increased renewable capacity and 
green energy generation in 2020:
—  our installed renewable capacity increased 
by 14 % to 11.3 gw in 2020.
—  green share of energy increased by 
4 percentage points to 90 % in 2020.
—  scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity 
decreased by 11 % to 58 g co2e/kwh.
—  scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 
decreased by 27 %.
covid-19
since the outbreak of covid-19, our corporate
crisis management organisation (ccmo) has 
met regularly, focusing on the health and safe-
ty of our employees and on ensuring business 
continuity. during 2020, we had 146 confirmed 
infected colleagues and fortunately no casu-
alties from covid-19. we continue to do our 
utmost to keep our colleagues safe across our 
locations and ensure business continuity.
renewable energy capacity
our installed renewable capacity increased by 
14 % to 11.3 gw in 2020. 
in december 2020, we commissioned the  
752 mw dutch offshore wind farm borssele 1 & 2. 
the wind farm deploys 94 siemens gamesa 
wind turbines, making it the largest ever built 
in the netherlands, and will supply renewable 
energy to 1 million dutch households.
1.1 cfo’s review
in 2020, we commisioned three new onshore 
wind farms in the us with a total capacity of
671 mw. sage draw (338 mw) was commis-
sioned in march, plum creek (230 mw) in june, 
and willow creek (103 mw) in september.
energy generation
offshore power generation increased by
27 % to 15.2 twh in 2020. the increase was 
primarily due to new power generation capac-
ity at borssele 1 & 2 and full-year effect from 
hornsea 1, commissioned in december 2019. 
onshore power generation increased by 
64 % to 5.7 twh in 2020, due to the three new 
onshore wind farms commissioned during 2020.
heat generation decreased by 20 % to 
6.7 twh, primarily due to the warm weather 
in q1 2020. 
thermal power generation decreased by
4 % to 4.4 twh in 2020 compared to 2019. 
the decrease was due to lower combined 
heat and power generation, offset by higher 
coal-based power generation at esbjerg 
and studstrup power stations because they 
delivered automatic frequency restoration 
reserves (affr), a type of ancillary services, to 
the danish grid. 
we are legally obliged to make our gen-
eration capacity available for affr and 
other ancillary services based on the lowest 
marginal cost which historically has typically 
been coal-based. we utilise our sustainable 
biomass-based power plants, electric boilers, 
and wind capacity in our ancillary services 
supply whenever possible, based on fuel prices, 
heat and power demand, and other factors.
green share of energy generation
our green share of generation increased by 
4 percentage points to 90 % compared with 
2019. the increase was driven by higher wind-
based generation and the full-year effect of 
the bioconversion of asnæs power station in 
late 2019, partly offset by higher coal-based 
thermal power generation associated with 
ancillary services.
greenhouse gas emissions
our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity
was reduced by 11 % to 58 g co2e/kwh in 2020 
compared with 2019 for the same reasons as for 
the increase in the green share of generation. 
our scope 3 emissions decreased by 27 % in 
2020 compared with 2019, mainly due to a 28 % 
decrease in natural gas sales. 
esg reporting frameworks
users of esg data in the financial community 
increasingly ask for standardised, high-quality 
esg reporting. we fully support that request 
and believe that alignment towards an 
international esg reporting standard using 
financial reporting principles is fundamental 
in achieving this. we are doing our best to be 
front runners in this area, having built our esg 
reporting on our financial reporting platform 
and reporting against several international 
esg frameworks, e.g. the greenhouse gas 
protocol and the tcfd recommendations.
we actively follow the many ongoing initia-
tives, including sustainable finance in the eu, 
the intention of the ‘big five’ (cdp, cdsb, gri, 
iirc, and sasb) to align their esg reporting, 
the world economic forum’s common esg 
metrics, and the ifrs foundation’s recent con-
sultation to identify the demand for a global 
standard for esg reporting. 
in this year’s report, we have added an over-
view of our current use of esg reporting frame-
works. we look forward to report our green 
revenue, ebitda, and capital investments as 
soon as the eu green taxonomy and reporting 
guidelines are finalised, expectedly in 2021.

1  in addition to the emission reduction targets, we have a target of being carbon-neutral in 2025. we will continue to investigate solutions for the remaining  
emissions which could also include investing in certified carbon-removal projects.
2  a 50 % reduction in total scope 3 emissions from the base year 2018. in addition, we want our scope 3 emissions to be carbon-neutral by 2040.  
we have adjusted the 2018 base year emissions following the divestment of the lng business in 2020 which constituted 20 % of the base year emissions in 2018.
3  our target is to have an employee satisfaction survey result in the top ten percentile every year compared to an external benchmark group.
4  our target is to use 100 % green power for our own consumption every year.

1.5 basis of reporting
about this report
in this report, you will find the complete set of 
Ørsted’s environment, social, and governance 
(esg) performance indicators. these are the 
data that we use in our reporting to various 
investor schemes and as the foundation for 
our answers to questions from investors and 
other stakeholders.
a selection of the data in this report is also 
presented in our:
–  annual report 2020, consolidated 
esg statements
–  sustainability report 2020.
this report contains Ørsted´s statement on 
the underrepresented gender in accordance 
with section 99 b of the danish financial 
statements act (Årsregnskabsloven). see note 
3.2 ‘gender diversity’.
esg data quality and consolidation
all our esg data are reported to the same 
consolidation system, and we apply the same 
processes and tools to our esg reporting as 
to our financial reporting. the data is consoli-
dated according to the same principles as the 
financial statements. thus, the consolidated 
esg performance data comprises the parent 
company Ørsted a/s and subsidiaries con-
trolled by Ørsted a/s. 
data from associates and joint ventures 
is not included in the consolidated esg 
perform ance data.
the scoping and consolidation of health, safety, 
and environment (hse) incidents deviate from 
the above-described principles. hse  incident 
data is collected using an operational scope. 
this means that irrespective of our ownership 
share, we include 100 % of injuries, environ-
mental incidents, hours worked, etc., from all 
operations where Ørsted is responsible for 
hse, including safety for our external suppliers. 
all data presented follows the principles 
above, unless otherwise specified in the 
accounting policy for the individual  indicator. 
accounting policies for all our esg data 
can be found next to each data table in the 
environmental (e), social (s), and governance 
(g) sections. the calculation factors used in 
this report are listed at the end of the report 
together with references.
esg data selection and frameworks
we aim to develop our esg data set in order 
to support our business and to disclose 
relevant and transparent information to 
our stakeholders. several international esg 
reporting frameworks are used as guidance in 
the data selection process (see notes 5.2-5.5 
for more details). 
business changes impacting esg data
in august 2020, we concluded the divestment 
of the danish power distribution, residential 
customer, and city light businesses.
in december 2020, we concluded the divest-
ment of the lng business. 
discontinued esg indicators
–  ghg intensity, chp plants only (replaced by 
a business unit breakdown of ghg intensity 
to include the heat boilers and generation 
from the renescience plant).
–  indicators related to the divested distribu-
tion business:
 
–  system average interruption index (saifi).
 
–  system average interruption duration 
index (saidi).
 
–  power distribution.
 
–  avoided emissions from allocated green 
bond proceeds (data can be found in the 
‘green bond impact report 2020’).
  
revised esg indicators
–  our suppplier assessment reporting has 
been expanded to include all types of 
supplier assessments performed.
–  waste reporting terminology has been up-
dated to align with the recent update of the 
global reporting initiative (gri) standard for 
waste reporting. we have also expanded the 
scope to include fly ash from power plants.
–  seawater and surface water consumption for 
cooling at our power plants has been added 
to the reporting of water consumption.
financial  
scope 
we use a financial scope for our data collection. 
thus, the consolidated esg performance data 
comprises data from the parent company Ørsted a/s 
and subsidiaries controlled by Ørsted a/s.  
financial 
consoli dation
we use the same consolidation method and 
consolidation application for our esg data as  
for our financial data. 
external  
review
all esg data in both Ørsted’s annual and 
sustainability reports has been reviewed by pwc. 
all data in this report covered by the esg review 
is marked with a ‘
’ in the tables. see the auditor’s 
limited assurance report on page 38 for information 
about the external review.

2.1 renewable capacity
accounting policies
installed renewable capacity
the installed renewable capacity is calculated as 
the cumulative renewable gross capacity installed 
by Ørsted before divestments.
for installed renewable thermal capacity, we use 
the heat capacity, as heat is the primary outcome 
of thermal energy generation, and as bioconversions 
of the combined heat and power plants are driven 
by heat contracts.
decided (fid) renewable capacity
decided (fid) capacity is the renewable capacity for 
which a final investment decision (fid) has been made.
awarded and contracted renewable capacity
the awarded renewable capacity is based on the 
capacities which have been awarded to Ørsted in 
auctions and tenders. the contracted capacity is the 
capacity for which Ørsted has signed a contract or 
power purchase agreement (ppa) concerning a new 
renewable energy plant. typically, offshore wind 
farms are awarded, whereas onshore wind farms are 
contracted. we include the full capacity if more than 
50 % of ppas/offtake are secured.
installed storage capacity
the battery storage capacity is included after com-
mercial operation date (cod) has been achieved. 
the capacity is presented as megawatts of alternating 
current (mwac).

1  fuel-specific thermal heat and power generation capacities cannot be added to total thermal capacity, as they are defined individually for each fuel type for our 
multi-fuel plants. all fuels cannot be used at the same time. 
2.2 generation capacity
our power generation capacity increased 
by 19 % to 8,884 mw in 2020. 
offshore wind power generation capacity 
increased by 752 mw in december 2020 
when the dutch wind farm borssele 1 & 2 
was commissioned. 
onshore wind power generation capacity 
increased by 671 mw due to the commis-
sioning of three new onshore wind farms 
in the us in 2020: sage draw (338 mw) in 
march, plum creek (230 mw) in in june, and 
 willow creek (103 mw) in september.
solar pv power generation capacity was 
 reduced by 10 mw due to the divestment 
of oak solar in june 2020.
accounting policies
power generation capacity
power generation capacity from offshore wind farms 
is calculated and included from the time when the 
individual wind turbine has passed a 240-hour test. 
generation capacities for onshore wind and solar pv 
are included after cod.
the gunfleet sands and walney 1 and 2 offshore
wind farms have been consolidated according to
ownership interest. other wind farms, solar farms, 
and chp plants are financially consolidated.
heat and power generation capacity, thermal
the thermal heat and power generation capacity is 
a measure of the maximum capability to generate 
heat and power. 
the capacity can change over time with plant mod-
ifications. for each chp plant, the capacity is given 
for generation with the primary fuel mix. overload is 
not included.
fuel-specific capacities measure the maximum 
 capacity using the specified fuel as primary fuel 
at the multi-fuel plants. therefore, the total sum 
amounts to more than 100 %.
chp plants which have been taken out  of primary 
operation and put on standby are not included.

2.3 energy generation
offshore power generation increased by 
27 % in 2020 relative to 2019. the increase 
was primarily due to the full-year effect 
from  hornsea 1 (commissioned in q4 2019), 
 generation from borssele 1 & 2 (commissoned 
in q4 2020), and higher wind speeds.
generation in onshore increased by 64 % 
in 2020 relative to 2019. the increase was 
primarily due to additional generation from 
lockett (commissioned in july 2019), sage draw 
(commissioned in march 2020), plum creek 
(commissioned june 2020), and willow creek 
(commissioned in september 2020).
heat generation was 20 % lower in 2020 
relative to 2019, primarily due to the warm 
weather in q1 2020. 
thermal power generation was 4 % lower 
in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower 
combined heat and power generation, partly 
offset by increased power generation from 
delivery of ancillary services by our coal-fired 
units at esbjerg and studstrup power stations.
accounting policies
power generation
power generation from wind farms is determined 
as generation sold. the gunfleet sands 1 & 2 and 
walney 1 & 2 offshore wind farms have been consoli-
dated according to ownership interest.
thermal power generation is determined as net gen-
eration sold, based on settlements from the official
danish production database. data for generation 
from foreign facilities are provided by the operators.
heat generation
heat (including steam) generation is measured as net 
output sold to heat customers.

2.4 green energy share
the green share of our heat and power 
generation was 90 % in 2020, up 4 percentage 
points relative to 2019. 
the share of generation from offshore and 
onshore wind increased by 10 percentage 
points as a result of new offshore generation 
capacity in the netherlands (borssele 1 & 2), 
new onshore generation capacity in the us 
(sage draw, plum creek, and willow creek), 
and higher offshore wind speeds.
the share of generation based on sustainable 
biomass decreased by 7 percentage points 
at Ørsted level. however, the green share of 
energy in markets & bioenergy, i.e. thermal 
heat and power generation, increased by 
3 percentage points to 71 %.
the green share of our generation increased 
from 86 % in 2019 to 90 % in 2020. the category 
‘ other green energy sources’ includes solar pv, 
biogas, and power sourced with green certificates.
accounting policies
green energy share
the green (renewable energy) share of our heat and 
power generation and the distribution of the gener-
ation volume on the individual energy sources and 
fuels are calculated on the basis of the energy sources 
used and the energy generated at the different 
energy plants.
for combined heat and power plants, the share of 
the specific fuel (e.g. biomass) is calculated relative 
to the total fuel consumption for a given plant or 
unit within a given time period. the specific fuel 
share is then multiplied by the total heat and power 
generation for the specific plant or unit in the specific 
period. the result is the fuel-based generation for 
the individual unit, for example the biomass-based 
generation of heat and power from the chp plant 
unit within a given time period.
the percentage share of the individual energy  sources 
is calculated by dividing the generation from the 
individual energy source by the total generation.
the following energy sources and fuels are con-
sidered renewable energy: wind, solar pv, biomass, 
biogas, and power sourced with green certificates. 
the following energy sources are considered fossil 
energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.

accounting policies
availability
availability is calculated as the ratio of actual pro- 
duction to the possible production, which is the sum 
of lost production and actual production in a given 
period. the production-based availability (pba) is 
impacted by grid and wind turbine outages which are 
technical production losses. pba is not impacted by 
market-requested shutdowns and wind farm curtail-
ments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site per-
formance, but due to external factors. total availability 
is determined by weighting the individual wind farm’s 
availability against the capacity of the wind farm.
load factor
the load factor is calculated as the ratio between 
actual generation over a period relative to potential 
generation, which is possible by continuously exploit- 
ing the maximum capacity over the same period. 
the load factor is commercially adjusted. commer-
cially adjusted means that, for danish and german 
offshore wind farms, the load factor is adjusted if the 
offshore wind farm has been financially compensated 
by the transmission system operators in situations 
where the offshore wind farm is available for 
generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the 
grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. wind 
farms in other countries are not compensated for 
non-access to the grid. 
new wind turbines are included in the calculation of 
availability and load factor once they have passed 
a 240-hour test for offshore wind turbines and 
commercial operation date (cod) for onshore wind 
turbines.
wind speed
wind speeds for the areas where Ørsted’s offshore 
and onshore wind farms are located are provided 
to Ørsted by an external supplier. wind speeds 
are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the 
individual wind farms and consolidated to an 
Ørsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 
‘normal wind speed’ is a 20-year historical wind 
speed average.
degree days
degree days are a measure of how cold it has been 
and thus indicate the amount of energy needed 
to heat a building. the number of degree days 
helps to compare the heat demand for a given 
year with a normal year. the number of degree 
days expresses the difference between an average 
indoor temperature of 17 °c and the outside mean 
temperature for a given period. the need for heat 
increases with the number of degree days.
energy efficiency, thermal generation
energy efficiency is calculated as total thermal 
heat and power generation divided by total energy 
content of fuels (lower caloric values) used in the 
generation of thermal heat and power.
offshore wind
the availability in 2020 was 1 percentage
point higher than in 2019. in 2020, wind speeds 
were 0.5 m/s higher than in 2019 and also 
higher than for a normal wind year due to high 
wind speeds in q1 2020. 
the higher wind speeds and availability 
 resulted in a 3 percentage point increase of 
the load factor in 2020 compared with 2019.
normal wind speed for the portfolio in-
creased by 0.1 m/s due to the new wind farms 
 hornsea 1 (commissioned in december 2019) 
and  borssele 1 & 2 (commissioned in december 
2020) which are located in areas with higher 
than average wind speeds.
onshore wind
in 2020, wind speeds were 0.3 m/s higher 
than in 2019. availability was 2 percentage 
points lower than 2019, primarily due to 
outages at lockett. in combination with the 
higher wind speeds, this led to a load factor 
in 2020 at the same level as in 2019.
other
in 2020, the number of degree days was 
1 % higher than in 2019, indicating that the 
 weather in 2020 was slightly colder than in 
2019. however, q1 was relatively warm.
energy efficiency decreased by 6 % because 
of the increased ancillary services-driven 
power generation at esbjerg and studstrup 
power stations and a reduced combined heat 
and power generation.

2.6 energy sales
gas sales decreased by 28 % to 90.3 twh in 
2020 compared to 2019. this was primarily 
driven by the temporary, but long-term shut-
down of the tyra oil and gas field in the north 
sea in september 2019 continuing throughout 
2020 and a decrease in lng sourcing, partly 
attributable to the sale of the lng business 
on 1 december 2020.
power sales were up by 6 % at 29.2 twh in 
2020 compared to 2019. the overall increase 
in power sales was due to a 30 % increase 
in power wholesale to 18.8 twh in 2020, 
primarily driven by an increase in sale of our 
partners’ share of generation from our wind 
farms, in particular hornsea 1 and borssele 1. 
the increase in wholesale was partly offset
by a 16 % decrease in green power to end
customers to 7.5 twh in 2020 and a 31 %
decrease in regular power to end customers
to 2.9 twh. 
the decrease in green power to end customers 
was primarily driven by a reduction in the 
number of large b2b customers in denmark and 
partially by the divestment of the residential 
customer business at the end of august. 
lower consumption in 2020 by b2b customers 
in denmark and the uk due to covid-19 has 
also partially contributed to the respective 
decreases in green and regular power sales to 
end customers.

2.7 greenhouse gas emissions, scopes 1 and 2
accounting policies
direct ghg emissions (scope 1)
the reporting of the direct scope 1 emissions is based 
on the greenhouse gas protocol and covers all direct 
emissions of greenhouse gases from Ørsted: carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexaflou-
ride. the direct carbon emissions from the thermal 
heat and power plants are determined on the basis 
of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the eu 
emissions trading system (ets). carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gas emissions outside the eu ets 
scheme are, for the most part, calculated as energy 
consumptions multiplied by emission factors.
indirect ghg emissions (scope 2)
the reporting of the indirect scope 2 emissions is 
based on the greenhouse gas protocol and includes 
the indirect ghg emissions from the generation of 
power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed 
by Ørsted. the scope 2 emissions are primarily cal-
culated as the power volumes purchased multiplied 
by country-specific emission factors. location-based 
is calculated based on average emission factors for 
each country, whereas market-based takes the green 
power purchased into account and assumes that 
the non-green power is delivered as residual power 
where the green part has been taken out.
greenhouse gas emission intensity 
greenhouse gas emission intensities are calculated 
as total scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emis-
sions divided by total heat and power generation, 
revenue, and ebitda, respectively.
2 emissions originated from power purchased 
for the generation of heat in boilers at the chp 
plants, power consumption during standstill and 
shutdown periods at the chp plants and wind 
farms, and heat and power for office buildings.
all power purchased and consumed by Ørsted
was certified green power, and therefore, our 
market-based scope 2 greenhouse gas emis-
sions from the power consumption amounted 
to zero. heat consumption accounted for 
2000 tonnes of scope 2 market-based green-
house gas emissions. 
Ørsted’s greenhouse gas emission intensity for 
energy generation  decreased by 11 % to 
58 g co2e/kwh, primarily due to increased 
wind-based generation and reduced thermal 
generation.
greenhouse gas emissions, scopes 1 and 2,  
g co2e/kwh
scope 1 greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions 
increased marginally from 2019 to 2020. the 
main driver was the increase in the use of coal 
at esbjerg and studstrup power stations due 
to the delivery of ancillary services, offset by a 
decrease in the use of natural gas. 
in 2020, fossil fuel-based heat and power 
generation was accountable for 98 % of the 
total scope 1 emissions. the remaining 2 % of 
scope 1 emissions originate from other fuel 
consumption, including gas combustion, cars, 
and vessels.
the main source of location-based scope 2 emis-
sions was power purchased to cover grid losses 
from distribution. in 2020, grid losses accounted 
for 35 % of the total locationbased scope 2 
emissions. the rest of the location-based scope

scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions decreased 
by 27 % from 2019 to 2020. the main driver 
for this was the 28 % reduction in gas sales 
which accounted for 87 % of the total scope 3 
emissions in 2020.
scope 3 emissions from fuel- and energy- related 
activities decreased by 24 %, primarily driven by 
the a reduction in the sale of regular power to 
business end customers.
scope 3 emissions from capital goods 
amounted to 0.7 million tonnes in 2020 and 
related to the carbon footprint of the new 
wind farms commissioned in 2020 (the offshore 
wind farm borssele 1 & 2 and the three new 
onshore wind farms in the us).
2.8 greenhouse gas emissions, scope 3
our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions were reduced 
by 27 % in 2020. we are on track to meeting our 
target of a 50 % reduction in the period 2018 to 2032.

accounting policies
greenhouse gas emissions, scope 3
the scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported 
based on the greenhouse gas protocol which divides 
the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories (c1-c15). 
ghg emissions from:
–  c1 is categorised spend data mulitiplied by relevant 
spend-category-specific emission factors
–  c2 includes upstream ghg emissions from installed 
wind farms. carbon emissions are included from 
cradle to operations and maintenance for single 
wind turbines. wind farms are included from the 
month where the wind farm has achieved commer-
cial operation date (cod)
–  c3 is calculated based on actual fuel consumption 
and power sales multiplied by relevant emission 
factors. we include all power sales to end customers 
and use separate emission factors for green and 
regular power sales
–  c4 only includes fuel for helicopter transport. 
 emissions from other transport types are  included 
in the emission factors we use for purchased goods 
and services
–  c5 is calculated based on actual waste data 
multiplied by relevant emission factors
–  c6 is calculated based on mileage allowances for 
employee travel in own cars and ghg emissions 
from plane travel provided by our travel agent
–  c7 is calculated based on estimates for distance 
travelled and travel type (e.g. car and train)
–  c9 is calculated based on volumes of residual 
products, estimated distances transported, and 
relevant ghg emission factors for transport
–  c11 is calculated based on actual sales of gas to 
both end users and wholesale as reported in our 
esg consolidation system. the total gas trade is 
divided into natural gas, lng, and biogas which 
have specific up- and downstream emission factors. 
the subcategories c10 and c12-c15 are not relevant 
for Ørsted, as we have no greenhouse gas emissions 
within these categories.
update of the 2018 
base year emissions
we have updated our 2018 base year 
scope 3 emissions in accordance with our 
policy for baseline adjustments for scope 3. 
we divested the lng business in 2020.  
the gas sales related to the lng business 
accounted for 20 % of the total 2018 base year 
scope 3 emissions. therefore, we have reduced 
the scope 3 base year emissions and target 
emissions in 2032 by 20 %.

2.9 avoided carbon emissions
avoided carbon emissions are the result 
of installed wind farms and conversions of 
chp plants to using sustainable biomass as 
fuel. if these projects had not been under-
taken, other sources would have provided 
the power generated. 
the avoided carbon emissions increased by 
16 % due to the increase in wind-based power 
generation. the avoided emissions from 
 biomass-converted generation increased by 
7 % in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the 
2020 full-year effect of the bioconversion of 
asnæs power station in late 2019.
by 2020, we have avoided an accumulated 
total of 59 million tonnes carbon emissions 
since 2006. this is the result of our wind-based 
and biomass-converted energy generation 
and corresponds to 47 % of the accumulated 
carbon emissions from thermal energy gener-
ation at Ørsted since 2006. 
accounting policies
avoided carbon emissions
the avoided carbon emissions due to generation 
from offshore and onshore wind farms are calculated 
on the basis of the assumption that the generation 
from wind farms replaces an equal  quantity of power 
generated using fossil fuels. 
the carbon emission factor from fossil fuels is based 
on an average fossil-fuel mix in the specific country. 
data is extracted from the  international energy 
agency, iea. power generation at a wind farm does 
not have direct carbon emissions, and no secondary 
effects are included, from neither chp plants nor 
offshore wind farms. the avoided carbon emissions 
are calculated as the offshore wind farm’s generation 
multiplied by the emission factor.
it is assumed that the use of 1 gj of biomass fuel 
avoids the use of 1 gj of fossil fuels. the upstream 
carbon emissions (from production, manufacture, and 
transport of biomass) are included in the calculation.
the accounting policies for avoided carbon emissions 
follow the principles of the ghg project protocol 
and the united nations framework convention on 
climate change (unfccc) methodology. 
carbon emissions 
carbon emissions include scope 1 greenhouse gas 
emissions from thermal heat and power generation. 
for more details, see ‘2.7 greenhouse gas emissions, 
scopes 1 and 2’.

2.10 energy consumption
accounting policies
scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, energy 
consumption
includes all energy consumption, including energy 
consumption that leads to scope 1 greenhouse gas 
emissions. energy consumption includes all fuels 
used at chp plants (lower caloric values) and other 
energy usage (oil, natural gas, and diesel). 
certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced
certified biomass are defined as wooden biomass, i.e. 
wood pellets and wood chips. biomass is  measured 
as sourced wooden biomass delivered to individual  
combined heat and power plants within the reporting 
period. certified sustainable wooden biomass 
sourced must be certified within at least one of the 
claim cate gories accepted by the danish industry 
agreement on certified biomass. accepted claim 
categories are: fsc 100 %, fsc mix, pefc 100 % 
and sbp compliant. certified biomass is calculated 
as the amount of sourced wooden biomass 
compared to the total amount of sourced wooden 
biomass delivered to individual chp plants within 
the reporting period.
scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, energy 
consumption
heat and power purchased and consumed by Ørsted 
is reported for chp plants, other facilities, and ad-
ministrative buildings. heat and power  consumption 
excludes consumption of own generated heat and 
power at the chp plants. for consumption related 
to administration and other processes, we calculate 
direct consumption on the basis of invoices. 
green share of total energy consumption
is calculated as renewable energy sourced (biomass 
and certified green power) for own consumption di-
vided by total energy sourced for own consumption.
internal energy savings
in 2018, Ørsted a/s signed a five-year climate part-
nership agreement with a target of 15 gwh energy 
savings. the scope of the energy savings covers both 
heat and power consumption. projects are included 
when they are fully implemented and operational.
electric vehicles in the company vehicle fleet
Ørsted has joined the global ev100 initiative. 
the statement is prepared on the basis of the ev100 
guidelines. the data excludes vehicles from our 
power distribution, residential customer, and city 
light businesses which were divested in 2020.

the total fuel consumption used in thermal 
heat and power generation was 8 % lower 
in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by a 14 % 
decrease in total thermal energy generation. 
thermal power generation decreased by 
4 % and thermal heat generation by 20 % 
(see note 2.3).
the consumption of sustainable biomass 
was 11 % lower in 2020 than in 2019. the total 
consumption of fossil fuels decreased by 4 %, 
driven by a 37 % reduction in the consumption 
of natural gas, offset by a 13 % increase in 
the consumption of coal. coal consumption 
increased due to the increased power genera-
tion at esbjerg and studstrup power stations, 
associated with ancillary services. 
we sourced 100 % of our wooden biomass as
certified sustainable wooden biomass in 2020.
the power purchased and consumed by 
Ørsted decreased by 18 % in 2020 and was
100 % sourced as certified green power.

2.11 water
the large increase in water withdrawal is 
because we have added reporting of surface 
and seawater to the statement. 
seawater is used for cooling water in the 
power plants. it is circulated in a closed system 
and returned to the sea with no other impact 
than a slight increase in temperature. we also 
use seawater as process water at one power 
plant to reduce our consumption of ground-
water from the municipality.
accounting policies
water withdrawal
water withdrawal includes all water resources that 
Ørsted either withdraw directly from groundwater or 
consume from waterworks. this includes: 
–  water withdrawal for process use (boilers, flue gas 
cleaning, fly ash management, etc.)
–  water withdrawal converted to steam or hot water 
and resold to business partners
–  water withdrawal for use in offices and other 
buildings.
the total volume of water withdrawal is measured 
based on meter readings or invoices from suppliers. 
using a corporate standard value, an estimated 
consumption is calculated in cases where exact data 
is not available.
surface water and seawater has been included from 
2020. surface water and seawater is used for cooling 
at the power plants.
water stress
water stress is measured at site level. the method-
ology used to assess water stress is wri’s aqueduct 
water risk atlas. the calculated output of this 
accounting practice is Ørsted’s total withdrawal of 
water from water-stressed areas. only groundwater 
and third-party water is included.
wastewater discharge
wastewater includes all planned and unplanned 
discharges of water from Ørsted, except cooling 
water from chp plants. 
for facilities, wastewater discharges are recorded 
based on meter readings. where wastewater is 
removed by road tanker, discharges are based on 
invoices. for offices and warehouses, wastewater 
discharges are presumed to be equivalent to water 
consumption.

the changes to water withdrawal from

2.12 waste
the total volume of waste decreased by 49 % 
from 2019 to 2020. the primary driver was 
a reduction in the amount of oil-containing 
wastewater from the oil terminal in fredericia, 
as we have installed a full-scale cleaning 
facility, which reduced the amount of 
hazardous waste by 84%. 
the oil-containing wastewater had to be 
treated as waste similar to the previous years 
because of a high content of pollutants.
the significant increase in non-hazardous 
waste is waste from biomass ashes from power 
production which is not sold as products and 
therefore is classified as waste as well as waste 
from the new renescience plant, commissioned 
in 2020.

accounting policies
waste by type and disposal method
the global reporting initiative (gri) standard 306, 
disclosures 306-3, 306-4, and 306-5, have been used 
as guidance in developing the reported indicators.
waste is generally reported on the basis of invoices 
received from waste recipients, supplemented with 
plant-specific measuring methods for  commercial 
facilities, including construction activities.
oil-contaminated wastewater from the oil pipeline 
from the north sea is treated as waste and therefore 
reported as waste and not wastewater.
waste generated from the renescience plant com-
misioned in 2020 is included.
we have added ashes from the power plants to the 
waste reporting from 2020 and adjusted the historic 
data accordingly. residual products, e.g. gypsym 
from the chp plants, which are not handled as 
waste, but sold as products, are not included. 
soil from excavation projects is not included.

2.13 environmental incidents, nox, and so2
in 2020, Ørsted registered two major incidents. 
one incident was a 200-litre oil spill from 
a leakage at the oil terminal in fredericia. 
all the contaminated soil has been removed 
and cleaned. 
the other incident was a sf6 gas leakage from 
a defect sealing at asnæs power station.
the reduction in absolute nox and so2 air 
emissions was due to a lower thermal heat 
and power generation in 2020.
accounting policies
environmental incidents
an environmental incident is an unintended incident 
which has a negative impact on the environment. 
we report environmental incidents using operational 
scopes, such as safety incidents. 
we register all environmental incidents at facilities 
where we are responsible for operations in terms of 
environmental management 
the materiality of an incident is determined on the 
basis of an assessment of the extent, the dispersion, 
and the impact on the environment. on this basis, 
all environmental incidents are categorised on a 
scale from 1 (slight impact) to 5 (massive impact). 
actual incidents in categories 4 (major impact) and 
5 (massive impact) are reported.
other air emissions: nitrogen oxides (nox)  
and sulfur dioxide (so2) 
nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions are 
only  reported for combined heat and power plants. 
nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions from 
other combustions are not included. nitrogen oxides 
and sulphur dioxide are  primarily measured by 
continuous measurement, but may also be based on 
plant- specific emission  factors.

2.14 biodiversity – protected areas 
accounting policies
biodiversity data only covers offshore wind farms. 
offshore wind farm lease or agreement areas cover 
large footprints. the wind farm is comprised of a 
range of infrastructure, including offshore wind 
turbines and cables. the physical footprint of this 
infrastructure, however, makes up a relatively small 
proportion of a total wind farm area. nonetheless, 
the reporting here considers total wind farm areas for 
completeness and to recognise relevant interactions 
with protected habitats and species.
in some markets, we install transmission assets for 
the offshore wind farm which includes onshore and 
offshore export cables and substations. however, 
these are usually required to be divested near to or 
when the wind farm is commissioned, as required by 
national legislation. therefore, the data for export 
 cables represents transmission assets not yet divest-
ed on some wind farms and does not include onshore 
parts of offshore wind farms.
protected areas
protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value 
follow the global reporting initiative (gri) standards, 
disclosure 304-1. this includes the list of protected 
areas described, such as iucn protected area 
 management categories, the ramsar convention, 
and national legislation.
the indicators are the cumulative square kilometres 
or length of cables in kilometres covered by our 
 operational sites. the areas reported represent 
Ørsted’s ownership share by year end. data is initially 
recognised from the commercial operation date (cod). 
our wind farms in european waters and in 
apac do not currently overlap with any 
 protected areas for nature conservation. 
compared with 2019, the wind farm 
 borssele 1 & 2 in the netherlands is the only 
addition to our portfolio of offshore wind 
farms in operation. borssele 1 & 2 is neither 
inside nor partly located inside a protected 
area since the closest natura 2000 area is 
16 km away from the border of the wind farm. 
however, the export cable runs through this 
natura 2000 area, but is not Ørsted-owned 
and has thus not been included.

biodiversity data only covers offshore wind farms 
and only the protected areas described in note 
2.14 ‘biodiversity – protected areas’.
offshore wind farm lease or agreement areas cover 
large footprints. the wind farm is comprised of a 
range of infrastructure, including offshore wind 
turbines and cables. the physical footprint of this 
infrastructure, however, makes up a relatively small 
proportion of a total wind farm area. nonetheless, 
the reporting here considers total wind farm areas for 
completeness and to recognise relevant interactions 
with protected habitats and species.
endangered red-list species
this indicator follows the global reporting initiative 
(gri) standard, disclosure 304-4, and lists the number 
of threatened species in areas where Ørsted has 
offshore operations.
for wind operations located in a protected area, 
the total number of species for which the area is 
designated is reported. 
we report by level of extinction risk according to 
the international union for conservation of nature’s 
(iucn) ‘red list of threatened species’ – an inventory 
of the global conservation status of plant and animal 
species. data is recognised from the commercial 
operation date of the wind farm.
our wind farms in european waters and in 
apac do not currently overlap with any pro-
tected or known areas of critical importance 
for vulnerable species. 
as outlined in our ‘offshore wind biodiversity 
policy’, we carry out detailed environmental 
consenting processes and ongoing environ-
mental monitoring in compliance with local 
regulations on protection of nature conser-
vation to ensure such species are considered 
carefully.
the united kingdom
since hornsea 1 went into operation, the overall 
number of potentially impacted vulnerable 
and near-threatened bird species has increased. 
the kittiwake, a designated feature of the 
flamborough and filey coast spa, is one such 
additional vulnerable species with the offshore 
wind farm hornsea 1 being located within their 
mean-maximum foraging range from the spa. 
at hornsea 1, we completed a comprehensive 
habitat regulations assessment that fully 
assessed the potential impact on kittiwakes, 
and it was concluded by the secretary of state 
in consenting the project that there was no 
adverse effect on the species. 
although the atlantic puffin is another desig-
nated species of this area, it is an assemblage 
feature, and it was concluded by the secretary 
of state that hornsea 1 would have no adverse 
effect on this vulnerable seabird species.
the us 
in the us, our block island wind farm is located 
within an area through which the critically 
endangered north atlantic right whale and 
the vulnerable fin whale are known to migrate 
and aggregate. we sail and operate in compli-
ance with the us marine mammal protection 
act for the protection of marine mammals 
and their habitats.
additionally, we work closely with relevant 
local interest organisations, authorities, and 
other stakeholders as well as the academic 
community, for instance the ecosystem and 
passive acoustic monitoring (eco-pam) project 
to better understand the presence, distribution, 
and seasonality of north atlantic right whales. 
we also contribute to the characterisation 
of their habitat in offshore wind areas and 
ensure we use best available evidence and 
knowledge to employ appropriate monitoring 
and mitigation techniques in our operations.

3.1 human capital
the number of employees was 5 % lower at
the end of 2020 compared to 2019. this was 
primarily due to the divestment of the danish 
power distribution (radius), residential custom-
er, and city light businesses to seas-nve on 
31 august 2020. approximately 750 employees 
were transferred to seas-nve as part of 
the transaction. ftes outside of continental 
europe increased by 19 % (287 ftes). 
at the end of 2020, the total turnover rate 
decreased by 3.2 percentage points to 8.4 %, 
and the voluntary turnover rate decreased 
by 2.2 percentage points to 5.0 % compared 
to 2019. the lower turnover rates were likely 
due to a decrease in the number of employees 
resigning their positions during the covid-19 
pandemic in 2020. the scores for employee 
satisfaction increased to 78 and was within 
the top 10 % target compared with our 
external benchmark group. we missed our 
2020 target for learning and development 
despite significant 2019 and 2020 investments 
in learning resources and programmes, and in 
enabling managers to develop their talents. 
we have, however, seen an improvement 
in employee perception of opportunities to 
develop: from 77 % in 2019 to 78 % in 2020.

accounting policies
number of employees, sickness absence, and 
turnover
employee data is recognised based on records
from the group’s ordinary registration systems. the
number of employees is determined as the number
of employees at the end of each month converted
to full-time equivalents (ftes). employees who have 
been made redundant are recognised until the expiry 
of their notice period, regardless of whether they 
have been released from all or some of their duties 
during their notice period. sickness absence is calcu-
lated as the ratio between the number of sick days 
and the planned number of annual working days.
the employee turnover rate is calculated as the 
number of permanent employees who have left 
the company relative to the average number of 
 permanent employees in the financial year.
employee satisfaction survey results
Ørsted conducts a comprehensive employee satis-
faction survey once a year. with a few exceptions, all 
Ørsted employees are invited to participate in the
survey. the following employees are not invited to
participate: employees who joined the company
shortly before the employee satisfaction survey,
employees who resigned shortly after the employee
satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisers, and 
external temporary workers who do not have an
employment contract with Ørsted.
the satisfaction survey focuses primarily on 
the embedding of learning and development in 
the organisational culture, and we appreciate 
that cultural change takes time. in 2021, we will 
continue our determined efforts to develop our 
learning culture and resources, to build manager 
capability, and to ensure all employees under-
stand how they can be accountable for their own 
development and the opportunities available.

we seek to ensure everyone at Ørsted globally, 
regardless of their demography or location, has 
equal opportunity to help deliver our vision. we 
have defined our 2023 goals around gender 
balance in senior leadership. since 2018, we 
have progressed from 90/10 (male/female ratio) 
to 80/20 at senior leadership levels (leadership 
conference) due to a focus on gender diversity 
in promotions and recruitment at senior levels. 
to support our gender diversity goals, we have 
a 66/34 gender balance among participants 
in our 2020 high-potential development 
programmes. by 2023, we aim for this balance 
to be 60/40. we have trained managers to 
reduce unconscious bias during people review 
meetings and job interviews, and our senior 
leaders are building more diversity in our 
talent pipelines. we have also introduced an 
inclusion index into our 2020 annual employee 
satisfaction survey to help all managers 
understand the sense of inclusion in their team. 
we conducted an inclusion survey which had 
a 60 % response rate and have set a goal of 
encouraging a multi-cultural mix at leadership 
levels globally.
to bring in more diverse talent, we encourage 
all candidates to apply, regardless of gender, 
race, age and cultural background; we have 
introduced a new format for our job ads, 
with the specific aim of making them more 
appealing to diverse candidates. recruitment 
processes include an expectation of diverse 
shortlists, reduction of bias in interviews, and 
a diverse interview panel.
high-potential diverse talent are identified in 
the annual people review process and have 
a structured dialogue about development 
wishes and possibilities in the following people 
development dialogue. 
Ørsted has joined ‘the un convention on the 
elimination of all forms of discrimination 
against women’.

accounting policies
our gender pay reporting is inspired by the 
mandatory gender pay reporting requirements in 
the uk. 
countries with more than 250 ftes per country are 
included in the statement. 
the annual general salary adjustment is finished by 
31 may. countries with more than 250 fte’s on that 
day are included in the year’s reporting.
definitions:
gender pay gap: the percentage men earn more in 
salary than women. 
gender bonus pay gap: the percentage men earn 
more in bonus payments than women.
gender bonus distribution: the percentage of men 
and women in the workforce who receive bonusses.
pay quartiles: the percentage of men and women on 
the employer’s payroll for each quartile.
the differences in pay between men and 
women are caused by differences in gender 
mix across levels in the organisation. 
there is a trend towards women comprising 
a smaller part of the population in higher 
 salary pay quartiles, which relates to the 
 lower percentage of women in higher man-
agement positions.

the decreasing share of women towards higher 
management levels explains the salary and bonus 
pay gap between women and men.
we are committed to equal pay and have 
a constant focus on ensuring equal pay for 
equal positions and competences in relation 
to all aspects of the salary-relevant processes 
from hiring to promotion.
the presented 2020 gender pay data are 
based on data from denmark (76 %), the uk 
(17 %), and the us (7 %) as there were more 
than 250 employees in each of these countries 
by 31 may 2020 when the annual salary review 
was finished. the us was not included in the 
2019 results as there was less than 250 ftes.

3.4 safety
the overall safety performance developed
positively in 2020 compared with 2019.
total recordable injuries in 2020 decreased by 
27 % (29 recordable injuries less), and the lost-
time injuries decreased by 20 % (nine lost-time 
injuries less) compared with 2019.
the total number of hours worked in 2020
was 1 % lower than in 2019. 
the total recordable injury rate (trir) was 
27 % lower than in 2019, and the lost-time 
injury frequency (ltif) was 19 % lower than 
in 2019.
we continue to have a strong focus on safety. 
our target is a trir of 2.9 or below in 2025.
accounting policies
safety
occupational injuries are calculated according to
operational scope. data from companies wholly
or partly owned by Ørsted, and where Ørsted is
responsible for safety, is included. occupational
injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both
our own employees and contractors. data from all 
Ørsted locations are recognised.
the lost-time injury frequency (ltif) is calculated as
the number of lost-time injuries per one million hours
worked. the number of hours worked is based on
1,667 working hours annually per full-time employee
and monthly records of the number of employees
converted into full-time employees. for contractors, 
the actual number of hours worked is recognised on 
the basis of data provided by the contractor, access 
control systems at locations, or estimates.
ltif includes lost-time injuries defined as injuries that
result in incapacity to work for one or more calendar
days in addition to the day of the incident.
in addition to lost-time injuries, total recordable injury 
rate (trir) also includes injuries where the injured 
person is able to perform restricted work the day 
after the accident as well as accidents where the 
injured person has received medical treatment.
fatalities are the number of people who lost their 
lives as a result of a work-related incident. 
permanent disability cases are injuries resulting in 
irreversible damage with permanent impairment 
which is not expected to improve.

3.5 job creation and people powered
through our green energy investments, 
we have stimulated local growth and job 
creation. 
in a lifecycle perspective, our own and our 
partners’ investments in deploying green off-
shore energy have created 197 thousand job 
years from the installed and decided projects. 
in the period 2019-2025, we plan to invest 
dkk 200 billion in renewables, adding signifi-
cantly to further local economic growth and 
job creation, not least in our new markets.
the main part of the jobs created in the 
value chain of offshore wind farms are jobs 
related to manufacturing, construction, 
and installation.
the 11 % increase in job years from 2019 
to 2020 based on installed capacity was 
mainly related to the offshore wind farm 
borssele 1 & 2, commissioned in 2020. 
people powered based on installed  
capacity increased by 27 % to 19.3 million 
people in 2020 compared to 2019, due to 
borssele 1 & 2 and the three new onshore 
wind farms commissioned in 2020.

accounting policies
job creation
the number of job years is calculated on the basis 
of a factor for job years per megawatt installed 
provided by the international renewable energy 
agency, irena. the job year creation factor is based 
on a 500 mw offshore wind farm. the factor is not 
adjusted for other details, such as when the wind 
farm was constructed, wind turbine size, and wind 
farm size-specific parameters beyond a simple 
scaling of capacity size or geographical position 
(i.e. water depths and distance to shore). 
the number of job years created relates to the value 
chain from procurement and manufacturing, over 
installation, operations and maintenance, to decom-
missioning. this means that job years related to, for 
example, mining and manufacturing of steel and con-
crete as well as local jobs, such as hotels and  dining 
for people working on local sites, are not included. 
a lifetime of 25 years for all wind farms is used.
the number of job years relates to the installed 
capacity and not Ørsted’s ownership share of the 
wind farm. the number of job years varies during 
the lifespan, and most of the jobs are created in the 
beginning during construction and installation.
people powered
the figure for people powered based on installed 
capacity is calculated using the installed capacity, 
the actual load factor, and the country-specific 
power consumption per person (state-specific 
consumption factors are used in the us).
people powered based on fid and awarded capacity 
is calculated on the basis of capacity and an 
average load factor based from business cases for 
offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar pv power. 
consumption is country-specific consumption per 
person (state- specific consumption factors are used 
in the us).

4.2 board of directors
the board of directors chaired by thomas 
thune andersen is responsible for the overall 
management of the company and appoints 
the executive board. 
the board of directors lays down the company’s 
strategy and makes decisions concerning major 
investments and divestments, the capital base, 
key policies, control and audit matters, risk 
management, and significant operational issues. 
the board monitors and oversees progress 
related to Ørsted’s climate change strategy, 
including our ambitious net-zero carbon reduc-
tion targets for scope 1-3 emissions.
the nomination & remuneration committee 
assists the board of directors in matters 
regarding the composition, remuneration, and 
performance of the board of directors and the 
executive committee.
the audit & risk committee assists the  
board of directors in overseeing the financial 
and esg reporting process (including key 
accounting estimates and judgements), the 
liquidity and capital structure development, 
financial and business-related risks, compli-
ance with statutory and other requirements 
from public authorities, internal controls, 
it security in operational and administrative 
areas, and cybersecurity.
moreover, the committee approves the 
 framework governing the work of the company’s 
external and internal auditors (including limits 
for non-audit services), evaluates the external 
auditors’ independence and qualifications, and 
monitors the company’s whistle-blower scheme.
accounting policies

4.3 executive committee
the executive board consisting of our ceo 
and cfo undertakes the day-to-day man-
agement of Ørsted through the executive 
committee which consists of an additional 
five members. 
the board of directors has laid down guide-
lines for the work of the executive board, 
including the division of work between the 
board of directors and the executive board 
and the executive board’s powers to enter into 
agreements on behalf of the company.
the board of directors regularly discusses the 
ceo’s performance, for example by following 
up on developments seen in relation to our 
strategy and objectives. the chairman of the 
board of directors and the ceo also regularly 
discuss the cooperation between the board of 
directors and the executive board. 
in addition to the safety target that makes up 
10 % of the cash-based bonus target for the 
executive board, climate-related performance 
indicators are part of the executive board’s 
individual business targets and leadership 
targets which in total make up 60 % of the 
cash-based bonus target. the indicators focus 
on the green energy share of our generation 
and our greenhouse gas emission reductions. 
furthermore, climate-related indicators are 
rewarded indirectly through our green energy 
build-out targets. 
 
you can find information about the mem-
bers of the executive board, including their 
previous employment and other executive 
functions, in our annual report on page 69 
and in our remuneration report.

based on henrik poulsen’s salary, excluding resignation reversal. 
2  in addition to the safety target for all the executive committee members, our ceo and cfo also have targets for delivering on our path towards our 2025 targets for 
the green share of energy and greenhouse gas reductions as part of their personal targets. you can find more details in our 2020 remuneration report.
accounting policies
remuneration
the ceo pay ratio is calculated as the ratio between 
the ceo’s total expensed remuneration (fixed salary, 
including personal benefits, such as a company car, 
free telephone, etc., a variable salary, and share-
based payment) and the average fte salary.
the remuneration of the executive committee is the 
total remuneration of the executive board and the 
other members of  executive committee.

 this indicator has been audited as part of the financial statements in the 2020 annual report.
1  for a full picture of current and paid taxes per country, we refer to the annual report, section 5 ‘tax’.
4.4 good business conduct, green bonds, and tax
in 2020, four substantiated cases of inappro-
priate or unlawful behaviour were reported 
through our whistle-blower scheme. three 
 cases concerned violation of good business 
conduct policies, and one case concerned 
violation of administrative procedures.  
the four cases had consequences for the 
 individuals involved. none of the reported 
cases were critical to our business or impacted 
our financial results. 
the share of employees who have completed 
a course in good business conduct decreased 
to 70 %. the reason was that in december 
2020, it was decided that everyone needs to 
take the course every second year, so we are 
in the middle of implementing the two-year 
update in the entire organisation. we expect 
to be at 96-97 % again next year.
in 2020, green bond proceeds were allocated
to four offshore wind projects: hornsea 1 and
hornsea 2 in the uk, borssele 1 & 2 in the 
 netherlands, and changhua 1 & 2a in taiwan.
the reduction in taxes paid in denmark relative 
to 2019 is primarily due to the large payment 
made in 2019 regarding the construction agree-
ment on hornsea 1. 
we have made significant investments in 
offshore wind farms in the uk, germany, the 
netherlands, the us, and taiwan, resulting in 
the accumulation of large tax assets in recent 
years. accordingly, we have not paid signifi-
cant taxes in these countries historically. this is 
changing as the offshore wind farms are being 
commissioned and generating positive taxable 
income, resulting currently in paid taxes in the 
uk and taiwan. we expect to start paying 
corporate tax in the netherlands in 2021 and 
in germany in 2022. we are also continuously 
investing in the us; however, we do expect 
to pay tax in the us in 2022-2024, due to the 
commercial structural set-up in the us.
accounting policies
whistle-blower cases
Ørsted’s whistle-blower hotline is available for
internal and external reporting of suspected cases
of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. whistle-blower
cases are received and handled by the internal audit
function which also receives similar reports through
the management system and from compliance 
officers. all reports are managed in accordance with 
the guidelines for the handling of whistle-blower 
reports approved by the audit & risk committee 
which is ultimately responsible for the whistle-blower 
scheme. only cases which are closed during the 
financial year, and which have been reported to the 
audit & risk committee as fully or partially substan-
tiated are reported.
course in good business conduct
the number of employees who have completed a 
course in good business conduct is calculated as the 
proportion of employees at 31 december who have 
completed an e-learning course in good business 
conduct relative to the number of employees invited 
to take the course.
green bonds and avoided emissions
the net proceeds from green financing instruments
can be allocated to the financing, or re-financing
(up to 2 years after cod), of a pool of eligible
projects, including the acquisition, development, and
construction of eligible projects. avoided emissions
from allocated green bond proceeds are calculated
using the same assumptions and calculations as for
avoided emsissions from our total energy generation 
(see note 2.9) except that the green bond calcula-
tions are made using the full capacity of the wind 
farm before divestments. wind farms are included as 
‘in operation’ after one full year of operation. note 
that avoided emission potential from wind farms 
under construction are calculated as if they were in 
operation in the current reporting year.

accounting policy can be found in section 5 ‘tax’ in 
our annual report 2020.

4.5 supplier due diligence
the number of screenings and due diligence 
activities conducted is determined by the 
time schedule of the individual construction 
projects and the procurement priorities from 
year to year.
in 2020, 303 risk screenings were conducted. 
based on the results of the risk screenings, an 
additional 81 extended risk screenings were 
carried out with additional risk parameters. 
furthermore, 843 know-your-counterparty 
(kyc) screenings were conducted, focusing 
on suppliers’ integrity and legal compliance. 
this amounted to 86 % and 92 % of the total 
procurement spend being risk-screened and 
kyc-screened, respectively. 
implementation of supplier assessments has 
been impacted by covid-19, and it has not 
been possible to conduct the planned number 
of site assessments in 2020, in particular code 
of conduct (coc), and health, safety, and envi-
ronment (hse) site assessments. instead, more 
desktop assessments have been conducted. 
however, for vessel inspections, more physical 
inspections than desktop inspections have 
taken place, with 339 conducted in total. 
physical vessel inspections have not been 
impacted to the same degree as the coc and 
hse site assessments as local inspectors and 
virtual inspections have been used. 
the results from the assessments are man-
aged through the different programmes, and 
improvement plans are developed and imple-
mented in collaboration with the suppliers. 
accounting policies
esg supplier and business partner due diligence is 
carried out by different departments in Ørsted.
risk screenings
the responsible business partner programme (rpp) 
team apply a risk-based due diligence framework to 
identify areas within our code of conduct (coc) for 
business partners where relevant suppliers need to 
improve their adherence to the code.
risk screenings are conducted by rpp based on 
country and category risk on all new sourcing 
contracts above dkk 3 million. based on the risk 
screening evaluation, rpp conducts extended risk 
screenings of selected contracts with additional 
parameters. screenings and extended screenings 
also take place for coal and biomass suppliers and 
top-spend suppliers.
the business ethics compliance (bec) team also 
conduct know-your-counterparty (kyc) screenings 
of all new suppliers and business partners to ensure 
legal compliance. 
procurement spend that is risk-screened and procure-
ment spend that is kyc-screened are both calculated 
on an annual basis for the reporting year. 
due diligence activities conducted
due diligence activities are carried out by the rpp, 
hse, and marine inspection teams, based on the re-
sults from individual screening and risk assessments. 
the activities are conducted either as desktop 
assessments or inspections or as on-site assessments 
or physical inspections which often include a visit to 
their production facilities by Ørsted or a third party.
assessments also include potential suppliers (i.e. no 
signed contracts yet) as part of the tender process.
new reporting scope
to capture the full scope of Ørsted’s esg 
supply chain due diligence activities, the re-
porting framework has been updated to better 
reflect all our supplier-facing activities. these 
activities are carried out by our health, safety, 
and environment (hse) supplier qualification 
department, and our marine inspection, busi-
ness ethics compliance (bec), and responsible 
business partner programme (rpp) teams. data 
is compiled from hse supplier assessments, 
vessel inspections, know-your-counterparty 
(kyc) supplier screenings, and code of conduct 
(coc) screenings and assessments. through the 
new reporting framework, we are now able to 
report more comprehensively on all environ-
mental, social, and governance parameters 
across our supplier base.

to the stakeholders of Ørsted a/s
Ørsted a/s engaged us to provide limited 
assurance on the selected esg data described 
below for the period 1 january to 31 december 
2020 set out in the company’s esg performance 
report 2020.
our conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and 
the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our 
attention that causes us not to believe that the 
selected esg data marked with a ‘ ’ in the esg 
performance report 2020 are free of material 
misstatements and prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the accounting 
policies as stated on pages 5-36.
this conclusion is to be read in the context of 
what we say in the remainder of our report.
what we are assuring 
the scope of our work was limited to assurance 
over esg data marked with a ‘ ’ in the esg per-
formance report 2020 for the period 1 january to 
31 december 2020.
professional standards applied and level 
of assurance
we performed a limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with the international standard 
on assurance engagements 3000 (revised) 
‘assurance engagements other than audits and 
reviews of historical financial information’, and, in 
respect of the reported greenhouse gas emissions, 
in accordance with international standard on 
assurance engagements 3410 ‘assurance engage-
ments on greenhouse gas statements’. a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially less in 
5.1 limited assurance report on the  
selected esg data
scope than a reasonable assurance engagement 
in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, 
including an understanding of internal control, 
and the procedures performed in response to the 
assessed risks; consequently, the level of assur-
ance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that 
would have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control
we have complied with the code of ethics for 
professional accountants issued by the interna-
tional ethics standards board for accountants, 
which includes independence and other ethical 
requirements founded on fundamental principles 
of integrity, objectivity, professional competence 
and due care, confidentiality, and professional 
behaviour. the firm applies the international 
standard on quality control 1 and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control, including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
our work was carried out by an independent 
multi-disciplinary team with experience in 
sustainability reporting and assurance.
understanding reporting and measurement 
methodologies
the selected esg data marked with a ‘ ’ need 
to be read and understood together with 
the accounting policies on pages 5-36 which 
management are solely responsible for selecting 
and applying. the absence of a significant body 
of established practice on which to draw to 
evaluate and measure esg allows for different, 
but acceptable, measurement techniques and 
can affect comparability between entities and 
over time. the quantification of greenhouse 
gas emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty 
because of incomplete scientific knowledge used 
to determine the emission factors and the values 
needed to combine emissions of different gasses.
work performed
we are required to plan and perform our work 
in order to consider the risk of material mis-
statement of the data in scope of our assurance 
engagement. in doing so and based on our 
professional judgement, we:
–  conducted interviews with group functions 
to assess consolidation processes and the 
use of company- wide systems and controls 
 performed at group level
–  performed an assessment of materiality and 
the selection of topics for the esg perfor-
mance report 2020 for the period 1  january to 
31 december 2020
–  conducted an analytical review of the selected 
data and trend explanations submitted by all 
business units for consolidation at group level
–  evaluated the evidence obtained.
management’s responsibilities
management of Ørsted a/s is responsible for:
–  designing, implementing, and maintaining 
internal control over information relevant to 
the preparation of data in the esg perfor-
mance report 2020 that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 
–  establishing objective accounting policies 
for preparing the selected data
–  measuring and reporting data in the esg per-
formance report 2020 based on the account-
ing policies
–  developing the content of the esg perfor-
mance report 2020 for the period 1 january to 
31 december 2020.
our responsibility
we are responsible for:
–  planning and performing the engagement to 
obtain limited assurance about whether the 
selected esg data marked with a ‘ ’ for the 
period 1 january to 31 december 2020 is free 
from material misstatements and is prepared, 
in all material respects, in accordance with the 
accounting policies
–  forming an independent conclusion, based on 
the procedures performed and the evidence 
obtained
–  reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of 
Ørsted a/s.

Ørsted’s annual 
esg reporting
annual report
our annual report provides full details 
on strategic esg targets and business 
drivers, complete with a consolidated esg 
statement. 
sustainability report
our sustainability report focuses on 
the company’s sustainability strategy 
and includes esg data related to the 
sustainability programmes. 
esg performance report
our esg performance report includes 
the full esg statements, disclosing all of 
Ørsted’s esg data. 
5.2 esg data selection and framework approach
esg dataset selection 
we continuously seek to develop our esg 
data set in order to support our business and 
to provide our stakeholders with relevant and 
transparent reporting of our esg performance.
the process behind our esg indicator selec-
tion is guided by Ørsted’s annual materiality 
assessment, investor requests, esg ratings, and 
sustainability reporting standards and guide-
lines. the interrelationship between Ørsted’s 
business-driver esg data and financial per-
formance is also central to this process. the 
resulting data set aims to show Ørsted’s impact 
on the environment and society, but also the 
impact that the environment and society, to 
an increasing degree, has on Ørsted’s business 
performance and value creation. 
approach to using sustainability 
frameworks 
part of the process for data selection involves 
using international sustainability frameworks 
and reporting standards as guidance. there 
are several frameworks with which we align 
partially (i.e. we use the framework as a start-
ing point from which to develop accounting 
practices) or fully (i.e. we fully comply with the 
framework requirements).
task force on climate-related financial 
disclosures (tcfd)
we are aware of the transitional and physical 
impacts of climate change on the resilience 
of our business as recommended by the tcfd. 
by endorsing and aligning our practices and 
reporting with the tcfd recommendations 
over the past three years, we have crys-
tallised our understanding and disclosure 
of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
our tcfd implementation is integrated in 
our strategy, risk management, governance 
practices, and reporting. this year, we have 
expanded our reporting to include a one-
page overview with references to our tcfd 
alignment (see p. 40 for details).
sustainability accounting standards board 
(sasb)
currently, we do not report in accordance 
with sasb, but we have conducted a cross- 
referencing exercise to identify where our 
current reporting aligns with topics and 
metrics from the ‘electric utilities and power 
generators’ standard relevant for Ørsted 
(see p. 41 for details).
greenhouse gas (ghg) protocol
we are in full compliance with the corporate 
accounting and reporting standards of the 
ghg protocol for scopes 1, 2, and 3.
cdp
we use the data requests from the cdp ques-
tionnaire process to help inform which data to 
measure and disclose in our report. our latest 
cdp report can be found on cdp’s website. 
sustainable development goals (sdgs)
Ørsted’s 20 sustainability programmes address 
the most important sustainability challenges 
affecting our business and stakeholders and 
contribute to several of the sdgs. our sdg 
cross-reference overview on page 42 focuses 
on those sdgs on which we aspire to have a 
transformative impact on namely sdgs 7 and 
13. for more information regarding our work 
with the sdgs, see Ørsted’s sustainability 
report 2020 (p. 16).
global reporting initiative (gri)
we use the gri standard as foundation for 
some of our esg data. we do not strive for full 
gri-based disclosure (see p. 42 for details).
other esg frameworks 
there are numerous other esg frameworks 
whose developments we will also continue to 
monitor closely, such as the world economic 
forum’s (wef) set of universal, material esg 
metrics and disclosures. furthermore, we 
will keenly await the outcome from efrag’s 
recent global consultation paper on sustain-
ability reporting, aimed at determining the 
need for global sustainability standards, and 
whether the ifrs foundation should be a 
part of this. 
we endeavour to grow our use of international 
esg frameworks as they continue to harmonise 
their work into a comprehensive, global plat-
form for corporate sustainability reporting.

5.4 alignment with sasb standards
the sasb’s industry standard ‘electric utilities 
and power generators’ is the primary sasb 
standard relevant for Ørsted. the tables on 
this page contain the data points in Ørsted’s 
current esg reporting that align with this 
standard. in addition, we have identified five 
codes in the standard for which it could also 
be relevant for Ørsted to disclose data, but 
they are not included in our current reporting 
(if-eu-110a.2, if-eu-140a.2, if-eu-140a.3,  
if-eu-150a.1, and if-eu-000.e). all other codes 
are omitted due to lack of applicability.
