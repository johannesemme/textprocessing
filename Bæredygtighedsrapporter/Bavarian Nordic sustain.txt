growing 
responsibly
2020 was a transformative year for bavarian nordic. we set out for 
the year with additional products in our portfolio after completing the 
acquisition of two marketed vaccines against rabies and tick-borne en-
cephalitis from glaxosmithkline. these products provide a strategic fit 
into our current business and are driving the commercial transformation 
of bavarian nordic.
global presence
an important task for us in 2020 has been the establishment of the 
commercial infrastructure to support the sales, marketing and distribu-
tion of the vaccines. this was a crucial first step to succeed with the in-
tegration of the products into our existing business. whereas previously 
our customers were mostly governments, our scope is now health care 
professionals in nearly 30 countries, requiring global presence across 
europe and the usa. to deliver on this, we have increased our work-
force by almost 40% in 2020. as we move forward with the integra-
tion, we will continue to grow our manufacturing and commercial 
activities and with that we will see an additional increase in manning 
over the coming year.
taking control of the full value chain
to support the growth and to minimize our dependency on third 
parties for manufacturing, we are expanding our manufacturing ca-
pabilities. in 2021 we will assume the final drug production of our 
own vaccines in our new fill and finish facility. with this facility, we 
will obtain full control of the value chain, from development over 
manufacturing to commercialization.
we have also initiated an expansion of our bulk manufacturing fa-
cility to allow for future transfer of the acquired products as well as 
to increase our capacity for future commercial production. we know 
that these activities will expand our carbon footprint, but they also 
allow us to help fulfil the increasing global requirements for vac-
cine manufacturing capacity. an additional advantage by expanding 
our in-house capabilities is that it enables us to provide a more an 
accurate reporting of our environmental impact going forward. 
going from a biotech company to becoming a sustainable business 
with global operations requires attention to many new disciplines 
and not least responsibility towards our many new stakeholders, 
whether they are patients, healthcare professionals, partners, 
authorities, shareholders or employees. we are governing these re-
lations according to established procedures and with the oversight 
of regulatory institutions all over the world, but more importantly 
in active dialogue with our stakeholders, whom we encourage to 
share their opinions about things that matter in our relationship.

our 
sustainability 
framework
we aim to do this by:
•  working actively and systematically to minimize our  
impacton the environment and climate.
•  maintaining an active dialog with our stakeholders on  
a local, national and global level.
•  actively supporting and respecting human rights and  
labor standards.
•  providing a safe and healthy working environment for  
our staff that includes opportunities for professional and  
personal development. 
•  conducting business according to highest ethical standards.  
•  communicating our csr policy openly and honestly to external 
collaboration partners, including our suppliers.
these are our guiding principles for working with csr, upon which we 
have formulated our policies which are further specified in relevant 
areas throughout this report. with this we are acting on the basis 
of principles regarding human rights, labor, environment and anti-
corruption, thus adhering to the ten principles of the united nations 
global compact1. 
reporting framework
since the establishment of our production facility at kvistgaard, den-
mark in 2005, we have been subject to annual environmental reporting 
to the danish authorities. this has served as a framework for key areas 
of our sustainability reporting, which has been expanded to include 
other relevant sustainability indicators as laid out by the global report-
ing initiative (gri).
in addition, we have incorporated the sustainable development goals 
(sdgs) adopted by the united nations in support of the 2030 agenda 
for sustainable development. they serve as a framework to highlight 
the impact of our business in a global perspective and help to raise 
awareness of the goals among all our stakeholders.
we have identified the following seven sdgs as important and relevant 
for our business. however, according to gavi2, the vaccine alliance, 
vaccines positively impacts, directly or indirectly, 14 of the 17 sdgs that 
support the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

companies
while pursuing our vision to become one  
of the largest pure play vaccines companies, 
improving and saving lives, we recognize the 
importance of protecting and taking care of 
the world around us, and act responsibly in 
all matters.

our manufacturing facility at kvistgaard, denmark is one of the chief 
sources of our environmental impact, and we seek to provide a 
high degree of transparency by reporting our carbon emissions and 
additional environmental data from this site. furthermore, it represents 
approximately two thirds of our employees. in addition, we have 
included our headquarters in copenhagen, denmark, research and 
development facilities in germany, and offices in switzerland and the 
usa, which collectively represent the last third of employees and 
contribute to our global emissions by approximately 15%.

emissions
our emissions increased by 22%, which was expected due to the 
significant scale up of activities in production, primarily related to the 
new fill and finish facility. as part of our acquisition of two commercial 
vaccines which will be transferred to our manufacturing facility as well 
as insourcing of fill and finish activities, we expect our resource con-
sumption and manufacturing output to continue to increase over the 
next years. see also note 1.
water 
water consumption at our kvistgaard facility increased in 2020, 
primarily due to activities related to validation activities in the new fill 
and finish facility. 
waste and recycling 
while the overall amount of waste increased in 2020, mainly as result 
of the work with the fill and finish facility, as well as new construction 
work being initiated, we saw a further increase in the recycling of 
waste, going from 50% in 2019 to 53% in 2020. see also note 4.
manufacturing activities in 2020 were primarily related to bulk 
manufacturing of smallpox vaccine under our ongoing contracts with 
the us government and small-scale manufacturing of vaccines for 
clinical trials.
additionally, we have focused on validation activities in our newly built 
fill and finish facility, which will assume commercial manufacturing 
in 2021. with this new facility, we will obtain full control of the value 
chain, from development over manufacturing to commercialization, 
which enables us to provide a more accurate reporting of our 
environmental impact going forward. 
to support the transfer of our acquired products, we have initiated 
construction work to expand our existing bulk manufacturing and thus 
have maintained a higher level of activity on the site together with 
an increase in staff and external workers, which has contributed to a 
higher consumption of energy and water.
there were no breaches of the environmental permit for the facility  
in 2020.

risks
we perform regular assessments of any risks associated with all our 
manufacturing activities and their impact on the environment, and 
from the initial phase of any new project. we work closely together 
with all relevant authorities to ensure that we have all the necessary 
approvals and that any impact on the surrounding environment is 
minimized as much as possible.
our vaccines are based on live viruses and are handled in a contained 
environment which has been designed to avoid viruses to escape 
into the indoor or outdoor environment through the air, waste, or 
wastewater.
we work continuously on improvements in connection with the 
identified areas of risks or opportunities.
we will continue our efforts to increase recycling with a 
particular focus on making further reductions of combustible 
waste fractions by increasing recycling of cardboard, paper and 
plastic. our goal for 2021 is to increase the overall recycling rate 
to a minimum of 55%, compared to 53% in 2020.

as we are becoming an increasingly global and diverse organization, 
we wish to build an inclusive workplace that offers an opportunity to 
contribute to our aspiration – regardless of gender, age, educational 
background, ethnicity, physical impairment, religion or sexual orienta-
tion. and we do not accept any kind of discriminatory behavior – nei-
ther verbal nor physical. we focus on health and wellbeing and want 
to offer a safe work environment for everyone employed in bavarian 
nordic. to oversee this, we have established a formal organization with 
oversight of all issues pertaining to health and safety, proactively work-
ing to ensure that we comply with relevant requirements as defined by 
the authorities. 
we systematically map both the physical and psychosocial working 
environment so that the necessary preventive steps can be taken, for 
the benefit of both individual employees and the company as a whole. 
we do so in a close dialogue between management and employees, 
both in the normal day to day engagements and through a number of 
established committees, including local works councils and a health 
and safety committee, which receives regular education and training in 
relevant areas. we act in accordance with the iso 45001 standard for 
an occupational health and safety (oh&s) management system.

in order to deliver on our commercialization strategy and prepare for 
the expansion of our manufacturing the number of employees has in-
creased by almost 40% in 2020. in 2021 we will continue to grow our 
manufacturing and commercial activities and with that we will see an 
additional increase in manning over the coming year.
engagement
in 2019 an employee engagement survey among all employees in ba-
varian nordic demonstrated an overall level of engagement surpassing 
engagement levels within the industry.
in 2020 employee engagement has been colored by covid-19 and 
the need for new ways of maintaining a sense of belonging, shared 
direction and commitment with most employees working remotely 
over longer periods of time. thanks to the high level of engagement as 
a starting point and the flexibility of our leaders and all employees, we 
have successfully managed to deliver on complex projects and objec-
tives even under the challenging circumstances. 
in 2021 we will follow up on the engagement in the organization by 
running a new survey as well as integrating our learnings from covid 
-19 into a more flexible way of working going forward.
health and safety
the absence rate was 2.7% in 2020 (2019: 2.8%) and thus we met 
our target to maintain the rate below 4%. we will continue our efforts 
around dialog-based absence management and aim to maintain a low 
rate of illness-related absence. see also note 5.
we recorded three occupational accidents in 2020, resulting in inju-
ry-related absence of a total of 90 days (one of the accidents resulted 
in long-term absence of 82 days). this translates into a lost time injury 
accident frequency rate (ltifr) of 2.8 accidents per million working 
hours compared to 2.5 in 2019. there were no fatal injuries. see also 
note 5.
diversity
we strive to maintain an equal gender distribution among our leaders 
in bavarian nordic. we want to work against biases in our selection 
and promotion processes and maintain a focus on the talent and qual-
ifications of the candidates rather than gender – or other demographic 
factors.
2020 
developments
2.7%
the absence rate was 2.7% in 
2020 corresponding to 6 days per 
full-time employee.
csr report 2020

in 2020, we maintained an equal distribution of men and women in 
managerial positions and we have female representation at all leader-
ship levels in the organization, including in our executive management 
team, where we welcomed two new female members during the year.
our board of directors has a representation of two women among the 
shareholder-elected members, corresponding to 28%, which is above 
the current target of 15%. the target is being reassessed in 2021. 
bavarian nordic favors that the composition of its board and manage-
ment is diverse in terms of experiences, competencies, nationality and 
gender. until now this has not been articulated in a separate policy, 
however in the coming year, a separate diversity policy will be pub-
lished and included in next year’s annual report to formalize our focus 
on diversity in executive management and the board of directors.
privacy and data protection
since the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) came into 
force in 2018, we have maintained a strong focus on the processing of 
personal data and securing the privacy of internal and external stake-
holders by introduction of proper procedures and guidelines which 
employees are regularly being trained in. 
human rights
we support and respect human rights. this area is widely covered by 
our health and safety policies, our code of conduct and our adherence 
to national labor and anti-discrimination laws in the countries in which 
we operate. in 2020, we have not received any reports of violation of 
human rights within our company. 
while our efforts are mainly directed towards our own employees, we 
seek to conduct business with third parties that are in compliance with 
the u.n. global compact principles as well. we have previously as-
sessed the impact of our business on human rights, and it indicated no 
actual adverse impacts. we will continue to monitor for potential ad-
verse impacts, in order to determine if additional actions are required.
as part of our procurement policies, we perform regular audits of 
our suppliers, whom we encourage to act responsibly in all matters, 
including observing international human rights. also, we conduct our 
clinical trials in a manner that recognizes the importance of protecting 
the safety of and respecting the research participants. we do this by 
applying the highest legal, ethical and scientific standards, in addition 
to complying with applicable laws and regulations.

risks
as a knowledge-based company, it is critical for us to attract  
and retain sufficient talent in order to perform at high standards 
and stay competitive. to mitigate this risk, we have established our 
operations in areas with high intensity of skilled labor, relevant for  
the biotech industry.
we operate in countries with a high labor standard, regulated by  
labor laws and are therefore at low risk of violations in this area.  
our suppliers are also located in highly regulated countries, thus with  
a perceived low risk of labor and human rights violations. 
with our manufacturing and associated activities, we are aware of 
the risks associated with handling of viruses and chemicals as well as 
handling of goods and production equipment. these risks are mitigated 
on a daily basis through proactive and systematic work in our ehs 
organization.

with the acquisition of two commercial vaccines from glaxosmith-
kline, bavarian nordic has entered the commercial market by having a 
portfolio of vaccines against several life-threatening diseases affecting 
people globally. we assumed ownership of the vaccines as per january 
1, 2020 and during 2020 we took over marketing authorizations and 
distribution in key markets. remaining markets will be taken over dur-
ing 2021, and later we will also assume manufacturing of the vaccines. 
while our customer base has changed significantly, our responsibility 
remains to ensure that our products meet the necessary requirements 
as set out by the authorities such as the fda and ema
product safety
product safety is crucial in our business, and quality and responsibility 
are important elements of our corporate culture. vaccine develop-
ment is a highly regulated area, in which a strong regulatory regime 
of inspections and approvals sets a high standard for all areas of our 
disciplines. 
we work according to good manufacturing practice (gmp), which 
are rules laid down by the european and u.s. health authorities. gmp 
includes strict requirements with respect to a product’s traceability, 
quality and purity, which means that quality management is built into 
each step of the manufacturing process. 
responsible procurement
in accordance with both gmp and our own supplier management 
system, we perform a risk assessment of all new suppliers of critical 
materials and equipment used in our production and laboratories. sup-
pliers whose products are considered to have a material impact on our 
products’ quality and safety, will undergo an initial audit, followed by 
an evaluation every third year as a minimum, either by way of a visit 
or a questionnaire, depending on the situation. the structured audit 
process helps us to gauge the quality mindset as well as the social and 
environmental responsibility of our suppliers. 
our suppliers of raw materials are mainly located in north america and 
the eu, which are areas with a high level of regulation of social and 
environmental parameters in place.

ethics
bavarian nordic prioritizes business ethics as a natural part of its un-
derlying business concept. we want to be seen as credible and reliable 
by all our stakeholders, and we are committed to work actively against 
bribery and corruption in all its forms as well as to ensure a high level 
of it-security. 
our code of business conduct and ethics (“the code”) describes the 
ethical requirements for all employees’ and the board of directors’ 
behavior in relation to customers, employees, shareholders, society, 
suppliers and partners. the code includes the rules and regulations in 
the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the truth in negotiations 
act (tina) that are relevant in connection with the company's business 
transactions and negotiations in the united states, but equally relevant 
in other markets, where the company operates. 
in 2020, all employees were trained in the code, and new employees 
will receive training as part of their introductory program. thus, the 
observation of the code rests upon all employees and all employees 
are encouraged to report issues, concerns and any breach of the code. 
for this purpose, the company has established a whistleblower system, 
which provides our employees with an opportunity to file reports in a 
secure and confidential manner. 
in 2020, the company received one report through the whistleblower 
system which has been investigated and handled in accordance with 
the internal procedures for whistleblower cases. the investigation is 
completed and the case has been closed.
the main risk associated with our activities relates to the potential 
legal and/or financial consequences deriving from violations by our 
employees of our code of business conduct. 
the overall risk for bavarian nordic in this area however is considered 
low. we primarily do business in countries and regions which typically 
are perceived at low-risk with respect to corruption, and we also make 
frequent assessments of our suppliers to mitigate any such risks.

we express a conclusion providing limited assurance.
management’s responsibility 
the management of bavarian nordic a/s is responsible for collecting, 
analyzing, aggregating and presenting the information in the report, 
ensuring that the report is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. bavarian nordic a/s’ reporting practice contains 
management’s defined reporting scope for each data type. 
auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 
data presented in notes 1-5 of the report based on our engagement 
with management and in accordance with the agreed scope of work. 
we have conducted our work in accordance with isae 3000, assurance 
engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial 
information, and additional requirements under danish audit regulation

a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than 
a reasonable assurance engagement. consequently, the level of 
assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we 
performed a reasonable assurance engagement. considering the risk of 
material misstatement, we planned and performed our work to obtain 
all information and explanations necessary to support our conclusion.
we performed our data review in february and march 2021. our work 
included interviews with key functions at bavarian nordic a/s, inquiries 
about procedures and methods to ensure that data and information 
have been presented in accordance with the reporting practice. we 
have assessed the processes, tools, systems and controls for gathering, 
consolidating and aggregating data, performed analytical review 
procedures and tested data prepared for consistency with underlying 
documentation. 
we have not performed site visits or interviewed external stakeholders, 
nor have we performed any assurance procedures on baseline data 
or forward-looking statements such as targets and expectations. 
consequently, we draw no conclusion on these statements.
conclusion 
based on our work, nothing has come to our attention causing us to 
believe that the data in notes 1-5 to the 2020 csr report has not been 
prepared in accordance with the reporting practice described.

co2 emissions all sites

energy kvistgaard site
reporting practice
calculations of co2-emissions are based on the corporate 
standard of the greenhouse gas protocol initiative4 and 
include the greenhouse gasses addressed by the unfccc5 
/kyoto protocol (co2, ch4, n2o, hfcs, pfcs, sf6 and 
nf3) calculated in metric tons of co2 equivalents when 
possible. 
our reporting covers scope 1 (emissions from sources that 
are owned or controlled by the company) and scope 2 
(emissions from purchased electricity), thus adhering to 
the corporate standard. 
numbers have been rounded for presentation purposes.
emission factors
in calculating co2 emissions, specific emission factors 
based on emissions type and geographic location were 
used. co2 emissions from the combustion of natural gas, 
oil, gasoline, diesel fuel and liquefied pressurized gas and 
from fugitive emissions were deemed to have a general 
global effect with minor local differences. emission factors 
from these sources are based on data provided by the 
danish energy agency, department for environment, food 
& rural affairs (defra) and linde. emissions for locally 
purchased electricity were determined on the basis 
of local conditions. emission calculations for electrical 
power in usa are based on emission factors provided by 
duke energy. emission calculations for electrical power 
purchased in germany are based on historical german 
emission factors; emission calculations for district heating 
purchased in germany are based on emission factors 
collected from local district heating companies.
reporting practice
energy consumption is calculated for the entire kvistgaard 
facility, including laboratories and administrative functions. 
the figure includes purchased electricity, purchased diesel 
oil used for power generators, and consumption of natural 
gas which is used for heating.

waste kvistgaard site
note 3
water kvistgaard site
waste consists primarily of disposable process equipment 
(production bags, tubing and other disposable equipment) 
and egg waste.  paper, egg waste, metal, electronics and 
pallets are being recycled.
hazardous waste includes organic solvents, acids, bases, 
hazardous clinical waste, etc. 
reporting practice
waste volumes are calculated for the entire kvistgaard fa-
cility and are based on annual statements from approved 
waste carriers handling ordinary and hazardous waste.
process wastewater is heat-inactivated, cooled and ph 
adjusted before being discharged into the public sewer 
system. inactivation is a procedure that ensures that all 
vaccine remnants are rendered 100% harmless, and 
the system is checked for operational problems before 
discharge. this treatment ensures that the discharged 
wastewater complies with the requirements in the com-
pany's permit to use the municipal sewer system.
reporting practice
water consumption is measured for the entire kvistgaard 
facility, including laboratories and administrative functions.

reporting practice
unless otherwise stated, the presented figures cover all 
bavarian nordic sites and employees.
fte
number of employees calculated as the equivalent num-
ber of full-time employees. 
employee turnover rate
the turnover rate expresses the ratio of all employees 
who have left the company during a year. employees 
with fixed-term contracts are not included. the calcula-
tion is based on the average number of employees over 
the year. voluntary turnover rate expresses the ratio of 
employees who voluntarily have left the company.
absence
absence data includes recorded staff sick days and child 
sick days for employees in denmark, germany and 
switzerland only. leave – also parental leave – is not 
included in these figures. the absence rate calculation 
is based on the average number of full-time employees 
for the year and the number of effective workdays in the 
calendar year, i.e. vacation days are excluded.
occupational injuries
occupational injury data relates to injuries resulting in at 
least one day of absence, in addition to the day of injury. 
absence days per injury expresses the average number of 
working days lost as result of the injury, measured as an 
average of all injuries occurred. the lost time injury fre-
quency rate (ltifr) is the number of occupational injuries 
per one million effective working hours. 
gender diversity
gender diversity expresses the ratio of women to men 
among all employees. gender diversity in management 
expresses the ratio of women to men among all manag-
ers with staff responsibility.
