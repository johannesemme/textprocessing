since genmab’s founding in 1999, our work has remained 
anchored in our core purpose “to improve the lives 
of patients by creating and developing innovative 
antibody products.” by focusing on this mission, we are 
making strides in transforming the way patients fight cancer 
while creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of 
science-driven innovation to help solve the world’s most 
pressing issues and revealed just how interconnected 
we are as a society. this interdependence reinforces how 
critically important it is for businesses to operate in a 
socially responsible and sustainable manner. with our 
core values and inspiring 2025 vision guiding our work, 
being socially responsible is fundamental to the way we 
do business at genmab.
we’ve dedicated more than 20 years to better under-
standing cancer and its impact on patients’ lives. i’m proud 
of and grateful for the resilience of genmab’s employees 
and our business partners, whose insatiable curiosity and 
steadfast dedication allowed us to continue to deliver on 
our promise during a very challenging year.
in 2020, genmab embarked upon a more focused, 
 business-driven corporate social responsibility (csr) 
strategy to steer our efforts. highlights include our commit-
ment to three united nations sustainable development 
goals (sdgs), determining the key environmental, social 
and governance (esg) related activities and disclosures 
important to our business, and launching our first sustain-
ability working group. we also welcomed a global head 
of compliance who reports directly to me and is building 
a robust compliance structure further strengthening our 
business integrity culture. i’m pleased to report the recent 
roll out of our new and updated code of conduct and 
anti-bribery/anti-corruption (abac) policies, all of which 
will further strengthen a strong framework for compliance 
moving forward.
as chair of our csr committee, which is comprised of 
representatives from our human resources, investor 
relations and communications, legal, compliance, and 
research and development functions, i am fully committed 
to ensuring that genmab carries out csr activities 
effectively and proactively communicates results.
as a leading international biotechnology company, we 
have high standards for our reporting requirements. along 
with the board of directors and my colleagues in senior 
leadership, we will continue to advance genmab’s csr 
strategy and activities to build a sustainable organization 
that meets esg criteria relevant to our business operations. 
we have adopted the sustainability accounting standards 
board (sasb) framework and will follow its guidelines to 
disclose critical measurements on the environment, society 
and governance of relevance to our business operations.
in 2021, we will continue to move our csr efforts forward, 
look for opportunities to further integrate esg into our 
strategic planning and risk management processes, monitor 
esg matters of relevance to our business operations, and 
establish clear goals to measure our performance. this 
report highlights our approach to our responsible business 
practices and offers easy access to other key reports and 
policies that may be of interest to you.

the issues of 2020 demonstrated how every 
organization and each individual plays an 
important role in the sustainability of our 
society and our planet. genmab embraces 
its responsibility to society and is pleased to 
join the effort to progress the united nations 
sustainable development goals (sdgs). in 
2020, we reviewed our csr focus areas and 
related activities to determine which sdgs were 
most closely aligned with our business and 
determined to commit to goals 3, 5 and 8. we 
will continue to assess our business operations 
in relation to all of the sdgs.
our commitment to the united nations 
sustainable development goals
genmab is dedicated to using science-driven 
innovation to improve the lives of patients 
with cancer and their families. in addition 
to the resources we dedicate to research 
and development, we are committed to our 
employees’ well-being and have benefits 
and programs in place to support them. 
additionally, we seek to support and be part 
of health-related initiatives in the commu-
nities where we operate.
genmab continues to be a leader in gender 
diversity among our peers. we have a female 
representation in “director-level and above” 
of 49% and are proud that four of our nine 
members of the board of directors are 
female, including the chair and deputy chair. 
our strong standing in gender balance and 
relatively high share of women at all levels led 
to genmab’s inclusion in the newly published 
goldman sachs “womenomics” share index 
of the 50 european companies that rank the 
highest in gender equality. 
genmab’s work is driven by innovation and 
conducted by employees who are highly skilled 
at, and dedicated to, their individual roles. 
we pay all of our employees a living wage and 
provide a safe stimulating and secure working 
environment. additionally, genmab contributes 
to the life sciences ecosystem by collaborating 
with academia, biotech and pharma companies, 
and other innovators to advance therapies 
against cancer and other diseases.

proprietary antibody 
technologies
genmab is building a strong pipeline of proprietary 
antibody products that have the potential to make 
a real impact on the lives of cancer patients. when 
we consider which programs to develop, we look 
for differentiated antibodies that are first-in-class, 
offer better efficacy than current treatments, or are 
better tolerated, and have the potential to improve 
outcomes for cancer patients. in this way, we are 
building a knock-your-socks-off (kyso) pipeline that
offers multiple possibilities for success and the 
potential to meet our 2025 vision, while also 
balancing the risks inherent in drug development. 
we are also working on an extensive portfolio of 
pre-clinical programs to fuel our pipeline of the future 
and bring us closer to achieving our 2025 vision.

about us

our commitment to corporate 
social responsibility (csr)
genmab is committed to being a 
socially responsible and sustain-
able biotechnology company. our 
commitment to csr is anchored 
in our company’s purpose, values 
and vision. being socially respon-
sible is fundamental to the way we 
do business.
our core purpose and vision
genmab is a leading international biotech-
nology company that aims to create, develop 
and commercialize antibody products to 
transform the treatment of cancer. we have a 
well-diversified portfolio of products, product 
candidates and technologies, featuring multiple 
approved antibody therapies that are marketed 
by partners, and a growing proprietary pipeline 
composed of modified antibody candidates 
including bispecific t-cell engagers and next- 
generation immune checkpoint modulators, 
effector function enhanced antibodies and 
antibody- drug conjugates. our portfolio includes 
four proprietary technologies which we use to 
create our own antibody products and license 
to other biotech and pharma companies.
genmab is committed to disrupting cancer 
treatment and turning our deep understanding 
of antibody biology into inventive technology 
platforms that fuel a transformative pipeline of 
potentially first-in-class or best-in-class therapies.
we are committed to ensure our actions benefit 
our direct stakeholders (patients, shareholders, 
collaboration partners and employees) and 
society as a whole. with our core values and vision 
in mind, being socially responsible is fundamental 
to the way we do business at genmab.
our commitment to csr is anchored in our 
company’s core purpose “to improve the 
lives of patients by creating and developing 
innovative antibody products” and our 
vision that “by 2025 our own product has 
transformed cancer treatment and we 
have a pipeline of knock-your-socks-off 
antibodies.” our vision inspires and motivates 
us. our teams are focused on developing 
innovative therapies that will transform how 
people fight cancer, changing it from a disease 
to be afraid of to a condition patients may live 
with and overcome.
how we carry out our csr initiatives
in conducting our business, genmab strives to 
comply with all relevant laws, standards and 
guidelines. we also consider the well-being of 
our employees a top priority and we minimize 
our impact on the environment to the extent 
possible. we have high ethical standards and 
aim to conduct business with companies and 
within countries that share our ethics and respect 
the protection of internationally proclaimed 
human rights. as we conduct business in a 
highly regulated industry, we have chosen not 
to implement a specific human rights policy. it is 
important to us, however, to support and respect 
the protection of internationally proclaimed 
human rights through other policies that 
address responsible supply chain management, 
ethical procedures, data privacy policies, health 
and safety procedures, anti-bribery and anti-
corruption policies and issues regarding access 
to medicine. genmab strives to only conduct 
clinical trials in markets where a drug is planned 
to become available. furthermore, genmab does 
not employ child labor.
the board of directors and senior 
leadership at genmab are committed to 
genmab’s  business- driven csr strategy, 
which focuses on four main areas:
employee well-
being, including 
health, safety 
and development 
business ethics and 
transparency 
environment, 
including waste 
management 
and recycling
ethics in relation 
to pre-clinical and 
clinical studies

we also benchmarked and examined our 
environment, social and governance (esg) 
activities, policies and disclosures to build a 
sustainable organization that meets esg criteria 
of relevance to our business operations. we 
have adopted the sustainability accounting 
standards board (sasb) framework and will follow 
its guidelines to disclose critical measurements 
on esg activities of relevance to our business 
operations. as we further execute on our csr 
strategy and build programs that have an impact 
on our stakeholders, we will be guided by the 
following tenets:  
• we use our world-class knowledge in antibody 
biology and deep expertise in innovative 
antibody technology to develop cancer 
treatments to have a positive impact on patients 
and society.
•  we care for our employees’ health, well-
being, safety and development and promote 
a collaborative culture that fosters passion for 
innovation, integrity and respect. we believe 
that diversity and inclusion are fundamental 
to achieving our vision and are committed to 
championing a corporate culture that accepts and 
promotes uniqueness and empowers each team 
member to bring their authentic self to work in a 
safe, open and respectful environment.
• we operate our business with the utmost integrity 
by always doing what is right and incorporating 
compliance, ethics and transparency into our 
business practices, policies and procedures.
• we maintain a highly ethical organization by 
promoting our code of conduct to employees 
and by engaging with partners and suppliers 
committed to the same level of ethics in  
their operations.
• we aim to reduce our impact on the environment 
by refining our processes and incorporating 
best practices into our operations to reduce our 
environmental footprint, minimize waste and 
decrease use of hazardous material.
• we monitor and evaluate targets for esg 
activities, measure our impact and communicate 
our progress.
our csr committee, chaired by our ceo, is 
comprised of representatives from our human 
resources, investor relations and communications, 
legal, compliance, and research and development 
functions. the committee ensures that genmab 
carries out our csr activities effectively and 
communicates them clearly and openly. genmab’s 
csr report discloses the main highlights of our 
csr initiatives but does not reflect all our ongoing 
initiatives and procedures. we also monitor 
new developments and practices and consider 
implementing new initiatives that could further 
enhance our csr activities when appropriate. the 
nominating and corporate governance committee, 
which oversees all aspects of genmab’s csr 
efforts on behalf of the board of directors, provides 
recommendations to the board of directors 
regarding csr and esg issues. the csr report has 
been approved by the genmab board of directors.

covid-19
our response to covid-19 
covid-19 has presented numerous 
challenges, but it has also high-
lighted how ingenuity, motivation, 
collaboration and dedication can 
produce positive outcomes for society. 
genmab is proud of the “can-do” 
spirit and determination that our 
employees are demonstrating during 
this unprecedented time and appre-
ciate their concern for others facing 
hardships due to the pandemic. 
beyond our internal response to our 
employees, genmab has deployed a 
multi-pronged approach to supporting 
covid-19 relief efforts. some key 
examples are highlighted on this page.
genmab scientists contribute to  
high-tech innovation of covid-19 
testing capacity in the netherlands
in the first weeks of the pandemic, genmab 
researchers and experts in laboratory automation 
and robotization joined molecular biologists 
in the netherlands who mobilized dozens of 
scientists around strategy development for 
innovative testing. the result of their collective 
efforts is a sophisticated and high-tech molecular 
test robot nicknamed “the beast.” through 
2020, the “open innovation initiative” gained 
momentum and added expertise from a variety 
of disciplines, companies and scientific institutes 
to the consortium, and later a national working 
group named systematic testing with robotics 
and innovation in pandemics (strip) was formed. 
following testing and a successful pilot in the 
diagnostic lab may lead to a robotized pandemic 
lab initiative preparing the netherlands for future 
pandemic needs. genmab is proud to be part of 
the larger life sciences ecosystem that contributed 
scientific expertise to this important cause.
genmab colleagues gather personal 
protective equipment (ppe) for frontline 
health workers
when the covid-19 pandemic struck and it 
became known that there was a need for ppe, 
genmab quickly inventoried its stocks of gloves, 
disinfectants, and other needed materials and 
readied a donation to the netherlands red cross 
and a local hospital in new jersey.
genmab supports local covid-19  
relief efforts
genmab employees are concerned about the 
well-being of those in our local communities. 
teams supported numerous local relief efforts 
including donating baby monitors used to facilitate 
communications between covid-19 patients 
and healthcare workers, providing a monetary 
donation to the new jersey pandemic relief fund 
to support local nonprofits’ on the ground efforts, 
supporting local food drives and contributing 
to thanksgiving meals for families facing food 
insecurity in new jersey.

employee engagement and development (continued)
progress in 2020
after extensive research of options, industry 
benchmarking and employee feedback, genmab 
implemented the following projects successfully  
in 2020:
• engagement survey: conducted a global 
employee engagement survey assessing 14 
proven engagement drivers across the rapidly 
transforming enterprise. our overall scoring 
significantly outpaced industry benchmarks and 
highlighted key opportunities to drive even higher 
engagement in the future. a structured workplan 
has been created. additionally, genmab ranked 
among new jersey’s medium-sized companies in 
the njbiz 2020 best places to work survey.
• automation: we continued to build and optimize 
our global hr systems by documenting all core 
business processes to promote appropriate 
uniformity in our ways of working, ensure 
efficiency and measurable impact.
• structure: we have developed and implemented 
a robust career architecture to help the 
organization scale in a disciplined manner and 
created a framework within which employees can 
create targeted development plans related to job-
based competencies.
• compensation: introduced a new rewards 
structure that takes a strong pay-for-performance 
approach, emphasizing individual and business 
results. the changes ensure a globally consistent 
and market competitive rewards package in each 
of our global geographies. they also further align 
employees to genmab’s core values and culture 
and ensure greater line of sight to our short-term 
goals, 2025 vision and overall business results.
• performance management: launched a new, 
more interactive performance management 
process experience. the new real-time system with 
enhanced reporting capabilities enables managers 
to make informed decisions, thus increasing 
effectiveness of the performance management 
and development process. senior level managers 
are further empowered to differentiate rewards 
for individual performance and accomplishments 
to ensure fair and appropriate base pay and 
incentive practices. lastly, our new performance 
management system significantly weighs 
behaviors to ensure we not only continue to 
demonstrate productivity, but that we operate in a 
manner consistent with our values.
• training and leadership development: 
provided both internal and external online 
training opportunities to employees, as needed. 
we also provided on-the-job training, enabling 
development and growth by encouraging 
employees to participate in challenging projects 
and assignments or in new jobs or roles. in 2020, 
we further developed a more formal strategy 
to identify developmental gaps and needs. 
this strategy includes establishing a consistent 
job architecture, talent review and succession 
planning process across the organization.

• learning and development: a tremendous 
amount of work was done to further build 
genmab’s learning culture. nearly all core training 
offerings were reformatted to be optimally 
delivered in a virtual environment. we accelerated 
the build and deployment of our cloud-based 
learning management system and accompanied 
this tool with a robust elearning library of courses 
to drive the competency development to our 
workforce remotely.
• employee communications: engaged 
employees by executing a global communication 
strategy to deliver timely and consistent 
messaging across the company, using a variety 
of media such as virtual town halls, webcasts and 
online updates. in response to the coronavirus 
pandemic, employee communications became 
paramount to ensuring the health and safety 
of our employees and collaborators and to 
safeguarding business continuity. the covid-19 
response team, led by genmab’s ceo, developed 
a strategic plan that offered clear guidance to 
employees based on global and local government 
and health agencies. additional virtual employee 
engagement programs were rolled out on a 
regular basis. a series of video messages from 
genmab’s ceo were pulsed throughout the year 
with inspirational messages to foster genmab’s 
strong collaborative and innovative culture.
• company intranet: further enhanced our 
company intranet to inform, connect, engage and 
inspire our employees and optimize the intranet 
user experience to access company news, 
policies and a variety of systems.
• employee resource groups (ergs): genmab 
has established genclubs, the genmab employee 
resource group, run by employees for employees, 
to network and foster the genmab culture of 
inclusiveness and passion for innovation.
• governance: engagement and development 
opportunities are identified and initiated by the 
global human resources (hr) team, which then 
works with two key internal groups to ensure 
employees’ points of views are represented. this 
includes the netherlands works council and 
denmark employee representatives committee. 
once recommendations are fully formed, all 
initiatives are presented and approved by 
genmab’s global leadership team.
our goal is to not only make genmab 
a successful company, but also one of 
the best places to work in the world.

progress in 2020
• governance and committee reviews: formal 
committees, responsible for monitoring and 
improving health and safety at each of our 
locations, continued their work. each committee 
reports up to site operations and the local 
management team to address and escalate 
any issues as needed. mandatory workplace 
assessments in the netherlands and denmark, 
in compliance with local regulations, were also 
conducted. health and safety prevention workers 
continue to monitor and improve health and 
safety at genmab research and development 
facilities in utrecht. all key findings have been 
communicated to employees. improvement 
plans have been developed and remediation 
strategies are being implemented. likewise, 
in our copenhagen facility, genmab abides by 
proposed new actions by an environmental group 
to improve health and safety.
• education and training: continued to use 
our security awareness program to increase 
employee awareness and improve the safety 
and security of our locations and employees. our 
physical safety procedures were reviewed and 
revised to accommodate reduced capacity for our 
physical work locations and dramatic measures 
were taken to ensure employee safety during a 
pandemic. these measures spanned from on-site 
temperature scanning, to increased cleaning and 
sanitization schedules to plexiglass barriers added 
to our reception desks and interview rooms.
• human rights: continued to support and 
respect the protection of internationally 
proclaimed human rights through internal 
policies. these policies address responsible 
supply chain management, ethical procedures 
and health and safety procedures. in addition, we 
do not employ child labor and we comply with all 
relevant laws in the markets in which we operate.
• covid-19: recognizing the magnitude of 
impact covid-19 and the associated measures 
taken to keep people safe has had on people, 
we undertook highly proactive measures to 
help our employees manage through 2020. 
genmab employees were given access to a full 
complement of home working accommodations/
business equipment to assist with the transition 
to remote working. in addition to these business 
tools, virtual exercise and training programs were 
provided to the workforce globally to ensure 
both physical and mental well-being. when our 
committed workforce began to exhibit signs of 
fatigue, we instituted a series of global company 
closures to promote recovery, as well as a new 
flexible work schedule and options that allow 
employees to better manage the demands of our 
new work/life balance dynamics.
• health and wellness: invested in our employees 
through a competitive benefits package that 
strives to be market competitive by country 
and region. our 2020 programs emphasized 
support for individual and family needs and 
helped to empower employees to focus on their 
overall health and wellness. each of our sites 
manages local programs that provide employees 
a multitude of wellness activities, from flu shots, 
to massages, to cross-training or running events. 
in 2020, we increased our focus and looked for 
ways to increase health and wellness incentives 
as a part of our overall benefits strategy.

ambition
seek diverse new talent who can teach genmab 
something we do not already know; challenge the 
way we think and complement our existing strengths 
by cultivating an inclusive culture that embraces all 
employees, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, 
age, disability and other characteristics.
commitment
we created a global diversity and inclusion council 
with representation of leaders and employees from all 
of our locations to firmly articulate our organizational 
commitment to diversity and inclusion, as we believe 
excellence in this domain leads to innovation and 
differentiated outcomes for patients.
action
beyond the introduction of a diversity and 
inclusion-related set of training courses (including 
unconscious bias and cross-cultural diversity), we have 
committed to hiring a leader of diversity and inclusion 
for the organization to drive even greater awareness and 
impact in 2021. while the dimension of diversity and 
inclusion was the absolute highest scoring area of the 
2020 genmab global employee engagement survey, we 
will continue to build on our strength in this area.

2020 targets
•  strive towards a balanced representation 
of genders at genmab, from entry-level to 
management and board-level positions.
• maintain a workforce that reflects the cultural 
diversity of the markets we serve.
• ensure our employees connect to diversity as 
a key part of our culture and understand the 
importance of working together with people from 
different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs.
• comply with the netherlands government 
participation act that supports people who find  
it difficult to get paid work due to a disability  
or incapacity.
why it is important
genmab believes that an engaged, inclusive 
and diverse workforce attracts top talent to drive 
passion and innovation. we believe that “growth 
through differences” is fundamental to our future. 
these differences are grounded in experience  
and points of view, but not gauged by an 
individual’s appearance, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, gender or other characteristics. to 
simply state: diversity efforts are the right thing to 
do both ethically and economically.
progress in 2020
genmab continues its commitment to working 
towards and maintaining equal opportunities for 
men and women at all levels within the company. 
diversity efforts will continue to be an increased 
area of focus in 2021 and beyond.
• gender balance in workforce: we have 
continued to meet and exceed our goal 
maintaining at least a 40% presence of females 
in all levels of leadership across the organization 
and proudly have overall female representation 
greater than 50%. we also have 49% female 
presence in director and above roles. we also are 
proud that four of our nine members of the board 
of directors are female, including the chair and 
deputy chair. genmab has achieved equitable 
gender representation at the board level 
according to the danish business authority’s 
guidance. our strong standing in gender balance 
and relatively high share of women at all levels 
led to genmab’s inclusion in the newly published 
goldman sachs “womenomics” share index 
of the 50 european companies that rank the 
highest in gender equality. beyond gender 
balance, genmab’s board of directors and senior 
leadership represent more than 10 nationalities 
and skill sets ranging from life sciences, finance/
risk, legal/governance, it, environmental/
sustainability and international markets.
• global workforce expansion: our workforce 
has grown by more than 220 new employees in 
the past 12 months. this includes onboarding 
new employees in the united states, europe and 
japan, and we proudly represent more than 50 
different nationalities in our workforce.

policies and guidelines
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
are governed by extensive and strict regulations 
that are intended to provide quality assurance of 
pre-clinical and clinical studies and the processing 
of the resulting data. genmab is subject to and 
complies with international regulations, guidelines 
and standards for drug development, such as 
current good laboratory practice (cglp), current 
good clinical practice (cgcp) and current good 
manufacturing practices (cgmps). genmab 
also complies with all relevant legislation and 
regulations, including guidelines issued by 
international regulatory authorities including the 
european medicines agency (ema), the u.s. food 
and drug administration (fda) and others.
genmab’s operations are audited by relevant 
authorities and genmab conducts internal and 
external audits according to an approved audit 
schedule and standard operating procedures.
we continue to evaluate business ethics with 
collaboration partners as part of our vendor 
management process and strive to work with 
partners that have the same level of ethics and 
regulations as genmab.
in accordance with guidelines and regulations, 
genmab discloses data and other information  
from our clinical trials in external public registries, 
such as clinicaltrials.gov and the eu clinical  
trials register.
 
in addition, we amend our policies and guide-
lines to stay in line with current regulations and 
business trends. genmab is dedicated to the 
ethical and responsible treatment of all animals 
used in the development of medicines. decisions 
regarding animal care, use and welfare are made 
by balancing scientific knowledge and regulatory 
requirements with consideration of ethical values 
and according to eu legislation. we feel that the 
principle of the 3rs (reduction, refinement and 
replacement) is important and stimulate the use 
of non-animal (in vitro, in silico) studies prior to or 
instead of animal studies. research animals are 
used only to address important scientific questions 
or fulfill a regulatory requirement. animals involved 
in research within genmab are all bred specifically 
for research purposes and are housed and handled 
in accordance with good animal practice as defined 
by the federation of european laboratory animal 
science associations (felasa), in an association 
for assessment and accreditation of laboratory 
animal care (aaalac) and iso9001:2000 accred-
ited animal facility (gdl). all animal experiments 
we do in nonclinical safety are performed in 
compliance with european directives (2010/63/eu) 
and approved by the local ethical committees.

genmab considers use of green energy in its 
operations across the enterprise. genmab 
purchases solely green energy at its copenhagen 
site. in utrecht, the building is equipped 
with solar energy panels for production-to-
consumption use. our new, state-of-the-art u.s. 
offices offer electric charging stations to promote 
the use of electric cars as part of the amenities 
offered to employees. for both european sites, 
buildings are equipped with recycling facilities 
for heating and water use.
genmab facilities are equipped with building 
research establishment environmental 
assessment method (breeam) certifications 
of various grades (e.g., excellent in the 
netherlands and very good in denmark). in 
particular, the utrecht facility is one of the first 
laboratories in the netherlands to obtain a 
breeam excellent certification.
the u.s. office and laboratory site have met 
requirements for leadership in energy and 
environmental design (leed) silver certification 
for its sustainable design features, which were 
paramount during the design and construction 
of the site. during the site renovation, more 
than 75% of construction waste was recycled, 
instead of being sent to a landfill. other features 
from the new space include energy-star 
equipment and appliances that contribute to a 
reduction in energy use and water stations to 
encourage the use of refillable water bottles. 
additionally, this project was acknowledged 
as a runner up for the united way economic 
development award in princeton, nj, in 2020.
ambition
strive to have a minimum carbon footprint  
in areas where possible.
2020 targets
• continue to encourage employees to act in an 
environmentally friendly manner, to produce as 
little waste as possible and to collect waste for 
recycling wherever possible.
• continue to focus on reducing our  
environmental impact.
progress in 2020
genmab is committed to the environment and to 
reducing its carbon footprint from its operations. 
at genmab’s european locations, we encourage 
employees to use public transportation to 
commute to work (by partially reimbursing 
commuting expenses and fully reimbursing public 
transportation in the netherlands) and by choosing 
locations with short proximity to public transport. 
in our copenhagen offices, we offer free access to 
company bikes, reducing the use of cars and taxis. 
while inter-site travel was significantly reduced or 
limited in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic, our 
global travel policy provides guidelines for limiting 
unnecessary plane travel. in 2020, genmab invested 
in online meeting infrastructure to optimize the use 
of teleconferencing and videoconferencing as an 
alternative to business trips.
while genmab’s environmental impact and carbon 
footprint are considered limited based on our 
current business operations, and we have not 
included any indicators for the environmental 
area at this time, the csr committee endorsed 
the launch of our first site-based employee-led 
environmental sustainability working group in the 
netherlands. the group will focus on assessing 
the local carbon footprint, creating awareness, 
and searching for different approaches on how to 
minimize our carbon footprint.

produce and supply our product candidates. dependent on clinical 
research organizations to conduct key aspects of our clinical trials, 
and on partners to conduct some of our clinical trials.
genmab oversees outsourcing and partnership relationships to ensure consistency with strategic objectives 
and service provider compliance with regulatory requirements, resources and performance. this includes 
assessment of contingency plans, availability of alternative service providers, and costs and resources 
required to switch service providers. we evaluate financial solvency and require our suppliers to abide by a 
code of conduct consistent with genmab’s code. 
subject to extensive regulatory and other legal requirements  
both during clinical development and post-marketing approval, 
including healthcare laws and regulations, as well as data  
protection regulations.
to ensure compliance with regulatory and legal requirements including current good laboratory practice 
(cglp), current good clinical practice (cgcp) and current good manufacturing practices (cgmps), genmab’s 
quality assurance department makes every effort to stay abreast of regulatory and legislative changes to 
ensure compliance. to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, genmab has 
established relevant policies and guidelines, including pharma compliance guidelines and guidelines for the 
processing and protection of personal data, and a new global compliance function led by an executive who 
reports to the ceo. the data protection area is overseen by the company’s dpo (data protection officer). 
legislation, regulations and best practices may change from  
time to time. 
to prevent unwarranted consequences of new and amended legislation, regulations etc., genmab strives to 
stay current with respect to all applicable regulations, practices and updates by means of internal, as well as 
external, legal counsel and compliance functions. also, internal procedures for review of contracts have been 
implemented to ensure contractual consistency and compliance with legislation and regulations.

uncertain and impossible to predict. the factors discussed above, 
as well as other factors that are currently unforeseeable, may result 
in further and other unforeseen material adverse impacts on our 
business and financial performance.
genmab has established a covid-19 response team, led by the ceo, that closely monitors the evolving 
situation, develops and implements precautionary measures to help limit the impact of covid-19 at our 
workplace and on our communities, ensures business continuity and helps mitigate effects on employee 
well-being as a consequence of working from home. genmab assesses the situation on an ongoing basis in
