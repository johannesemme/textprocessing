foreword 
dear reader,
 
2021 marks the 150-year  
anniversary of danske bank. 
a company that has existed 
for a century and a half is a 
company that has managed to 
adapt and evolve and that has 
managed to run a business 
that has been commercially 
sustainable over the course of 
time. 
at danske bank, we have 
evolved as a reflection of 
the societies we are part of, 
and we have helped shape 
these societies by creating 
opportunities and by helping 
individuals and businesses 
to realise their ambitions – as 
well as by helping to build 
and innovate the financial 
infrastructure. 
we have a long and proud 
history, and we have much to 
celebrate. each day, we service 
the needs of thousands of 
customers by providing vital and 
innovative financial services, 
and we contribute to growth 
and the general prosperity of 
the nordic countries. 
but as we embark on 
celebrating our anniversary, 
we are also coming to terms 
with issues from our recent and 
distant past. we are working 
hard to address these issues 
with an ambition to promote 
a culture in which problems 
are discussed, handled and 
resolved openly and responsibly. 
we want to be a trusted partner 
and become an even better 
bank that is simpler, faster 
and more competitive and that 
creates long-term value for our 
customers, employees, society 
and investors. as a responsible 
bank, we will work to resolve 
issues of past mistakes, while 
continuing to look forward and 
“for danske bank and for our customers, 
sustainability and the transition to a greener 
economy is possibly the greatest opportunity and 
the greatest challenge ahead. we regard sustainable 
finance as a strategic lever for danske bank to 
succeed commercially.”

helping our customers assess 
the risks, challenges and 
opportunities ahead. 
by integrating esg 
considerations into our 
financing and investment 
activities, we want to take a 
leading position on sustainable 
finance in the nordic region. 
we will build on our strong 
customer relationships and 
use our leading position among 
corporates and institutions 
to drive the agenda across 
customer segments.  
for danske bank and for our 
customers, sustainability and 
the transition to a greener 
economy is possibly the 
greatest opportunity and the 
greatest challenge ahead. we 
regard sustainable finance as a 
strategic lever for danske bank 
to succeed commercially.
our efforts rest on our 
commitments to the un 
principles for responsible 
banking and principles for 
responsible investment, as well 
as through our embracement 
of the task force on climate-
related financial disclosures. 
we also continue to support 
the un global compact, and 
we contribute to several of the 
un sustainable development 
goals.
our responsibility to provide 
resilient and sustainable 
financial solutions for our 
customers and for society also 
guides our work and initiatives 
to support families, businesses 
and external partners through 
the financial hardship and 
uncertainty caused by 
covid-19. 
the year 2020 will be 
remembered as a year in 
which business and everyday 
life were turned upside down, 
and the social and financial 
consequences are likely to stay 
with us for years. 
danske bank is a well-
consolidated bank, and we are 
in a solid position to support 
our customers throughout the 
crisis. our foremost priority in 
2020 has been to safeguard 
the health and safety of 
our employees, customers 
and external partners while 
supporting our customers 
with lending and expertise and 
advice. we will continue to do 
so in 2021.
throughout the process, we 
have had to invent new ways of 
working and new ways to meet 
and advise our customers, and 
the experience has strength-
ened our ambitions to become a 
better and simpler bank.
the coronavirus pandemic 
continues to be a tremendous 
challenge for us all. but our 
collective ability to adapt to 
a new and unforeseen reality 
has also shown us what we 
can achieve when we all work 
together. i believe that this is an 
important lesson to draw upon 
as we set out to transform our 
businesses and our economies 
in the transition towards a 
greener and more sustainable 
future.

business & strategy
since 1871, we have been helping our customers to become 
financially confident and to build their lives and businesses on 
a solid financial foundation. today, danske bank is one of the 
largest financial institutions in the nordic countries and is listed 
on nasdaq copenhagen’s omx c25 index. in addition to banking 
services, the danske bank group offers customer life insurance 
and pension products, mortgage credit, wealth management, real 
estate, and leasing products and services.
our business 
danske bank is a bank for people and businesses across the nordic region, and our more than 
22,000 employees serve in excess of 3.3 million customers. by providing a high level of financial 
competence and leading innovative solutions, we strive to create long-term value for our key 
stakeholders. 
at the end of 2019, we launched our better bank plan and 
announced clear ambitions for 2023 for our key stakeholder 
groups: customers, employees, society and shareholders. the 
better bank plan will ensure that danske bank becomes a 
simpler and more competitive bank and that we continue to 
be more closely integrated into the lives of our customers and 
nordic societies. the plan centres on our customers, employ-
ees, our contribution to society and our investors. in 2020, to 
strengthen our business resilience and to future-proof danske 
bank’s ability to create value, our executive leadership team 
expedited our better bank transformation by focusing primarily 
on compliance, cost savings, better ways of working and on our 
purpose and culture.

with our strong foothold in the nordic markets, we are well posi-
tioned to help our customers meet their financial objectives by pro-
viding them with banking services based on high levels of financial 
competence and leading innovative solutions. 
danske bank is headquartered in denmark, and in 2020 our cus-
tomer services operated through four business units: banking dk 
and banking nordic, serving personal and small and medium-sized 
business customers in denmark, finland, norway and sweden; cor-
porates & institutions, serving corporate and institutional custom-
ers; and wealth management, providing pension savings, private
banking, and asset management services across the entire group.
we serve personal and business customers in northern ireland, 
which is operated and reported on as a separate business unit.
we engage with our customers at our physical locations and 
through a wide range of digital platforms, including self-service and 
other digital solutions. our offices outside the nordic countries 
offer gateways to the rest of world for nordic customers and serve 
as points of entry to our region for international customers whose 
activities are anchored in our core markets.
following structural reorganisation in january 2021, danske 
bank’s commercial activities are managed by just two business 
units: personal & business customers and large corporates & 
institutions.

group key figures 2020

the creation of societal value 
and business value can and 
must go hand in hand. this 
assumption drives our approach 
to sustainability and is an impor-
tant lever for our better bank 
transformation towards 2023. 
the 17 un sustainable devel-
opment goals (sdgs) and so-
ciety’s sustainability transition 
towards 2030 are driving rapid 
change across markets. for the 
financial sector in particular, the 
eu action plan on sustainable 
finance, the task force on 
climate-related financial disclo-
sures (tcfd), the principles for 
responsible banking (prb) and 
the principles for responsible 
investments (pri), all of which 
are supported by danske bank, 
are significantly shaping market 
developments and our business.
to seize opportunities and avoid 
risks associated with these de-
velopments while also meeting 
our stakeholders’ expectations, 
we in 2020 revisited and 
updated our group sustain-
ability strategy. our updated 
sustainability strategy builds on 
our foundation, on the results 
achieved in recent years as well 
as on our better bank 2023 
ambitions. by doing so, we 
further develop the areas that 
create both societal value and 
business value, which in turn 
also strengthens danske bank’s 
competitiveness.
our main area of impact is 
through sustainable finance. 
consequently, sustainable 
finance is at the core of our 
sustainability strategy, and our 
ambition is to take a leading po-
sition on sustainable finance in 
the nordic countries. we define 
sustainable finance as “finance 
to support economic growth 
while reducing negative impacts 
and increasing positive impacts 
on esg factors”. this aligns 
well with the eu’s definition, 
and it covers integration of esg 
considerations into our financ-
ing and investments activities 
across the group. the strategy 
includes five additional focus 
areas that continue to be of high 
importance for our stakeholders 
and which are vital to our per-
formance and credibility on the 
overall sustainability agenda. 
our strategic direction
we aim to support value creation for all our stakeholders and have updated our 2023 group 
sustainability strategy, thereby placing sustainable finance at the core of our strategy to future-
proof danske bank’s business.

with our strategy and our 2023 targets, we aim to contribute 
to the un’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development and to 
the sdgs. over the past couple of years, we have targeted our 
efforts on sdg 4: quality education, sdg 8: decent work and 
economic growth, and sdg 13: climate action. reflecting our 
work to promote equal opportunities in leadership and our efforts 
to reduce illicit financial flows and combat financial crime, the 
updated strategy also addresses sdg 5: gender equality and 
sdg 16: peace, justice and strong institutions. 
through our sustainable finance activities, we potentially have 
an indirect impact on all 17 sdgs. depending on the underlying 
activities, the impact can be both negative and positive, which 
we will start mapping in more detail in 2021, in line with our 
prb commitment, see p. 13 and p. 36. in this report, we refer to 
relevant sdg targets for which we are currently able to disclose 
supporting metrics on progress across our six focus areas.
our contribution to the sdgs
“the sdgs address global challenges and patterns in society that no one can solve alone. we want 
to make a real difference, and we contribute through our actions and financial offerings and by 
joining forces with stakeholders who share our sustainability ambitions.”

head of group sustainability

key levers for an efficient 
execution of our sustainability 
strategy are our governance 
framework, our engagement 
with stakeholders and our 
reporting efforts. 
because our 2023 group 
sustainability strategy cuts 
across the entire business, 
it is essential to have clear 
roles and responsibilities that 
enable efficient execution. this 
is of particular importance for 
the sustainable finance area, 
which has matured and grown 
in significance to involve more 
employees across the organ-
isation. to further support 
coordination and accelerate 
group-wide execution, we in 
2020 established a sustainable 
finance council and a diversity 
& inclusion council, both of 
which include representatives 
from all business units and from 
relevant group functions. 
the majority of employees work-
ing with sustainability are firmly 
rooted in our business units, and 
in collaboration with our group 
sustainability function, they lead 
the work in their units to embed 
sustainability in everything we 
do. 
we monitor progress against 
our targets using a set of 
key performance indicators 
(kpis), and our sustainability 
strategy execution dashboard 
provides a solid overview of 
our achievements on a regular 
basis. towards 2023, we will 
further develop and integrate 
sustainability-related kpis into 
our performance management 
framework. we took the first 
step in 2020 by including three 
sustainability-related kpis in 
the group’s variable remu-
neration structure to ensure 
that all employees’ variable 
remuneration is clearly linked 
to our ambitions. the remuner-
ation kpis are based on our 
2023 sustainability targets and 
include environmental footprint, 
employee well-being & diversity 
and governance & integrity, 
which together represent all 
three esg dimensions.

our stakeholder engagement
based on information gathered 
from our stakeholder engage-
ments, we annually assess the 
materiality of esg-related topics 
to identify issues that represent 
risks or opportunities for socie-
ty and for our business. 
this year’s assessment is also 
informed by our comprehensive 
stakeholder survey from 2019. 
the survey confirmed that a 
majority of our personal cus-
tomers in the nordic countries 
and investors consider sus-
tainability to be an important 
focus area for danske bank, 
with governance- and compli-
ance-related topics as the most 
material areas. investors also 
highlighted climate change 
preparedness as an area of 
increasing importance. 
similarly, a group-wide employ-
ee survey in 2019 documented 
that our sustainability efforts 
are important to the majority of 
our employees. climate change 
was assessed as the most 
important topic, followed by 
employee health and working 
conditions.
to ensure that the six focus are-
as in our sustainability strategy 
embrace our material impacts 
and risks, we in 2020 held 
workshops with key sustaina-
bility experts across the group. 
the workshops confirmed that 
sustainable finance stands out 
as the area of greatest signifi-
cance, from both a societal and 
business perspective. 
we are accelerating our efforts 
to understand and measure 
positive and negative impacts 
of our activities. in 2020, we 
joined the banking for impact 
working group, which works 
to develop a data-based and 
comparable method for meas-
uring and valuing the impact 
of banks’ activities. we also 
collaborate within the indus-
try via finance denmark on 
better understanding different 
stakeholder perspectives on 
sustainability issues in the 
danish society. this is in line 
with our commitment to prb, 
see p. 36.
we present and report on our 
material sustainability issues 
within the six strategic focus 
areas. actual and potential 
impact on human rights and 
labour rights are an integral 
part of several of these issues. 
likewise, covid-19 risks and 
responses affect numerous 
issues and reinforce the impor-
tance of sustainability as we 
look to support our customers 
and society in ‘building back 
better’.

it is key for us that our stakeholders provide us with input about what 
they expect from us and what we should do better. partnerships with 
our stakeholders are also an important lever to success because we 
recognise that collaboration is needed to solve global and complex 
challenges. 
in 2020, we updated our stakeholder policy and specified the princi-
ples for engaging with each of our stakeholder groups to support our 
ongoing stakeholder dialogues. our interactions with stakeholders 
are guided by cross-cutting principles that include collaborating, with 
the objective of reaching shared goals for the benefit of our custom-
ers and society; always seeking to engage in an honest dialogue; and 
making our knowledge and expertise available to our stakeholders.
compliance remediation related to the estonia case, closure of 
the flexinvest fri case and the danish debt collection case, see 
p. 24, have been topics in many of our stakeholder dialogues in 
2020. this naturally also influences how we engage in dialogue on 
sustainability issues. we remain humble to the task ahead of us in 
restoring the trust of our customers and of society. 
danske bank is a registrant to the online european transparency 
register, to which we provide information on our lobbying efforts, 
including our fields of interest and membership of industry asso-
ciations. as a registrant, we have also signed the transparency 
register code of conduct.

sustainable finance
in future, robust and relevant 
sustainable finance offerings 
will constitute a bank’s licence 
to operate – particularly in 
the nordic countries, where 
sustainability standards are 
relatively advanced. 
in 2020, danske bank ranked 
as the number one nordic 
arranger in bloomberg’s 2020 
global league tables for 
bookrunners for both sustain-
able bonds and green bonds. 
also, 82 of our funds and 
sub-funds were awarded the 
acknowledged european sus-
tainable finance label luxflag 
esg in 2020, thereby position-
ing danske invest as the fund 
manager in europe that has the 
most funds with this certifica-
tion. our score from the cdp 
climate change 2020 ques-
tionnaire, which is aligned with 
the tcfd, increased from c to 
b. however, achieving a leading 
position in the nordic countries 
requires persistency, proactive 
engagement and a strategic 
approach to the regulatory 
agenda. we will further develop 
our position across customer 
segments and sectors and will 
use the power of finance to 
create immediate and long-term 
sustainable progress. 
in 2019, we introduced volume 
targets for sustainable finance 
towards 2023. because market 
conditions were more favour-
able in 2020 than expected, 
we have already met our group

bank’s ambition is to take a leading position in the nordic countries when it comes to sustainable finance. 
volume target on sustainable 
financing, and we are close to 
reaching our target for invest-
ing in the green transition. 
consequently, we will update 
our ambitions for our volume 
targets in 2021 while aligning 
our definitions with the incom-
ing eu taxonomy on climate 
change mitigation and adapta-
tion. we will also continue our 
work to align our corporate loan 
portfolio and danica pension’s 
investment portfolio with the ob-
jectives of the paris agreement 
on climate change. 
market development
the financial sector is increas-
ingly taking a central role in the 
sustainability transition by facili-
tating sustainable financing and 
investing, and banks currently 
face a number of significant 
market developments that bring 
new risks and opportunities.
firstly, nordic customers are 
relatively advanced in their 
sustainability considerations, 
and they expect their bank to 
be able to support sustainable 
development across segments. 
secondly, the speed of the 
climate transformation has a 
disruptive effect on sectors and 
companies, rapidly creating new 
winners and losers. this offers 
opportunities for the financing 
of high performers and those 
that want to transition, but it 
also carries the risk of stranded 
assets for those who do not. 
thirdly, competition is strong as 
our competitors are also actively 
targeting the field of sustainable 
finance. lastly, the eu is rolling 
out ambitious regulations in 
its action plan on sustainable 
finance, which will have a 
profound impact on our sector. 
in addition to these develop-
ments, voluntary initiatives that 
aim to advance the financial 
sector’s integration of esg fac-
tors and drive transparency are 
also gaining increasing support. 
such initiatives include pri, 
prb and tcfd – all of which 
we support, see pp. 36-39. 
we are also an active member 
of the taskforce on nature-re-
lated financial disclosures 
(tnfd) informal working group, 
which has started to scope the 
mandate and governance of the 
formal tnfd.
beyond climate 
to classify sustainable 
economic activities, the eu 
taxonomy is introducing 
screening criteria for climate 
change mitigation and 
adaptation activities. although 
this is an important first step, 
danske bank fully supports 
the intension to expand the 
taxonomy and to include broader 
definitions of esg factors. 
this is in line with the societal 
trend to go beyond climate and 
consider other environmental 
challenges, such as threats to 
biodiversity and natural habitats, 
while also increasing emphasis 
on reducing inequality and 
“the eu action plan on sustainable finance aims at channelling financial 
flows towards paris-aligned activities. danske bank takes on this responsibility 
by ensuring competitive and robust sustainability offerings that support a 
net zero carbon economy by 2050. we are committed to helping our customers 
in this transformation.”
berit behring, member of the executive leadership team, head of wealth management 
and interim head of corporates & institutions.

ensuring a just transition to a 
low-carbon future. 
although it is too early to draw 
decisive conclusions, the 
coronavirus pandemic seems to 
have reinforced and accelerated 
focus on social factors, in 
particular unemployment 
and related socio-economic 
challenges. this is reflected in 
the increased focus on social 
bonds and investments, see p. 
16 and p. 18, as well as in a 
raised awareness on employee 
well-being – not least at danske 
bank, see p. 32. 
nevertheless, we expect 
climate change to remain a 
dominant theme that challenges 
people, business and societies 
to act differently as we all look 
to ‘build back better’. green 
loans, green bonds and green 
investments, which represent 
our key contribution to sdg 
13: climate action, currently 
dominate our sustainable 
finance portfolio. as we move 
integrating sustainability 
into everything we do is key 
to our way of working with 
sustainable finance at danske 
bank. our approach is to use 
our financial expertise as the 
starting point and to develop 
the sustainability competences 
in our financial teams. by 
developing our financial teams’ 
sustainability capabilities and 
by equipping them with esg 
data, we aim to deliver best-
in-class sustainable finance 
advice. this also means that 
the responsibility for developing 
sustainable finance solutions 
lies with the respective business 
units, where knowledge of 
customers and stakeholders 
is strongest. to ensure that 
we work in an effective and 
consistent manner, a group-wide 
sustainable finance framework 
has been developed. launched 
in december 2020, the 
framework provides guidance 
on the implementation of our 
sustainable finance ambition 
and targets, and it also identifies 
key focus areas for execution 
and potential synergies. 
the framework includes a 
set of guiding principles for 
the entire group. inspired by 
and aligned with the prb, 
in support of regulatory incentives 
danske bank engages actively in developing the regulatory 
framework for sustainable finance through our industry 
association memberships, and we fully support the 
recommendations of the danish government’s climate 
partnership on finance and the intention and ambitions of 
the eu action plan on sustainable finance. this action plan 
further consolidates the agenda and introduces regulatory 
group-wide sustainable finance framework
forward, we will use mapping 
of our negative and positive 
impacts to develop our insights 
and to increase our contribution 
to society. we also work to 
reduce our own environmental 
footprint, see p. 35.
these guidelines will help 
safeguard our sustainability 
ambitions and commitments 
while developing commercial 
approaches. how we work with 
governance, transparency, 
training and data is key to 
supporting our development 
and our customers’ 
sustainability journey. 
in 2021, we will introduce a 
sustainable finance policy, 
which will be anchored in the 
prb. our position statements 
will also be reviewed in order 
to ensure that they remain 
relevant in a market where 
new issues emerge as society 
is transitioning. our current 
position statements cover 
agriculture, arms and defence, 
climate change, forestry, 
fossil fuels, human rights, 
and mining and metals.
incentives for financial institutions to channel more capital 
towards projects that have a clearly defined environmental 
and/or social benefit. increased requirements for esg 
integration and disclosures will also help address challenges 
and dillemas related to lack of both data and standards for 
measuring performance and risks.

sustainable finance
sustainable finance
sustainable financing is the 
provision of loans and bonds for 
projects and activities that have 
a clearly defined environmental 
or social benefit. at danske 
bank, we issue our own green 
bonds to finance our green len-
ding activities, and we arrange 
sustainable bonds for our custo-
mers to support the financing of 
their own sustainable transition. 
our green bond framework, 
launched in 2019, defines the 
loans or investments eligible to 
be funded by the proceeds of 
green bonds issued by dan-
ske bank. in march 2020, we 
published our first green bond 
impact report, which highlighted 
the fact that our two inaugural 
green bonds have provided dkk 
7 billion in green loans to our 
corporate customers, resulting in 
532,039 tonnes of avoided co2 
emissions. 
in 2020, the continued growth 
and interest in green loans 
combined with interest in ar-
ranged sustainable bonds for 
customers resulted in a total of 
dkk 102 billion in sustainable 
financing being provided by the 
group.
in 2020, we granted green 
loans to customers across the 
nordic countries to cover clean 
transportation, renewable ener-
gy, green and energy-efficient 
buildings, and sustainable fore-
stry. in denmark, we introduced 
the first green building loan for 
public housing by granting a loan 
of approximately dkk 500 milli-
on to boligselskabet sydfyn. 
danske bank was also one of 
the banks behind the financing 
of swedish company northvolt’s 
usd 1.6 billion project to build 
the largest battery manufactur-
ing facility in europe – a facility 
that will support electrification 
and a carbon-neutral transporta-
tion and energy sector. further-
more, danske bank provided 
green loans amounting to dkk 
1,635 million for the financing 
of wind farms in bolivia and 
ethiopia in cooperation with da-
nida sustainable infrastructure 
finance (dsif).
esg risk assessments 
when we grant a loan to a 
customer, we enter into a long-
term commitment. we carefully 
assess the financial situation 
of our customers to ensure we 
offer loans that are suited to the 
customer’s needs and financial 
capacity. we also take into con-
sideration the purpose for which 
the funds will be used and work 
to integrate esg considerations 
into our risk management frame-
work, see p. 26. 
at individual business cus-
tomer level, we perform esg 
risk assessment of regulatory 
compliance, track record, esg 
commitment, and of the busi-
ness’s efforts to mitigate any 
issues. the esg risk analysis 
is an integrated part of the 
credit analysis, and we aim to 
assess whether the customers’ 
esg approach is aligned with 
danske bank values and with 
how current or potential risks 
could affect danske bank and 
customers’ conduct, repayment 
ability and reputation. certain 
industries face more esg risks 
than others, and in line with 
danske bank’s position state-
ments, we treat these industries 
with a risk-based approach. this 
means that these industries are 
subject to higher expectations 
in terms of their management 
and mitigation of risks than low 
risk industries are. in line with 
the principle of three lines of 
defence, we train and supply 
all relevant personnel with 
knowledge, tools and govern-
ance understanding to ensure 
awareness of our esg risk 
policies and to help, in particular, 
first-line relationship managers 
and second-line credit officers to 
comply with these. 
in 2020, we developed a new 
digital solution for esg risk 
assessment, thereby making 
the process smoother and 
enabling better monitoring and 
reporting at both customer level 
and portfolio level. we launched 
the solution in the autumn of 
2020 to the larger customer 
segments, and we expect to 
expand the solution to other cus-
tomer segments in 2021. esg 
risk analysis is also performed 
at portfolio level, where we also 
conduct climate scenario analy-
sis in line with the tcfd, see pp. 
37-39.

global sustainable bonds issued 
in 2019 by 51%. and as a likely 
result of the coronavirus pande-
mic, the volume of social bonds 
issued increased significantly, 
accounting for almost a quarter 
of the total sustainable bond 
market. in the nordic countri-
es, the volumes of sustainable 
bonds issued also grew and pro-
vided opportunities for attrac-
ting new investors, creating hig-
her demand, ensuring enhanced 
visibility, and improving investor 
dialogue. the swedish krona 
remains the main currency for 
sustainable bond issuance in 
the nordic countries, and it is 
the third most-used currency 
for green bonds globally. our 
ranking as number one among 
nordic banks in bloomberg’s 
2020 global league tables for 
bookrunners on sustainable and 
green bonds underscores our 
contribution to supporting the 
market.
we began 2020 by structuring 
the first ever green bond fra-
mework for a seafood business 
– mowi asa, a norwegian pro-
ducer of farmed salmon – and 
we acted as joint bookrunner for 
the business’s inaugural eur 
200 million green bond issue. 
following this, we acted as 
bookrunner in connection with 
a number of other key bond is-
sues: the kingdom of sweden’s 
inaugural sek 20 billion green 
bond issue, the dutch public 
sector bank nwb’s eur 2 billi-
on social bond issue to finance 
affordable housing, and the 
nordic investment bank (nib) 
sek 1.5 billion nordic-baltic 
blue bond issue within water 
resource management and pro-
tection. we ended the year by 
acting as joint bookrunner and 
green structuring adviser on the 
swedish residential property 
company heimstaden bostad’s 
inaugural sek 1.2 billion green 
bond issue.
sustainability-linked loans 
for the financing of activities 
that cannot be classified as 
green or sustainable, we offer 
sustainability-linked loans. 
interest in this type of loan, for 
which the terms of financing are 
linked to material esg-related 
performance criteria, continued 
to increase throughout 2020. 
danske bank’s facilitation of 
a nok 1.5 billion sustainabili-
ty-linked revolving credit facility 
for bane nor eiendom – a 
norwegian property manager 
and developer – is one example 
of a sustainability-linked loan. 
the margin that applies to the 
facility is linked to the ability of 
bane nor eiendom to meet 
specific sustainability certifica-
tions for the eligible real estate 
projects and its ability to meet 
annual reductions in energy 
consumption across its building 
portfolio. 
responsible shipping 
to support the transformation of 
the international shipping sector 
and help finance its decarbon-
isation, danske bank is both a 
member of the getting to zero 
coalition and one of the found-
ing signatories of the poseidon 
principles (pp), launched in 
2019. and as one of 18 inter-
national shipping banks, danske 
bank has begun to assess and 
disclose the climate alignment 
of our shipping portfolios. 
our target is to have a portfolio 
in line with, or lower than, the 
pp trajectory, which is at least a 
50% total reduction in ghg by 
2050 from 2008 levels, as set 
by the international maritime 
organization. in december 
2020, the first report published 
showed that in 2019 our portfo-
lio alignment score was 11.9% 
higher than target, and we will 
engage in dialogue with our 
customers to drive progress. 
danske bank also supports 
the responsible ship recycling 
standards, and in 2020 we 
inserted separate clauses on 
responsible recycling in 94% of 
all new loan agreements for the 
sector. our target for 2021 is 
100%.
promoting a green fleet 
a greener company vehicle 
fleet offers the potential to 
reduce co2 and to contribute to 
national climate targets, such 
as denmark’s target for a 70% 
reduction in ghg emissions 
from 1990 levels by 2030. 
in denmark, the average com-
pany car annually emits around 
five tonnes of co2, which is 
around 30% of the average 
citizen’s total annual emissions. 
greenfleet70 is a concept 
that has been introduced to 
help danish companies reduce 
emissions from road transport. 
in addition to offering an exten-
sive selection of electric vehicle 
models, the concept provides 
a number of tools, including an 
advanced fleet planner. part-
nerships with electric mobility 
providers is also an important 
part of greenfleet70, which 
nordania leasing introduced 
in april 2020. in total, 14% 
of all new car orders in 2020 
were electric or plug-in hybrid 
vehicles, against only 3% of all 
new car orders in 2019.
paris-aligned loan book
in line with our ambition to lower our financed 
greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, danske 
bank in 2020 committed to setting a climate 
target by 2023 for our corporate loan 
portfolio in alignment with the climate goals 
of the paris agreement on climate change. 
to guide our work in this area, we joined the 
partnership for carbon accounting financials 
(pcaf), an industry-led partnership that aims to develop 
and implement a harmonised approach, based on the 
ghg protocol, to measuring and disclosing 
ghg emissions associated with loans 
and investments. we also contributed 
to finance denmark’s financial sector 
guidelines for co2 disclosures, which 
links to our support for standardised 
sustainability disclosures and tcfd.
in 2020, we mapped 100% of the ghg emissions 
associated with the group’s utilities lending 
book, and we gained valuable insights into the 
power-generation technologies applied across 
our customer base. our mapping is now 
being extended to other sectors, with 
priority being focused on the emissions-
intensive industries where our 
engagement can have the most positive 
impact. we will regularly disclose the 
outcomes of our analysis, and we aim 
to cover a major share of the corporate 
lending portfolio by 2022.
2023-onwards 
set target(s) and take actions
we will use our target(s) to steer 
actions and annually disclose 
progress. we aim to incorporate 
climate considerations into the 
existing framework for balance 
sheet allocation and include 
these as a natural step in the 
development of customer 
relationships. 
develop target/s and 
implementation strategy
we will apply the findings of 
the portfolio mapping to set a 
baseline for the climate target for 
our corporate loan portfolio based 
on best practice that currently 
points to setting sectoral targets 
and implementation strategies.

sustainable finance
responsible investing is a cornerstone of our fiduciary duty to 
protect and grow our customers’ investments, and it supports our 
ambition to create value for society.
we continued to integrate esg factors into our investment 
processes, products and advisory services throughout 2020. our 
esg integration council ensures the integration of esg into the 
investment decisions across wealth management, including danica 
pension. across all fronts, we also strengthened our disclosures 
and our efforts in relation to active ownership, screenings and 
restrictions. esg is integrated so that it fits the unique features 
and characteristics of each of our investment strategies and asset 
classes. our portfolio managers integrate esg into their investment 
processes, and they identify material financial and esg factors to 
assess the potential impact of these on performance when they 
make investment decisions. and to improve our processes and 
assist our investment teams in their everyday work, we develop 
tools and training programmes on an ongoing basis. 
platform for esg integration 
• mdash, our proprietary analytical tool that helps to 
identify and evaluate material esg issues likely to impact 
a business’s financial performance.
• esg data platform that sources high-quality esg data 
from multiple suppliers, thereby helping to integrate esg 
and enable better-informed investment decisions. 
• educational programmes to build skills in including 
sustainability in investment processes and in advising 
customers about sustainability matters.
• on-site esg analysts and specialists across the 
nordic countries to help deploy robust esg integration 
processes locally. 
active ownership
by exercising active ownership, 
danske bank seeks to effective-
ly manage risks and oppor-
tunities, maximise returns, 
positively influence businesses, 
and create value for customers 
and society. when sustainabil-
ity issues of concern arise, our 
approach is to actively engage 
with businesses instead of 
refraining from investing and 
leaving the problem for some-
one else to deal with. 
our portfolio managers regularly 
engage with businesses to 
address material esg issues 
that affect the businesses’ 
financial performance. the 
top three esg topics in 2020 
were greenhouse gas (ghg) 
emissions, employee health and 
safety, and energy efficiency. 
coronavirus pandemic-related 
issues were of course also 
on the agenda in 2020, and 
activities carried out by our 
portfolio managers in relation 
to these included assessing 
business model resilience; 
discussing potential behavioural 
changes, including shifts 
in demand for e-commerce 
and payment services; and 
addressing social well-being as 
a means to protect employees, 
the business and society. 
to extend our voting activity 
at the annual general meet-
ings of portfolio companies, 
we strengthened our voting 
infrastructure in 2020. our 
aim is to exercise our voting 
rights for all the shares we 
hold, albeit taking into account 
preconditions, resources and 
the cost of exercising voting 
rights. we also developed 
voting guidelines to enable us 
to vote on passively managed 
assets. these guidelines cover 
a range of topics, ranging from 
board compensation and capital 
structure to biodiversity, water 
scarcity and anti-corruption. as 
a result, we voted at more than 
5,200 company meetings in 
2020 against 406 in 2019.
we disclose data on our en-
gagement and voting activities 
twice a year in our active own-
ership report. and in 2020, 
to increase transparency and 
enhance the relatability of data, 
we published active owner-
ship stories about selected 
engagements, the handling of 
dilemmas and the expected 
outcomes of these. 
restrictions
in 2020, we enhanced the 
process for applying norms-
based investment restrictions 
covering all danske invest funds 
and danica pension’s invest-
ment activities. the enhanced 
process enables us to better 
meet customer demand and 
invest in line with customers’ 
values. we restrict businesses 
that are involved in esg-relat-
ed controversies, practices or 
other activities considered un-
acceptable by nordic societies. 
this includes businesses that 
contribute to climate change, 
loss of biodiversity and weak 
labour standards. as a result  
of our norms-based investment 
restrictions, more than 150 
companies were restricted in 
2020, and these are on our 
publicly available investment 
restriction list.
product innovations 
the eu’s incoming sustainable 
finance disclosure regula-
tion (sfdr) sets out reporting 
requirements that aim to create 
transparency for customers on 
the actual sustainability charac-
teristics of investment prod-
ucts. the sfdr imposes new 
obligations for transparency on 
how specific financial products 
promote environmental and/or 
social characteristics and how 
products target sustainable 
investment objectives. 
in 2020, we started the pro-
cess of adjusting and enhancing 
a wide range of our investment 
products to ensure compliance 
with the sfdr. from january 
2021, we will discontinue using 
current sustainability labels, 
such as our esg inside inte-
grated, restricted and thematic 
labels for investment funds, and 
these will be replaced with a 
labelling system compliant with 
the sfdr. 
for our funds, we prepared a 
set of sustainability one-pagers 
that include details of carbon 
footprint, investment restric-
tions and third-party esg 
ratings of the individual fund. 
and as we move ahead, we will 
further strengthen the visibility 
of esg characteristics across 
our product range in order to 
meet the sustainability prefer-
ences of our customers. 
our two new investment and 
pension solutions, global 
sustainable future and danica 
balance sustainable choice, 
both introduced in 2020, also 
cater for the increasing demand 
for investment products that 
meet specific requirements. 
these two solutions enable 
customers to invest in a green 
and sustainable transition in 
support of the sdgs. through 
new product innovations, 
we will continue to develop 
our sustainable investment 
offerings, and we plan to 
introduce a 2023 sustainability 
target for danske bank asset 
management in 2021.

large-scale co2 emitters 
as well as encouraging 
businesses to act on climate 
change, we also participate 
in investor coalitions such as 
climate action 100+, which we 
joined in 2019. this coalition 
specifically targets 100 of the 
most systemically important 
ghg emitters, which together 
account for two-thirds of annual 
global industrial emissions. 
we engage with businesses to 
curb co2 emissions, improve 
governance and strengthen 
climate-related financial 
disclosures.
in 2020, we voted at 
annual general meetings of 
businesses such as duke 
energy, exxonmobil, chevron, 
ford, general motors, delta 
airlines and united airlines. 
we voted in favour of aligning 
lobbying activities with the 
climate targets of the paris 
agreement on climate change 
and for increased disclosures 
on climate and energy-related 
lobbying activities. 
another way to address 
unacceptable business 
developments is to apply 
climate-related investment 
restrictions, as is the case 
for tc energy corporation, 
for example. this energy 
infrastructure company is 
constructing a pipeline to 
connect the canadian tar sands 
production area to the usa for 
the purpose of delivering crude 
oil, and the pipeline forms part 
of the oil industry’s pursuit to 
triple tar sands production by 
2030. because the tar sands 
pipeline conflicts with the 
paris agreement, tc energy 
corporation is now on our 
investment restriction list. 
in 2019, danica pension communicated our green investment pledge of dkk 100 billion by 2030. in 
2020, danica pension increased its investments in the green transition by 164% – from dkk 10.3 
billion to dkk 27.2 billion. the current volume of investments means that danica pension is close to 
reaching its initial 2023 milestone of dkk 30 billion, and we will review our investment milestones in 
2021. 
in 2020, we joined the global un-convened net-zero asset owner alliance and committed to make 
danica pension’s investment portfolio carbon neutral by 2050. we are further developing a 2025 
milestone for co2 reductions in our investments. launched in 2020, danica pension’s first carbon 
footprint report shows that equity and corporate bond investments made by danica pension in 2019 
emitted 33 tonnes of co2 per dkk million invested. this is 21% lower than a global benchmark 
covering scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. also, a first scenario analysis of the expected short- and long-
term emissions from portfolios indicated that 80% of equity investments are paris-aligned towards 
2030, whereas 55% are aligned towards 2050. this indicates the need for businesses to commit to 
more ambitious co2 reduction targets.

all businesses today need to 
conduct their operations in an 
increasingly sustainable way. 
many entrepreneurs view global 
sustainability challenges as 
business opportunities and 
will create innovative solutions 
in which growth and positive 
impact go hand in hand.
however, many start-ups fail to 
develop into viable businesses 
despite the significant poten-
tial they possess. supporting 
growth companies is part of 
danske bank’s core business, 
and since 2015 we have been 
working with start-ups and 
scale-ups across the nordic 
countries in a more structured 
way with an ambition to help 
them grow their business and 
increase their positive impact at 
the same time. we understand 
what businesses need at each 
of the different phases of their 
lifecycles, and we can support 
them with relevant financial and 
non-financial solutions. since 
early 2016, we have supported 
5,065 start-ups and scale-ups 
with growth and impact tools, 
services and expertise.
the successful businesses of 
the future will be found among 
the entrepreneurs of today. 
they are using tech and risk 
capital to achieve growth and 
innovation, and they are able 
to rapidly scale up their global 
presence. for danske bank, this 
represents opportunities 
for establishing relationships 
with high-growth business cus-
tomers, extending our insights 
into new technologies and busi-
ness models, and tapping into 
new top line and profit pools. 
this also allows us to provide 
alternative investment oppor-
tunities for private banking 
customers and enable business 
customers to access to new 
technologies. nordic societies 
will benefit from growth in jobs 
and productivity, and nordic 
companies will be able to face 
the strong competition from 
competitor companies in asia 
and the usa.
the hub – a cornerstone for 
start-ups
recruitment and access to capi-
tal have proven to be the main 
scalability challenges for growth 
companies. a key initiative in 
addressing these challenges is 
the hub, danske bank’s free, 
digital community platform. 
today, the hub is the nordic 
region’s largest job portal for 
start-ups – not only helping 
start-ups to recruit talent but 
also helping applicants to find 
the right job. through the hub, 
start-ups can create a profile to 
increase their visibility among 
investors and promote their va-
cant positions and work culture 
to job seekers. since its launch 
in december 2015, more than 
500,000 job applications have 
been submitted to the hub, and 
more than 28,000 job vacan-
cies have been posted. 
covid-19 briefings at the hub
in 2020, danske bank focused 
a great deal on helping start-ups 
to get through the challenging 
situation caused by covid-19. 
however, our experience shows 
that start-ups, in general, have 
fared well during the situation 
thanks to the agile and oppor-
tunistic mindset prevalent in 
this customer segment. some 
start-ups have found new oppor-
tunities thanks to their digital 
business models and their 
ability to quickly adapt their 
products or services to the new 
situation.
in march, danske bank con-
ducted a survey at the hub to 
identify the most pressing is-
sues facing start-ups as a result 
of the pandemic, and we creat-
ed a series of webinars at the 
hub on relevant topics, which 
were held from late march to 
july. at these events, advisers 
from danske bank and other 
experts provided inspiration and 
suggested approaches on how 
to navigate in the short-term to 
stay in business while protect-
ing opportunities for long-term 
growth. the 15 events attracted 
around 800 attendees.
angel investor training and 
pitch events 
in order to help start-ups gain 
access to risk capital, danske 
bank offers wealthy private 
banking customers training 
in making informed decisions 
about angel investing. the train-
ing covers topics such as risk 
handling, defining an investor 
profile, building and managing a 
portfolio, due diligence and valu-
ation, active ownership and exit 
strategies, and impact invest-
ment. upon completion of their 
training, the angel investors are 
introduced at a pitch event to 
early-stage start-ups looking for 
funding.
the programme was launched 
in finland in 2019 under the 
name hub invest and was 
repeated in 2020 with 47 par-
ticipants. a similar programme, 
named angel investor acade-
my, was launched in sweden 
and denmark in 2020, attract-
ing 15 and 24 participants 
respectively. new angel investor 
training and pitch events are 
planned to be held in denmark 
and norway in early 2021.
return on diversity
women entrepreneurs in 
denmark are much less likely to 
attract investment and on aver-
age attract smaller investments 
than their male peers. this is 
not merely a societal problem. 
because there is a risk of losing 
out on talent, innovation, job 
creation and economic growth, 
it also represents a lost potential 
for start-ups and investors alike. 
furthermore, an overwhelming 
start-ups and scale-ups
danske bank supports the growth of new businesses that can drive innovation and job creation, 
thereby contributing to the overall well-being and sustainable development of society.

majority of research indicates 
a positive correlation between 
diversity and performance and 
return on investment.
to address the gender imbal-
ance in the danish start-up 
ecosystem, danske bank in 
2020 sponsored the return on 
diversity guide. developed by 
bootstrapping, female found-
ers of the future, nextwork 
and the danish ict industry 
association, this guide provides 
new tools for founders, inves-
tors and those who organise 
investments. 
supporting impact start-ups
at danske bank, we believe that 
the nordic region can become a 
centre for start-ups that make a 
positive social and environmen-
tal impact by addressing one or 
more of the sdgs. to make this 
a reality, we must help impact 
start-ups build the right capabil-
ities among founding teams and 
connect with new investment 
and ecosystem partners.
to gain a deeper understanding 
of the challenges, danske bank 
conducts an annual analysis, 
insights from which are shared 
in our state of nordic impact 
start-ups report. the 2020 
report concluded that the nor-
dic countries boast a growing 
number of impact start-ups that 
are maturing to a point where 
they are beginning to resemble 
regular growth-stage start-ups. 
as well as showing that the ma-
jority of the start-ups are based 
on potentially scalable business 
models that have the potential 
to work on regular early stage 
investment terms, the analysis 
also shows that nearly half of 
the founders have significant 
entrepreneurial experience. 
accelerator programme
in 2020, we ran danske bank’s 
fourth accelerator programme 
that helps early-stage nordic im-
pact start-ups to fine-tune their 
business models and prepares 
them for the next stages of 
growth. the programme is all-ex-
penses-paid and offers mentor-
ing, training and networking. this 
year’s programme took place in 
stockholm and was arranged in 
partnership with wework labs, 
rise and ignite sweden. all 11 
participating start-ups focused 
on developing solutions revolving 
around the circular economy, 
and the programme included 
sessions with large corpora-
tions such as coop, h&m, hiliti, 
husqvarna and electrolux to pro-
vide inspiration and explore op-
portunities for collaboration. at 
the end of the programme, the 
start-ups pitched their business 
ideas in front of more than 100 
participants and potential inves-
tors at a demo day. since the 
launch of the first programme in 
2018, a total of 29 starts-ups 
have graduated.

new home of impact and innovations
nordic and european starts-ups are more impact-focus-
sed than their global peers. in 2019, impact investing 
accounted for over 30% of nordic and 15% of total 
european venture capital (vc) investment, whereas the 
global average was 7%. 
the figures are published on a new global data platform 
created by dealroom, impactcity, tech nation and danske 
bank in 2020. the platform provides global intelligen-
ce and trusted insights about start-ups and scale-ups, 
innovations, investment, investors and other key players 
across ecosystems. 
+impact by danske bank is a knowledge partner and has 
contributed with information on 1,000+ impact start-ups 
in the nordic countries. by sharing our data, we hope 
to increase transparency and awareness of the nordic 
impact scene.

develop diverse
develop diverse is one of the successful start-ups on our +impact platform. develop 
diverse has developed a software platform that analyses language in companies’ 
communication channels to detect gender, age and ethnicity biases. the platform also 
proposes more inclusive alternatives, thereby helping companies to foster more diverse 
and inclusive workplaces. in 2020, danske bank tested the platform and now uses it 
to ensure more inclusive job postings and career-related content on social media and 
danskebank.com, all of which helps us to reach a wider and more diverse talent pool.
“it is an important signal to investors and other companies that a large player like danske 
bank believes in us and is using our product to foster inclusion and diversity.”

despite the many strengths of 
the nordic welfare model, per-
sonal finances are still a source 
of worry for many. learning and 
developing sound money habits 
early in life is an essential foun-
dation for financial confidence, 
but as money is becoming  
invisible and spending is 
becoming digital, many parents 
find it hard to make the value 
of money tangible and under-
standable for their children. this 
is why we need new insights 
into money habits in a digital 
society and new ways of talking 
about ‘invisible money’ with our 
children. 
at danske bank, our ambition is 
to help our customers and soci-
ety as a whole achieve greater 
financial confidence – with a 
particular focus on helping 
children and young people get 
off to a good start. since early 
2018, we have supported more 
than one million children, young 
people and parents with finan-
cial literacy tools and expertise. 
and to reach our 2023 target, 
we will scale up our initiatives 
and evolve our financial literacy 
programmes to reflect develop-
ments in society and technology.
we will also provide insights 
about how to foster good money 
habits among children and 
young people as an integral ele-
ment in our dialogue with cus-
tomers. this will strengthen our 
advisory capabilities and can in 
the long-term help danske bank 
to reduce risk and build future 
customer relationships.
covid-19 affects financial 
confidence
danske bank’s annual survey 
of financial confidence among 
people in denmark shows 
that the coronavirus crisis 
has made people in denmark, 
young people in particular, more 
worried about their personal 
finances, and around a quarter 
of 18 to 34 year olds fear that 
the coronavirus situation will 
make it harder for them to find 
a new job.
an evidence-based approach 
to financial capabilities 
to gain more knowledge of 
what drives good money habits, 
we developed the children’s 
financial capability framework 
in 2020 to provide an evidence-
based approach for teaching 
good money habits to children 
and young people. based on 
this framework, we conducted 
a survey of the current state 
of financial capability in the 
nordic countries, and the 
results provide a baseline for 
measuring the impact of our 
programmes in terms of  
behavioural changes. 
the results of the survey point 
to four key elements for building 
financial capability.
firstly, practice makes perfect. 
knowing how to make a budget 
and plan for the future does not 
necessarily mean that children 
and young people will actually 
do these things when they 
become adults. to develop their 
financial mindset and skills, 
they need to practice making 
financial decisions themselves. 
secondly, good financial capabil-
ity starts early. when children 
reach the age of three or four 
years, parents should give them 
access to their own money. 
the survey shows that children 
and young people who receive 
regular pocket money and have 
a bank account that they fre-
quently use are more financially 
capable.
the third element is under-
standing the role of money 
in society. information and 
knowledge alone are not enough 
to build financial capability. 
children and young people who 
talk with their parents about 
general money topics are more 
financially capable than those 
who do not.
finally, parental behaviour is 
essential. parents are usually 
financial capability at a young age
at danske bank, we want to contribute to people’s financial confidence by helping the next generation 
to develop sound money habits and progress all the way to a financially secure adulthood.

good at saying the right things, 
but children in particular learn 
through observation and imita-
tion – not by listening. letting 
children see how money
matters are handled with the
bank or see other types of finan-
cial decision builds financial
capability.
pengeskyen and peng’ pong
in march 2020, we launched 
a new online universe, penge-
skyen (the money cloud), in 
denmark. on this site, parents 
can find tips, inspiration and 
advice from experts on how to 
foster good money habits in 
children, such as understand-
ing what money is, savings, 
expenditure and digital money. 
pengeskyen kicked off with a 
campaign that reached 72% 
of our target group on social 
media alone, and our campaign 
evaluation showed that the site 
was well received by 96% of 
the parents using the site. 
we have continued the develop-
ment of new teaching material 
for primary school pupils in 
partnership with the danish 
students’ organisation. based 
on everyday experiences and 
through exercises and reflec-
tion, the material helps develop 
the pupils’ financial skills and 
knowledge. the material has 
been tested in five schools, and 
the first module was launched 
on the pengpong.dk website in 
november 2020. the material 
is freely available for all teach-
ers and can be combined with 
a guest lecture from one of our 
employees. 
our financial literacy pro-
grammes pocket money 
day and pengekøbing were 
launched in denmark in 
2019 and were planned to be 
introduced in the other nordic 
countries in 2020. unfortunate-
ly, the coronavirus pandemic 
meant that we were unable to 
invite children and their parents 
to such events, but we hope to 
roll out programmes in 2021.

offers the first free teaching 
material on financial literacy 
for secondary schools, created 
in alignment with the finnish 
school curriculum. in the pro-
gramme, the students examine 
their own attitudes, practice 
decision-making and accumu-
late knowledge and skills in 
economics. as part of the pro-
gramme, danske bank advisers 
gave a presentation, held online 
due to covid-19, at two school 
events.
in 2020, danske bank advisers 
also attended five workshops 
organised in collaboration 
with the children and youth 
foundation in finland and held 
at vocational schools. at these 
workshops, the youngsters cre-
ated digital stories about how 
money affects their everyday 
life and future, and our advisers 
shared their own experiences 
with personal finances.
blogs on financial wellbeing
in 2020, danske bank in 
northern ireland developed 
and launched a new blog for 
personal customers that helps 
and encourages them to start 
talking about money. the blog 
will explore a wide range of 
topics – from savings, fraud and 
money and mental health to 
money management, including 
tips on money management 
for young people who have 
moved away from home and are 
financially independent for the 
first time. customers will also 
be asked what money topics 
they themselves would like to 
talk about.

the coronavirus crisis has 
affected a large number of 
danske bank’s customers, 
many of whom have required 
help within a very short period of 
time. across our core markets, 
we offered an extended level of 
help and flexibility to customers, 
and we set up a dedicated 
unit to provide urgent help to 
customers who had been hit 
hard financially, for example 
customers who temporarily lost 
their jobs or whose businesses 
experienced drastic decreases 
in sales. since the start of the 
pandemic, danske bank has 
been in contact with thousands 
of customers through online 
meetings, by phone and via 
other digital communication 
channels, and we have helped 
9 out of 10 customers who 
requested our assistance. 
our offers included wider ac-
cess to overdrafts, payment in 
instalments, increases of facili-
ties and extension of terms. we 
also suspended the charging of 
negative interest rates for the 
rest of 2020 for up to 90,000 
small businesses in denmark 
that have deposits of less than 
dkk 500,000. 
among personal customers, 
there was a particular need for 
deferred payments, and among 
business customers, credit 
cases doubled. across the 
danske bank group, we made 
dkk 100 billion in new corona-
virus-related credit available to 
business and large corporate 
and institutional customers, 
while we also helped customers 
raise new funding in the debt 
capital markets.
business customers asked us to 
provide a range of advisory ser-
vices, including assisting them in 
making a plan for their business 
and ensuring the right decisions 
were made earlier rather than 
later; helping customers to make 
use of public support schemes; 
advising about currency or inter-
est rate hedging for customers 
with, for example, market shares 
in norway or sweden, where the 
currencies have depreciated.
we have been proactive in 
contacting all private banking 
customers to inform them of the 
developments in the financial 
markets and to give them our 
assessment of the situation and 
provide general recommenda-
tions.
in denmark, danica pension 
opened a hotline for all custom-
ers who have health insurance 
coverage. through the hotline, 
customers who felt that the 
coronavirus pandemic was 
affecting their mental well-being 
were able to talk to a psycholo-
gist. 
customer engagement
in 2020, danske bank’s customer engagement focused primarily on helping individuals and 
businesses affected by the coronavirus crisis and on compliance remediation.

ambition
2020 performance
“we need to help customers affected by the coronavirus crisis in a responsible
way – whilst still upholding responsible debt levels and compliance requirements. 
we achieve this by ensuring that critical functions remain in place and that 
processes to extend liquidity are as flexible as possible in the situation.”
glenn söderholm, 
member of the executive leadership team and head of banking nordic, interim head of banking dk
remediation efforts
in recent years, we have identi-
fied a number of legacy issues 
in connection with which 
danske bank has failed to act 
in our customers’ best inter-
ests. several of these cases 
have been revealed through our 
ongoing efforts to improve our 
compliance, risk and control 
capabilities and processes; 
others have been revealed 
through internal warnings. a 
case in point is the issue con-
cerning data errors in our debt 
collection system in denmark, 
which led us to overcollect 
debt from customers despite 
warnings from employees and 
business partners who raised 
the issue internally. the issue 
has subjected danske bank to 
public criticism, and we deeply 
regret that employees were not 
heard when they voiced their 
concerns. 
we cannot undo past mistakes, 
and we cannot guarantee that 
new mistakes will not occur, but 
we can and will ensure that all 
the issues that may arise are 
dealt with as quickly as possible 
and that we will make things 
right for our customers. to this 
end, we have established a new 
remediation office to oversee 
the remediation of identified 
legacy issues and to ensure 
consistent, decisive and proac-
tive handling of all issues. with 
direct reference to the executive 
leadership team, the remedi-
ation office will ensure a fully 
transparent approach along with

timely communication to cus-
tomers and other stakeholders.
as planned, by the end of 2020 
we had completed our internal 
investigation into the non-resi-
dent portfolio at the now-closed 
estonian branch regarding 
alleged violation of the rules on 
prevention of money launder-
ing. we continue to be in close 
dialogue with authorities in 
denmark, the usa, estonia and 
france; however, the timing and 
outcome of these dialogues 
remain uncertain. 
in 2020, we continued the 
process of closing down the 
flexinvest fri case, and we 
paid a total of dkk 310 million 
in compensation to almost 
87,000 customers who invest-
ed in the flexinvest fri product 
during a certain period and paid 
fees that were too high. 
statements of inspections from 
the danish financial superviso-
ry authority (the danish fsa) 
are available on our website, 
and we are committed to contin-
uing our close and construc-
tive dialogue with all relevant 
authorities and with customers 
and all other stakeholders. 
customer satisfaction
despite a year of challenges 
for danske bank, our customer 
satisfaction levels are progress-
ing on the right path, although 
we are not yet meeting our 
objective.
our better bank customer 
ambition for 2023 is that we 
rank, on average, among the top 
two for customer satisfaction 
in everything we do. through 
our better ways of working 
initiative, we aim to improve 
the customer experience and 
respond faster to changing 
customers’ demands.
danske bank has a legal obliga-
tion to ensure that our advisers 
act in the best interests of our 
customers, and retail advisers 
do not receive sales-related bo-
nuses as a matter of principle. 
our advisers receive continuous 
training in how to offer the most 
suitable products and advice. 
we send questionnaires to our 
customers to get their input 
on how we can improve the 
customer experience, and we 
encourage customers who are 
not satisfied with our services 
to contact us with a view to 
settling the matter. it is also 
possible for customers to file a 
complaint online.
district – cutting complexity
in addition to the changing 
market conditions caused 
by the corona pandemic, our 
business customers face 
intensified regulatory demands 
and a heightened risk of fraud. 
to meet digital needs of these 
customers and to help them cut 
through complexity, we in 2020 
launched our digital financial 
platform, district. with district, 
we introduce new and simplified 
navigation that combines safe-
guarding customer data with a 
good customer experience. the 
platform allows our customers 
to service themselves and 
optimise their daily work, while 
allowing us to provide them with 
even better support. district 
also enables customers to eas-
ily see accounts across banks 
and offers an easy integration 
of data and solutions from other 
banks and partners. over time, 
more solutions and features will 
be added – including solutions 
from new partners – to give our 
customers a platform that en-
ables them to connect and act 
on their financial data.
strong data ethics
we work diligently to ensure 
that data protection, privacy and 
integrity are taken into consid-
eration at every step when we 
process personal data. in 2020, 
our dedication to upholding 
strong data ethics led to a 
variety of changes in the way 
we work and how we document 
our work. 
requirements of the eu general 
data protection regulation 
(gdpr) form part of our man-
datory compliance training, 
see p. 27, and in 2020 around 
500 employees who are 
particularly exposed to gdpr 
received additional training. our 
customers are also becoming 
increasingly aware of their 
gdpr data subject rights, and 
we provided more than 5,000 
customer data insight reports 
in 2020. we also enhanced 
internal procedures, such as 
our physical archiving process, 
to ensure that we do not store 
personal data any longer than 
is absolutely necessary, and 
by doing so we updated the 
retention rules for more than 
12 million physical documents 
stored centrally. we have, how-
ever, identified that some per-
sonal data has been stored for 
a longer time than necessary. 
this should of course not have 
happened, and we are working 
to solve these issues.
supporting customers’ green 
transition
for many of our customers, the 
green transition is high on the 
agenda, and we want to support 
them in making sustainable 
choices. in february 2020, 
danske bank and realkredit 
danmark introduced improved 
loan terms for energy improve-
ments for personal customers 
in denmark who want to reduce 
energy consumption in their 
homes. to help the customers 
assess the potential for energy 
saving in their homes, we also 
partnered with a consulting 
engineering company to provide 
this service. in december 
2020, we announced a new car 
loan for electric cars. this loan 
has a 0% interest rate for a pe-
riod of six months and reduced 
establishment costs. read 
more about our sustainable 
finance offerings on pp. 14-19.

a strong compliance culture 
empowers all employees to 
take positive steps to ensure 
the group adheres to applicable 
laws, rules and regulations. this 
is achieved by setting a clear 
tone from the top; reinforcing 
individual accountability and 
risk-awareness through appro-
priate policies and training; and 
supporting open communica-
tion through accessible tools, 
behavioural standards and 
reward structures. as regu-
latory requirements continue 
to evolve, we will also continue 
to invest in developing our risk 
management framework and 
capabilities to ensure that any 
new expectations remain firmly 
embedded in our daily activities.
our code of conduct policy 
is the overarching document 
reflecting the purpose and 
values of danske bank and 
our expectations as to how all 
employees conduct themselves 
in their activities on behalf of 
the bank. the code identifies 
the principles we seek to uphold 
and the associated areas that 
underpin wider rules and stand-
ards across policies, processes 
and risk management.
danske bank applies an enter-
prise risk management (erm) 
framework that sets common 
standards for risk management 
across all risk types. to ensure 
appropriate oversight and 
accountability, the framework 
specifies how risk governance 
and risk responsibilities are 
structured. our risk manage-
ment practices are organised in 
accordance with the principles of 
the three-lines-of-defence model. 
the first line of defence consists 
of our frontline and direct 
support functions that own the 
risks and are responsible for 
their operational management 
across national borders, which 
includes designing, implement-
ing and operating effective 
controls.
the second line of defence 
consists of group risk manage-
ment and group compliance. 
they set the standards, policies 
and methods under which the 
first line of defence operates, 
and they are responsible for the 
risk and compliance oversight. 
the chief risk officer and the 
chief compliance officer are 
both members of our executive 
leadership team and may also 
contact the board of directors 
directly.
the third line of defence is 
group internal audit (gia)  
– an independent and objective 
function that evaluates and 
improves the effectiveness of 
our risk management, control 
and governance processes. the 
head of gia reports directly to 
the board of directors.
more broadly, we have an esca-
lation policy that helps our em-
ployees to recognise potentially 
significant issues and concerns 
and which sets out the expecta-
tions we have of employees to 
raise issues of concern to the 
right level in the organisation. 
in 2020, we updated the policy 
to give additional clarity to all 
individuals within the group on 
the relevant triggers and esca-
lation paths, thereby enabling 
us to respond faster and more 
effectively.
whistleblowing scheme
we make an effort to promote 
a healthy and safe culture in 
which employees feel they can 
share their concerns with their 
colleagues, managers or hr. 
however, employees can also 
report concerns about irregula-
rities or wrongdoings anony-
mously through our whistle-
blowing scheme. all reports are 
investigated and treated in the 
strictest confidence, and our 
whistleblowing policy provides 
assurance that employees can 
raise concerns without fear of 
reprisals or inappropriate reac-
tions, also if they turn out to be 
mistaken. the whistleblowing 
scheme also applies to external 
stakeholders and can be ac-
cessed via the whistleblowing 
policy, which was made public 
in december 2020.
in 2020, we redesigned the 
whistleblowing reporting site, 
making it more inviting and 
user-friendly and to give employ-
ees a strong sense of trust and 
security, and we further devel-
oped our training on whistle-
blowing. we also implemented 
a whistle blowing handling 
instruction, which clearly out-
lines handling procedures for 
received whistleblowing reports. 
the number of whistleblowing 
reports increased by more than 
50% from 2019 to 2020.
tax transparency
at danske bank, we have a 
firm position on tax compliance, 
as set out in our tax policy. 
we seek transparency and a 
proactive, open and cooperative 
relationship with the tax authori-
ties, and we are committed to 
disclosing our tax payments in 
accordance with national and 
international requirements and 
in line with good practice among 
our peers. 
should it come to our attention 
that any of our customers or 
business partners are engaging 
in tax fraud or tax evasion, we 
cooperate with the relevant 
authorities in accordance with 
applicable rules and regulations 
and in line with our core values. 
we do not participate in any 
abusive tax arrangements. our 
employee training on financial 
crime prevention includes 
understanding tax affairs at 
customer level and detecting 
tax evasion.
compliance culture
danske bank strives to build and maintain a strong culture that embeds compliance into everything 
we do and sets the foundation and expectations for individual behaviour across our group.
sdg contribution 
we work to reduce corruption 
and bribery in all forms, in 
support of sdg 16.5.

and passed risk and compliance 
training.

anti-corruption and bribery
mitigating the risks associated 
with corruption and bribery 
is part of our compliance 
infrastructure. we operate in 
accordance with the following 
five principles: (i) not to accept 
or solicit bribes in any form; (ii) 
not to make or accept facilita-
tion payments; (iii) not to offer, 
promise or give a financial
or other advantage; (iv) to only 
accept gifts given or received 
in specific situations; and (v) 
to avoid any conflict between 
our personal interests and the 
interests of the group.
our stance on corruption and
bribery is expressed in our code
of conduct policy and in our 
recently launched anti-bribery  
and corruption policy. this 
latter policy will in 2021 be 
complemented by a separate 
instruction that includes a set of 
criteria for sponsorship agree-
ments. this will also improve 
our assessment of anti-corrup-
tion risks and controls across 
the group. 
in 2020, we updated our gifts 
and hospitality instruction and 
broadened the scope, criteria 
and principles for providing 
and receiving gifts and hospi-
tality. the updated instruction 
includes new thresholds and 
a process for pre-approval 
and registration of gifts and 
hospitality. 
mandatory training
all employees must complete 
annual training that includes 
courses covering risk and 
compliance issues related to 
our policies and applicable regu-
lation. all new employees of the 
danske bank group must com-
plete all courses within their 
first 14 days of employment. 
the training provides knowledge 
that empowers employees to do 
the right thing for our custom-
ers, for our colleagues and for 
society. the courses follow a 
learning path that helps employ-
ees to complete the training in 
an order that ensures the best 
possible learning experience 
and the embedding of knowl-
edge. 
we are continuously improving 
the courses, and in 2020 we 
made a notable update of the 
course on fighting financial 
crime by broadening the scope 
from anti-money laundering 
to also include other financial 
crime risks, such as fraud, tax 
evasion, bribery and corruption.

danske bank has continued 
to make substantial invest-
ments to enhance our financial 
crime-prevention procedures, 
systems and competences. in 
2020, we made solid trans-
formational progress on our 
continuous path to strengthen 
our defences. 
those who attempt to misuse 
the financial system con tinue 
to evolve their methods and are 
becoming more sophisticated 
and cunning – financial crime 
related to covid-19 is testimony 
to that. consequently, fighting fi-
nancial crime remains at the top 
of danske bank’s agenda and is 
one of the strategic focus areas 
in our better bank plan. 
advanced technologies
in 2020, we continued to invest 
heavily in optimising and auto-
mating the processes, systems 
and tools that underpin our 
financial crime prevention ef-
forts. this work included further 
integration and consolidation of 
our it systems to strengthen 
our controls and make process-
es smoother and simpler for our 
customers. 
we also increased the speed of 
our customer ongoing due dili-
gence (odd) processes across 
the nordic countries through 
new automated processes, and 
we implemented new digital 
ways to collect customer infor-
mation used in the due diligence 
processes and other financial 
crime controls. examples 
include new digital platforms 
to gather know your customer 
(kyc) information and using 
our customers’ preferred digital 
communication channels, such 
as danske mobile banking and 
danske ebanking, to obtain 
additional kyc data. 
monitoring and screening of 
customers and transactions is 
a vital part of our financial crime 
defence, and these underwent 
considerable technological 
upgrades in 2020. today, 
customer screening and trans-
action screening have been 
significantly enhanced. we 
have expanded our automated 
surveillance of transactions by 
using technology to optimise 
the process and target relevant 
risk. also, new data analytics 
and visualisation systems have 
been implemented, and these 
have enhanced the coverage 
of our investigations and the 
speed in which our investiga-
tors are able to identify potential 
financial crime risks. 
strong governance and 
capabilities
although technology is impera-
tive in our fight against financial 
crime, it can only take us some 
of the way. ultimately, it is our 
people who make the difference. 
in 2020, we increased the num-
ber of capable hands working 
to prevent financial crime, and 
we hired a large number of em-
ployees who possess specialist 
expertise and international 
experience to fill key positions. 
we continued to train custom-
er-facing staff to ensure the right 
skill set and knowhow, and we 
updated our mandatory elearn-
ing on fighting financial crime for 
all employees across the group, 
see p. 27.
in 2020, a strong governance 
structure to support our trans-
formation efforts was put into 
place. this includes a compre-
hensive group-wide plan that 
outlines clear divisions of roles 
and responsibilities and serves 
as a detailed road map for our 
financial crime transformation, 
which both ensures interna-
tional best practice and meets 
our regulatory requirements in 
all the jurisdictions we operate 
in. we continue to share our 
progress with regulators on 
an ongoing basis to increase 
transparency. 
our work also included signifi-
cant development of our policies 
to ensure our requirements are 
more precisely arti culated and 
designed, decreasing unnces-
sary complexity and ensuring 
greater standardisation across 
business units. for example, 
we updated our policy on 
anti-money laundering (aml), 
counter-terrorist financing (ctf) 
and sanctions. this policy sets 
out our principles and standards 
for the management of risk and 
compliance, and it determines 
the objectives of our financial 
crime prevention framework 
that extends across our entire 
customer base.
financial crime prevention
fighting financial crime remains at the top of danske bank’s agenda and we continue to 
strengthen our defence systems, processes and capabilities.
“the threat of financial crime is a challenge for all financial institutions. given 
the global nature of financial crime and the cunning behaviour of criminals, it 
requires a joint approach within the financial sector and between the sector and 
authorities to properly make the financial system safe and resilient.”

partnering for change 
over the past years, we have
actively engaged in domestic
and cross-border initiatives. by 
doing so, we have been able 
to share insights and exper-
tise and develop solutions to 
strengthen and secure our 
collective defence systems in 
close collaboration with supervi-
sory authorities and other large 
banks across the nordic coun-
tries and in the rest of europe.
an example is our engagement 
in the public-private partnership, 
swedish anti money launder-
ing initiative (samlit) – a pilot 
project that tests new methods 
for sharing information between 
banks and authorities under 
current legislation and identifies 
changes needed to enhance our 
effectiveness in future financial 
crime prevention. 
we also participate in a similar 
public-private partnership 
between nordic banks and the 
financial intelligence unit (fiu) 
in finland. in this partnership, 
we focus on exchanging infor-
mation on current and emerging 
crime phenomena related to 
money laundering and terrorist 
financing and the risks of these, 
in adherence with the danish 
anti-money laundering act.
through our industry associ-
ation, finance denmark, we 
take part in a permanent aml 
working group, and in 2019 we 
participated in the aml task 
force. this task force present-
ed 25 proposals for aml and 
counter-terrorist financing 
measures – measures we carry 
out in continuous cooperation 
with the sector and authorities. 
a tangible outcome from this 
is our new fighting financial 
crime webpage, which aims 
to increase transparency for 
our customers, investors and 
society by showing how danske 
bank works to combat financial 
crime. 
furthermore, we contribute to 
the development of more effi-
cient aml and counter-terrorist 
financing legislation through 
our nordic and european trade 
associations, and in august 
2020 we provided input to 
the european commission’s 
aml action plan via its public 
consultation. 
the monetary losses from payment fraud, 
such as investment scams, romance scams, 
cryptocurrency scams and id theft, can 
amount to millions for business customers and 
to hundreds of thousands for personal custo-
mers. fraudsters are continually broadening 
and honing their techniques, and in 2020 the 
number of attacks on our customers increased 
20% from 2019 levels.
in 2020, we also saw the emergence of 
covid-19-related scams: primarily phishing, 
which in some cases imitated local healthcare 
authorities. we allocated additional resources 
to enable us to monitor the changing threat 
landscape and raise awareness amongs custo-
mers and employees of new attack scenarios 
on a weekly basis, which enabled us to quickly 
respond to covid-19 fraud threats. also, our 
customers proved to be alert to these scams, 
resulting in a relatively low number of these 
fraud cases.
creating awareness about cyber security, both 
within and outside the bank, remains a priority. 
as part of this, we conduct an annual hacking 
event at which employees are exposed to a 
range of security challenges and are trained in 
preventive measures. at least once a month, 
we engage with business customers to raise 
their awareness of the most common fraud 
trends, and through our keep it safe platform 
we provide tools for businesses and for per-
sonal customers that enable them to protect 
themselves against cyber criminals. we also 
collaborate with the danish consumer council 
on their free digital self-defence app, mit 
digitale forsvar, which provides advice on how 
to avoid becoming a victim of fraud and what 
to do if this happens. to date, the app has been 
downloaded by more than 150,000 people, 
and in 2020 we provided an emergency alert 
on the app about vulnerabilities in a particular 
internet browser – an alert that was viewed by 
11,500 users. to raise public awareness of 
fraud threats, we also share our expertise with 
the media and through webinars. in 2020, our 
content on social media was viewed by more 
than 40,000 users. 
danske bank shares best practice on the 
latest fraud intelligence, and we collaborate 
with external cyber security organisations to 
help strengthen cyber resilience within the 
nordic countries. these organisations include 
the danish centre for cyber security, the 
danish national center of it-related economic 
crime (lcik), and the nordic financial cert, 
which plays a lead role in the joint effort to fight 
cybercrime. we also share our insights about 
topics such as cyber security, hacking and 
password security with universities and the 
financial community at various industry events 
and seminars.

in 2020, a total of 9,090 
suppliers delivered products or 
services across the group, and 
group procurement collaborat-
ed with locations, departments 
and business units on 2,092 
new contracts.
responsible sourcing and 
collaboration with our suppliers 
forms part of our value-chain 
approach to embedding esg 
considerations throughout our 
business. by doing so, we can 
minimise potential adverse soci-
etal effects and support positive 
societal change. our responsi-
ble sourcing process ensures 
that all suppliers comply with 
the sustainability standards 
set out in our supplier code of 
conduct and with additional 
specific environmental require-
ments for selected products 
and services. this code is based 
on international sustainability 
principles, including the un 
global compact and the un 
guiding principles on business 
and human rights. we expect 
our suppliers to set similar 
sustainability standards for their 
supply chains.
the responsible sourcing pro-
cess is part of our supplier due 
diligence programme alongside 
other supplier assessments, 
such as it security, financial 
assessment and gdpr. in 
2021, we will implement a new 
third party risk management 
(tprm) framework that will also 
include responsible sourcing.
environmental awareness
danske bank only uses con-
ference venues that meet our 
environmental requirements. 
in 2020, each meeting venue 
listed in our conference booking 
tool, meeting manager, has 
also been given an eco score to 
enable employees to take the 
environment into consideration 
when they select a meeting 
venue. our online travel booking 
tool now displays information 
about co2 emissions for each 
flight, and we are also develop-
ing our own eco score for hotels 
to raise employee awareness of 
the environmental implications 
of their choices.
new invoicing platform
danske bank launched a new 
procurement and invoicing 
platform called ivalua in novem-
ber 2020. not only does this 
platform improve our own pro-
curement procedures, invoice 
processing and collaboration 
with suppliers, but it also bene-
fits our suppliers by delivering 
shorter processing time and 
better communication with 
danske bank regarding source 
to pay.
responsible sourcing
danske bank promotes responsible business conduct throughout our supply chain, and responsible 
sourcing is an important part of our supplier due diligence programme.
independent audits
a handful of suppliers are 
selected each year by danske 
bank for independent third-par-
ty audits. the twin aim of these 
audits is to evaluate whether or 
not the suppliers live up to our 
supplier code of conduct and 
to identify areas where we may 
help the suppliers improve their 
esg performance. suppliers are 
selected on the basis of their 
risk profile, how they affect our 
business and their score in the 
self-assessment questionnaire.
in 2020, we audited two sup-
pliers at the construction site of 
the new danske bank head-
quarters in copenhagen to gain 
insight into working conditions 
and sub-contracting practices. 
in addition, we audited a danish 
real estate administrator and an 
archiving supplier in sweden. 
none of these audits revealed 
any severe non-compliance is-
sues, and the audit reports have 
provided valuable insights into 
the performance and maturity 
level of the suppliers.
our risk assessment has three main steps
our ongoing target is to have 
a minimum of 80% of tenders 
through the responsible sourcing 
process. this applies to supplier 
contracts above dkk 1 million 
that are handled through group 
procurement.
ambition
2020 performance
96% of tenders through the 
responsible sourcing process. 
we encourage our partners and

practices, in support of sdg 12.6.
sdg contribution 
1: pre-qualification questions
the risk profile of suppliers is pre-
assessed based on the contract 
spend, their geographical location 
and the category of their product or 
service.
2: self-assessment questionnaire
high-risk suppliers and suppliers 
of contracts exceeding dkk 10 
million complete an additional 
in-depth questionnaire about their 
esg policies and performance. their 
replies are evaluated by our external 
partners.
3: corrective action plan
if the self-assessment questionnaire 
reveals unsatisfactory issues, we 
engage in dialogue with the supplier
and agree on a corrective action 
plan. if the issues are not resolved to 
our satisfaction, we may terminate 
the business relationship.

diversity and inclusion are high 
on the agenda at danske bank, 
and in 2020 we strengthened 
this further by establishing 
a diversity & inclusion (d&i) 
council and by making our 
mission clear. when people feel 
that they belong, they are com-
fortable expressing themselves 
openly, freely and in their own 
voice – and they feel empowered 
to make a difference. we believe 
that a diverse and inclusive cul-
ture unleashes the full potential 
of our employees and makes us 
a better bank for all our stake-
holders.
to progress our work, we 
updated our d&i policy, hired 
d&i experts and appointed 18 
d&i leads. in 2020, we also 
set targets and launched new 
initiatives on inclusion, equal 
opportunities and on creating an 
attractive workplace.
gender diversity 
in 2019, we set a target of in-
creasing the share of women in 
senior leadership positions from 
27% in 2019 to 35% in 2023. 
we are still at 28% and aim to 
increase this through a number 
of measures, including target-
ed recruitment where there is 
always at least one woman in 
the final field of candidates for 
leadership positions and on the 
hiring committee. 
we have equal gender distribu-
tion across our workforce but 
not across our management 
levels, which is why we since 
2018 have been working 
towards three 2020 targets to 
increase the share of women 
across danske bank’s manage-
ment levels.
although progress has been 
made, the three targets are not 
fully met, and we will prolong 
current targets until 2023. of 
the 13 members of the board of 
directors, nine are elected at the 
annual general meeting (agm), 
and with three women in this 
group, the share of women in 
2020 was 33% against a target 
of 38%. when we include our 
four employee-elected mem-
bers, of whom three are women, 
the total share of women on 
the board of directors is 46%. 
the target for our executive 
leadership team is 25%, and 
despite changes to the team in 
2020, the current figure stands 
at 13%. the share of women in 
management positions in 2020 
remained stable at 37% against 
a target of 38-40%. 
a new screening tool, develop 
diverse, see p. 21, was 
introduced in 2020 in our 
recruitment process to help 
ensure inclusive job postings 
and career-related content, 
and a performance tool for the 
year-end process was rolled 
out to ensure focus on potential 
manager bias when evaluating 
employee teams. we also 
launched a d&i educational 
programme for managers 
that strengthens inclusive 
leadership by developing the 
competencies managers need 
to enable them to unlock the 
full potential of their employees. 
the programme, which will be 
rolled out across the group 
in 2021, builds on unesco-
diversity and inclusion 
at danske bank, we aim to build a diverse and inclusive culture that mirrors the 
societies we are part of and to create equal opportunities for our employees.

inclusive workplace
again in 2020, we sponsored 
copenhagen pride week, 
during which employees and 
family members participated 
in different activities under 
the slogan free to be me. in 
conjunction, we launched a set 
of principles in the group that 
ensure equal rights to parental 
leave for all employees in non-
traditional families, irrespective 
of the gender identity or sexual 
orientation of the employee 
or the employee’s biological 
relation to a child.
in 2020, we also joined the 
stonewall global diversity 
champion programme to further 
strengthen our work on becom-
ing a more inclusive workplace 
for lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (lgbt+) people. 
stonewall is europe’s largest 
lgbt+ organisation, and the 
group’s decision to join the 
programme was inspired by the 
membership of danske bank 
in northern ireland. another 
aspect of inclusivity addressed 
by northern ireland involves 
shaping the agenda to recruit, 
retain and retrain people at 
work whatever age and stage 
of their career. in 2020, a re-
sulting age-inclusive action plan 
involved around 100 employ-
ees in seven online mid-career 
review sessions on careers and 
financial well-being. 
through the stonewall global diversity champion programme, danske bank’s hr 
function and our employee-led rainbow networks have access to best-practice 
tools such as support, webinars and guides to increase our knowledge about lgbt+ 
topics and to ensure that our policies are fully inclusive.

employee well-being & diversity
in 2020, the coronavirus pan-
demic drastically changed our 
ways of working. the pandemic 
affected our daily operations 
because most of our employ-
ees were advised to work 
from home, which required a 
tremendous team effort. also, 
our execution of our better bank 
plan with increased focus on 
cost and more effective ways 
of working led to layoffs. both 
conditions had a negative effect 
on employee engagement, and 
reversing this trend is a strong 
ambition for us.
as announced in october 
2020, we expect to discontinue 
up to 1,600 positions across 
the group within six to twelve 
months’ time. part of the re-
duction is achieved through the 
260 voluntary resignations in 
november, the discontinuation 
of positions, natural attrition 
and by maintaining our hiring 
freeze to reduce the number 
of layoffs. also in november 
2020, a total of 257 employ-
ees in denmark and in other 
countries were laid off. we are 
carefully evaluating across units 
and markets where and how fu-
ture layoffs will be effected, and 
the situation is being handled in 
close dialogue with the unions. 
employee engagement 
our employee engagement 
index decreased by two points 
over the past year, ending 2020 
at 84%. to aid teams in improv-
ing the employee experience, 
we will be introducing several 
initiatives, including a new 
engagement survey.
providing opportunities for our 
employees to develop their 
competencies and build their 
career is also a key focus when 
it comes to becoming a more 
engaging workplace. in 2020, 
around 2,300 managers and 
employees tested our grow 
universe tool that supports the 
embodiment of our employees’ 
development journey. the tool 
was found to be valuable by 
80% of the test group, and it 
will be launched for all employ-
ees as part of our new perfor-
mance set-up in 2021. 
additionally, we will continue the 
work done in 2020 to ensure 
succesfull onboarding as part 
of our recruitment processes, 
and we will build on the valuable 
input provided by 43% of our 
employees who responded to 
a survey on shaping the future 
culture of danske bank. another 
way of supporting employee 
engagement is through our vol-
unteering initiative, see p. 34. 
flexible and virtual workplaces 
in 2020, approximately 90% of 
our employees across locations 
worked remotely. this was in 
line with national recommenda-
tions to mitigate the spread of 
the coronavirus and to safe-
guard the health and safety of 
our employees. 
the pandemic has stimulated 
more digital ways of working, 
and following the introduction of 
coronavirus restrictions in the 
spring, we conducted a survey 
on becoming a more flexible and 
virtual workplace. more than 
4,000 employees responded, 
and their message was clear: 
93% find it important to have 
the opportunity to work remote-
ly in future. working from home 
was also seen as an important 
measure for improving mental 
health because it increased 
engagement, made life less 
stressful and decreased com-
mon illnesses. on this basis, we 
in june introduced our working 
from home initiative, which 
allows employees across the 
group to work from home one 
to two days a week, subject to 
agreement with their manager. 
in addition, our new initiative 
working@danske aims to 
build a flexible working environ-
ment driven by a more virtual, 
collaborative culture across the 
group. this will be achieved by 
enabling big-scale flexibility for 
a stronger work-life balance, 
which in itself will be achieved 
by shaping our company for 
employee engagement 
at danske bank, we want to foster employee well-being and be a more engaging workplace through 
better ways of working and by ensuring a sense of belonging and equal opportunities for all our 
employees.
by 2023, at least 90% of our 
employees are engaged, as 
measured in our employee 
engagement index.

better ways of working 
one of the initiatives to help us become a more engaging workplace is better ways of 
working. through this initiative, we will foster new ways of collaborating by changing the 
way we are organised from being a traditional, hierarchical bank to becoming a modern 
organisation. by encouraging more collaborative relationships between departments and 
by reducing bureaucracy, we aim to become a better bank for our customers and our 
employees. our colleagues will move from specialist departments into cross-functional 
teams that work towards one common goal and which have the autonomy to decide how 
to deliver the best solutions for our customers. not only will this help us to become more 
efficient and speed up the digitalisation of customer journeys, but it will also empower our 
colleagues by making them responsible for deciding how we develop the best solutions.

“our employees have done a tremendous job in serving our customers

karsten breum, 
member of the executive leadership team and head of group hr
flexibility while remaining fully 
compliant with working envi-
ronment regulations. we are 
investing in technology to enable 
teams to engage and become 
more collaborative, effective and 
adaptable to the physical envi-
ronment they are in. we are also 
transforming our workspaces, 
and in 2020 we designed our 
new offices in india, denmark 
and lithuania to support differ-
ent activities and collaboration 
between employees and with 
customers – either physically or 
virtually.
mental health and well-being 
a high-paced work environment 
with frequent organisational 
changes can affect the mental 
and physical health of employ-
ees. in addition, coronavirus re-
strictions and uncertainty relat-
ed to the pandemic may further 
challenge employee well-being. 
because of this, mental health 
was a specific priority for our 
working-environment organi-
sation and councils throughout 
2020, and it was a key issue in 
our collaboration with unions, 
employee representatives and 
local management. employee 
well-being also includes promot-
ing good working habits when 
there are no longer physical 
boundaries between workplace 
and home. 
our expert team on mental 
health and well-being and our 
close to 500 mental health 
ambassadors played a vital 
role in promoting initiatives 
that build mental resilience and 
elevate the well-being of our 
employees. we introduced a 
new intranet site that provides 
inspiration, tools and training for 
management and employees on 
how to cope with change and 
uncertainties – in both a pro-
fessional and private context. 
examples include a podcast 
on how to spot stress when 
employees work remotely, and 
our engagement of managers 
and employees 
in training seminars on stress 
prevention throughout the year.
we also hosted webinars on 
mental resilience and healthy 
lifestyles in connection with 
world mental health day. 
do it right
in 2020, the #metoo move-
ment continued to stoke the 
public debate on how to behave 
respectfully in both a business 
and social context. this led us 
to reinforce our communication 
on our zero-tolerance position 
on sexual harassment and 
emphasise that we must all act 
in accordance with our commit-
ment to protect and respect all 
human rights, including labour 
rights. if employees experience 
inappropriate behaviour, we 
encourage them to contact hr 
legal, share their concerns on 
our doright intranet site or use 
our whistleblowing scheme, see 
p. 26.
our code of conduct policy and 
hr-related policies address 
human rights risks in the 
workplace and are supplement-
ed by internal human rights 
guidelines. we are continuously 
working to identify, assess 
and address potential and 
actual adverse human rights 
infringements. also, we actively 
promote a healthy and safe 
working environment, with the 
aim of eliminating discrimina-
tory treatment and protecting 
our employees’ right to freedom 
of association, collective bar-
gaining and privacy. 
equal opportunities 
we disclose our median em-
ployee gender pay ratio, which 
illustrates whether or not men 
and women are evenly distrib-
uted throughout compensation 
layers. our gender pay gap of 
19% reflects the fact that we 
have more women than men 
in lower paid jobs and more 
men than women in higher paid 
jobs. we aim to change this by 
promoting equal opportunities 
for leadership, and we recognise 
gender diversity as a driving 
force for other diversity aspects, 
see p. 31. we also monitor pay 
levels and conduct local equal 
pay and gender pay analyses, 
which we report annually to local 
authorities where we operate.

all danske bank employees 
are encouraged to take part in 
purposeful activities in their 
local communities though 
our corporate volunteering 
programme called time to 
give. this programme provides 
employees with the opportunity 
to spend one paid workday per 
year participating in volunteer 
work. 
whether employees want to 
volunteer on their own or with 
their team is entirely their own 
personal choice. similarly, 
employees can choose which 
cause they wish to support, or 
they can sign up for a project 
that is coordinated by danske 
bank. in several countries, 
danske bank has established 
partnerships with local ngos to 
collaborate on the development 
of the time to give projects. 
in 2020, more than 1,000 
employees across the group 
donated 6,588 hours and con-
tributed with competencies to 
the value of dkk 1,358,798.
assessment of impact
the time to give partner 
organisations benefit from the 
supply of highly motivated and 
devoted volunteers, who have 
generated substantial economic 
value and opened up a wealth 
of new possibilities. this is 
one of the conclusions in an 
impact assessment of time to 
give conducted by an external 
firm in 2020. the partner 
organisations interviewed 
stated that danske bank 
volunteers possess sought-
after and valuable skills, such 
as data-management skills, 
and can provide guidance 
about personal finances. 
time to give has also proven 
to be a recruitment channel 
that engages civil society in 
volunteer work.

denmark – dream days
at three dream day events, arranged as part of our partnership with the children’s aid foundation 
(børnehjælpsdagen), 151 employees spent 785 hours making dreams come true for children and young 
people living in care in denmark. the dreams were large and small and included everything from getting a 
harry potter book, a trampoline and a funfair season ticket to meeting an idol or having a book published. 
coronavirus restrictions meant that one of the events had to be held online, but this did not diminish 
either the dreams or the outcome. through the partnership, employees also offered mentorships and 
workshops about personal finances to socially disadvantaged young people.
india – care packages 
in india, 15 danske it employees and their families gathered at a virtual workshop during the lockdown to 
create care packages for covid-19 warriors in their neighbourhood. the packages contained handmade 
essentials such as breathable cloth masks, sanitisers and gloves, as well as treats such as chocolates. 
the packages were then handed over to health workers, services workers and municipal staff who work 
to fight covid-19 in high-risk situations with only rudimentary or no safety equipment.
norway - christmas help
danske bank in norway has a long-standing partnership with the church city mission (kirkens bymisjon), 
a non-profit organisation involved in social work. at christmas, 40 employees helped at sales stands at a 
christmas market, wrapped gifts to be given out at a christmas dinner, folded boxes for packaging glass 
angels made at workshops, and assisted at trondheim gingerbread city. furthermore, five employees 
arranged courses in personal finance for students at a church city mission café.
lithuania – helping hands for public health 
in lithuania, approximately 20 danske bank employees volunteered at the organisation sauliu sajunga, 
where they assisted at medical posts and helped the police monitor citizens’ compliance with coronavirus 
restrictions. furthermore, approximately 50 employees volunteered at the national public health centre 
by offering additional helping hands for collecting and documenting information about persons infected 
with covid-19 and their close contacts and providing them with further guidance.
northern ireland – inspiring young people
in northern ireland, colleagues volunteered their skills at the charitable organisation young enterprise and 
at local schools, where the volunteers taught young people about employability skills, such as interview 
skills, and provided information on career opportunities in banking. in all, 20 danske bank volunteers 
spent 108 hours on this activity in 2020. 
selected time to give activities 2020
show that 95% are satisfied 
with the volunteering experience 
and that time to give has a 
positive impact on danske bank 
– both as a business and as a 
workplace. for example, the 
programme enhances employee 
engagement, and 76% 
experience an increased sense 
of pride in working at danske 
bank. furthermore, 67% of 
the volunteers experience 
an increased sense of team 
spirit between themselves 
and their colleagues, which 
creates new possibilities for 
cooperation across the group. 
all these factors contribute to 
creating a better daily working 
environment and they enhance 
workplace happiness and job 
performance. and 34% of 
the volunteers surveyed feel 
inspired to do more volunteering 
in their spare time.
new initiatives in the face of 
covid-19
the coronavirus pandemic also 
affected time to give by forcing 
the cancellation of many activ-
ities. however, the pandemic 
also gave rise to creative digital 
solutions that made it possible 
for the voluntary work to be 
continued online. in compliance 
with coronavirus restrictions, 
we allowed employees to spend 
the day helping a neighbour, 
family member or local busi-
ness in need. in 2021, we will 
continue to support our part-
ners and will explore new oppor-
tunities for digital volunteering 
in light of covid-19.

even though danske bank’s 
biggest environmental impact 
by far occurs indirectly through 
our ba lance sheet, we must 
also work to reduce the impact 
from our business operations. 
our ambition is to minimise our 
environmental footprint with a 
focus on further reducing our 
own emissions of greenhouse 
gases. key initiatives towards 
our 2023 target include more 
digital meetings, energy-effi-
cient buildings, environmentally 
friendly company cars and a 
reduction in air travel. in 2020, 
our operations resulted in 7,871 
tonnes of co2 emissions, which 
is a 48% decrease from 2019. 
because this significant drop in 
co2 emissions is mainly a result 
of the corona pandemic, our cur-
rent 2023 target will be retained 
without change.
since 2009, danske bank 
has compensated for carbon 
emissions from its own opera-
tions, such as emissions from 
transport and heat consump-
tion, that cannot be eliminated 
through energy reduction 
initiatives. this compensation 
has been achieved through 
certified renewable electricity 
and verified carbon credits. all 
electricity used by danske bank 
comes from renewable sources 
certified by guarantees of origin 
and international renewable 
energy certificates, resulting 
in a renewable energy share of 
53% across scope 1 and 2, see 
p. 42. we only purchase carbon 
credits for projects verified 
according to international stand-
ards, such as the gold standard, 
guaranteeing a real reduction in 
co2 emissions. 
energy-efficient buildings
the energy consumption in our 
building portfolio accounts for 
about 40% of the group’s total 
co2 emissions. in 2020, our 
initiatives to increase energy 
efficiency focused on installing 
led lights and reducing co2 
emissions from heating. for 
example, in the pasila building 
in helsinki, finland, we changed 
the heating source from fossil fu-
els to renewable energy sources, 
resulting in an annual reduction 
of co2 emissions of 369 tonnes. 
in december 2020, the pasila 
building was certified with leed 
gold environmental certifica-
tion. led light installations at 
premises in denmark in 2020 
will account for a saving of over 
16 tonnes of co2 annually. in 
2020, our energy consumption 
was 4.53 mwh per employee 
(fte), which is a 13% reduction 
from 2019.
travel-related emissions
the coronavirus pandemic has 
pushed us to work even faster 
on finding new solutions for 
meeting and working remotely. in 
2020, our co2 emissions from 
air travel were 68% lower than 
in 2019, and we are determined 
to maintain lower levels of travel 
as we move out of the pandemic. 
several initiatives will help us 
reduce co2 emissions from 
travel, while also achieving cost 
savings. we have significantly 
reduced the budget for travel, 
and internal travel recommen-
dations about travelling by train 
rather than by air on specific 
routes have been introduced. 
furthermore, we will enhance 
travel reporting with co2 emis-
sion follow-up, and we will nudge 
our employees towards making 
green choices through new fea-
tures in our travel-booking tool.
in northern ireland, we have re-
vised our company car scheme. 
from 2021, employees can 
select from a range of hybrid 
and electric vehicles only, and 
from 2022, electric vehicles will 
be the sole option. 
making the most of our waste 
with more than 22,000 em-
ployees, danske bank produces 
a significant amount of waste 
every day. to increase our re-
cycling rate from 45% to 75%, 
we in 2020 replaced individual 
waste bins with new waste seg-
regation stations at all offices 
and locations in denmark, swe-
den and norway. our employees 
in finland and lithuania have 
been successfully segregating 
their waste for several years.
the waste segregation stations 
are designed to accommodate 
the typical types and amounts 
of waste found in an office area, 
such as coffee cups, napkins, 
banana peels or plastic cups. 
for other types of waste, such 
as cardboard, batteries, paper or 
printer cartridges, we have other 
recycling solutions available in 
our printing rooms.
environmental efforts
our efforts to minimise danske bank’s own environmental footprint focus on reducing 
the emissions of greenhouse gases from our premises, operations and travel.

eco-friendly payment cards
in 2020, we took steps to phase out existing payment cards and replace 
them with payment cards made from 86% recycled plastic. after a 
period of thorough testing, the first more eco-friendly payment cards are 
in production, and the first customers can expect to start using them in 
early 2021. each year, around six billion payment cards are produced 
worldwide, and this initiative makes danske bank one of the first banks 
in the world to issue payment cards made of recycled plastic.

principles for responsible banking 
performance overview & assurance
as a signatory bank to the principles for responsible banking (prb), we annually report on our progress in implementing the principles. 
the full version of our prb self-assessment is included in our sustainability fact book 2020.
principles
current status
principle 1: alignment
we will align our business strategy to be consistent with and 
contribute to individuals’ needs and society’s goals, as expressed 
in the sustainable development goals (sdgs), the paris climate 
agreement and relevant national and regional frameworks.
our updated 2023 group sustainability strategy integrates selected sdgs that target areas 
where we have significant impact. we will focus on integrating sustainability even further into 
our business model and into key business decision-making processes. we support the tcfd 
initiative, and we disclose climate change risks and opportunities. we have also committed to 
setting a climate-related target for our corporate lending portfolio in alignment with the paris 
agreement on climate change, and in 2020, danica pension joined the global un-convened 
net-zero asset owner alliance.
principle 2: impact & target setting
we will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing 
the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and 
environment resulting from our activities, products and services. 
to this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the 
most significant impacts.
as part of our strategic review, we have introduced ambitions for six sustainability areas. these 
ambitions are supported with kpis and smart targets and are aligned with selected sdgs. 
in order to further mature our understanding of our negative and positive impact, danske 
bank joined the banking for impact working group in 2020 (www.bankingforimpact.org). the 
goal of this working group is to scale up impact measurement within the banking sector to 
drive sustainable progress and enhance decision making. to achieve this, the working group 
aims to build on existing existing methodologies to develop a standardised and comparable 
methodology and data protocol for banks to measure and value their impacts.
during 2021, danske bank also aims to apply the developed method to our own operations so 
that we can make an initial assessment of our full societal impact. 
we will start reporting on our results from the impact analysis in 2021, and new targets will be 
adapted.
principle 3: clients & customers
we will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to 
encourage sustainable practices and enable economic activities 
that create shared prosperity for current and future generations.
in 2020, we continued to expand our sustainability-related product offering. we also 
accelerated our efforts on our financial confidence programmes for personal customers,  
and we help entrepreneurs grow through our +impact initiative.
we will focus on further developing our solutions and advisory services to ensure that we, as 
a financial adviser, can fully support our customers’ sustainability ambitions. this includes 
regular training programmes for our advisers in providing sustainable finance advice to our 
customers. 
principle 4: stakeholders
we will proactively and responsibly consult, engage and partner 
with relevant stakeholders to achieve society’s goals.
we annually assess the materiality of sustainability-related topics. the assessment includes 
engagement with stakeholders, as defined in our stakeholder policy.
in 2020, we joined a collaboration with finance denmark (fida) on better understanding 
different stakeholders’ perspectives on the current challenges in danish society.
we are also an active member of the partnership for carbon accounting financials (pcaf), 
the taskforce on nature-related financial disclosure’s (tnfd) informal working group, and we 
assisted fida in developing a methodology for calculating the indirect co2 footprint of financial 
institutions. furthermore, we are an active member of unep fi’s tcfd working group and the 
banking for impact working group.
principle 5: governance & culture
we will implement our commitment to these principles through 
effective governance and a culture of responsible banking
the board of directors and the business integrity committee develop and oversee the 
implementation of our sustainability strategy, which includes the prb. they also oversee 
related policies, targets and commitments. 
to foster a culture of responsible banking, all employees must annually complete mandatory 
training in risk and compliance.
the group-level performance kpis for 2020 for the executive leadership team and other 
senior management levels include three sustainability-related kpis.
principle 6: transparency & accountability
we will periodically review our individual and collective 
implementation of these principles and be transparent about 
and accountable for our positive and negative impacts and our 
contribution to society’s goals.
we report annually on progress with our sustainability strategy, including on the 
implementation of the prb, tcfd and the un principles for responsible investments (un pri).
in 2020, we revised our group sustainability strategy to further develop the areas where we 
create both societal value and business value while simultaneously meeting our stakeholders’ 
expectations. we also joined the pcaf to enable us to measure and disclose the greenhouse 
gas emissions from our lending and investing portfolios in a harmonised way.

task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures 
danske bank’s first publication aligned with the task force on cli-
mate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) was provided in danske 
bank’s sustainability report 2019. since then, we have taken 
tangible steps forward in how we assess and act on climate-related 
risks and opportunities. our tcfd execution relies on embedding 
climate considerations into our business units’ operations and on 
collaborating across our organisation to share and develop best 
practices. in addition, we will continue to improve our development 
of the tools, methods and practices that are required for full tcfd 
implementation. 
in 2020, embedding all the necessary climate data for sufficient 
climate risks and opportunity disclosures was a key focus area, and 
this will continue to be a priority in the coming years. to enhance 
our own and the financial industry’s expertise, danske bank active-
ly participates in industry-wide collaborations. we have played an 
active role in unep fi’s tcfd pilot phase ii, and we will continue 
to hone our climate-stress testing capabilities in phase iii in 2021. 
danske bank has also committed to financial industry initiatives 
that support society’s transition to net zero greenhouse gas (ghg) 
emissions and encourage improved climate disclosures, including 
the net-zero asset owner alliance and the partnership for carbon 
accounting financials (pcaf). during 2021, we look to disclose 
more quantitative information about the group’s climate-related 
risks and opportunities. 
1.a) board’s oversight
the board of directors (bod) 
exerts oversight over climate-re-
lated issues in a variety of 
manners – both as routinely 
scheduled items and when 
important matters arise. the 
group’s sustainability strategy 
is reviewed annually by the 
bod, which also approves new 
policies and the annual external 
reporting on sustainability, 
including climate. environment, 
social and governance (esg) 
considerations are also taken 
into account when the bod con-
siders the group’s sector risk 
and risk appetite. an example 
of this was when the bod in 
2020 reviewed danske bank’s 
approach to esg risk in oil and 
gas sector financing.
1.b) management’s role
the overall responsibility for 
danske bank’s 2023 group 
sustainability strategy, policies 
and related programmes, 
including climate-related issues, 
resides with the business in-
tegrity committee (bic), which 
includes all the members of our 
executive leadership team. 
among other duties, the bic is 
responsible for danske bank’s 
approach to climate-related 
products and the implementa-
tion of tcfd recommendations. 
in 2020, we set up our sus-
tainable finance council, which 
includes members from all 
business units and from group 
risk management and acts as 
a preparatory consulting body 
for the bic. the impacts of 
climate risks on credit risk are 
also discussed in our execu-
tive group all risk committee 
during sector reviews and risk 
appetite discussions. also, our 
esg integration council, which
consists of heads of different 
investments strategies, includ-
ing sustainable investments, 
ensures the integration of esg 
into the investment decisions 
across wealth management, 
including danica pension. 
climate considerations are also 
tied to management remuner-
ation because variable pay in 
danske bank includes three 
sustainability considerations, 
one of which is the carbon 
footprint of our own operations. 
towards 2023, we will further 
develop and integrate sustaina-
bility-related considerations into 
our performance management 
framework.
1.  governance 
climate change is an important 
strategic consideration for 
danske bank, and we anticipate 
that it will affect the bank’s 
business in the near, medium 
and long term. our business 
units have identified specific, 
high-level climate-related busi-
ness impacts and opportunities, 
summarised here. identifying 
climate risks and opportunities 
and assessing the likelihood 
and magnitude of the financial 
impacts from individual climate 
items represent a key part of 
our ongoing work. 
2.a) identified risks and 
opportunities
risks related to the transition 
to low-carbon societies can 
have an impact on many things, 
including the financial perfor-
mance of some of our custom-
ers and investments, and there 
are also implications for the 
future regulatory environment in 
connection with the implemen-
tation of the eu action plan on 
sustainable finance. in addition, 
future physical changes in the 
nordic climate, such as in-
creased average temperatures 
and increased frequency of 
heavy precipitation events, can 
increasingly affect the operating 
conditions of our bank, our cus-
tomers and our investments. 
at the same time, several 
opportunities are currently 
materialising in connection with 
society’s low-carbon transition. 
for example, customers are in-
creasingly requesting products 
that can benefit the climate 
agenda, and supporting compa-
nies and sectors that tackle the 
climate change challenge can 
bring us new business, enhance 
our investment performance 
and integrate us closer with the 
societies that we are part of. 
this is particularly true in the 
nordic region, where the major-
ity of danske bank’s stake-

climate-related risks can have 
an impact on danske bank 
through numerous channels, for 
example through the financial 
risks we take, including credit, 
market and liquidity risk as 
well as our non-financial risks. 
the table below provides 
an overview of the focus 
areas in climate-related risk 
management in 2020.
unit
3.a) 
process for identifying and assessing  
climate-related risks
3.b) & 3.c) 
process for managing climate-related risks and integrating 
this into our overall risk management processes
lending 
we have prioritised the high-climate-risk 
sectors by using a climate risk heat map to 
qualitatively assess which of our portfolios will 
be most exposed to physical and transition 
risks given our nordic footprint. for these high-
risk industries, in particular, we include climate 
scenario analysis in our industry reviews to 
assess possible credit risk effects. 
our position statements outline our credit policy for 
industries that have elevated esg risks. we implement 
position statements through the esg screening of all 
corporate lending. we have integrated esg, including 
climate, assessment into our standard credit process for 
our large corporate customers, and we provide staff training 
about the financial effects of climate change. also, we take 
climate risks into consideration as a part of the industry 
reviews that are a central risk-management tool within 
our organisation. furthermore, we have committed to align 
our corporate lending book with the objectives of the paris 
agreement on climate change.
asset 
management 
& danica 
pension
we are integrating esg, including climate 
considerations, into our investment process, 
and we have built the datasets, tools and 
resources needed to achieve this. tools include 
our materiality dashboard, mdash, which 
structures the material esg assessment of 
individual businesses based on the sasb 
framework, and a climate toolkit, which 
provides climate-exposure metrics and 
alignment metrics to help our investment 
teams in their decision making and in one-to-
one discussions. 
the main methods for esg risk management, within 
which climate-related risks are included, are outlined 
in our responsible investment policy. for instance, we 
use a bottom-up approach based on identifying material 
sustainability risks to integrate esg; we exercise active 
ownership to encourage companies to take action on 
climate; we include esg considerations in external 
manager selection; and we apply screening and norm 
based restrictions, e.g. for coal-based-power production. 
furthermore, we are establishing asset-class-level policies to 
decarbonise our danica pension portfolio. 
3.  risk management
performance overview & assurance
holders are heavily engaged 
in climate action. all nordic 
countries have high climate 
ambitions and have disclosed a 
target to reach net zero green-
house gas (ghg) emissions 
before 2050. 
2.b) impact on business, 
strategy and financial planning
if we fail to adequately take 
climate change into account, 
transition and physical risks 
could materialise across our 
major operations. this could 
affect, for example, customer 
acquisition and retention; dan-
ske bank’s competitive position; 
balance sheet health; and the 
market value of our invest-
ments, further details of which 
are provided below in section 
three: risk management.
on the other hand, we believe 
that we are in an excellent po-
sition to benefit from business 
opportunities that emerge from 
supporting our customers and 
investments in the low-carbon 
transition. within our nordic 
core markets, we see high and 
increasing levels of demand for 
sustainable financing, advisory 
and investment services. the 
sustainable financing products 
that we see our customers 
showing an interest in include 
green loans, green bonds and 
sustainable bonds. further-
more, supporting the low-car-
bon transition can be beneficial 
when it comes to meeting 
our fiduciary duty to create 
investment value for our clients. 
in order to seize and capitalise 
on climate-related opportuni-
ties, we have included volume 
targets related to green lending 
and investments in our 2023 
group sustainability strategy. 
2.c) resilience of the 
organisation’s strategy
to identify and manage risks, 
danske bank has developed 
analytical tools, sector poli-
cies and relevant expertise, 
all of which are deployed to 
assess the potential impacts 
of physical and transition risks 
on our activities. we have also 
performed scenario analyses 
to stress-test our climate-re-
lated risk exposure in certain 
sectors. our business units 
are continually developing new 
products and service offerings 
that enable us to seize and cap-
italise on the business opportu-
nities the low-carbon transition 
brings with it. for instance, we 
in 2020 launched global sus-
tainable future, a new thematic 
investment product, and danica 
balance sustainable choice – a 
pension solution that invests 
in companies that are leading 
in the global sustainability 
transition. 
sustainability report 2020
39
as part of our credit risk assessments, we have started to 
include climate risk scenario analysis in order to stress-test 
high-climate-risk sectors identified through a climate risk 
heat map. the analysis is already now starting to inform 
sector-specific risk strategies, but our ambition is to grad-
ually advance over time as data and methodology evolves 
and as more sectors are covered. in 2020, the following 
sector-specific climate risk analyses were performed: 
•  physical risk – real estate
 
physical risk assessments analysed the risk of flooding 
from sea, streams and lakes for both our danish mort-
gage and commercial real estate portfolios by using 
the danish coastal authority’s geographical data and 
projections of future flooding risk. the analysis showed 
that flooding risk is clearly prevalent for parts of the 
danish real estate portfolio. further analysis is needed 
to translate the risk into financial impacts in the long 
term, to incorporate mitigation factors such as insur-
ance coverage, and to extend the assessment to other 
nordic markets.
•  transition risk – oil and gas
 
a transition risk analysis was performed for the oil and 
gas portfolio using new climate scenarios from the net-
work for greening the financial system, including a de-
layed 2°c scenario and a disorderly 1.5°c. irrespective 
of the scenario used, it is clear that ambitious transition 
plans are needed to ensure stable credit quality in the 
long term, and our work to ensure paris alignment is 
therefore key for this sector.
•  transition risk – agriculture 
 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our agriculture 
portfolio using future estimated carbon taxes. results 
climate risk scenario analysis in 2020 
4.a & 4.c) disclose the 
metrics and targets used to 
assess and manage climate-
related risks and opportunities
as a part of our 2023 group 
sustainability strategy, we re-
leased metrics and targets that 
measure how well we are able 
to capture the opportunities that 
arise from the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. these tar-
gets include our commitment to 
facilitate well beyond dkk 100 
billion in sustainable financing 
by 2023 and danica pension’s 
commitment to investing dkk 
30 billion in green assets by 
2023, dkk 50 billion by 2025 
and dkk 100 billion by 2030. 
we have also announced that 
we will set a climate target for 
our corporate lending portfolio 
in alignment with the paris 
agreement on climate change, 
and danica pension has joined 
the net-zero asset owner 
alliance, thereby commit-
ting to decarbonise its total 
investment portfolio by 2050. 
these portfolio-level targets 
are central in ensuring that we 
future-proof our lending and 
investment portfolios. currently, 
work is ongoing to develop the 
methodologies to implement 
these actions. 
in 2021, danica pension will re-
lease an intermediate decarbon-
isation milestone for 2025. we 
are currently in the process of 
mapping the climate impact of 
our corporate lending book, and 
in may 2020 we joined pcaf 
to utilise and share financial 
industry best practices in this 
area. we have also contributed 
to finance denmark’s finan-
cial sector guidelines for co2 
disclosures.
in 2020, we published a report 
on the carbon footprint of equity 
and corporate bond investments 
made by danica pension as well 
as a green bond impact report 
on avoided co2 emissions 
resulting from green loans to 
corporate customers on the 
back of danske bank’s two 
inaugural green bonds. 
for details of danske bank’s 
co2 reduction target of 75% 
from 2010 by 2023 for our 
operations (4.b), our scope 1, 2 
and 3 ghg emissions and other 
sustainability data, including on 
sustainable finance, please see 
p. 40, our sustainability fact 
book 2020 and our statement 
on carbon neutrality 2020. 
4.  metrics and targets
show that the agricultural sector is sensitive to a carbon 
tax and that a proper implementation of the tax could be 
key in incentivising the sector towards a solid transition.
scenario analysis is also used in investment strategies to 
identify possible plausible low-carbon transition pathways 
and to help understand what these developments could 
mean from risk and return perspectives. as a signatory 
to the net-zero asset owner alliance, danica pension 
analyses transition scenarios to help establish decarbonisa-
tion strategies that enable co2 reduction targets to be met 
towards 2050.
credit quality in the oil and gas portfolio: exploration and 
production segment
the graph shows credit quality deterioration under four of the scenarios from the network 
for greening the financial system, as used for the transition risk stress-test on the oil and 
gas portfolio. the climate scenarios make different assumptions about the future energy 
mix, but common to all the transition scenarios is that the share of oil and gas in the world 
energy mix will diminish over the long term. depending on how ambitious the world is in 
reducing its carbon emission, credit quality will deteriorate, assuming that our customers 
do not react to the changing world, thereby indicating the need for ambitious transition 
plans.

esg performance data
as part of our annual reporting practices, we include an overview of assured performance data related to our 2023 group sustainability 
strategy. all data is prepared in accordance with our reporting principles, see pp. 42-43. complementary data and information is included 
in our sustainability fact book 2020.
1  sustainable financing includes green loans in db and rd and bloomberg leage table share of arranged sustainable bonds. total sustainable financing in 2020 was dkk 102.2 billion.
2  our responsible investment policy applies to all aum. as a consequence of the upcoming sustainable finance disclosure regulation (sfdr), we will adjust our categorisation of esg/
sustainability aum in 2021 to follow definitions outlined in the regulation. this means that current sustainability labels, such as our esg inside integrated, restricted and thematic labels for 
investment funds, will no longer be applied, and a new labelling system compliant with the sfdr and new kpis will be defined.
3  data covers denmark (dk), sweden (se), norway (no), ireland (irl), northern ireland (ni), finland (fi) and lithuania (lit) and includes estimated figures for the remainder of the group. we 
included exact figures from our operations in india (in).
4  baseline is 55,690 tonnes of co2 emissions in 2010. a 75% emissions reduction equals 13,705 tonnes of co2 emissions in 2023, meaning that by 2023 we need to have reduced our 
emissions 10% from 2019 levels. our total co2 emissions in 2020 amounted to 7,871 tonnes (scope 1, 2 and 3).
5 data covers dk, se, no, irl, ni, fin and lit. in 2017, we included figures from our operations in in.
6 data is from annual report 2020 and fact book q4 2020. for a definition of ratios, see definition of alternative performance measures on p. 67 of our annual report 2020.
7  due to a reviewed and more accurate accounting methodology for women in senior leadership positions, we have updated the 2019 baseline from 23% to 27% (updated data is from january 
2020). the increase is due to a new definition of senior leadership position, resulting in an increase of the baseline senior leader population from 603 to 927.
performance overview & assurance
sustainability report 2020

independent auditor’s  
assurance report 
to the management and the stakeholders of danske bank
we have assessed danske bank’s sustainability report 2020 
(‘the report’) to provide limited assurance on selected 2020 
data on page 40 of the report. the report covers danske bank’s 
international activities from 1 january to 31 december 2020. 
our assessment was performed in order to assess whether:
• 
the esg performance data on page 40 in the report have 
been stated in accordance with the criteria defined by the 
reporting principles;
• 
danske bank has offset its consolidated co2 emissions for 
2020.
we express a conclusion providing limited assurance.
management’s responsibility 
the management of danske bank is responsible for collecting, 
analysing, aggregating and presenting the information in the 
report, ensuring that data are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. danske bank’s non-financial re-
porting principles contain management’s defined reporting scope 
for each data type. the criteria for the reporting principles can be 
found on page 42-43 of the report.
auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion 
on the esg performance data on page 40 in the report. fur-
thermore, our responsibility is to provide limited assurance on 
whether danske bank has offset its consolidated co2 emissions 
for 2020. we have conducted our work in accordance with isae 
3000, assurance engagements other than audits or reviews 
of historical financial information, and additional requirements 
under danish audit regulation to obtain limited assurance about 
our conclusion. 
deloitte statsautoriseret revisionspartnerselskab is subject to 
international standard on quality control (isqc) 1 and, accord-
ingly, applies a comprehensive quality control system, including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements. 
we have complied with the independence and other ethical 
requirements of the code of ethics for professional accountants 
issued by fsr – danish auditors (code of ethics for professional 
accountants), which are based on the fundamental principles 
of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour.
a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope 
than a reasonable assurance engagement. consequently, the 
level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been 
obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
considering the risk of material misstatement, we planned and 
performed our work to obtain all information and explanations 
necessary to support our conclusion. 
we performed our review from november 2020 to january 
2021. our work has included interviews with key functions in 
danske bank, inquiries regarding procedures and methods to 
ensure that selected esg data and information have been incor-
porated in accordance with the reporting principles. we have 
assessed processes, tools, systems and controls for gathering, 
consolidating and aggregating esg data at group level, and 
performed analytical review procedures and tested esg data pre-
pared at group level against underlying documentation. we have 
reviewed the reported data (some measured, some calculated 
and some estimated) as well as evaluated and given feedback 
on the reliability and validity of the underlying sources, especially 
of estimated data. furthermore, we have received documenta-
tion that the consolidated co2 emissions have been offset by 
purchase of offset certificates. finally, we have evaluated the 
overall presentation of the report, including the consistency of 
information. 
we have not performed site visits or interviewed external stake-
holders, nor have we performed any assurance procedures on 
baseline data or forward-looking statements such as targets and 
expectations. consequently, we draw no conclusion on these 
statements. 
conclusion 
based on our work, nothing has come to our attention causing us 
not to believe that: 
• 
the esg performance data subject to our review have been 
stated in accordance with the criteria mentioned in the report-
ing principles;
• 
danske bank has offset its consolidated co2 emissions for 
2020.

investments in the green 
transition by danica pension
investments in green transition 
are defined as investments 
that contribute to the transition 
to a low-carbon, resilient and 
resource-efficient economy 
such as investments where e.g. 
products, services or activities 
contribute to environmental 
adaption, mitigation, prevention, 
control or restoration. data in-
cludes: 1) investments in com-
panies through listed equity and 
credit bonds with revenue relat-
ing to environmental objectives 
and investments in green bonds 
through credit, government and 
mortgage bonds; 2) alternative 
investments in renewable ener-
gy; 3) investments in sustaina-
bility certified buildings; and 4) 
sustainability certified buildings 
owned indirectly in real estate 
entities internationally. the 
reporting period for number 2, 
3 and 4 runs from q4 2019 to 
q3 2020.
assets under management 
reporting principle for assets 
under management (aum) is 
included in the annual report 
2020.
environment
 
environmental data covers  
the actual consumption from 
the group’s operations in den-
mark, finland, ireland, north-
ern ireland, norway, sweden, 
lithuania and india, and it also 
covers the estimated consump-
tion from the group’s remaining 
operations without registered 
data. the reporting period for 
the year 2020 runs from q4 
2019 to q3 2020. data is 
retrieved from the credit360 
reporting system. we report our 
co2 emissions with guidance 
from the greenhouse gas 
protocol.
co2 emissions scope 1
scope 1 comprises co2 emis-
sions from heating using oil 
and gas and from the usage of 
company cars. the emissions 
from heating are calculated on 
the basis of heating consump-
tion and either specific emission 
factors from energy companies 
or average emission factors for 
heating for the country from 
international energy agency 
(iea) and the department of 
environment, food and rural 
affairs (defra). for transport 
by company cars, the emissions 
are calculated on the basis 
of the mileage and emission 
factors from defra.
co2 emissions scope 2
scope 2 comprises co2 
emissions from heating and 
electricity supplied by external 
suppliers. the emissions from 
heating and cooling are calcu-
lated on the basis of heating 
consumption and on either 
specific emission factors from 
energy companies or average 
emission factors for heating for 
the country from iea and de-
fra. similarly, emissions from 
district cooling are calculated on 
the basis of district cooling con-
sumption and the specific emis-
sions factor used for district 
heating. this is a conservative 
approach. in accordance with 
the market-based methodology 
from greenhouse gas protocol 
guidance, the emissions from 
electricity consumption were 
omitted owing to the purchase 
of renewable electricity certified 
by guarantees by origin and 
international renewable energy 
certificates.
co2 emissions scope 3
scope 3 comprises co2 
emissions from paper usage 
and business travel by 
employee cars and flights. the 
emissions from paper usage 
are calculated on the basis of 
the paper consumption and the 
emission factors from defra. 
for transport by employee cars, 
the emissions are calculated 
on the basis of the mileage 
and emission factors from 
defra. the emissions from 
air travel are reported directly 
by our travel agency, american 
express.
estimated co2 from operations 
without registered data
for operations that do not have 
any measured consumption, 
we estimate co2 emissions 
on the basis of the average 
number of full-time employees 
as provided by group finance 
from q4 2019 to q3 2020 
and the average emissions per 
employee in the group. these 
estimates represent 1% of total 
co2 emissions in 2020 and 
are distributed across the three 
scopes based on the share of 
the individual scope. 
co2 emissions per fte
co2 emissions per employee 
(tonnes/fte) are calculated on 
the basis of the total amount of 
co2 emissions (tonnes) and the 
number of full-time employees 
provided by group finance from 
q4 2019 to q3 2020. 
energy consumption
data for energy consumption 
from electricity and heat is 
either based on automatic data 
transfers from smart meters 
or quarterly meter readings, or 
it is calculated on the basis of 
performance overview & assurance
43
sustainability report 2020 
statements received regularly 
during the year from energy 
companies and lessors. data 
on electricity consumption 
is calculated mainly on the 
basis of statements from 
energy companies, and heat 
consumption figures for our 
head offices are similarly based 
on actual readings taken by the 
energy companies. if no reading 
or statement is available, we 
estimate consumption on the 
basis of the average electricity 
or heat consumption at the 
country unit and the floor  
space. data on floor space 
covers all properties used by 
the group and its subsidiaries, 
including the group’s own 
premises and leased premises, 
for own operations in various 
countries.
in sweden, heat consumption 
data is calculated on the basis 
of information from boverket.se  
(energy labelling of buildings). 
the consumption figure is 
calculated on the basis of the 
group’s share of floor space in 
the various buildings in sweden. 
according to this method, data 
on heat consumption at proper-
ties without actual consumption 
in finland is calculated by using 
the key figures for sweden 
because consumption patterns 
for locations in finland are 
similar to those for branches in 
sweden.
energy consumption per fte
energy consumption per full-
time employee (mwh/fte) 
is calculated on the basis of 
the total energy consumption 
(mwh) and the number of 
full-time employees provided by 
group finance from q4 2019 
to q3 2020.
renewable energy share 
scope 1 and 2
renewable energy share within 
scope 1 and 2 is calculated on 
the basis of the total energy 
consumption and the amount 
of renewable electricity certified 
by guarantees of origin and 
international renewable energy 
certificates. the calculation 
does not include fuel use from 
company cars. with limited 
data on the energy mix for heat-
ing, it is assumed that the ener-
gy mix is made up of a variety of 
different fossil sources. this is a 
conservative approach.  
social
number of full-time employees
the number of full-time employ-
ees (ftes), end of year, is based 
on information registered in the 
group’s accounting system at 
the end of q4 2020.
women in the executive 
leadership team
percentage of women in the 
executive leadership team is 
defined as the number of wom-
en in the elt divided by the total 
number of members of the elt.
women in senior leadership 
positions 
senior leadership is defined as 
female employees who hold the 
title ceo, any vice president ti-
tle, leader of business/function, 
leaders of leaders or leaders of 
team. calculations were based 
on information registered in the 
hr platform at the end of q4 
2020.
women in management
women in manager positions
are employees with staff re-
sponsibility. calculations were 
based on information registered 
in the hr platform at the end of
q4 2020. 
women in the workforce
the percentage of women in  
the workforce is based on  
information registered in the  
hr platform at the end of q4 
2020.
employee gender pay ratio
the calculation includes all cash
compensation (salary, bonus
payments and any other mone-
tary benefits) for all employees
across the group. the gender
pay ratio is calculated by com-
paring the female employees’
median cash compensation
with the male employees’ medi-
an cash compensation.
employee turnover
employee turnover is defined 
as the number of employees 
(head count) who retired or 
resigned divided by the number 
of employees (head count) 
per month and converted 
to a percentage rate. the 
information was retrieved from 
the hr platform and covers 
the entire group. the employee 
turnover rate is based on 
information registered from q1 
to q4 2020.
employee engagement
data on employee engage-
ment for db comes from the 
pulse survey, managed by our 
external provider ennova. the 
survey covers the entire group. 
the employee engagement 
index is based on replies to five 
questions in the pulse survey: 
three on encouragement and 
two on enablement. the pulse 
survey runs monthly except 
july. the reported data is a 
2020 average.
number of start-ups and 
scale-ups supported with 
growth and impact tools, 
services and expertise
the support can be via the 
digital platforms, thehub.io and 
+impact.io, advice from db 
growth advisers, enrollment in 
+impact accelerators, canute 
programmes or other growth 
and impact initiatives in db.
the kpi is measured using the 
number of start-ups and scale-
ups that posted a job on the 
hub, as a proxy. the start-up or 
scale-up supported is counted 
at the time it has posted the 
first job on the hub. data for 
the kpi covers companies 
registered in denmark, sweden, 
norway, finland and northern 
ireland and has been accu-
mulated from dec. 2015 and 
onwards. data covers all types 
of corporate structures (ivs, 
aps, as, ab, inc. etc.). data is 
retrieved from the back-end sys-
tem (keystones) of the hub.
 
number of people supported 
with financial literacy tools and 
expertise
data includes active unique
users of db digital educational 
tools developed to support 
financial confidence. data also 
includes people participating 
in related physical events 
arranged by db. data has been 
accumulated from 2018 and 
onwards. 
number of participants 
in employee volunteering 
programmes
data includes the total number 
of employees (head count) who 
have reported their participation 
in the time to give programme 
during the year. all employees 
in the group have the opportu-
nity to participate. registration 
is captured and reported via an 
internal it system. for northern 
ireland and india, registrations
are captured and reported using 
excel and are sent to the group.
governance
women on the board of 
directors (agm elected)
percentage of women on the 
board of directors elected at 
the annual general meeting 
(agm).
employees trained in risk and 
compliance
the risk and compliance 
elearning courses are man-
datory for all employees of the 
group and must be completed 
once a year and on time. in addi-
tion, all new employees in the 
group must complete the mod-
ule within the first 14 days of 
their employment. all temporary 
employees and external consult-
ants with access to the group’s 
it systems must also complete 
training. the completion data 
has been extracted from db’s 
external learning management 
system, cornerstone at the end 
of 2020. 
tenders through responsible 
sourcing process 
data covers all new or rene-
gotiated supplier contracts 
for which group procurement 
is involved across the whole 
group where the total contract 
is in scope for pre-qualification 
(supplier with total contract 
value above dkk 1 million).  
the percentage of tenders 
that have been through the 
responsible sourcing process 
is calculated by dividing the 
number of activities in scope by 
the number of activities marked 
as compliant.
