2020 has been an incredibly 
challenging year for our 
business, our customers and 
our people all around the 
world.  
through it all, we have remained 
resilient, buoyed by our strong 
performance over the past few years. 
 
i would like to thank each and every 
one of our people for their role in 
continuing to support our business 
and our customers through these 
tough times.  
 
during the year, our top priority was 
the health and wellbeing of our 
employees, while at the same time 
taking the actions required to protect 
the financial health of our business 
this year and capture long-term 
growth opportunities for the future. 
 
the market decline and prolonged 
on-trade closures in many markets 
led to an 8.4% organic decline in 
revenue, but our relentless focus on 
cost efficiencies and early 
intervention enabled us to limit the 
organic decline in operating profit to 
3.1%. we ended the year with 
reported revenue of dkk 58.5bn, 
operating profit of dkk 9.7bn and 
free cash flow of dkk 5.1bn. 
 
despite the challenges posed by 
covid-19, our strategic priorities 
and ambitions remain intact, and we 
have continued to invest in our 
brands. while volumes sold have 
declined overall, we have seen 
growth of 1% in our craft & speciality 
brews and 11% in our alcohol-free 
brews. 
 
our financial performance and 
sail’22 business strategy are 
underpinned by our ongoing 
commitment to responsibility and 
sustainability. 
 
this year, we increased our support 
for local communities – including the 
hard-hit hospitality industry – and 
transformed production lines to help 
meet unprecedented demand for 
hand sanitiser. the carlsberg 
foundation, together with the new 
carlsberg foundation and the 
tuborg foundation, also donated 
dkk 956m to support research, arts, 
culture and civil society, including 
dkk 109m specifically for covid-19 
relief efforts. 
 
our purpose is brewing for a better 
today and tomorrow. despite the 
immense and immediate threat to 
human health, i am encouraged to 
see that the global pandemic has 
sharpened the world’s focus on the 
long-term sustainability of the 
planet too. we must not lose sight of 
this overriding objective and i joined 
other leading ceos in urging 
governments to ensure their recovery 
efforts support the paris agreement’s 
1.5˚c climate goal.  
 
at carlsberg, we have our own 
ambitious targets to cut carbon 
emissions and water waste, and we 
will not let covid-19 throw us off 
course. we are on track to meet our 
2022 targets, and since 2015 we 
have reduced our brewery emissions 
by 39% and our water use by 18% for 
every hectolitre of beer produced. 
from 2015 to 2019, we cut our 
beer-in-hand emissions by 7%.

achieving these targets as we work 
together towards zero will help us 
mitigate risks to our business that 
will be amplified by climate change 
in the future. i am pleased to see the 
increased focus on esg risks and 
opportunities by our stakeholders, 
including investors, which will 
contribute to creating progress at the 
pace and scale needed. 
 
this year, for the first time, we are 
reporting in line with the 
recommendations of the task force 
on climate-related financial 
disclosures to better understand and 
act on climate-related risks and 
opportunities for our business. 
 
climate change is also increasing 
water risks and our ground-breaking 
water risk scenario analysis with 
wwf is helping us target action to 
sustain essential water supplies – 
both for our breweries and for the 
communities whose water resources 
we share. our innovative partnership 
with desolenator will use renewable 
energy from the sun to create access 
to clean water for thousands of 
people in an area of india stricken by 
the effects of both climate change 
and covid-19. 
 
zero carbon footprint and zero 
water waste are key ambitions in our 
together towards zero 
programme, alongside zero 
irresponsible drinking and a zero 
accidents culture. our efforts 
towards achieving all four ambitions 
play a critical role in the success of 
our business now and in the future – 
not only by addressing risks but by 
creating opportunities for growth. 
 
our burgeoning range of alcohol-
free brews has delivered 11% growth 
in sales volumes this year as more 
people embrace healthy balanced 
lifestyles in the wake of the 
pandemic. we also want consumers 
to enjoy our alcoholic products 
responsibly and reached our target 
to include messaging about 
responsible drinking on all packaging 
two years early. 
 
the success of our business depends 
on our people, and their health and 
safety remains our top priority. as 
well as supporting them through the 
challenges of the pandemic, we have 
stepped up our efforts to embed safe 
behaviour and continued to drive 
down accident rates by a further 19% 
across the business in 2020. but this 
progress was overshadowed by the 
death of a contractor during 
dismantling work at a former 
production site. any accident is one 
too many and this tragedy 
strengthens our resolve to get to 
zero. 
 
carlsberg was founded over 170 
years ago on a strong sense of social 
responsibility – and we remain 
steadfast in our commitment to 
uphold the principles of the un 
global compact. with the creation of 
the carlsberg sustainability advisory 
board, we are inviting external 
experts to provide an “outside in” 
view to help us stay true to the 
values of our founder, challenging 
ourselves to constantly strive for 
better as we work towards our 
ambitious targets.  
 
i am convinced that driving progress 
together towards zero will help 
carlsberg keep brewing for a better 
today and tomorrow as the world 
recovers from covid-19.

external perspectives 
  i am pleased to be part of 
the csab and have the opportunity 
to follow – and influence – the 
carlsberg sustainability journey. 
 
from my perspective it is a genuine 
improvement journey that seeks to 
continuously raise the bar, focusing 
on the material issues. much has 
been done in recent years, which 
allows us to set high ambitions. 
all companies are today truly at an 
inflection point with regard to esg  
and sustainability, and it is clear to 
me that carlsberg is stepping up to 
this challenge. 
knut haanaes,  
professor of strategy,

imd business school 
 
 it has been my utmost 
pleasure and privilege to be a  
part of the csab, which has allowed 
me to contribute my consumer 
trends expertise for a higher cause.  
 
it’s heartening to see how the 
together towards zero initiative  
is more than just a csr campaign; 
but a well-crafted strategic plan 
to lead carlsberg towards a more 
sustainable future.  
 
looking ahead, i’m hopeful that the 
executive leadership of carlsberg  
will be able to set new standards  
for how business success will be 
measured – not just by financial 
metrics and shareholder value, but 
by the organization’s impact on  
people and planet.

 since 1847, carlsberg and  
its people have remained true to the 
founder’s heritage, aspirations and 
responsible way of working. the 
decade leading to 2030 will  
be dynamic and challenging. 
 
to transform itself whilst securing 
business continuity and success will  
not be an easy task. well-supported  
by a bold company purpose, with its 
ambitious together towards zero 
sustainability programme and strong 
commitment from its leadership and 
staff, carlsberg is ready for the job. 
 
the csab will play its part, acting as  
a sparring partner for the leadership 
team and helping to stay in sync with 
expectations of the outside world. 
companies must adapt to survive,  
and we will challenge the speed and 
scale of sustainability implementation, 
advising on the tough dilemmas and 
trade-offs on the way towards zero.

carlsberg is one of the world’s 
largest brewery groups. in 
2020, we produced almost 
117 million hectolitres (hl) of 
quality beers and beverages. 
our 100+ consumer brands include 
international premium brands such 
as carlsberg, grimbergen, 1664 and 
tuborg, as well as strong local 
brands. in 2020, we increased sales 
volumes of craft & speciality brews 
by 1% and alcohol-free brews by 
11%, although the overall volumes of 
beer we sold declined due to the 
impact of various covid-19 
restrictions.  
 
more than 40,000 employees help 
us produce, transport and sell our 
beer. we have 88 sites in western 
europe, eastern europe and asia. 
our products reach consumers in 
over 100 countries around the world 
through domestic sales, exports and 
licensing agreements.  
 
we deliver value to our shareholders 
and society, and support sustainable 
development, through the 
contribution we make to economies 
around the world (see graphic). 
  
our majority shareholder, the 
carlsberg foundation, uses its 
dividends for wide societal benefit. in 
2020, the carlsberg foundation, 
together with the new carlsberg 
foundation and the tuborg 
foundation, granted dkk 956m to 
support scientific research, arts, 
culture and civil society, including 
over dkk 109m towards covid-19 
relief efforts.

at carlsberg, we are brewing 
for a better today and 
tomorrow. that is our purpose. 
we have been brewing for over 170 
years. doing business responsibly 
and sustainably will help us stay on 
course to achieve our sail’22 
strategy, deliver value for 
shareholders and society, and keep 
brewing for many more years to 
come. see our annual report for 
more on our sail’22 strategy. 
 
our together towards zero 
programme helps us mitigate long-
term risks and make our business 
more resilient by tackling global 
challenges such as climate change, 
water scarcity and public health 
issues. it also enables us to capture 
opportunities by meeting growing 
consumer demand for more 
sustainable products and healthier 
choisces. 
 
the programme sets out 
transformative targets to drive action 
in four priority areas: zero carbon 
footprint, zero water waste, zero 
irresponsible drinking and zero 
accidents culture. identified through 
a materiality process (see page 57), 
these are the areas where we can 
have the biggest impact on 
sustainable development through our 
business and our partnerships. we 
have aligned our ambitions and 
targets to the un sustainable 
development goals (sdgs) where 
we can have the greatest impact. 
 
we partner with suppliers, ngos and 
others in our industry to make 
progress together towards zero. 
our steadfast commitment to doing 
business responsibly underpins 
progress in all four priority areas.

the covid-19 pandemic has 
impacted lives and livelihoods 
worldwide, with far-reaching health 
and economic consequences. 
 
during these unprecedented and 
challenging times, we prioritised the 
health and wellbeing of our people 
(see page 39) and stepped up efforts 
to support our customers and 
communities.  
 
helping communities stay 
strong 
we transformed brewery production 
lines to produce alcohol for hand 
sanitiser. we donated equipment and 
alcohol-free beverages to support 
healthcare workers. and we ran 
campaigns to support the hard-hit 
hospitality sector. see map for local 
examples. 
 
we made corporate contributions 
and carlsberg teams around the 
world raised funds for local 
organisations. in addition, the 
carlsberg foundation, together with 
the new carlsberg foundation and 
the tuborg foundation, donated dkk 
109m during the crisis to support 
research, arts, culture and civil 
society.  
 
calling for a low-carbon 
recovery 
as we work to respond to covid-19 
challenges and reset our business for 
the future, we know society must 
also do the same and we are 
determined to play our part in 
supporting a low-carbon recovery.  
 
together with the science based 
targets initiative and 150 other 
leading businesses, we called on 
governments around the world to 
align their covid-19 recovery 
efforts with the latest climate 
science. we also joined business 
leaders and investors in urging the 
european union to put the european 
green deal at the core of its recovery 
package.

the world is facing a climate 
emergency that threatens 
people, the environment and 
our business.  
governments, businesses and 
individuals must take action now to 
help prevent the worst effects of 
climate change. we are determined 
to do our part by cutting the carbon 
footprint of our operations and our 
entire value chain.  
 
our ambitious targets, approved by 
the science based targets initiative 
in 2017, are in line with the latest 
climate science to limit global 
warming to 1.5˚c. in 2020, we 
joined other leading companies in 
urging governments to ensure their 
covid-19 recovery efforts align with 
the paris agreement’s 1.5˚c goal and 
calling for european union leaders to 
embrace a 55% carbon emissions 
reduction target by 2030. 
 
we are making strong progress on 
our 2022 targets to switch to 100% 
renewable electricity, eliminate use 
of coal and halve carbon emissions 
at our breweries as we drive progress 
towards zero carbon brewing by 
2030. eliminating emissions from 
our breweries will help us cut our 
value chain footprint from field to 
glass – what we call beer-in-hand 
emissions – by 30% by 2030 (from 
2015 levels).  
 
beyond our own operations, we 
work with partners who supply our 
ingredients, packaging, logistics and 
refrigeration. together, we are 
supporting sustainable agriculture, 
making the transition to lower-
carbon transport and cooling, and 
creating packaging solutions like our 
snap pack and green fibre bottle.  
 
extreme weather and shifting rainfall 
patterns as a result of climate 
change pose a direct risk to our 
brewing operations and to the crops 
and water we need to make our 
products. this year, we signed up to 
the task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures and are 
applying its recommendations to 
better understand and report on 
these risks. we were also included in 
the cdp a list of global corporate 
leaders for transparency and action 
on climate risks and opportunities.

scientists at the carlsberg research 
laboratory in copenhagen have 
been exploring the boundaries of 
crop science and perfecting the art of 
brewing since 1876. today, they are 
turning their attention to sustainable 
agriculture to reduce climate risks in 
our supply chain.   
 
barley is an essential ingredient for 
our beer – and the focus of the lab’s 
ground-breaking research into 
climate-tolerant crops. in the last 
decade, we have invested more than 
dkk 50m in research on breeding 
new sustainable and climate-
tolerant raw materials, as well as 
advances in hop, yeast and brewing 
processes.  
 
our scientists have isolated more 
than 40 candidates for barley 
varieties that display climate-
resilient traits such as greater 
tolerance to drought and heat 
waves, deeper roots and the ability 
to grow in saline soils.  
 
we are now partnering with local 
breeders in australia to see how the 
new crop varieties cope in extreme 
drought and adverse soil conditions. 
the varieties that grow best will form 
a pipeline for barley breeding, and 
we will work with partners to rapidly 
integrate those varieties into our beer 
supply chain.  
 
barley bred to produce higher yields 
also has a lower climate impact 
because the same amount can be 
grown using less fertiliser, which 
takes a lot of carbon to produce. in 
russia, the 70 farmers who supply 
our baltika breweries are using 
barley varieties developed by our lab 
that are more sustainable than 
current elite varieties. their yield is 
approximately 10% higher than 
varieties developed locally in russia.  
 
we set requirements for these 
farmers on fertiliser use and hold 
field days to prepare them to harvest 
the benefits of future innovations 
from our lab. 
 
 
 
feature: zero carbon footprint in action 
promoting sustainable agriculture 
through crop innovation 
  our farm is one of the leading farms in the 
yaroslavl region and has grown brewing barley for 
several years. thanks to the carlsberg group, our 
experience turned out to be a success: the harvest 
almost tripled within three years. the barley must meet 
specifications and grows under regular monitoring that 
allows it to reach high quality. carlsberg group 
specialists provide consultations and always assist us 
with expert advice.”

eliminating 
brewery 
emissions 
 
our global environmental policy 
supports our progress towards zero 
carbon emissions from our breweries. 
it sets out our commitment to robust 
environmental standards with 
particular focus on energy and 
emissions as well as water, waste and 
packaging.  
 
we manage our 86 breweries and two 
malting sites as part of our integrated 
supply chain, using best practice 
environmental management systems 
to drive continuous improvement. 
these systems are certified to the iso 
14001:2015 standard at 79 of our 
breweries, and energy management 
systems at 19 sites are also certified 
to iso 50001.  
 
we collect environmental data from 
across all our breweries and malting 
sites to track progress. in 2020, 
carbon emissions totalled 563,000 
tonnes. 
 
we are switching to 100% renewable 
electricity, eliminating use of coal and 
adopting best practices and advanced 
technologies in production processes.  
 
in 2020, we reduced relative emissions 
at our breweries by 12% to 4.3 kg co2 
per hl from 4.9 kg co2 per hl in 2019. 
that is a 39% reduction since 2015, 
well on the way to our target of 50% 
by 2022. overall, across our breweries 
and malting sites we have cut our 
absolute emissions by 33% since 2015. 
this is a saving of 283,000 tonnes of 
co2, equivalent to taking 109,000 
cars off the road for a year1. 
 
we are on course to eliminate 
emissions from our breweries and 
malting sites by 2030. 
switching to renewable 
energy 
we are well over halfway towards our 
goal to source 100% of electricity for 
our breweries from renewable sources 
like the sun and wind by 2022. to 
ensure a robust approach to the 
measurement and use of renewable 
electricity, we are members of the 
re100, and apply their technical 
criteria when working with renewable 
electricity – see overview of approved 
renewable electricity types below. in 
2020, we reached 64% (up from 56% 
in 2019). our breweries in china 
achieved 100% this year, joining all our 
breweries in western europe, which 
achieved this target several years ago.  
 
most of our renewable electricity 
comes from the grid through the 
purchase of renewable electricity 
certificates, totalling 570,077 mwh 
in 2020. at eight of our sites, we 
generate renewable power from on-
site solar panels. we are also 
exploring options to buy renewable

what we 
mean by zero 
carbon 
footprint  
brewery emissions: we aim to 
eliminate carbon emissions from our 
88 sites – including breweries and 
malting sites – by 2030. to help us 
drive progress towards this absolute 
target and improve production 
efficiency on the way, we aim to 
halve emissions per hectolitre (hl) of 
production from our 86 breweries – 
including breweries, soft drink and 
water plants, but excluding malting 
sites – between 2015 and 2022. 
 
both targets include scope 1 and 2 
emissions and exclude owned 
logistics and distribution, which are 
included in our beer-in-hand target.  
 
beer-in-hand emissions: we aim to 
reduce our value chain (beer-in-
hand) emissions per hl of beer 
produced by 15% by 2022 and 30% 
by 2030 from our 2015 baseline. 
these reductions cover scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions from: growing and

re100 options for renewable electricity 
to achieve 100% renewable electricity, a company  
may choose from the following options: 
 
self-generated electricity  
1. generation from installations owned by the company  
 
purchased electricity  
2. purchase from on-site installations owned by a supplier 
3. direct line to an off-site generator with no grid transfers 
4. direct procurement from offsite grid-connected generators 
5. contract with suppliers (green electricity products)  
6. unbundled energy attribute certificate purchase  
7. other options

electricity directly from wind and solar 
producers through power purchase 
agreements.  
 
our site at farris in norway achieved 
zero carbon emissions in 2020, 
switching from fuel oil to renewable 
electricity. globally, eight of our 
breweries are now carbon-neutral, 
powered by 100% renewable electricity 
and thermal energy.  
 
by targeting 100% renewable 
electricity for brewing, and through 
our membership of the re100, we 
aim to encourage our industry peers 
and suppliers to make the same switch 
to renewables.  
 
eliminating coal 
in 2020, we converted a coal-fired 
boiler at our okocim brewery in 
poland to run on biogas generated on 
site and, if necessary, natural gas. 
that leaves just one site where we still 
use coal, our aurangabad brewery in 
india. plans to convert the coal-fired 
boiler at this site to run on biomass 
have been delayed due to an extended 
covid-19 lockdown in india, but we 
aim to complete this in 2021.  
 
many of our breweries have replaced 
coal and natural gas with innovative 
technology to harness carbon-neutral 
thermal energy. in 2020, 28 breweries 
made use of biomass, biogas 
extracted from on-site wastewater, 
renewable district heating or biogas 
certificates. in switzerland, 52% of all 
heat generation came from renewable 
fuels, including 27% from ethanol 
extracted while producing our alcohol-
free beer.  
 
transforming brewing 
efficiency 
our breweries continued to break new 
boundaries for efficiency and 
innovation in 2020.  
 
in asia, we cut the amount of heat our 
breweries use by 13% from 2019 
through investments in bottle washing 
and energy recovery systems.  
 
in western europe, we installed new 
brewhouse heat recovery systems in 
estonia and lithuania that cut heat 
use by over 10%.  
 
in eastern europe, we added 
recuperative heat exchange units in 
ukraine and reduced brewhouse 
evaporation in russia.   
 
climate and water risks to our 
business are connected and so are 
many of the solutions. for example, 
the new advanced water-recycling 
plant at the fredericia brewery in 
denmark, operational in 2021, will 
halve water consumption, and biogas 
generated from the wastewater 
treatment process will replace around 
10% of the site’s natural gas 
consumption.  
 
 
 
 
case study 
 our scientists pursue 
tomorrow’s zero carbon 
solutions 
 
 
 
energy-saving solutions at our breweries 
without disrupting current production. the 
scientists are already trialling interventions 
that could help our brewery in ukraine cut 
energy use by up to 15%.  
 
they are also evaluating early-stage 
technologies with the potential to save energy 
and carbon at our breweries globally, including 
solar-assisted brewing, heat pump integration 
and energy from spent grain. 
post-doctoral researchers at the carlsberg 
research laboratory are using next-generation 
technology to bring us a step closer to a zero 
carbon future.  
 
in 2020, the talented members of our young 
scientists community created a “digital twin” 
brewery in close collaboration with colleagues 
from our integrated supply chain and baltika in 
russia. this unique virtual tool will enable us to 
simulate new ideas, brewing techniques and

cutting our 
beer-in-hand 
emissions  
we look beyond the brewery gates 
to understand and reduce the climate 
impact of our products across the 
value chain – from growing and 
malting grain to brewing, packaging, 
transporting and cooling our 
products. we call this our beer-in-
hand emissions.  
 
measuring our value chain 
footprint 
we cannot manage what we do not 
measure. we conduct in-depth 
assessments of our carbon emissions 
across the value chain every three 
years, using leading best practices 
and the greenhouse gas protocol.  
in 2020, we conducted our most 
extensive analysis yet of our global 
value chain carbon footprint, based 
on the european commission 
guidelines and with support from the 
carbon trust. suppliers representing 
more than 60% of our spend provided 
in-depth product-level data on the 
emissions they generated to provide 
ingredients, packaging and transport 
for our beer.  
 
the results showed that our value 
chain emissions in 2019 totalled 6.8 
million tonnes of co2-equivalents 
(co2e). for every hectolitre of our 
beer that consumers enjoyed, it took 
56.4 kg of co2e to do everything 
needed to put the beer in their hand. 
that is 7% less than in 2015, putting 
us almost halfway towards our 2022 
goal of 15%. we will use the data to 
help identify and implement the 
actions needed to achieve our target. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reporting on 
climate-
related 
financial risks 
and 
opportunities 
 
recognising the increasing risk of climate 
change to businesses and communities 
across our regions, in 2020 we 
broadened our analysis and reporting in 
this area by aligning with the 
recommendations of the task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures 
(tcfd).  
 
using the tcfd reporting framework, we 
will continue to improve our 
understanding and disclosure of the 
medium- and long-term impact of 
climate change on our business.  
 
our first disclosure according to the 
tcfd reporting framework is included in 
our 2020 annual report (page 36), 
available at carlsberggroup.com/ 
reports-downloads. 
 
it provides a brief summary of our 
governance, strategy, risks, metrics and 
targets in relation to climate change with 
links out to more information in this 
sustainability report and elsewhere.  
 
we have worked closely with carlsberg 
on their supply chain emission 
calculation model since 2016, and the 
work we did this year sets new 
standards for scope 3 emissions 
accounting and measurement. the 
model we have developed together 
uses very granular data for each value 
chain step. this enables carlsberg to 
track, measure and reduce its scope 3 
emissions on a market, regional and 
global level with great precision, which 
puts the company at the forefront of 
scope 3 accounting.”

the graphic illustrates our progress 
across each stage of the journey 
from field to glass. it shows that we 
have significantly cut carbon from 
our brewing and cooling, and made 
some progress on packaging and 
transport. however, emissions 
generated from agriculture – over 
which we have least control – have 
risen slightly.   
 
methodologies for value chain 
footprinting continue to develop, and 
in our latest analysis we updated our 
2015 baseline to reflect the 
improved methodology, greater 
availability of primary data, and 
additional sector guidance on both 
calculations and emissions factors 
from the product environmental 
footprint category rules (pefcr) 
and the beverage industry 
environmental roundtable (bier). 
this resulted in a 12% increase in our 
2015 baseline. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction target – exceeding the 67% required 
by the science based targets initiative.   
adopting globally recognised best-practice 
standards gives us confidence that we are 
gathering science-based information to inform 
our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint and 
mitigate climate-related risks to our business.  
read more about the methodology on page 88. 
we were early adopters of the product 
environmental footprint guidelines, developed 
by the european commission for measuring a 
product’s environmental footprint. and we 
apply the relevant parts of these specific 
product rules for beer to measure our 
corporate value chain footprint.  
seventy-five percent of our scope 3 emissions 
are covered by our 2030 beer-in-hand carbon 
industry ghg emissions sector guidance 
(version 4.1), developed by the beverage 
industry environmental round table (bier).  
detailed data from our suppliers enables us to 
track emissions by market down to product 
group level. in total, we collect primary data 
for more than 60% of our spend, covering our 
wide-reaching value chain from raw materials 
to point of sale.  
the science behind our carbon 
accounting 
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of our 
global beer-in-hand carbon footprint every 
few years, using stringent processes that 
enable us to identify and conduct reduction 
activities specific to each market.  
we adhere to the rigorous ghg protocol for 
scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and the beverage

partnering to shrink our 
shared footprint  
with 87% of our value chain carbon 
footprint outside our operations and 
direct control, partnering is key to 
reducing our beer-in-hand emissions.  
 
we collaborate with partners who 
supply our ingredients, packaging, 
transport and refrigeration on 
efficiencies and innovation that drive 
down their carbon footprint and ours. 
for example, partnerships are helping 
us drive progress in areas such as 
sustainable packaging and switching 
to renewable energy.  
 
originally, we set a fixed target to 
enter into 30 partnerships with 
suppliers to reduce our shared carbon 
footprint by 2022. partnerships have 
now become such an integral part of 
our approach that we have decided to 
stop tracking the number of 
partnerships and focus on their impact.  
 
this year, we were able to obtain 
primary data input on greenhouse gas 
emissions from suppliers representing 
more than 60% of our spend to inform 
our beer-in-hand carbon footprint 
analysis.  
 
more than 98 companies in our supply 
chain have joined the science based 
targets initiative, 12 of which account 
for more than 13% of our total carbon 
footprint and have a significant direct 
impact on our beer-in-hand targets.  
together with o-i glass, a supplier of 
our western european markets, we 
localised production of our grimbergen 
bottles in france at an energy-
efficient plant. the bottles are made 
using almost 80% recycled broken 
glass and delivered to our nearby 
kronenbourg brewery by train, a 
lower-carbon emission alternative to 
trucks. 
 
some of our key suppliers have 
adopted their own carbon-cutting 
roadmaps that support our 2022 and 
2030 targets to reduce our beer-in-
hand footprint. examples include two 
major beverage can suppliers, ball and 
crown.  
 
in 2020, ball completed two long-
term renewable energy agreements 
for 93.4 mw of new wind energy 
and secured additional guarantees of 
origin to address 100% of its energy 
load in western europe moving 
forward. meanwhile, crown has 
launched new goals to halve its 
operational emissions and source  
60% of its electricity from renewables 
by 2030.  
 
rethinking packaging  
high-profile campaigns and new 
regulations have put the 
environmental impacts of packaging, 
and particularly plastics, in the 
spotlight. 
 
our own packaging – including glass 
and plastic bottles, cans, kegs, 
plastic wrap and cardboard boxes – 
generates 41% of our beer-in-hand 
emissions. this is by far the largest 
part of our value chain carbon 
footprint.  
 
to cut the climate impacts of 
packaging, we invest in innovation 
and promote reuse and recycling. we 
are also developing industry-leading 
solutions to reduce our plastic 
packaging, which can have a wider 
environmental impact, particularly if 
it ends up in the world’s oceans (see 
feature on next page). 
 
aluminium cans are the containers 
we use most for our products and 
account for the biggest share of our 
emissions from packaging. this year, 
we partnered with suppliers to 
continue reducing their weight, use 
more recycled content and improve 
recycling rates after use. our beer-
in-hand analysis showed we cut 
emissions from cans by around 17% 
from 2015 to 2019 – a testament to 
the impact we and our suppliers can 
have when we work together.    
 
around the world, we support well-
established and efficient bottle return 
systems for consumers with high 
collection rates. in some markets we 
wash and refill returnable glass 
bottles. and in malaysia we 
implemented a protective coating 
that can make them last three times 
as long.  
 
many of our breweries support local 
initiatives to boost recycling rates for 
packaging. in 2019, baltika launched 
19 partnerships to operate 10,000 
recycling containers in 50 
municipalities across russia. and in 
2020, the powerhouse brand 
expanded its trial with retailer 
vkusvill to install vending machines 
in st. petersburg and moscow stores 
where consumers can drop off used 
cans and plastic bottles – the first 
initiative of its kind in the country.   
 
we are also experimenting with 
product packaging to reduce our 
carbon footprint. with our supplier 
ds smith, we are testing stronger, 
thinner cardboard boxes that could 
cut raw material use and related 
emissions from a multipack by 
around 20%. in 2020, we started 
trialling the boxes at our brewery in 
falkenberg, sweden. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carlsberg group sustainability report 2020   zero carbon footprint 
17 
 
 
 
we are continuing our efforts to 
reduce, recycle and avoid plastics.  
 
in 2020, we partnered with suppliers 
to extend our revolutionary snap pack 
technology to three more markets. 
launched in the uk in 2019, snap 
pack cuts plastic by up to 76% per 
multipack by replacing plastic shrink 
wrap or rings with glue dots that hold 
packs of cans together. it is now in 
use in denmark, estonia, france, 
germany, latvia, lithuania and the 
uk.  
 
we are getting closer to a “paper” 
beer bottle that can be launched 
commercially, with a trial planned for 
2021 pending regulatory approval 
with our technology partner, paboco. 
the green fibre bottle, made from 
sustainably sourced wood fibre, has 
the potential to offer a more 
sustainable alternative not only for 
beer, but for other drinks and liquid 
products. we were joined by other 
leading companies in the project, all 
of which have made good progress 
this year: coca-cola has launched its 
first prototype and absolut has 
launched a trial in sweden and  
the uk. 
 
we are also innovating in our use of 
recycled plastics for product 
packaging. we now use shrink film 
made of 100% recycled plastic in 
denmark, finland, france, norway, 
poland and sweden. for the karhu 
brand in finland alone, carbon 
savings will total 200 tonnes of co2e 
a year. meanwhile, in 2020, bon 
aqua in finland launched 100% 
recycled pet bottles, joining our 
imsdal brand in norway, which 
moved away from virgin plastic in 
2019. and we launched the first pet 
bottle-recycling machine in belarus 
together with supermarket and waste 
collection partners.

promoting sustainable 
agriculture  
the second biggest share of our 
value chain climate impact – 25% of 
emissions – comes from growing, 
malting and processing ingredients 
for our beers and other beverages.   
 
our business depends on a long-
term, sustainable supply of crops, 
mainly barley and rice. we generally 
purchase barley as a commodity. 
while we only work directly with 
farmers in one country, russia, we 
support sustainable agriculture more 
broadly in several ways.  
 
we invest in next-generation crops 
through the work of scientists at the 
carlsberg research laboratory. their 
ground-breaking efforts, highlighted 
on page 11, include developing 
climate-tolerant and high-yield 
varieties of barley.  
 
our beer-in-hand analysis enables 
us to identify drivers of emissions, 
which we will work on factoring into 
our purchasing decisions in the 
future. for example, higher-yield 
crops can significantly reduce carbon 
emissions from agriculture. this 
means we may buy grain from 
regions that produce higher yields 
even if this involves transporting our 
raw ingredients over longer 
distances, since it reduces overall 
carbon emissions.  
 
the energy used to malt grain for 
our beers – by our suppliers and at 
our own malting plants in russia – 
accounts for around 3% of our total 
value chain emissions. between 
2015 and 2019, we reduced carbon 
emissions from malting processes by 
19% for every hectolitre of beer 
produced. this was achieved through 
decarbonising efforts at our own 
plants and by our supplier viking, 
which has converted a large part of 
its heat generation to sustainable 
biomass. 
 
making our logistics 
smarter 
the logistics of getting our beer from 
breweries to warehouses and on to 
bars, restaurants and retailers by 
road, rail and sea account for 12% of 
beer-in-hand emissions.  
 
emissions from transport decreased 
by 12% between 2015 and 2019. we 
plan to take advantage of improving 
technology to make our fleet more 
sustainable. 
 
at our warehouses, whenever we 
replace machinery such as forklift 
trucks we aim to switch from natural 
gas and diesel to electric models, 
and from lead acid batteries to more 
efficient lithium ion batteries. to do 
this, we also need to invest in 
suitable infrastructure for charging 
electric vehicles. we now have over 
1,550 electric powered forklifts, 
making up around 70% of the fleet 
globally. 
 
outsourcing most of our outbound 
logistics enables us to make 
efficiency gains, including higher fill 
rates, by transporting our products 
alongside others. we set clear 
sustainability requirements in our 
contracts with logistics providers. for 
example, they must train drivers to 
maximise fuel efficiency, and track 
fuel use and emissions.   
 
in some markets, where we operate 
our own fleets, we use telematics 
programmes to monitor and improve 
our drivers’ awareness on the road. 
these have helped to cut emissions 
by improving fuel efficiency, as well 
as reducing accidents and vehicle 
wear and tear. in 2021, new route 
planning software will reduce our 
road mileage, further cutting 
emissions. in 2020, we took delivery 
of the first of our fleet of 26-tonne 
electric trucks in switzerland – the 
first of their kind manufactured by 
renault trucks. 
 
even at its most efficient, transport 
by road is a relatively high-carbon 
solution. we therefore look for 
opportunities to transport products 
by train wherever national rail 
networks allow. in 2020, we 
continued to use rail in denmark, 
france, kazakhstan, norway, 
russia, sweden, switzerland and 
ukraine.  
 
cutting impacts from 
cooling  
most of our products are best 
enjoyed chilled. the fridges and beer 
coolers used for our beer and 
beverages in bars, restaurants and 
retail stores account for 9% of our 
beer-in-hand footprint.  
 
we work closely with two major 
suppliers, frigoglass and klimasan, 
to adopt the latest market 
technologies and solutions, switching 
to more energy efficient fridges and 
refrigerants that have a lower 
climate impact. this proactive 
approach, combined with more 
electricity from renewable sources in 
national grids, reduced our 
refrigeration emissions by 21% from 
2015 to 2019.  
 
the fridges and beer coolers we 
provide to our retail customers last 
around eight years on average. to 
minimise their carbon footprint, all 
new models we buy must use led 
lighting and refrigerants such as 
hydrocarbons that have a lower 
climate impact than 
hydrofluorocarbons. in 2020, 97% of 
fridges and beer dispense equipment 
purchased through our central 
procurement team used low-
climate-impact hydrocarbons & led 
lightning.  
from 2021, we will introduce energy 
management systems in all 
replacement fridges, where feasible, 
to reduce electricity use and related 
carbon emissions. this will require 
additional investment from us, but it 
will save our customers energy and 
money – and help us reach our 2022 
and 2030 targets.

water shortages directly 
affect communities and our 
business. 
 
many parts of the world face 
increasing water scarcity challenges 
as the effects of climate change 
trigger droughts and alter rainfall 
patterns. as soon as 2025, two 
thirds of people worldwide may be 
dealing with water shortages. and by 
2050, almost half of global gdp 
could come from areas facing high 
water risk.1 
 
water is an essential ingredient in 
our products, and other key 
ingredients, such as grain and hops, 
need it to grow. put simply, no water 
means no beer. with 17 of our 
breweries located where water risk is 
high, our focus on pushing the 
boundaries of efficiency and 
technology is both a business and a 
sustainability priority.  
 
industries like ours have a big role to 
play in safeguarding water supplies 
wherever we operate. that is why 
we have set ambitious global targets 
for zero water waste.  
 
by 2030, we aim to halve the 
amount of water used to make every 
hectolitre (hundred litres) of beer. 
we have already achieved an 18% 
reduction through best practice 
efficiency and water treatment 
upgrades at our breweries. and we 
will accelerate progress with state-
of-the-art water-recycling 
technology.  
 
in 2020, we updated our water risk 
assessment for 81 of our 86 
majority-owned breweries and 
finalised a ground-breaking scenario 
analysis with wwf to prepare for 
future risks to our business. the 
findings will help us prioritise actions 
as we work with partners to protect 
and improve water supplies for the 
communities whose resources we 
share. we disclose our management 
of water risks to the cdp and 
achieved an a- rating in the latest 
assessment.

brewed and bottled in central 
vietnam for 30 years, our popular 
huda brand is deeply rooted in its 
local communities.  
 
many people across the region still 
get their drinking water from 
unhygienic wells or ponds, store 
rainwater or are forced to buy costly 
bottled water to avoid drinking from 
contaminated supplies. even where 
public taps are available, they often 
run dry.  
 
the brewery put our commitment to 
safeguard shared water resources 
into action – bringing clean water at 
the turn of a tap to almost 20,000 
people. we partnered with local 
authorities to construct new water 
infrastructure in five provinces, 
including thua thien hue, where the 
brewery is based.  
first, we identified the communities 
most in need, then we collaborated 
with local people to plan how best to 
provide clean, reliable fresh water. 
projects included installing or 
repairing water pipelines, reservoirs, 
wells, pumping stations, filter tanks, 
water flow meters and a concrete 
dam.  
 
the projects we completed in 2019 
serve around 5,500 people. in 2020, 
we accelerated expansion to support 
over 14,000 more people as the 
covid-19 pandemic made the need 
for reliable clean water even more 
urgent.

eliminating 
water waste 
from brewing 
operations  
 
we employ best practices and the 
latest technologies to continually 
improve the efficiency of our 86 
breweries and avoid any water being 
wasted. our focus on efficiency 
reduces costs and the risks to our 
business, as well as delivering 
sustainability benefits.  
 
in 2020, it took 2.8 hl of water for 
our breweries to produce 1 hl of 
beer. that represents a 7% 
improvement on 2019, saving more 
than 1,100 olympic swimming pools 
of water. overall, the water 
efficiency of our breweries has 
improved by 18% since 2015.  
 
 
 
 
 
to meet our 2022 target (see box) 
and reduce our reliance on fresh 
water, we will combine continued 
efficiency upgrades with investments 
in wastewater recycling and reuse. 
we are building an advanced 
wastewater recycling plant in 
denmark and are assessing the 
opportunities for other breweries.  
 
implementing best-in-
class efficiency measures 
we maintain rigorous environmental 
management standards at all our 
breweries (see page 12) that support 
continuous improvement. to drive 
progress towards our targets, our 
breweries invest in making water-
intensive cleaning and production 
processes more efficient. highlights 
from 2020 include 
 
• vietnam: the phu bai brewery 
installed two new bottle washers 
that, combined with best practice 
water management, have helped 
cut water use from 3.24 to 2.48 
hl/hl of beer produced. this will 
save the equivalent of 75 olympic 
swimming pools per year.  
 
• china: our dazhulin brewery is at 
the forefront of implementing 
carlsberg operating practices in 
water management (see feature on 
next page).  
• india: our mysuru brewery was 
recognised as a noteworthy water-
efficient unit in the 2020 
confederation of indian industries 
national awards for excellence in 
water management. 
 
innovating to reuse 
wastewater 
treating and reusing wastewater 
offers huge potential to shrink our 
water footprint, while creating biogas 
for our heat use. we have 58 
wastewater treatment plants in 
operation at our breweries. 
 
at our fredericia brewery in 
denmark, we are investing in 
advanced recycling technology that 
will make it the world’s first brewery 
to virtually eliminate water waste. 
once operational, the new water-
recycling plant will halve water 
consumption at the brewery, cutting 
the amount of water used to produce 
each hectolitre of beer from 2.9 hl to 
1.4 hl.  
 
construction of the plant began in 
2020 and the danish minister for 
higher education and science 
attended a ceremony at the site (see 
quote on next page), along with our 
partners in drip – the public-private 
partnership behind the project.

what we 
mean by zero 
water waste 
 
 
breweries: we aim to progressively 
eliminate water waste in our 
operations by reducing water use at 
all our majority-owned breweries 
(including soft drinks and water 
plants, but excluding malting sites). 
all our operations at these sites are 
covered, including offices, production 
and warehousing. 
 
our targets are to reduce relative 
water use by 25% by 2022 and by 
50% by 2030 compared with the 
2015 baseline performance of 3.4 
hectolitres (hundred litres) of water 
used to produce 1 hectolitre of our 
beer and beverages (3.4 hl/hl).  
 
communities: we will begin 
partnering to safeguard shared 
water resources for communities in 
areas identified as high-risk by 2022 
and have a partnership in place in all 
high-risk areas by 2030.

other significant progress included 
building a state-of-the-art 
wastewater treatment plant at our 
shumen brewery in bulgaria, which 
will begin operating in 2021. in 
eastern europe we built three 
wastewater treatment plants, in 
novosibirsk, rostov and st. 
petersburg. in india, our alwar 
brewery introduced a rooftop 
rainwater harvesting system and 
extended wastewater recycling. a 
new water-recycling plant planned 
for our kolkata brewery was not 
installed due to covid-19 
lockdowns. 
 
looking further into the future, our 
young scientists community – a 
team of postdoctoral researchers 
based at the carlsberg research 
laboratory – developed a promising 
prototype that will reduce the water 
and chemicals needed for brewery 
cleaning.  
 
measuring every drop 
we source water for our operations 
from municipal supplies, boreholes at 
our own sites and surface water. we 
continually monitor intake at both 
site and global level to drive 
improvements and understand 
broader performance trends. in 
2020, our total water consumption 
decreased by 8% to 33 million m3.  
 
 
we want to make 
denmark a green and 
sustainable pioneer 
country, and one of the 
things that means a lot to 
me is how we make more 
green research work in 
society. here in fredericia, 
you have done it, across 
business, government and 
researchers.

water. based on this analysis, the team 
introduced measures such as reusing water in 
cleaning processes and using less water in 
bottle washing and pasteurisation. these have 
delivered big results for little additional cost.  
 
in just four months, the team reduced water 
used in beer production by 18% – from 2.7 to 
2.2 hl/hl. dazhulin’s striking success brings the 
brewery close to achieving our 2022 target to 
explore going below 2.0 hl/hl at sites in areas 
of high water risk. we are now sharing the 
team’s approach and lessons learned as best 
practice across our breweries. 
our dedicated team at the dazhulin brewery  
in china has made it their mission to 
dramatically reduce water waste. the brewery, 
one of our priority sites for water risk, is 
located within the yangtze river basin.   
 
the team scrutinised brewing and packing 
processes, checked all water pipes to detect 
any leaks, inefficiencies or blind spots, and 
installed more water meters to get a fuller 
picture of water use in specific areas of 
production. 
 
they also asked employees at every level to 
use their experience to share ideas for saving

mapping our 
water risk  
preparing for a world where water is 
increasingly scarce helps us build a 
more resilient business and better 
support the communities whose 
natural resources we share. in 2020, 
we worked closely with wwf to gain 
a better understanding of water risk.  
 
identifying high-risk 
breweries  
we assessed 81 of our majority-
owned breweries1 across europe and 
asia using wwf’s leading water risk 
filter tool.  
 
to gain a complete picture, we 
collected and evaluated data on a 
wide range of river basin and 
operational risks2. these included 
vulnerability to floods, water scarcity 
and poor water quality, and the 
potential for regulatory action or 
reputational challenges such as 
media scrutiny or community 
conflict. in evaluating sites, we also 
factored in each brewery’s size and 
anticipated growth.  
 
this assessment – the most detailed 
we have ever conducted – enabled 
us to rank sites by risk level, so we 
can plan interventions accordingly. 
the results showed that none of our 
breweries currently face high overall 
operational risks. however, 17 
breweries were identified as being in 
high-risk areas, spread across nine 
major river basins in asia (see map). 
together, these breweries account 
for 17% of our global production 
volume.  
 
modelling water risk 
scenarios 
climate and water risks are closely 
connected, especially for businesses 
like ours that depend on reliable 
water supply in many parts of the 
world.  
 
in 2020, we worked with wwf on a 
ground-breaking addition to its 
water risk filter – forward-looking 
scenarios to help us better 
understand our global water risk in a 
changing climate. 
 
we were the first multinational to test 
and use the tool, which enables 
businesses to explore scenarios for 
2030 and 2050 based on current 
trends as well as both optimistic and 
pessimistic alternatives. the findings 
on likely changes in water availability 
and quality will help us evaluate 
future risks to our breweries and how 
we can best prepare. wwf has now 
incorporated the scenarios into its 
water risk tool, to be used by 
thousands of companies globally.   
 
mapping water risk for our breweries 
and local communities will help us 
work towards our 2022 goal to 
explore reducing water use below 
2.0 hl/hl at all high-risk breweries 
and prioritise local partnerships to 
protect shared water sources.  
 
 
companies are finally 
waking up to growing 
water risks and the need 
to take urgent action to 
reduce their risks and 
tackle shared water 
challenges. by harnessing 
the new scenarios in the 
water risk filter tool, 
companies and investors 
can better assess, 
respond and plan for 
climate and water 
resilience.

1 the water risk assessment did not cover five carlsberg microbreweries in europe, which together account for 
around 0.1% of our total production volume. 
2 the methodology used was more comprehensive than our 2016 assessment, which focused only on river 
basin risks. in 2020, we scored sites on four factors, weighted as follows: basin risks (33.33%), operational 
risks (33.33%), site size (16.67%) and growth projections (16.67%).

partnering to 
protect the 
water we 
share  
thriving healthy communities and 
freshwater ecosystems around our 
breweries are essential to our business 
success. these communities around 
the world rely on the water we share, 
and we have a responsibility to help 
protect this essential natural resource.  
 
investing in water stewardship helps 
us build strong relationships with 
communities and regulators, and 
supports our licence to brew now and 
in the future as water becomes 
scarcer.  
 
by 2030, we aim to partner to 
safeguard shared water resources in 
all high-risk areas with breweries. 
identifying our 17 breweries in high-
risk areas – in cambodia, china, india, 
laos and nepal – is an important step 
towards this goal.  
 
we already have water access 
projects underway or in the pipeline in 
river basins serving several of these 
breweries, as well as in vietnam, 
where our huda brand has set a 
strong example (see page 21).  
our projects range from improving 
water access in homes and schools to 
restoring habitats and installing 
innovative technology. some involve 
international ngo partners and 
extensive community engagement, 
while others are initiated directly by 
our breweries based on their 
knowledge of local needs.  
 
in 2020, we partnered with wwf and 
the university of kathmandu to 
consult stakeholders and research 
water-related health risks and 
management in the narayani river 
region in nepal. based on the 
findings, in 2021 we will begin 
projects to restore wetlands, which 
will help purify water and maintain a 
stable supply for local communities 
and freshwater ecosystems.   
 
in india, we have developed plans to 
fund clean drinking water and 
sanitation improvements at three 
schools in alwar and mysuru that 
currently lack soap, running water 
and other hygiene essentials. our 
technology partner desolenator and 
social enterprise ecosoftt will support 
delivery of these projects in 2021.

standard for corporate sustainability. it’s been a privilege to work with such incredible cross-
sector organisations, as well as the women entrepreneurs in the sundarbans. the impact of  
this collaboration goes beyond the provisioning of clean water. it is a demonstration of the 
transformational potential of convening partners around a shared vision of the future.

responsibly and that we 
provide consumers with 
choices that support a 
balanced lifestyle. 
our brands sit at the heart of social 
occasions and play a positive role in 
the lives of millions of people around 
the world. drinking cultures are 
improving in many regions, including 
europe, where heavy episodic 
drinking is declining in 29 of 30 
countries.1 
 
covid-19 has reinforced the 
importance of healthy lifestyles for 
many people around the world. but 
misuse of alcohol – like drinking 
when underage, while driving or to 
excess – remains a global health 
concern. that is why we are 
committed to promoting zero 
irresponsible drinking in all our 
markets.   
 
people make their own decisions 
about how they consume our 
products, but we aim to enable, 
inform and encourage them to 
enjoy responsibly.  
 
we are stepping up efforts to avoid 
marketing to minors and include 
responsible drinking messages, as 
well as ingredient and nutritional 
information, on our product 
packaging and online. we partner 
with governments, customers and 
ngos to tackle alcohol-related 
challenges in each market. and we 
are rapidly expanding our range of 
alcohol-free brews (afbs). 
 
our commitment to responsible 
drinking is the right thing to do. it 
also helps to protect the reputation 
of our business and the brewing 
industry, and supports our ability to 
partner with regulators. as 
consumers prioritise healthy choices, 
our afbs are creating new revenue

drink-driving remains a problem in 
malaysia, where several recent 
traffic fatalities have emphasised the 
dangers of driving after consuming 
alcohol. our team is supporting 
government efforts to change 
consumer mindsets and behaviour.  
 
in 2020, the country’s road 
transport act was amended to lower 
the blood alcohol level permitted 
while driving to align with world 
health organization recommenda-
tions. it also introduced harsher 
penalties for drink-driving. education 
and personal responsibility are of 
equal importance in ensuring 
progress on reducing drink-driving 
incidents.  
 
on global beer responsibility day, 
we launched our sixth annual 
campaign supporting people to 
#celebrateresponsibly in partnership 
with several ride-hailing services. 
the campaign discouraged drink-
driving by offering people discounted 
rides home after a night out any 
time from 7 pm to midnight.  
 
consumers at more than 1,800 of 
our affiliated bars, bistros and 
restaurants around the country used 
smartphone apps to access discounts 
from our established partners, grab 
and riding pink, a women-only 
ride-hailing service. we also 
partnered with three other 
chauffeuring services – socar+, 
lailah and drivesafe – that each 
offered a 10% discount on fares.  
 
to increase consumer awareness and 
education, we partnered with leading 
newspapers sin chew daily and the 
star to publish articles and videos on 
the new laws and ways to avoid 
drink-driving.  
the six-week campaign, our biggest 
yet, provided around 5,700 
discounted rides from grabcar and 
riding pink alone. since 2015, this 
annual ride-hailing campaign has 
reached more than 81,000 
consumers on the ground, and in 
2020 it connected with an additional 
4.5 million people through digital 
channels.

expanding 
choices with 
alcohol-free 
brews 
 
we offer consumers a wide range of 
tasty, positive choices to help them 
drink responsibly. these include 
beers with a range of alcohol 
content, including our increasingly 
popular alcohol-free brews (afbs). 
and we continue to develop our 
products, focusing on great taste and 
a better consumer experience. 
 
we have set a target to ensure that 
by 2022 all customers and partners 
in all our operating markets have 
access to our afb portfolio, 
wherever carlsberg brands are sold. 
we currently offer alcohol-free 
variants in 48 domestic and export 
markets.    
 
our afb sales by volume climbed by 
11% in 2020 (83% since 2015) as 
offerings expanded and consumers 
looked to moderate alcohol 
consumption during lockdowns. the 
category outperformed our 
mainstream beers, which were more 
affected by covid-19-related 
restrictions on bars and restaurants.  
 
meeting evolving demand 
during covid-19 
consumer demand is being driven by 
a shift to healthy lifestyles that has 
been strengthened by the covid-19 
pandemic. nearly one in three 
people said they drank less – or 
stopped altogether – during 
lockdowns, according to a nine-
country survey by the international 
alliance for responsible drinking.1  
 
the impact of this trend was striking 
in some of our markets. at our 
feldschlösschen brewery in 
switzerland, we saw a 40% rise in 
afb sales during march and april 
compared with the same months in 
2019. the brewery created around 
336,000 litres of high-proof alcohol, 
extracted during afb production, to 
be turned into disinfectant gel to 
combat hospital shortages. in 
sweden, online sales of afbs soared 
by as much as 350% from march to 
september 2020 compared with the 
same period in 2019.   
 
despite covid-19 restrictions in 
2020, we pressed ahead with our 
first afb launches in asia, where the 
category is less developed. we 
successfully launched carlsberg 
alcohol free pilsner and carlsberg 
alcohol free wheat, first in 
singapore and then in hong kong. 
and chongqing lager in china 
became our first local powerhouse 
brand to launch an afb in asia.

consumers want transparency from 
food and beverage companies. we 
provide clear product information 
that allows people everywhere to 
make informed choices and enjoy 
our beer safely and in moderation. 
we collaborate with industry 
associations, local partners and 
governments to reduce alcohol-
related harm in line with 
recommendations from the world 
health organization.  
 
improving product 
information  
we use our product labels to send 
clear messages about responsible 
drinking to consumers – such as text 
or icons warning people not to drink 
while driving, pregnant or underage.  
 
having achieved our target to put 
this messaging in place across our 
product portfolio, together with other 
members of the international 
alliance for responsible drinking 
(iard) we are now focusing 
specifically on strengthening 
messages about underage drinking.  
 
we continue to include nutritional 
information, such as calorie counts, 
on our product labels and online. by 
2022, we will do this for all beers 
sold in the eu as part of the brewers 
of europe proud to be clear 
voluntary agreement with the 
european commission, and our aim 
is to achieve this globally.

super bock also partnered with a portuguese 
distillery to turn the alcohol removed during

disinfectant gel that was donated to hospitals 
across the country. 
super bock group, a carlsberg joint venture in 
portugal, found a unique way to thank 
frontline health workers battling covid-19.  
 
the company made a special edition of its 
alcohol-free offering, changing the name from 
super bock free to super doc for four months. 
the alcohol-free brews were delivered to 
hospitals with thank-you cards for doctors and 
nurses.

accelerating actions to 
reduce underage drinking  
through the iard, we have made a 
strong commitment with others in 
our industry to accelerate action to 
prevent underage drinking.  
 
our new target to add legal age 
symbols or text to all alcohol 
products and afb extensions sends a 
clear message to all communities 
that our beer, wine and spirits should 
not be bought or consumed by 
minors.  
 
consumers increasingly engage with 
us online and on social media. we 
are working with industry peers and 
digital platform owners, including 
facebook, snapchat and youtube, 
to implement rigorous online 
safeguards that prevent minors from 
seeing or interacting with our brands 
online.  
 
we also plan to step up 
collaboration with retailers, 
wholesalers and distributors on best-
practice initiatives for age 
verification, including developing 
global standards for online alcohol 
sales and delivery. 
 
our marketing 
requirements 
these new commitments and 
partnerships support our digital 
guiding principles, based on iard 
guidelines designed to restrict those 
under the legal drinking age from 
seeing our marketing on online 
platforms and social media. 
 
in early 2021, we will launch our 
updated global marketing 
communication policy which sets 
strict controls to ensure that all our 
advertising, communications and 
promotions meet our high standards 
as a responsible brewer. these 
include:  
• design communications to appeal 
to adult audiences 
• restrict people under the legal 
drinking age from being exposed to 
our communications 
• advocate responsible drinking and 
enjoyment in moderation 
• never associate consumption of our 
products with drink driving, 
potentially dangerous activities or 
antisocial behaviour 
• never claim that alcohol can 
contribute to individual success, 
enhance abilities or benefit health 
• provide transparent information 
about our products 
• communicate legally, truthfully 
and respectfully, championing 
social inclusion and environmental 
sustainability 
• offer choice through alcohol-free 
brews and market them responsibly  
 
monitoring compliance 
we are prioritising safeguards for 
digital channels and online sales 
platforms, which have become more 
popular during covid-19 
lockdowns. 
 
in 2020, we introduced a new 
centralised system to better monitor 
local market compliance with our 
safeguards. results showed 90.6% 
compliance with all five digital 
guiding principles across global 
channels, an increase from 87%  
compliance in 2019. content is 
regularly updated and requires 
regular monitoring. in the rare event 
that we find problems, we direct 
local marketing teams to fix them 
quickly.

our brewers’ ambition 
2022 is a significant step 
in demonstrating our 
members’ leadership in 
ensuring all beers label

alcoholic beverages 
should be providing

encouraging 
responsible 
behaviour 
harmful drinking behaviours and 
trends vary from country to country. 
we work with local partners who can 
help us identify national priorities – 
such as underage drinking, drink-
driving or drinking to excess – and 
target action where it will make the 
most difference in each market.  
 
these partners include local and 
national governments, police 
departments, supermarket chains, 
ngos, social research institutes and 
ride-hailing companies. together, 
we engage with customers and 
consumers to encourage responsible 
choices.  
 
as markets track progress against 
their locally developed targets, we 
will use this information to measure 
progress against our global 2030 
target for 100% of markets to 
improve on responsible drinking year 
on year. 
 
in 2020, there were fewer 
responsible drinking campaigns than 
in 2019. this is due to restrictions as 
a result of covid-19, including the 
closure of the on-trade in many 
markets and the cancellation of 
festivals and events. however, our 
local initiatives still reached more 
than 35.5 million people in 2020. 
examples include: 
• bulgaria: our yearly campaign with 
the union of bulgarian brewers to 
support healthy adolescents and 
families reached 1,160 people.  
• denmark: we ran a pilot with the 
danish centre for social research at 
aarhus university using targeted 
text messages to encourage 
students to drink less.   
• finland: our karhu 0.0 afb 
launched a zero january social 
media campaign that reached 
473,000 people during a month 
when many choose to abstain from 
alcohol.  
• france: kronenbourg led a coalition 
of drinks companies to prevent 
harmful drinking behaviour, 
partnering with 80,000 cafés, bars 
and restaurants.      
• laos: our beerlao brand, the 
country’s bestselling beer, funded 
billboards and handed out 8,500 
stickers to drivers in support of the 
government’s anti-drink-driving 
campaign. 
• latvia: the results of our survey on 
what motivates bad driving habits, 
conducted with the safe driving 
school and the latvian state 
police, generated strong media and 
public interest. 
• norway: we partnered with major 
grocery chains and the national 
brewers’ association to prevent 
alcohol sales to minors through in-
store advertising and training sales 
teams. an annual survey by 
juvente, a youth temperance 
organisation, found a 20% decline 
in alcohol sales by stores to 
underage customers. 
• uk: we continued our partnership 
with the drinkaware trust, whose 
drink free days campaign 
attracted 1 million unique visitors 
to the website, pledging 27,800 
drink-free days. 
 
expanding alcolocks in 
company vehicles 
alcolocks prevent people from 
driving if they are over the legal 
blood alcohol limit. in many markets 
where there are no legal restraints to 
do so, we use these in our company 
vehicles to encourage responsible 
behaviour. in 2020, 48% of our cars 
in western europe and 50% in 
eastern europe were fitted with 
alcolocks (up from 37% and 31% in 
2019). we plan to continue this roll-
out in 2021.

we celebrate global beer 
responsibility day in september 
every year. covid-19 restrictions 
curtailed many of the experiential 
activities we had planned for 2020, 
but our teams around the world 
came up with other creative ways to 
deliver positive drinking messages. 
together, they reached 22.5 million 
people.  
 
our ukraine team saw an 
opportunity to use ubiquitous 
facemasks as a tool to promote 
responsible drinking. they created 
masks for retail customers carrying a 
message for minors trying to buy 
alcohol: “we sell responsibly because 
we care.”  
 
in russia, we reached 7 million 
people through a social media 
campaign aiming to combat 
underage drinking by asking for 
honest answers about how old 
people were when they first tried 
alcohol and how they talk about it 
with their children. we also teamed 
up with artists in kazakhstan and 
popular musicians in serbia to 
channel responsible drinking 
messages. 
 
in china, we partnered with the 
police in chongqing to warn 
consumers of the dangers of drink-
driving, including using simulation 
goggles to let them experience the 
impairing effects of alcohol. in 
malaysia, we partnered with ride-
hailing services to offer discounted 
rides home for patrons using our 
affiliated bars and restaurants (see 
page 28).

the health and safety of our 
people always comes first. we 
want everyone to go home 
safe every day. 
we believe all accidents are 
preventable. by 2030, we aim to 
make them a thing of the past by 
instilling a zero accidents culture.  
 
everyone at carlsberg is responsible 
for their own safety and the safety 
of those around them. we aim to 
empower our people to identify 
unsafe behaviours and take action to 
help their colleagues adopt safe 
ways of working.  
 
managers at all levels of the 
business lead by example, making 
safety a personal priority to help 
them demonstrate strong and 
credible leadership. part of their role 
is to make sure that every individual 
in their team complies with safety 
rules and keeps safety top of mind.  
 
we manage key risks through our 
health and safety management 
systems, training and compliance 
with our stringent standards, 
including our life saving rules that 
everyone must follow at all times.  
 
our relentless focus on safety is 
working, with accident rates falling 
for four years in a row. we aim to 
reach zero lost-time accidents 
across the business by 2030. 
 
staying safe and healthy enables our 
people to live full and productive 
lives at home and at work – and 
makes our business more efficient. in 
2020, we stepped up our support for

almost all accidents share a 
common root cause: unsafe 
behaviour. that is why we put 
behaviour-based safety at the heart 
of our zero accidents culture. 
 
at the start of 2020, four specially 
trained truck drivers in the 
distribution team took on an 
important new role as safety 
ambassadors for our feldschlösschen 
brewery in switzerland. every day, 
they reinforce the message that 
safety is everybody’s responsibility 
and that nobody should just walk 
past if they see anything unsafe. 
 
drawing on their experience and 
safety training, the ambassadors 
help other drivers and employees 
understand how to spot unsafe 
behaviour and risks in their working 
environment and take action for 
improvement. this could be speaking 
to a colleague or showing them how 
to work in a safe way instead. or 
working with a customer to create a 
safer delivery point. 
 
all four ambassadors are 
experienced members of our 
distribution team and they know the 
delivery process by heart – from 
safely loading and unloading vehicles 
to safe driving. they act as role 
models for safe behaviour as they 
accompany other truck drivers on 
their routes delivering beer to 
customers and event venues across 
the country, helping them stay safe 
every step of the way.  
 
changing culture and behaviour 
takes time, but our system of 
observations and feedback is 
designed to open people’s eyes to 
things they are doing that they may 
not even realise are unsafe. the 
ambassadors are helping to make 
sure safe behaviour is an integrated 
part of the working culture at 
feldschlösschen. 
 
together, we will create a zero 
accidents culture.

  creating safety ambassadors for our distribution

anchored in the day-to-day business and are making an 
important contribution on our journey towards zero 
accidents.”

driving down 
accident 
rates 
 
in 2020, there were 116 lost-time 
accidents among employees, and the 
employee accident rate dropped by 
19% to 3.0. we have now reduced 
our accident rate by 55% since 2015 
as we work towards zero accidents 
by 2030. including contractors, there 
were 155 lost-time accidents, 23% 
fewer than in 2019. 
 
our safety initiatives have continued 
to drive down our accident rate, with 
year-on-year progress at the start 
of 2020. as a result of covid-19, 
the accident rate dropped even 
further through the year as the 
pandemic heightened awareness of 
health and safety, and government 
restrictions led to fewer hours being 
worked. 
 
responding to serious 
incidents 
any accident is one too many. 
serious accidents are unacceptable. 
 
we deeply regret that a contractor 
lost his life during dismantling work 
at our former chelyabinsk production 
site in russia in january 2020. there 
were also two other serious 
accidents this year, which resulted in 
severe finger injuries to an employee 
in cambodia and a contractor in 
germany. we completed thorough 
investigations of the incidents and 
strengthened our controls for 
contractor management. we set the 
following programme objectives: 
• a consistent end-to-end contractor 
management process to prevent 
serious accidents.  
• a robust fatality prevention 
framework through compliance 
with the life saving rules.  
• a structured permit-to-work 
system for high-hazard activities. 
 
we identify health and safety 
compliance during execution of high-
hazard contractor works as a key 
focus area and we are strengthening 
our contractor management 
standards globally (see page 39).

accidents: we define these as lost-time 
accidents that result in an employee 
being unable to perform their full range of 
normal duties for at least one day, 
excluding the day of the accident. we are 
aiming for zero by 2030. 
 
accident rate: this is calculated as the 
number of lost-time accidents multiplied 
by 1,000 and divided by the number of 
full-time employees. we are targeting 
year-on-year reductions by 2022.

managing 
risks 
health and safety management 
systems at our production sites 
support continuous improvement in 
risk management and performance. 
these are certified to iso 
45001:2018 at 77 of our breweries. 
 
our health & safety policy includes 
our commitment to create a robust 
zero accidents culture and key 
elements of our approach to 
managing risks. it is supported by 
detailed standards, guidance and 
training on risks relevant to specific 
roles. 
 
embedding our life  
saving rules 
the policy includes our life saving 
rules, which distil our safety 
standards into clear and simple 
mantras that everyone must follow 
(see box). the five rules focus on our 
biggest risks – road traffic (on and 
off site), working at height or in 
confined spaces, and working with 
electricity or machinery that has 
moving parts.  
 
a big push to communicate the life 
saving rules and ensure they are 
applied in every relevant situation 
has contributed to a significant drop 
in accident rates since 2018. in 
2020, we increased compliance with 
the life saving rules to 94% across 
the business (up from 90% in 2019). 
 
by keeping safety top of mind, our 
focus on these key risks has also 
helped us tackle other issues that 
can cause less severe but more 
frequent accidents, such as slips, 
trips and falls. 
 
targeting road safety 
risks 
in 2020, we continued to roll out 
training on road safety risks for 
company drivers across the business, 
including truck drivers and sales 
teams.  
 
more than 11,000 employees – 95% 
of our drivers – completed our new 
online training on road safety in 
2020 and we aim to reach 100% in 
2021. practical training has been 
postponed to 2021 due to covid-19 
restrictions. 
 
around 2,260 employees have now 
completed two-wheeler training in 
asia, where a significant number of 
employees ride scooters or 
motorcycles to visit customers. 
 
instilling a 
safety 
culture 
our behaviour safety programme is 
central to building a zero accidents 
culture. we are initially rolling this 
out to production and logistics teams 
worldwide, as these are two of the 
highest risk areas of our business. 
we also provide safety behavioural 
training for sales teams. 
 
the premise of this approach is to 
encourage everyone working with us 
to look out for safety risks and 
unsafe behaviours, report their 
observations and act on them. this is 
not about blame, and we make it 
very clear that nobody should judge 
or feel like they are being judged. it 
is about taking action, caring for 
each other and helping colleagues to 
adopt safe behaviours. 
 
training our people to 
stay vigilant 
we provide training that is designed 
to empower people to notice when 
something looks unsafe or someone 
is doing something in an unsafe way. 
it emphasises the importance of 
providing positive reinforcement by 
recognising safe ways of working as 
well as identifying safe and unsafe 
behaviours. 
•  
our leaders took the training first to 
secure their commitment, encourage 
them to lead by example and help 
them coach their teams. over the 
last three years, we have trained 
6,000 leaders. this year, we also 
trained safety champions at our 
breweries across eastern europe to 
act as ambassadors for our 
behaviour-based safety programme.  
 
globally, we have begun focusing 
more on peer-to-peer observations 
and feedback to encourage people to 
interact directly with each other 
about safe and unsafe behaviours, 
and overcome any reluctance to 
report on colleagues. 
 
we have introduced new pocket 
cards for people to carry with them 
so they are always ready to observe, 
spot and act on safe and unsafe 
behaviours (see image). the cards 
contain tips tailored to employees 
and leaders, and we have rolled out 
training on how to put these tips into 
practice. training conducted virtually 
due to covid-19 will be reinforced 
with practical coaching sessions on 
site once restrictions are lifted.

acting on safety 
observations 
of the 306,377 safety observations 
recorded across our business in 
2020, 265,594 were recorded by our 
production and logistics teams, an 
average of 14.0 per employee in 
these functions. around 97% of 
employees in these roles are now 
actively reporting observations.  
 
site and team leaders conducted 
133,694 safety walks, including 
128,487 in production and logistics, 
checking safe working environments 
and behaviours first-hand.  
safety observations from employees 
and leaders help us identify risks and 
define actions to address them. we 
track implementation of these 
actions at each of our sites and 
monitor how many actions have 
been closed.  
 
 
working with 
contractors 
contractors work alongside our 
employees to provide additional 
labour during seasonal production 
peaks and to support infrastructure 
projects to improve facilities. 
management of these contractors is a 
critical element of our health and 
safety policy.  
 
in 2020, we introduced a new safety 
standard specifically for temporary 
contract workers and achieved 93% 
compliance by the end of the year. 
like employees, all contract workers 
receive safety training as part of their 
induction, as well as specific training 
relevant to their role. we also use a 
buddy system to partner each 
contract worker with an experienced 
employee to coach them on safe 
behaviours.  
 
for contractors supporting 
infrastructure projects at our sites, we 
include safety criteria at every stage 
of our partnership – from qualification 
and selection to induction and 
performance evaluation. this year, we 
achieved 94% compliance with our 
contractor management standards. in 
2020, there were 39 lost-time 
accidents involving contractors. 
 
 
supporting 
employee 
health and 
wellbeing 
helping our people stay well at work 
and at home was a priority this year 
through the unprecedented covid-
19 pandemic. 
our operations in china were among 
the first affected, and we applied the 
best practices we developed there to 
create global guidelines and enable a 
rapid response across the business. 
throughout the pandemic, we have 
closely monitored and aligned our 
approach with guidance issued by 
the world health organization. 
 
the covid-19 guidelines we 
developed enabled local crisis 
management teams to adapt and 
respond to the rapidly evolving 
pandemic situation and related 
regulations. the guidelines set out a 
series of mandatory measures to 
prevent the spread of the virus, as 
well as recommended practices and 
tips on keeping employees informed.  
 
measures to stay healthy at work 
included social distancing, more 
frequent disinfection of shared 
spaces, additional personal 
protective equipment, and keeping 
teams separated through shift 
patterns and smart working 
schemes. our rigorous approach 
enabled us to keep production 
running at all our breweries 
throughout 2020, except where 
government restrictions enforced 
closures. 
 
if an employee presented with 
symptoms, we asked them to stay at 
home, phone a doctor and inform 
their manager. we then 
decontaminated any areas where 
they had been working and activated 
our tracing systems to identify who 
that employee had been in close 
contact with to ensure they also 
quarantined. as an extra precaution, 
we also informed and monitored the 
condition of others who had been 
near the affected individual but not 
in close contact.  
 
outside the roles that have to be 
performed on site, many of our 
employees have worked from home 
for an extended period during the 
pandemic to support our efforts to 
prevent the spread of the virus. we 
provided training and tools to 
support them. 
 
our ceo, cees ’t hart, issued 
personal video messages every week 
at the height of the covid-19 
restrictions to keep employees 
engaged. some markets used pulse 
surveys to check on wellbeing, and 
we created a global toolbox to help 
managers better support their teams 
through covid-19 challenges, 
including providing guidance on how

responsible  
business  
doing business responsibly  
is fundamental to protect our 
reputation, achieve our business 
goals and deliver our together 
towards zero programme. 
we do this by contributing to economies, acting 
with integrity, respecting and supporting people,  
sourcing responsibly and ensuring product safety.  
our responsible approach supports several of the  
un sustainable development goals.

contributing 
to economies 
 
 
our business and our products play 
an important role in economies, 
supply chains and communities 
around the world.  
 
we make a significant contribution 
to local and national economies 
through the jobs we create and the 
taxes we generate. in doing so, we 
are also supporting un sustainable 
development goal 8 to promote 
sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth.  
 
 
creating jobs 
we directly employed more than 
40,000 people in our majority-
owned businesses around the world 
at the end of 2020.  
 
in addition to this direct 
employment, our business indirectly 
created an estimated 1.09 million 
further jobs for people involved in 
supplying our raw ingredients and 
serving our beer to consumers1. that 
is equivalent to 28 for every single 
carlsberg employee.  
 
the number of indirect jobs we 
generated fell this year due to the 
effects of the covid-19 pandemic, 
particularly in the hospitality sector 
as bars and restaurants were shut for 
extended periods in many countries. 
 
many of the jobs we create provide 
vital employment opportunities for 
people in rural areas, particularly 
through our agricultural supply chain 
and breweries that are located away 
from cities.

generating economic value 
in 2020, we generated dkk 85bn1 in 
total economic value. while 
remaining substantial, this total is 
11% lower than in 2019 due to 
covid-19 restrictions that affected 
our business. the decrease highlights 
the need for governments to support 
brewing and related sectors so that 
together we can continue our vital 
role in sustaining livelihoods.  
 
generating taxes in the regions 
where we operate is one of the ways 
we contribute to the un sustainable 
development goals, specifically 
target 8.1 to sustain per capita 
economic growth. in our tax policy, 
we set out our commitment to fulfil 
our global tax obligations and 
contribute to the societies in which 
we do business. our business and 
our beer generate substantial 
revenues for governments, support 
public services and stimulate 
economic growth.  
 
in 2020, our total tax contribution 
amounted to dkk 38bn (down from 
dkk 44bn in 2019). this includes: 
• 
taxes borne, including 
corporate income tax, social 
security taxes and other taxes 
(including environmental taxes). 
• 
taxes collected on behalf of 
governments, including personal 
income taxes paid on behalf of 
our employees, vat and excise 
duties.  
additional government revenues are 
generated from related sectors, such 
as agriculture, retail and hospitality.   
 
methodology and definitions 
see page 89 for details on the 
methodology we use to calculate our 
economic contribution and definitions 
of the categories used.  
 
1 economic value generated is a combination of gross revenue, other income,  
financial income and income included in special items.

living by our 
compass 
 
 
integrity. responsibility. honest and 
ethical business conduct. these are 
our core values.  
 
living by these values – our 
compass – supports our strategy, 
mitigates risks and protects our 
reputation as a responsible brewer.  
 
our leadership team sets the tone 
from the top, and we empower 
everyone working with us to live by 
our compass every day. 
 
setting clear standards 
our code of ethics & conduct 
provides clear guidance for all our 
employees and contract workers.  
 
the code covers issues such as anti-
bribery and corruption, competition 
law, data protection and privacy, 
conflicts of interest, political activities, 
discrimination and harassment. it is 
supported by more detailed policies 
on each topic (as referenced in 
relevant sections of this report). 
we also extend ethical requirements 
to our business partners and 
suppliers (see page 48). 
 
building awareness 
everyone joining our business 
completes training on our code of 
ethics & conduct as part of their 
induction. in 2020, 4,511 employees 
did this training. we deliver refresher 
training when we review and update 
the code every three years. the next 
review is planned for 2021.  
 
regular communications about 
ethics and compliance help to 
maintain awareness and empower 
our people to act with integrity in 
everything they do. these include 
videos, posters and e-mails that 
encourage employees to consider 
how they would respond to high-risk 
situations.  
 
targeting bribery and 
corruption  
we consider any form of bribery to 
be dishonest, morally wrong and 
unacceptable. our anti-bribery and 
corruption policy and manuals spell 
out our zero-tolerance approach and 
guide employees on what constitutes 
a bribe and how to deal with specific 
situations, for example how to 
decide whether modest gifts or 
hospitality are appropriate. 
 
in 2020, we introduced new online 
training on anti-bribery and 
corruption for people in roles such as 
sales, procurement and finance. 
19,162 employees completed the 
course, which includes real-life 
examples, experiences and 
dilemmas. 
 
implementing compliance 
controls 
we implement strong compliance 
controls to protect our reputation 
and the smooth operation of our 
business everywhere we operate.  
 
our controls include annual 
assessments to identify risks of non-
compliance with our policies or 
relevant laws on topics such as data 
protection, anti-bribery and 
corruption, competition law and 
trade sanctions. based on the 
findings, we adopt additional 
measures, where required, to control 
these risks effectively.  
 
in 2020, we updated our controls, 
including enhancement of the trade 
sanction screening process. we also 
developed tailored compliance 
toolkits for key functions. the aim is 
to make it easier for business leaders 
to understand the requirements most 
relevant to them and ensure they 
understand their role in ensuring 
compliance. in early 2021, our 
markets will use a new tool for 
reporting implementation of 
compliance controls across the 
business.  
 
 
 
spotlight on 
harassment 
 
the #metoo movement has shone a 
spotlight on harassment in the 
workplace and sparked much debate in 
the media. 
 
at carlsberg, we have a zero-tolerance 
approach to any form of harassment 
against our employees. our code of 
ethics & conduct protects this value 
and clearly states the consequences if 
anyone breaks the rules. the message 
is reinforced by detailed guidance in 
our hr policy and manual. 
 
everyone must be treated with respect 
in our workplace. leaders have a 
responsibility to set a good example 
and protect colleagues from physical, 
verbal, sexual or psychological 
harassment, bullying, abuse or threats. 
 
we support and encourage anyone 
who may have experienced harassment 
to talk to their manager, their 
manager’s manager or their local hr 
team – or to report it via our 
confidential speak up line – so we can 
take action. 
 
 
carlsberg group sustainability report 2020   responsible business

speaking up 
if anyone who works for or with us 
has any ethical concerns, we urge 
them to speak up without fear of 
retaliation.  
 
suspected misconduct, non-
compliance with the law or breaches 
of our code of ethics & conduct can 
be reported to line managers, hr 
teams or compliance representatives. 
concerns can also be reported 
anonymously to 
speakup@carlsberg.com or via our 
independent third-party speak up 
helpline. 
 
the 24-hour helpline is available to 
anyone inside and outside the 
company in local languages online or 
by phone. people outside the 
company can also report concerns 
directly to our senior managers in 
each market. 
 
investigating and 
responding to concerns  
our group internal audit & control 
team reviews, and where needed, 
investigates all reported concerns. 
investigations of the most serious 
allegations are overseen by our 
integrity committee, which is chaired 
by the chief financial officer and 
includes the general counsel, senior 
vice president of group hr, vice 
president of group internal audit and 
vice president of compliance. 
 
the number of reported cases of 
suspected misconduct has increased 
significantly – from 53 in 2017 to 
196 in 2020 – since we established 
an integrity committee and raised 
awareness of the importance of 
speaking up. 
 
we take all reported concerns very 
seriously, conducting thorough 
reviews and investigations where 
needed. in 2020, more than half of 
the cases reported were fully or 
partially substantiated. as a result, 
51 employees were dismissed, 56 
employees received a verbal or 
written warning and 37 feedback 
meetings were held.   
acting on allegations 
in 2018, a concern was reported 
alleging potential improper 
payments in 2015-2016 at a joint-
venture brewery in india. an 
investigation concluded that the 
allegations could not be evidenced. 
following the presentation of new 
materials in 2019, the investigation 
was reopened. 
 
the investigation during 2019 and 
2020 was conducted by a leading 
international accounting firm and a 
top-tier indian law firm. it found no 
evidence of actions aimed at personal 
gain for carlsberg employees, but did 
find evidence of potential unethical 
practices in breach of carlsberg group 
policies in the period up to 2018. 
 
while no breaches of our policies 
were detected in relation to current 
operations, the investigations 
identified the need for further 
strengthening of controls. actions 
taken included disciplinary measures 
for implicated employees still at the 
company, and strengthening of 
compliance and internal controls.  
in addition, we conducted an india-
wide internal audit of the process for 
obtaining permits and licences. this 
showed a clear improvement in 
behaviour over time, as well as 
identifying opportunities to further 
strengthen controls. we have 
appointed a dedicated compliance 
officer to oversee compliance at 
carlsberg india. 
 
in early 2021, the media reported on 
a separate case in india from 2018, 
involving underage labourers and 
non-compliant working conditions in 
a warehouse operated by a third 
party. we identified this through 
internal monitoring processes at the 
time and took immediate action, 
terminating the contract with the 
third-party provider in 2018.

respecting 
human rights 
 
 
we are committed to respecting all 
internationally recognised human 
rights – of our employees, workers in 
our supply chain and anyone else 
connected to our business. 
 
carlsberg is a signatory to the un 
global compact and supports both 
the un universal declaration of 
human rights and the un guiding 
principles on business and human 
rights.  
 
our labour & human rights policy 
outlines our commitment to 
respecting the human rights of all 
our employees and contract workers, 
irrespective of the country in which 
they work. it covers topics such as 
working hours and wages, freedom 
of association, discrimination, 
harassment, and child and forced 
labour.  
to embed our commitment to 
respect human rights across our 
organisation, we train people 
managers in all markets on the 
policy and provide an 
implementation manual. in 2020, we 
continued to assess compliance in 
our operations in potentially higher-
risk markets through audits in 
bulgaria, kazakhstan, laos, 
lithuania, myanmar and ukraine. 
 
our supplier & licensee code of 
conduct extends our commitment to 
uphold labour and human rights to 
the thousands of third parties we 
work with.  
 
any grievances or possible violations 
of human rights can be reported via 
our speak up helpline, which is 
available to anyone, including supplier 
workers. we investigate all reports of 
human rights concerns and, where 
reports are substantiated, we develop 
an action plan to mitigate the issues 
identified. we do not tolerate 
retaliation against anyone who raises 
a question or concern in good faith.  
 
of the total number of speak up 
reports received in 2020 (196), 58 
(30%) were related to human rights 
topics (including discrimination and 
harassment, retaliation, data privacy, 
health and safety, labour law 
breaches and other hr issues). of 
the closed human rights-related 
cases, 38% were fully or partially 
substantiated (21 cases). all fully or 
partially substantiated cases were 
addressed through an agreed action 
plan. 
 
identifying salient 
human rights 
we are committed to engaging with 
global and local stakeholders to 
identify, prioritise and address salient 
human rights issues – the human 
rights that are at risk of the most 
severe negative impact across our 
operations and value chain.  
 
with support from shift, the leading 
centre of expertise on the un 
guiding principles on business and 
human rights, we undertook a 
cross-company exercise in 2020 to 
identify and prioritise our salient 
human rights issues. 
 
the analysis found that the highest 
risks we face relate to labour rights 
for employees and supplier workers 
in specific roles. our next step is to 
complete a deeper assessment of 
these risks.  
embracing 
diversity & 
inclusion 
 
 
valuing diverse perspectives and 
experiences makes our business 
stronger by creating a winning team 
that supports innovation and helps 
us better serve our customers around 
the world. we strive to foster an 
inclusive environment where 
everyone can bring their true self to 
work.  
 
our diversity & inclusion policy 
outlines how we will achieve this by 
adopting a global mindset, building a 
diverse talent base, ensuring equal 
opportunities for all our people and 
encouraging inclusive leadership.  
 
setting and driving our 
agenda 
we have established a diversity & 
inclusion council to help us define 
our approach and turn our policy into 
practice. it is made up of senior 
leaders who represent diverse 
perspectives, business functions and 
regions (see next page).  
the council will act as ambassadors 
for diversity and inclusion across the 
business and provide input to our 
executive committee on how we can 
improve in this area. it met for the 
first time in january 2020 and will 
meet virtually at least three times 
a year.  
 
we conducted an anonymous survey 
of 800 senior leaders across the 
business to get a better 
understanding of support for 
diversity and inclusion. it found that 
most leaders, both men and women, 
perceive carlsberg as an inclusive 
organisation while also seeing 
opportunities to make our culture 
more welcoming to all. 
 
the results are informing our 
roadmap to enhance diversity and 
inclusion. focus areas for 2021 
include training managers on 
unconscious bias and inclusive 
leadership, anchoring our diversity 
and inclusion agenda locally in our 
markets, and integrating diversity 
and inclusion in our processes such 
as recruitment, development, 
promotion and pay.  
 
 
 
 
carlsberg group sustainability report 2020   responsible business

embedding inclusive 
leadership 
we continued rolling out training on 
unconscious bias at the start of 
2020, with workshops for 130 senior 
leaders, building on the 90 already 
trained in 2019. more planned face-
to-face workshops were curtailed 
due to covid-19 restrictions, but a 
further 110 leaders completed the 
virtual training.  
 
inclusive leadership is also integrated 
into our leadership development 
training, and online learning on 
unconscious bias and cultural 
awareness is available for all 
employees. 
 
reinforcing inclusive 
people processes 
we are working to integrate diversity 
and inclusion into our recruitment 
and development processes to build 
a diverse pool of potential future 
leaders. our initial focus is on gender 
balance.  
 
nearly half of our employees in the 
early stages of their careers are 
women as we build a pipeline of 
female talent. in 2020, women 
represented 37% of participants in 
global leadership programmes (up 
from 34% last year) and 40% of 
employees on developmental or 
short-term assignments (down from 
43%). this year, we conducted 
gender pay reviews across our 
markets to ensure we continue to 
meet our commitment to equal pay 
for equal work.  
 
flexible working arrangements can 
support diversity by enabling people 
to manage their varied work/life 
situations. the covid-19 pandemic 
has accelerated the move to 
homeworking, and we are 
developing global flexible workplace 
guidelines based on feedback from 
employees about their needs and 
preferred ways of working.

position they have in the company and independently of

  the correlation between diverse teams, inclusive 
working environments and business performance is 
unambiguous. but diversity is not enough – nor should it 
be the end goal. as a company we must embrace 
different perspectives, creating an environment where 
people feel they belong, and acknowledging the benefits 
of inclusivity. tangible and lasting results will require 
specific and immediate action, continuous commitment, 
gentle nudging of our leaders, a vow to measure 
progress and an active approach to tackling biases.”

developing 
talent  
we aim to enable everyone at 
carlsberg to achieve their goals and 
build their career with us. we want 
to develop people with the right skills 
and experience to support our 
business now and in the future. we 
strive to provide exciting careers and 
opportunities at all levels, from 
apprentices and graduates to 
managers and senior leaders. 
 
employees set individual 
development objectives each year 
and review progress. in 2020, we 
introduced more continuous dialogue 
between managers and employees 
to enable real-time feedback, 
increase the focus on development 
and wellbeing, and empower people 
to adjust their objectives as needed 
throughout the year.   
 
in 2020, we provided an average of 
15 hours of training per employee. 
our functional academies helped us 
continue to train people virtually 
during the pandemic. they offer 
programmes tailored to different 
roles and functions across the 
business, including commercial, 
leadership, financial, compliance and 
production skills. we also offer 
additional internal and external 
training locally. 
 
we run leadership development 
training to prepare high-potential 
employees for future roles in 
leadership positions. in 2020, we 
continued to roll out our leadership 
training for managers, which focuses 
on alignment, accountability and 
action. more than 1,300 managers 
have now completed the course. 
 
 
engaging 
employees 
we keep employees informed and 
engaged in the business through 
regular team dialogue, internal 
communications and ceo townhall 
meetings.  
 
we run a global employee survey 
every two years to help us 
understand how we are doing as an 
employer and where we can 
improve. in the last survey, in 2019, 
we achieved a high level of 
employee engagement (84%). 
priorities identified for improvement 
included more frequent feedback and 
recognition, career opportunities and 
support for wellbeing. 
 
in 2020, we responded by building 
more continuous feedback into our 
people processes and encouraging 
managers to give their teams more 
support for development and 
wellbeing. we integrated these 
principles into our leadership toolbox 
for leading remotely during covid-
19. in a pulse survey in 2021, we will 
ask employees how well they feel 
we have responded to their 
feedback.  
 
we also engage with employee 
representatives through formal 
consultation and we recognise the 
right to collective bargaining. in 
2020, 67% of our employees 
worldwide were covered by collective 
bargaining agreements. 
 
rewarding and recognising our 
people’s hard work and 
achievements supports employee 
engagement and job satisfaction. we 
offer competitive pay and benefits, 
which we benchmark in each market. 
we also expect our leaders to seek 
out opportunities to recognise their 
colleagues informally or through 
local award schemes. 
 
supporting people  
through change 
covid-19 has affected demand for 
our beer at bars, restaurants and 
events due to restrictions on the 
hospitality industry. sadly, as a 
result of these uncertainties, we have 
had to say goodbye to some of our 
colleagues.  
 
we consulted employees and their 
representatives throughout the 
process in line with local law and 
practices, and offered support to find 
new jobs. we also trained managers 
to lead their teams through change, 
including setting revised objectives 
and priorities for remaining staff. 
 
 
sourcing 
responsibly 
we strive to build long-term, 
collaborative relationships with 
suppliers that share our values and 
meet our high standards.  
 
we spend billions of danish kroner 
with tens of thousands of suppliers 
around the world. they provide the 
raw materials, packaging and 
logistics for our products, as well as 
other goods and services to support 
our business. 
 
to work with us, all suppliers must 
comply with the standards set out in 
our supplier & licensee code of 
conduct and commit to extending 
these standards to their own 
suppliers too. 
 
the code covers topics related to 
business ethics, labour and human 
rights, health and safety, and 
environmental sustainability. it 
includes commitments to reduce 
carbon emissions and manage water 
risk in line with our together 
towards zero focus areas. 
we ensure that suppliers understand 
and follow our requirements, and 
monitor compliance through our 
supplier relationship management 
practices. suppliers must be able to 
demonstrate compliance with the 
code and applicable laws on request. 
in the event of a breach, suppliers 
must promptly inform us and act to 
remedy the issue promptly. if a 
supplier fails to comply with the code 
or show willingness to remedy non-
compliances, we may terminate their 
contract or refuse to do business 
with them.  
 
we reserve the right to conduct 
audits of supplier sites. in 2020, we 
carried out 53 integrated quality 
audits to ensure our vendors are 
complying with the code and other 
relevant quality standards. due to 
covid-19 restrictions, we conducted 
fewer on-site audits than planned 
and focused on business-critical 
suppliers.

carlsberg is part of the global food 
safety initiative (gfsi), which 
supports continuous improvement in 
food safety throughout the supply 
chain. all our major breweries in 
europe and 27% in asia are now 
certified to external schemes 
recognised by the gfsi. 
 
suppliers of raw ingredients and 
packaging play a critical role in 
ensuring the safety of our products. 
we require them to meet high 
standards on food safety and we 
monitor compliance through our 
integrated quality audits. in 2020, 
we continued to work with suppliers 
to assess risks, monitor performance 
and build capacity through our 
supplier management tool, starting 
with suppliers of glass and cans.  
 
we aim to continually enhance the 
robust quality systems and 
foundations we have in place to 
ensure end-to-end product quality.  
in 2020, we updated our strategic 
quality initiatives to increase focus on 
sensory elements of our quality 
systems and evaluation of consumer 
complaints to ensure the best 
consumer experience at all times. 
 
our rigorous approach to product 
quality and safety includes stringent 
checks and controls designed to 
ensure all our products are right first 
time. the aim is to identify and 
remedy any issues before products 
leave our sites. in 2020, we 
enhanced the escalation process for 
reporting quality incidents to ensure 
information is shared across our 
production sites and prevent similar 
incidents occurring elsewhere. 
 
on rare occasions, a quality issue is 
identified after products have been 
sold to consumers, requiring a recall. 
in 2020, one product was recalled.

governing 
sustainability 
our executive committee (excom) is 
responsible for sustainability, 
providing strategic guidance and 
approval for policies and targets. 
ultimate accountability for 
sustainability at carlsberg, including 
our together towards zero (ttz) 
programme, lies with our ceo and 
excom.  
 
external experts inform our approach 
by engaging with the ceo and other 
executives through the carlsberg 
sustainability advisory board (see 
page 53).  
 
reviewing performance 
key performance indicators (kpis) 
for our ttz programme are reported 
monthly to our integrated supply 
chain management team and 
excom, and at least once a year to 
our supervisory board. both excom 
and the supervisory board review 
overall sustainability performance 
and progress towards our ttz 
targets at least once a year, in 
addition to reviewing relevant 
investments and projects in line with 
normal business procedures.  
 
examples in 2020 included our latest 
beer-in-hand carbon footprint 
analysis and topics related to 
covid-19 crisis management. 
executive remuneration is linked to 
kpis related to ttz and 
sustainability. the performance of 
the executive board against their 
sustainability-related kpis is 
discussed in the remuneration 
committee four times a year. 
 
ttz is also on the agenda of all the 
extended leadership team meetings 
for our top 60 leaders, with monthly 
health and safety updates and 
engagement on relevant projects 
throughout the year. 
 
embedding ttz in our 
business  
we integrate responsibility for 
specific areas of our ttz programme 
and management of sustainability 
topics into core business functions.  
 
designated ttz owners drive the 
programme’s implementation and 
progress towards our 2022 and 2030 
targets within their respective areas 
of responsibility. they are supported 
by local target owners and 
leadership teams in our markets and 
relevant functions. 
 
the executive vice president, 
integrated supply chain – who is 
responsible for production, logistics, 
supply chain and procurement 
operations – owns the ttz targets 
on carbon, water and accidents. the 
chief commercial officer owns the 
ttz targets on responsible drinking. 
our group sustainability team drives 
strategic initiatives and partnerships, 
and supports sustainability 
champions, who help to coordinate 
local sustainability initiatives across 
the business. 
 
engaging our people 
we embed sustainability throughout 
the business and aim to get our 
people involved in the ttz 
programme to help us achieve our 
targets. 
 
new employees are introduced to 
ttz as part of their induction to the 
business, and everyone can access 
training on sustainability through our 
online academies. we provide 
additional training on specific topics 
to people in relevant roles. for 
example, innovation managers 
receive training on how to integrate 
environmental life cycle thinking into 
product development, and we 
present the results of our beer-in-
hand carbon footprint analysis to 
local market management teams to 
help them target improvements. 
 
ttz is a global programme, but it is 
anchored through ownership, action 
and communication at local level. 
examples from across the business 
help us showcase local flavour and 
share examples of best practices with 
other markets. we post local stories 
on the intranet for all employees and 
disseminate these through our global 
corporate affairs teams. we also 
train sustainability champions in 
each market to drive internal 
communications and awareness at 
local level. 
 
to give people a personal stake in 
our progress together towards 
zero, we link remuneration to 
performance on ttz targets for 
relevant roles, including executives, 
brewery managers, facilities 
managers, and innovation, 
marketing and sustainability teams. 
relevant kpis range from energy 
and water savings to stakeholder 
engagement, brand engagement and 
reputation.

managing risk 
excom leads our corporate risk 
management programme, with 
oversight from the audit committee. 
we map the impact of each risk on 
our operating profit or brand/image 
against the likelihood of that risk 
materialising.  
 
based on this assessment, excom 
identifies high-risk issues for the 
coming year and assigns risk owners 
to oversee activities to manage and 
mitigate them. see our annual 
report for more on our approach to 
risk management and a list of key 
risks identified for 2020. 
 
we integrate sustainability risks into 
this assessment and management of 
business risks, primarily in relation to 
legal and regulatory compliance, and 
regulatory changes. in 2020, we 
strengthened our focus on longer-
term sustainability challenges, 
starting with climate-related 
financial risks – including reporting in 
line with the recommendations of the 
task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures (tcfd) (see 
page 14) – and a ground-breaking 
scenario analysis of water risks (see 
page 24).  
 
from 2021, mid- and long-term 
risks will be reviewed annually, 
including those related to the areas 
of commercial and competition, 
governance, consumer, 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, reputation, supply 
chain and climate. these will feed 
into our assessment of business risks. 
 
an analysis of relevant risks 
informed our latest assessment of 
the most material sustainability 
issues for our business and our 
stakeholders (see page 57). 
 
integrating external 
perspectives 
the carlsberg sustainability advisory 
board (csab), established in 2020, 
provides a valuable “outside in” 
perspective to excom. 
 
three independent external 
sustainability experts sit on the csab 
(see box). they engage directly with 
our ceo, ttz area owners and other 
senior executives who are also csab 
members. the director of our group 
sustainability team facilitates csab 
meetings, which are held at least 
twice a year. 
 
the role of the csab is to:  
• help us stay in sync with 
expectations in the outside world 
and remain true to our founder’s 
aspirations through our strategy 
and actions. 
• provide strategic advice, critical 
review and feedback. 
• act as a sparring partner for 
excom and other members of the 
leadership team. 
the csab first met in may 2020 to 
provide feedback on our ttz 
programme, progress and reporting. 
they raised important 
considerations, challenging us to 
continually strive for better. the 
table summarises their feedback and 
our response. see page 5 for direct 
feedback from each of the external 
csab members. 
 
we also asked for insights into 
external trends on plastics and 
sustainability trends among asian 
consumers. at a second full meeting 
in october, the csab discussed the 
business case for sustainability and 
how the covid-19 pandemic has 
affected the sustainability agenda.

responding to csab feedback 
 
csab feedback 
our response 
strengthen the links between sustainability and the business in 
risk mapping and reporting. 
 
we set out the business case for our ttz targets in the relevant sections of this report. in 2020, we integrated sustainability further in our annual report for investors and in our risk 
mapping through alignment with the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) guidelines. while our annual report and sustainability report are published 
simultaneously, we believe that a separate sustainability report offers more value for a wider range of stakeholders.  
set out a clear plan to deliver the pace of progress required to 
meet ttz targets on carbon and water. 
we have established roadmaps with specific actions to achieve our 2022 targets on water, elimination of coal and 100% renewable energy. we are now working on a roadmap to 
help us achieve our carbon reduction targets, supported by our latest beer-in-hand footprint analysis (see page 11). roadmaps for the 2030 targets will be more high level to 
enable flexibility as the business evolves and new technologies emerge.  
benchmark performance and reporting by publishing external 
ratings and aligning reporting with established guidelines. 
our performance in key external sustainability benchmarks is published in this report (see page 51). in 2020, we aligned our reporting with tcfd guidelines. while we used the 
principles of the global reporting initiative sustainability reporting guidelines to inform the performance indicators and framing of our reporting, we do not currently report in 
accordance with the gri standards. 
increase focus on raw materials and agriculture. 
our influence on agricultural practices is relatively limited because we buy our ingredients mainly from commodity markets and do not operate in regions, such as africa and south 
america, where there is a strong industry focus on supporting smallholder farmers. however, we are supporting sustainable agriculture through research at our lab, which is field-
testing drought-resilient crops as part of our focus on tackling climate change (see page 10). 
elaborate on the materiality process and which stakeholders 
were consulted. 
we updated our materiality assessment in 2020 and provide information on the process, including stakeholders consulted, in this report (see page 57). 
share innovative solutions to benefit the wider industry and 
clarify the next steps for innovations like snap pack and the 
green fibre bottle. 
the green fibre bottle is a good example of how we aim to extend our positive impact by sharing innovative solutions with the wider industry. we were instrumental in developing 
it, then invited others to join the initiative too. the bottle was piloted by the absolut company in 2020, and the coca-cola company launched its first prototype. we aim to trial 
the green fibre bottle with our beer as soon as we receive regulatory approval. we also rolled out snap pack to more markets in 2020. see page 17. 
translate corporate impact into the consumer’s personal 
impact, explain initiatives in a language consumers can 
understand and quantify impact in tangible terms  
consumers can identify with. 
we are investing in life cycle assessments and fact-based product claims to help consumers understand what our sustainability performance means for the beer in their hand. we 
also strive to use simple language, tangible comparisons and engaging infographics to help communicate our sustainability story to consumers. for example, we compare our 
carbon savings with the equivalent number of cars taken off the road and our water savings with olympic swimming pools (see pages 12 and 22). 
identify ways to contribute to sustainability locally and 
highlight local case studies. 
many ttz programmes are run at local level, particularly in relation to responsible drinking, shared water resources and recycling. we aim to engage further with local colleagues 
to translate our global programmes and targets into local contexts. local case studies and examples are included throughout this report. 
rewrite the rules of the industry on responsible drinking and 
tell the world more about it.  
we are committed to collective industry efforts and partnerships to promote responsible drinking. we offer alcohol-free brews across our brands, and we are working on more 
purpose-driven marketing to better communicate our sustainability actions to consumers.

engaging with stakeholders 
dialogue with stakeholders helps us understand what matters most to them and respond. this is essential for fostering open communications and building trust. their input helps us define and prioritise 
our sustainability efforts. and our partnerships with stakeholders enable us to drive progress together towards zero.

responsible drinking initiatives 
consumer demand for healthier and more 
sustainable options is growing. sustainable 
packaging is the most tangible aspect of 
sustainable products for consumers. 
we are developing products and packaging that are more sustainable for the planet through our ttz 
targets on carbon (see page 10) and water (see page 20). we are also developing a process to implement 
sustainability in each of our brands.  
we put a strong focus on enjoying our beer responsibly in our marketing, we include product labelling to 
support healthy choices, and we have extended our range of alcohol-free brews. our responsible drinking 
initiatives also connect directly with consumers (see page 27). 
customers 
sales and marketing channels 
responsible drinking partnerships 
customers’ supplier requirements, questionnaires and 
audits 
customer satisfaction surveys 
customers want to know how we can help them 
achieve their own sustainability goals and meet 
consumer demand for healthier and more 
sustainable options.   
in addition to our own response to consumers (see above), we partner with customers, such as bars and 
retailers, on campaigns like global beer responsibility day (see page 33).  
we also help customers reduce sustainability risks in their supply chain through our ttz programme and 
by doing business responsibly. 
employees 
biennial global employee survey 
regular dialogue and feedback 
twice-yearly performance reviews 
formal consultation with employee representatives 
feedback from our latest employee survey in 
2019 showed improved employee engagement 
and highlighted several areas where we could 
improve, including more frequent feedback and 
recognition, career opportunities and support for 
wellbeing.  
we have responded to what employees told us in 2019 by building more continuous feedback into our 
people processes and encouraging managers to focus more on support for development and wellbeing 
(see page 48). 
industry 
engagement through industry organisations, such as the 
international alliance for responsible drinking (iard), 
brewers of europe, the worldwide brewing alliance and 
national trade associations 
engagement with peers on initiatives to drive sustainable 
innovation 
industry peers are keen to work together to tackle 
common challenges and protect the reputation of 
brewing companies and the wider drinks industry. 
together with other members of the iard, in 2020 we committed to accelerating measures to tackle 
underage drinking (see page 31). we are also part of the brewers of europe proud to be clear initiative to 
expand nutrition and ingredient information on product labels and online.  
we welcomed others in the drinks industry to join our innovation initiative to develop a green fibre bottle 
and the absolut company began trialling it in 2020 (see page 17). 
investors

annual general meeting  
investor roadshows 
individual meetings

investors want to know that we meet their 
environmental, social and governance (esg) 
requirements – and have been showing increasing 
interest in esg. they want to understand how 
investments in sustainability will support our 
business goals and help deliver sustainable 
financial returns in the long term. 
we respond to investor questionnaires to demonstrate compliance with esg requirements, and we explain 
the business case for our ttz programme.  
our strong scores in ratings such as msci and sustainalytics demonstrate our business is low risk for 
investors. 
see also our annual report and investor relations at carlsberggroup.com/investor-relations. 
journalists 
individual meetings and calls 
direct engagement by e-mail 
journalists’ questions give us an insight into wider 
trends across and beyond the industry. recently, 
their focus has been on carbon emissions and 
renewables, due diligence standards, gmo policy 
and transparency. 
we always seek constructive and fact-based dialogue with media and journalists, and value an open 
discussion on detailed subjects to ensure that our approach and communication are well understood and 
accurately reflected.

we communicate our requirements on sustainability through our supplier & licensee code of conduct, 
and we monitor compliance through audits (see page 48).  
in 2020, we also engaged with suppliers to gather data at product level to support our beer-in-hand

and responds to global challenges. they also want 
to see ambitious targets, strong performance and 
transparent reporting. 
in 2020, the csab provided detailed feedback  
(see page 54).  
sustainability experts also provide valuable input 
on our approach to issues such as human rights. 
see page 54 for our response to csab feedback in 2020. 
we are a member of the science based targets initiative and in 2020 we supported its call for 
governments to align covid-19 recovery efforts with the latest climate science (see page 8). 
we have strategic partnerships with wwf and plastic change. in 2020, we worked closely with wwf to 
map water risks in our business (see page 24). 
human rights experts shift provided feedback and input on our human rights risks and due diligence (see

and similar conferences where government officials are 
present 
governments want to know that we comply with 
laws and contribute to economies through job 
creation and taxes. they also want to understand 
how we support their strategies on sustainability 
and public health. 
our public & government affairs manual, updated in 2020, sets out clear guidance on how we engage 
with governments globally.  
we have controls in place to ensure compliance with all applicable laws (see page 44). we report our total 
economic contribution, including taxes generated and jobs created, every year (see page 42). and we 
engage with governments indirectly on sustainability and public health issues through industry 
associations such as the iard and brewers of europe. 
communities 
local community engagement programmes 
communities near our operations want us to be a 
responsible neighbour and to understand how we 
can support them.  
our business creates jobs through the people we employ directly and many more in related sectors, 
including in rural communities with few employment opportunities (see page 42).  
in 2020, we provided targeted support for communities around the world through the covid-19 crisis 
(see page 8).  
we also improved access to safe, reliable drinking water for people living in high-risk areas (see page 25).

identifying 
our priorities 
we aim to ensure that our work 
remains focused on the topics that 
are most significant to our business 
and our stakeholders – our most 
material issues. the together 
towards zero programme was 
informed by a materiality 
assessment conducted in 2016. this 
helped us identify where we can 
have the biggest economic, 
environmental and social impact. 
 
global challenges continue to evolve 
and the covid-19 pandemic has 
highlighted health and economic 
concerns. in 2020, we conducted a 
new materiality assessment with 
support from experts at globescan.  
 
analysis of existing data and 
research from both within our 
business and externally, combined 
with insights from a digital listening 
platform, informed an initial issues 
list. this was used to support 
focused consultation to gain internal 
and external perspectives. we 
conducted a survey of employees 
representing a range of geographies 
and functions, and in-depth 
interviews with external stakeholders 
representing groups including non-
governmental and inter-
governmental organisations, industry 
associations, investors, customers, 
suppliers and academics. 
 
the findings 
four interconnected environmental 
themes top the most material issues 
for carlsberg: climate change 
adaptation; energy and carbon; 
water stewardship; and sustainable 
packaging. these were also priority 
issues in 2016, but the scale and 
nature of stakeholder expectations 
have evolved. sustainable packaging 
is more prominent among these top 
issues, while climate change 
adaptation is now as important as 
seeking to mitigate risks. water 
stewardship remains a high strategic 
and reputation risk, but is also seen 
as an opportunity for carlsberg to 
show leadership. 
 
supporting equality and caring for 
employees have risen in prominence. 
diversity, inclusion and equity is a 
high priority. employee safety, 
health and wellness is also a critical 
issue and will remain so as we 
emerge from the covid-19 crisis. 
looking forward, areas for potential 
future consideration are the future of 
work and the need for upskilling or 
reskilling (talent and development), 
as well as carlsberg’s role in 
supporting social justice and 
economic equality (community 
impact and investment). 
 
stakeholders also see an opportunity 
for carlsberg to show leadership on 
product health impact and social 
impacts (preventing harmful use of 
alcohol) through innovating and 
widening the availability of products 
(such as low-/no-alcohol or low-
sugar options), bolder marketing, 
and working with the industry and 
others to define the role for beer in a 
“healthy” society.  
the prominence of sustainable 
agriculture and ecosystem health is 
rapidly increasing and expected to 
become more of a high-profile issue 
for the whole food and drinks sector. 
stakeholders also highlighted the 
interconnection between biodiversity, 
water and climate.  
 
carlsberg’s extended responsibility 
across the whole supply chain was 
prominent in stakeholder feedback 
(responsible supply chain 
management), with human rights 
and labour standards being key 
components. other issues identified 
as highly material include product 
quality and safety, ethical behaviour 
and governance, waste management 
and circular resource use in 
production, responsible marketing, 
and economic impact and tax.

reporting approach and 
criteria 
 
scope of the sustainability 
reporting 
this report covers the relevant and 
significant social, ethical and 
environmental issues for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 
2020. it gives our stakeholders an 
overview of our performance in these 
areas, complementing our annual 
report, which primarily covers our 
financial and economic performance. 
 
for many years, we have been using 
the standards of global reporting 
initiative (gri) as guidance for our 
sustainability work. for this 2020 
report, the gri g4 sustainability 
reporting guidelines were applied in 
preparing the underlying data and 
framing our reporting principles; 
however, the carlsberg group does 
not apply gri-specific disclosures in 
accordance with the standard. 
 
we receive recommendations on our 
sustainability activities and reporting 
from our assurance provider, pwc, 
while we ourselves routinely analyse 
global megatrends, take part in 
industry initiatives and assess the 
activities of our competitors. this 
ensures that we fully understand the 
key issues and keep up to date. 
 
the report focuses on the topics that 
we consider most important to our 
business and society. it is based on a 
range of inputs from our 
stakeholders, including, but not 
restricted to, the materiality 
assessment updated in 2020 in 
cooperation with globescan, water 
risk assessments undertaken with 
wwf, the un’s sustainable 
development goals (sdgs), carbon 
footprinting analyses undertaken 
with the carbon trust and guidance 
from the carlsberg sustainability 
advisory board. 
 
boundary setting  
entities included in this report’s 
performance data include majority-
owned subsidiaries, which are 
defined as companies that the 
carlsberg group directly or indirectly 
owns, in which it controls more than 
50% of the voting rights or that it 
otherwise controls. 
joint ventures and companies over 
which the carlsberg group does not 
have the opportunity to exercise 
management control are not 
covered. however, we work with our 
partners routinely to ensure ongoing 
focus on sustainability issues. if a 
majority-owned entity is acquired 
during the financial year, it will be 
included in the following year’s 
report.

ensuring data quality  
in gathering information about our 
sustainability performance, we 
applied the widely used principles of 
balance, clarity, accuracy, reliability, 
timeliness and comparability. please 
find additional information on each 
of the topics below: 
 
balance  
we are committed to communicating 
honestly and openly about our 
performance, both when it has 
improved and when it has not. our 
aim is to provide our stakeholders 
with sufficient information about our 
company for them to form their own 
judgements concerning the carlsberg 
group’s position and role in the 
societies in which we operate. 
 
clarity  
we strive to make our sustainability 
reporting accessible and easy to read 
for anyone, but we are always open 
to feedback about the way we 
communicate on our material issues. 
 
 
reporting process  
and scope  
 
carlsberg group sustainability report 2020   governance and transparency

accuracy and reliability  
since 2009, our dedicated 
sustainability reporting system has 
helped us collect data from local 
sites and consolidate this at group 
level. every year, we have improved 
the indicator definitions for our 
performance indicators in order to 
help our entities report accurately 
and reliably.  
 
however, it is a challenge to obtain a 
complete and fully aligned overview 
of all our data that, at the same 
time, takes into account local 
procedures for data gathering. for 
this reason, we are continuously 
working on improving data accuracy. 
since 2009, we have been using an 
international provider of 
sustainability software solutions to 
systematise and collect our data. 
this gives us a higher degree of 
control over the data-gathering 
process, helps local companies 
compare data year on year, and 
enables instant consistency checks 
during the data-gathering phase. as 
well as the system, we use internal 
data management systems to collect 
information such as employee 
headcounts. an additional tool used 
to improve our sustainability data is 
the carlsberg operational manual 
(com), which sets out details 
regarding processes and best 
practices.  
pwc has been appointed to provide 
independent assurance regarding 
selected social, environmental and 
safety indicators. in each section of 
the report, we indicate which data 
has been assured. for further details, 
see pages 90-91.  
 
 
timeliness  
internally, we report our 
sustainability data with varying 
degrees of frequency, depending on 
the nature of the data. where 
necessary, we revise the reporting 
frequency in order to strike the right 
balance between obtaining the 
correct data and observing 
appropriate time intervals for 
reporting on them. annual data 
gathering and external reporting are 
aligned with financial data collection, 
following the calendar year. 
 
 
comparability  
on pages 76-83, we have published 
the definitions we use for the key 
indicators in the report, which are 
also the data points on which pwc 
provides assurance. 
 
we include three- or five-year data 
in all cases where a comparable 
three- or five-year data history is 
available. 
 
  
targets  
we communicate through actions 
and targets: 
• one-year short-term actions 
towards zero 
• 2022 targets  
• 2030 targets 
 
these have been developed by each 
of the area owners in cooperation 
with group sustainability and may 
be adjusted following significant 
changes in the business, such as 
major acquisitions and divestments. 
as far as possible, we include such 
changes by applying scenario 
planning to our target-setting 
process.

basis of preparation 
general comments 
this basis of preparation presents 
the scope and methodology of the 
collection and reporting of the data 
on tax payments used in the 
contributing to economies section 
(“the section”). 
 
the section aims to provide readers 
with an overview of the total tax 
contribution to society that the 
carlsberg group (excluding 
associates) has generated during the 
year. the total tax contribution is 
defined as taxes borne and taxes 
collected by the carlsberg group.  
 
it is the responsibility of the 
management of the carlsberg group 
to ensure that appropriate 
procedures are in place to prepare 
reporting in line with this basis of 
preparation.  
 
all data, unless otherwise stated, has 
been prepared for the year from 1 
january 2020 to 31 december 2020.  
 
 
data is collected for consolidated 
entities in the carlsberg group. 
 
companies over which the carlsberg 
group exercises a significant 
influence, but does not consolidate, 
are considered to be associates. data 
for associates is not part of the 
carlsberg group tax contribution.  
 
entities acquired or formed during 
the year are recognised in the 
section from the date of acquisition 
or formation. entities that are 
disposed of or wound up are 
recognised in the consolidated 
income statement up to the date of 
disposal or winding-up.  
 
the data includes a degree of 
estimation, as tax per entity is not 
reported in detail if a type of tax is 
below dkk 100,000 per year. 
instead, taxes below dkk 50,000 
are not reported, and taxes above 
dkk 50,000 but below dkk 
100,000 are reported as dkk 
50,000. the data is reported by the 
entity in local currency in multiples 
of 1,000.  
 
scope of reporting and 
definition of key terms 
“tax” in this section means any 
amount of money required to be 
paid to, or collected and 
subsequently remitted to, a 
government.  
 
terms defined in the carlsberg 
group’s annual report 2020 are not 
described below.  
 
taxes borne and taxes collected are 
the taxes due in respect of an 
accounting period as defined in ifrs, 
as adopted by the eu. 
 
 
key term definitions 
economic value generated 
economic value generated comprises 
gross revenue, other income, 
financial income and income included 
in special items, and share of profit 
after tax in associates and joint 
ventures. income recognised in other 
comprehensive income is not 
included.  
 
total tax contribution  
total tax contribution is the sum of 
borne and collected taxes paid to 
governments for the period from 1 
january to 31 december. amounts 
are included as paid when cash is 
released from or received by the 
carlsberg group.  
 
operating costs  
include cost of sales, sales and 
distribution expenses, administrative 
expenses and other operating 
expenses, but exclude employee 
wages.  
 
employee wages  
include wages to employees, 
excluding social security costs. 
 
providers of capital  
include financial expenses recognised 
in the income statement, but exclude 
financial expenses recognised in 
other comprehensive income.  
 
economic value retained  
consolidated profit after tax.  
 
employee taxes  
include personal income taxes and 
social contribution for employees 
(collected).  
 
government  
any government body or nation, 
state, region or district.  
 
 
scope of reporting 
1. borne taxes 
these are the taxes that the 
carlsberg group is obliged to pay to 
a government on its own behalf, or 
taxes that the group is obliged to 
pay to a third party and that cannot 
be recovered from a government.  
 
corporate income tax  
corporate income tax comprises any 
tax on the business calculated on the 
basis of its profits, income or capital 
gains. typically, these taxes would 
be reflected in corporate income tax 
returns made to governments and 
tend to become payable, and are 
paid, either in the year the profits 
were made or up to one year later, 
depending on the local tax rules as 
to timing of payments.  
tax contribution

energy taxes (net, non-refundable)  
energy taxes comprise 
environmental taxes levied on the 
consumption of energy borne by 
companies’ own supply of energy. 
such taxes may include taxes on the 
consumption of electricity, oil, gas or 
coal.  
 
environmental fees  
environmental fees comprise 
additional environmental taxes that 
may apply depending on company 
operations. such taxes may include 
other taxes and duties on the supply 
of goods and services that are 
potentially harmful to the 
environment and have not been 
included in the energy taxes.  
 
vat (non-deductible)  
non-deductible vat is the part of 
the input vat that cannot be 
recovered, e.g. vat on gifts or 
entertainment. 
 
real estate taxes  
real estate taxes comprise any 
property-related taxes, including 
property, land and estate tax (other 
than stamp duty, which is shown 
below). typically, these taxes tend 
to become payable, and are paid, to 
governments throughout the year.  
 
withholding taxes on dividends, 
royalties, interest and professional 
fees  
withholding taxes comprise the final 
tax burden on payment of dividends, 
interest etc. after possible tax relief.  
 
transportation taxes  
transportation taxes comprise flight 
tax, petrol tax, registration duties 
and other taxes levied on the 
mobility of goods and employees.  
 
social contribution for employees  
social contribution for employees 
comprises the social security 
contributions levied on and borne by 
the employing company. such 
contributions may include the 
employer’s national insurance 
contributions, employment insurance 
tax, employees’ provident fund, old-
age, survivors’ and disability 
insurance tax.  
 
stamp duties  
stamp duties comprise taxes that 
arise on transfers of assets or 
capital. typically, these taxes would 
be reflected in stamp duty returns 
made to governments and tend to 
become payable, and are paid, to 
governments shortly after the capital 
or assets have been transferred.  
 
other taxes  
this category comprises all paid 
taxes that are not included in the 
above categories. 
 
2. taxes collected, including 
excise duties 
these are taxes not finally borne by 
the carlsberg group, but for which 
the group bears an administrative 
burden of collection. these taxes 
are, however, indirectly generated 
from the group’s business activities 
and are therefore part of the group’s 
total tax contribution.  
 
excise duties (beer and soft drinks 
etc.)  
excise duties are indirect taxes on 
the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages etc. 
 
excise duties are generally imposed 
by the tax authorities and are 
collected by the group on behalf of 
the authorities when the goods are 
transferred to the customers and are 
thereby ready for consumption. 
 
personal income taxes  
these comprise employee taxes 
withheld from employee wages and 
paid to governments, i.e. tax 
collected and remitted to 
governments on behalf of 
employees.  
 
social contribution withheld by the 
company  
these comprise social contributions 
payable by employees to social 
security, and private funded and 
unfunded schemes. generally, the 
employment of staff requires the 
employing company to administer 
employees’ social security 
contributions by deducting these 
from wages and salaries. 
 
withholding tax on dividend 
distributions made by carlsberg a/s  
this comprises taxes that are 
required to be withheld in advance 
on payments made to shareholders.  
 
vat/gst 
vat is a broadly based consumption 
tax assessed on the value added to 
goods and services. it applies more 
or less to all goods and services that 
are bought and sold for use or 
consumption. 
 
vat is assessed and collected at 
each point in the manufacturing–
distribution–sales process of a good 
or supply of a service.  
 
like vat, the goods and service tax 
(gst) is a value-added tax assessed 
on most goods and services bought 
and sold for consumption.

our value chain carbon footprint – 
which we call our beer-in-hand 
footprint – includes scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions as set out in the 
greenhouse gas (ghg) protocol.  
 
our targets, aligned with the 
science-based targets initiative, are 
to cut our beer-in-hand footprint by 
15% by 2022 and by 30% by 2030 
(from our 2015 baseline).  
 
to assess progress, we measure our 
beer-in-hand footprint every few 
years. in 2020, we completed an 
analysis of our 2019 footprint, which 
showed a 7% improvement from the 
2015 baseline. 
 
we worked with the carbon trust to 
build a value chain model that 
enables us to measure and track 
reductions in our beer-in-hand 
footprint.  
 
modelling and using 
standards  
to calculate a value chain carbon 
footprint requires extensive data on 
emissions at every stage of the value 
chain. while we have a good 
understanding of our own 
operational emissions (scope 1 and 
2), visibility of scope 3 emissions is 
often more limited.  
 
calculating footprints requires a 
combination of measurement and 
modelling, which includes an 
inherent level of uncertainty. we 
limit this uncertainty by following 
and supporting the development of 
industry-leading standards – and we 
encourage others to adopt these 
standards to support consistency and 
credibility in reporting across the 
industry.  
 
the standards we follow are: 
• ghg protocol (including the 
corporate value chain (scope 3) 
accounting and reporting standard 
supplement) 
• beverage industry ghg emissions 
sector guidance (version 4.1), 
developed by the beverage 
industry environmental round 
table  
• specific product environmental 
footprint category rules (pefcr) 
developed for the beer industry in 
cooperation with the european 
commission (while this standard is 
for product life cycle analysis, 
much of it is also applicable to 
value chain analysis). 
 
data quality 
we use the most robust data 
available to model our beer-in-hand 
emissions. in 2020, this included 
primary data from suppliers 
accounting for more than 60% of our 
total spend – most related to 
packaging, which accounts for the 
largest portion of our value chain 
emissions. collecting raw data 
directly from suppliers helps to 
ensure the quality and comparability 
of data sets. we apply the 
standardised circular footprint 
formula, part of the pefcr, for all 
packaging types supplied to us. 
where primary data is not available, 
we use the pefcr’s country-specific 
emission factors. 
 
material scope 3 emissions 
we focus our efforts and our beer-
in-hand footprint targets on the 
scope 3 emissions where we have 
the greatest influence: the value 
chain associated with our own 
production volume. an initial analysis 
showed that this accounts for more 
than 75% of the total value chain 
emissions related to our production, 
licensees, third-party products and 
joint ventures. the 75% exceeds the 
science based targets initiative’s 
requirement to cover more than two 
thirds of total scope 3 emissions. 
 
our beer-in-hand footprint includes 
emissions from each stage of the 
value chain:  
 
agriculture and processing: includes 
all upstream emissions (such as 
fertiliser and seed production), 
farming and processing of 
agricultural raw materials used at all 
carlsberg breweries – modelled using 
data specific to each country and 
type of grain where available.  
 
breweries: includes emissions from 
electricity, thermal fuels, waste 
leaving breweries, water treatment 
and refrigerant leakage at all 
majority-owned breweries within the 
carlsberg group’s management 
control. excludes emissions from 
off-site warehouses. 
 
packaging: includes production and 
end-of-life treatment (recycling, 
incineration or landfill) for all 
primary, secondary, tertiary and 
quaternary packaging (incorporating 
all minor components, such as 
labels, glues and caps).  
 
transportation and distribution: 
includes inbound transport of raw 
materials and outbound transport of 
finished products – based on 
distances travelled, mode of 
transport (road, rail, sea) and 
temperature (ambient, chilled) – as 
well as flights for business travel. 
 
cooling: includes chilling of products 
by customers (retail and hospitality). 
excludes home cooling as this is 
beyond our influence and beverages 
account for only a small proportion 
of home refrigeration. 
 
engagement within the organisation 
the results of our beer-in-hand 
footprint analysis, as well as 
priorities to support reductions at 
each stage of the value chain, are 
discussed and approved by our 
executive committee. in 2020, we 
also ran sessions with all local 
management teams to present 
market-specific developments and 
identify local actions.

value chain methodology

estimates of the total jobs we 
indirectly support throughout the 
value chain were calculated by the 
research consultancy europe 
economics using a well-established 
methodology.  
 
the methodology uses data 
collected from the carlsberg group 
export & license department, and 
from the 29 companies across the 
world owned by carlsberg a/s, 
including data on:  
• employment (number of people in 
each market) 
• production, exports and imports (in 
hectolitres) 
• taxes borne and collected by 
carlsberg in each of the markets 
(excise, vat, corporate, 
environmental, employee income, 
social contribution and other taxes, 
in national currency).  
 
this data is complemented with 
productivity indicators sourced from 
various national statistics offices.  
 
upstream indirect 
employment 
our upstream indirect impacts 
include impacts in the supply chain 
for the raw ingredients, products and 
services we purchase.  
 
these were calculated using data on 
the shares of upstream domestic 
purchases for production in the 
following sectors: agriculture; 
utilities; packaging and bottling; 
transportation and storage; 
equipment and other industrial 
activities; media, marketing and 
communication; and other goods 
and services.  
 
for our fermented beverages, we 
used data for 2019 and the shares 
were assumed to be the same in 
2020. for our non-fermented 
beverages, we used 2020 data. 
 
upstream indirect employment was 
calculated using ratios of turnover 
per person employed.  
 
for european countries, these ratios 
were sourced from eurostat, the 
statistical office of the european 
union, using the european 
classification of economic activities 
(nace) rev. 2 sector classifications.  
for non-european countries, we 
used ratios taken from the world 
bank (available for the agriculture, 
industry and services sectors only).  
 
downstream indirect 
employment 
our downstream indirect impacts 
include impacts in the hospitality 
(on-trade) and retail (off-trade) 
sectors.  
 
these were calculated using data on 
prices collected in 2019 and shares 
of carlsberg group sales in on- and 
off-trade markets collected at the 
end of 2020.  
 
calculations start with the total 
consumption values in on- and off-
trade markets, which are calculated 
based on three components:  
• annual domestic 2020 sales in each 
country (domestic production plus 
imports less exports, in hectolitres) 
• the estimated 2020 split between 
on- and off-trade markets in each 
country 
• the relative prices of the products 
sold in each country.  
 
the market values are then 
converted to pre-tax values by 
removing the vat. excise duties are 
not removed as the productivity 
ratios used from statistical sources 
include these duties.  
 
downstream indirect employment 
was calculated using ratios of 
turnover per person employed.  
 
for european countries, we used 
eurostat data for the nace rev. 2 
sectors of retail sale of beverages in 
specialised stores and beverage-
serving activities. for non-european 
countries, we used world bank data 
for the services sector. 
 
effects of the covid-19 
pandemic 
the methodology used for 
estimating indirect employment 
involves a direct translation of 
production volumes into the level of 
employment needed to produce 
these volumes.  
 
this methodology is appropriate for 
estimating employment in normal 
circumstances as it provides a fair 
reflection of employees’ productivity.  
 
however, this methodology does not 
reflect jobs that have been 
maintained through government job-
support schemes during the 
pandemic in 2020, when lower levels 
of production and consumption have 
been observed.  
 
therefore, we would expect the 
number of jobs related to our 
business activity to be slightly higher 
than the ones we report for 2020.  
 
comparability with 
previous estimates  
the scope of our economic 
contribution analysis for 2020 has 
been broadened to include indirect 
impacts from our non-fermented 
beverages as well as our fermented 
beverages.  
 
this means the results of the 2020 
analysis (presented in this report) are 
not directly comparable with the 
results of the 2019 analysis 
(reported in the carlsberg group 
sustainability report 2019), which 
only included sales of fermented 
products. however, the differences 
are small because non-fermented 
beverages are only produced in 
seven markets and represent a small 
share of carlsberg’s total production.

the carlsberg group engaged us to 
provide limited assurance on the 
selected data described below and 
set out in the carlsberg group 
sustainability report for the period 1 
january – 31 december 2020. 
 
our conclusion 
based on the procedures we 
performed and the evidence we 
obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us not to 
believe that data in scope for our 
limited assurance engagement are 
free of material misstatements and 
are prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the accounting 
principles as stated in the sections 
“reporting process and scope” 
(pages 74-75), “indicator definitions” 
(pages 76-83), “list of reporting 
sites” (pages 84-85) and “tax 
contribution principles” (pages 86-
87) of the 2020 carlsberg group 
sustainability report.  
 
this conclusion is to be read in the 
context of what we say in the 
remainder of our report. 
 
selected information 
the scope of our work was limited to 
assurance on selected data for the 
period 1 january – 31 december 
2020 in the sections “generating 
economic value” and “data summary 
table” (page 43 and pages 67-73), 
namely:  
• economic value generated: data on 
“corporate income tax”, “taxes 
borne and excise duties collected” 
and “excise duties” (page 43); 
• energy, carbon and water: data on 
“total production of beer and soft 
drinks”, “total thermal energy 
consumption”, “total electricity 
consumption”, “total water 
consumption”, “total co2 
emissions (from direct and indirect 
fuel consumption) (market-
based)”, “total co2 emissions 
(from direct and indirect fuel 
consumption) (location based)”, 
“relative figures from beer and soft 
drinks production”, “total co2 
emissions from refrigerants”, 
“scope 1 – absolute co2 emissions 
(excl. logistics)”, “scope 2 – 
absolute co2 emissions, market 
based”, “scope 1+2 - absolute 
emissions (together towards zero 
2015 baseline)”, “percentage of 
electricity from renewable sources” 
and “number of sites using coal” 
(pages 67-69);  
• health & safety: data on “lost-
time accidents in production, 
logistics, sales & marketing and 
administration”, “lost-time 
accident rate”, “number of days 
lost” and “days lost rate” in the 
carlsberg group and “number of 
lost-time accidents, contractors” 
and “number of lost-time 
accidents, members of the public” 
(page 70) and ;  
• responsible drinking and marketing 
communication: data on 
“percentage of fermented produced 
volume carrying legal age 
restriction symbol or equivalent 
text”, “percentage of fermented 
produced volume that lists 
nutritional information” and 
“percentage of fermented produced 
volume that lists ingredient 
information” (page 71). 
 
we do not provide any assurance on 
the achievability of the carlsberg 
group's objectives, targets and 
expectations.  
professional standards 
applied and level of 
assurance 
we performed a limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with the 
international standard on assurance 
engagements 3000 (revised), 
“assurance engagements other than 
audits and reviews of historical 
financial information” and, in respect 
of the greenhouse gas emissions 
stated on pages 67-69, in 
accordance with international 
standard on assurance 
engagements 3410 “assurance 
engagements on greenhouse gas 
statements”.  
 
greenhouse gas quantification is 
subject to inherent uncertainty 
because of incomplete scientific 
knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values 
needed to combine emissions of 
different gases.  
 
a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment 
procedures, including an 
understanding of internal control, 
and the procedures performed in 
response to the assessed risks; 
consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been 
performed. 
 
our independence and 
quality control 
we have complied with the code of 
ethics for professional accountants 
issued by the international ethics 
standards board for accountants, 
which includes independence and 
other ethical requirements founded 
on fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional 
behaviour. the firm applies the 
international standard on quality 
control 1 and accordingly maintains 
a comprehensive system of quality 
control, including documented 
policies and procedures regarding 
compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards

and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. our work was carried 
out by an independent 
multidisciplinary team with 
experience in sustainability reporting 
and assurance. 
 
understanding reporting 
and measurement 
methodologies 
data and information need to be 
read and understood together with 
the accounting principles (sections 
“reporting process and scope”, 
“indicator definitions”, “list of 
reporting sites” and “tax contribution 
principles”), which management is 
solely responsible for selecting and 
applying. the absence of a 
significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to 
evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability 
between entities and over time. 
 
work performed 
we are required to plan and perform 
our work in order to consider the risk 
of material misstatement of the 
data. in doing so and based on our 
professional judgement, we:  
• completed a media search to 
identify relevant risks and issues 
within the scope of the assurance 
engagement for carlsberg during 
the reporting period;  
• reviewed the suitability of the 
reporting criteria;  
• evaluated the design and 
implementation of the systems, 
and processing and internal 
controls over the selected data in 
scope for our assurance 
engagement;  
• conducted interviews with relevant 
policy owners at corporate levels, 
who are responsible for collecting, 
consolidating and carrying out 
internal control procedures on the 
selected data in scope for our 
assurance engagement;  
• performed remote site visits on 
production sites in vietnam, russia 
and greece to obtain insight into 
local sustainability management, 
review data and assess the 
robustness of the sustainability 
data management systems;  
• conducted an analytical review of 
the selected data in scope for our 
assurance engagement submitted 
by all production sites for 
consolidation at corporate level 
• evaluated relevant internal and 
external documentation, based on 
sampling, to determine whether the 
selected data in scope for our 
assurance engagement is supported 
by sufficient evidence;  
• reconciled selected tax information 
with the audited consolidated 
financial statements of carlsberg 
a/s;  
• read other information included in 
the 2020 carlsberg group 
sustainability report in order to 
identify any material 
inconsistencies with the selected 
data in scope for our assurance 
engagement and our limited 
assurance report thereon.  
 
carlsberg’s responsibilities 
management of the carlsberg group 
is responsible for:  
• designing, implementing and 
maintaining internal control over 
information relevant to the 
preparation of data in the carlsberg 
group sustainability report that is 
free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error;  
• establishing objective accounting 
principles for preparing data;  
• measuring and reporting data in 
the sustainability report based on 
the accounting principles; and  
• the content of the carlsberg group 
sustainability report for the period 
1 january – 31 december 2020.  
 
our responsibilities 
we are responsible for:  
• planning and performing the 
engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether selected 
environmental, health & safety, 
social and economic contribution 
data in the 2020 carlsberg group 
sustainability report are free from 
material misstatement, and are 
prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the accounting 
principles;  
• forming an independent 
conclusion, based on the 
procedures performed and the 
evidence obtained; and  
• reporting our conclusion to the 
stakeholders of the carlsberg 
group.
