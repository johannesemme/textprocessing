the power of commitment  
the power of commitment  
2020 was an extraordinary year that impacted us
all. as a transport and logistics company, we are used to 
being exposed to global events and its impact on our 
infrastructure. however, the corona pandemic impacted us 
with such intensity and magnitude that i personally have 
not experienced anything similar before. when the
crisis hit us the hardest, and required us to close our 
passenger business and furlough of 1/3 of our employees,
we leaned on our purpose to move for all to grow. our
commitment kept us focused on doing our utmost for
customers and employees. in parallel we introduced
our climate action plan, committing us to becoming a
climate neutral company by 2050.
 
becoming climate neutral by 2050   
our climate action plan ensures we prioritise our 
environmental footprint. in an industry with a large carbon 
footprint, we are committed to finding solutions that will 
eventually transform how our industry operates. the plan 
commits to climate neutrality by 2050 by gradually reducing 
our footprint. we will reduce co² emissions by 45% by 2030.  
innovation for green fuels   
96% of our co² emissions come from our vessels, making 
it a natural focal point in our green transition. however, 
the challenge is twofold: vessels are designed and 
built for today's fuelling, and green fuel alternatives 
for vessels do not currently exist. to address the first 
challenge, we focus on several projects aiming to reduce 
co² emissions from our existing fleet over the next ten 
years, as well as reducing co² emissions from our trucks, 
travel, cars, and buildings. 
 
to find green fuel alternatives, we joined two sustainable 
fuelling partnerships in 2020. one project aims to develop 
a hydrogen and e-fuel production facility in copenhagen. 
the other aims to build a 100% hydrogen-powered ferry, 
running on electricity from a hydrogen fuel cell system that 
emits only water. more partnerships like these will speed up 
innovation and help us transition and sustain our company 
and industry in the years to come.   
 
moving for employees to grow 
it is rooted in our dna to care for our people. as we operate 
in logistics locations, at terminals, and sea, our people's 
safety is a particular focus of mine. with the outbreak of the 
pandemic, the safety of our people remained a top priority. 
our mental health became an issue of concern, with office 
employees working from home. for our many non-office 
colleagues, frequent testing and the creation of safe work 
shift routines were quickly implemented.  
 
diversity & inclusion 
we must develop diverse and inclusive teams in an industry 
with a long tradition for being diverse on nationalities but 
less so on gender. today, our organisation includes 23% 
women, and it is our ambition to increase that number to 
30% by 2023. in 2020, senior leadership in dfds pledged 
to make dfds even more diverse and inclusive. we 
made diversity and inclusion a top priority parameter in 
promotions, recruitments, and projects.  
 
despite a challenging 2020, i am proud of the progress we 
made on sustainability. our commitment to move for all 
to grow is deeply embedded in our culture and benefits 
customers and people alike. it helps make us a valuable 
partner to society.  
 
in closing, i would like to thank our colleagues for their 
extraordinary commitment to our company during 
challenging times. a special thank you to customers and 
our external partners, without whom we would not succeed. 
lastly, a thank you to shareholders and our board of 
directors for their continued support.

sustainability strategy
being a transport and logistics provider, we are comitted to 
having a sustainability strategy that helps us reduce our 
environmental footprint and to ensure that our employees are 
safe, healthy, and treated equally. 
we defined our sustainability strategy in 2018. the two 
overarching themes environmental footprint and caring 
employer are each supported by three ambitions. in 2019, we 
added individual metrics to measure progress. in 2020, we 
completed our specific, targeted, and actionable climate action 
plan and emphasised organisational sustainability, including 
health & safety, diversity & inclusion, and our code of conduct. 
sustainability is an intrinsic component of our daily planning 
and operations. we have thorough processes and reporting 
lines to help us reduce our environmental footprint and 
continuously strengthen our position as a caring employer. 
we assess risks, analyse, and investigate relevant initiatives 
and adjust our actions as needed to stay on track with our 
commitments. sustainability is also an inherent element in 
investment considerations: all capex investments above €1 
million must be accompanied by documentation assessing 
the investment’s environmental impact before they can be 
authorised. the executive management team (emt) has 
approved the climate action plan and follows its progress 
closely during the year.

un sustainable development goals
our sustainability strategy aligns 
with un sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) 3, 5, 13, 14 and 17 
because they are particularly 
relevant to our business activities. 
these sdgs guide our efforts and 
represent global principles for 
responsible conduct, to which we 
want to be held accountable.

sustainability strategy
environmental footprint
air quality
taking responsibility for bringing down emissions 
customers are becoming more prone to seeking climate-
conscious suppliers who can prove that their business 
is sustainable. we continuously adjust our business and 
operations to minimise our environmental footprint to 
remain a competitive supplier, partner, and employer.
in 2020, we finalised our climate action plan. we want 
to be climate neutral by 2050 and aim for a relative 
reduction of ghg emissions by 45% from 2008 to 2030, 
corresponding to an approximate reduction of 32% 
between 2019 and 2030. 
our emissions of co² equivalents were estimated at 
2.020.000 tonnes of co² – 96% of which come from 
the operation of our ferries. we have reduced our co² 
emissions by 4% since 2019. we continued to improve our 
efficiency and cut emissions per unit by reducing average 
fuel consumption. the main drivers of the reduction 
were new efficient tonnage, operational and technical 
improvements, and innovative anti-fouling treatments 
to reduce resistance on a number of vessels. part of the 
emissions reduction on total volumes was also largely 
driven by the reduced operational activities caused by the 
environmental footprint
our comprehensive climate action
plan will lead to the improvement of
air quality. the plan’s targets are to
reduce relative co² emissions by 45% 
by 2030 and to make us climate
neutral by 2050. 
we aim to be a responsible neighbour 
who contributes to reducing pollution, 
waste, and noise in the communities
in which we operate.
we operate in the marine environment 
and want to support ocean life, relevant 
research, and educational initiatives.

global pandemic within the passenger business, resulting 
in several ferries being taken out of operation. on the other 
hand, additional tonnage and fuel consumption during q4 
related to increased trade volumes and brexit partly off-set 
the reduction.    
2030 target: we know where and how to improve 
our short-term plan for reducing emissions is based on 
careful analysis of how we operate today, and identification 
of the areas with the most significant potential for 
improvement. we have a long tradition of continuously 
improving our operation and fuel efficiency, resulting 
in a 21% improvement from 2008-2020. to reach our 
2023 and 2030 targets, we need to increase our speed of 
implementation and have therefore identified necessary 
actions such as fleet replacement and environmental 
upgrading, optimising the vessels' hydro-dynamic 
performance to reduce friction in the water and improving 
decision support systems to help crews and shore-side 
support teams operate in a more fuel-efficient way, as well 
as continuous improvements to energy consumption. we 
actively develop and test new means of propulsion and 
energy generation and participate in testing low carbon fuels 
such as biofuels. we currently run +20 projects that aim to 
reduce co² emissions from our existing fleet over the next 
ten years. combined, they will result in a relative reduction 
in emissions of roughly 45% from 2008 to 2030.  in 2021, 
we will improve our internal emission accounting by aligning 
data from all the different parts of the organisation involved 
in climate plan reporting and develop a common reporting 
standard. this might have a minor impact on previously 
reported performance, but it will improve our ability to 
measure results and assess areas that need improvement. 
we recently introduced better 
silicone-based hull coating on 
four of our new jinling vessels 
while they were in dry dock. the 
remaining two jinling vessels 
will also get this hull treatment. 
this simple improvement reduces 
water resistance and enables us 
to use less fuel. it is expected to 
reduce our annual c0² emissions 
by 4-6% or 10,000 tons on these 
four vessels alone.

we are developing a hydrogen 
ferry that only emits water, 
europa seaways. if the project 
succeeds in achieving the 
necessary financing and results, 
she will serve our oslo- 
copenhagen-frederikshavn 
route from 2026.
towards zero emission shipping in 2050
the major transition towards zero emission shipping 
requires our industry to replace today’s fossil-fuel 
dependent fleets with a new generation of ships that run on 
sustainable fuels created entirely from renewable energy. 
in the long term – by 2050 – we will replace fossil 
fuels with zero emission fuels like ammonia, hydrogen, 
or methanol. storing, handling, and using these new 
fuels differs vastly from how fossil fuel works. finding 
feasible alternatives to fossil fuels calls for cross-sector 
collaboration and an appetite for experiments. numerous 
complex uncertainties still hold back the commercial 
viability of renewable fuels. the demand for them depends 
on price differentials between black and green energy, 
availability, bunker infrastructure, and regulations. 
closing the price gap between fossil and renewable fuels 
will be critical to driving the adoption, construction, and 
use of zero emission vessels. we openly share information 
about which sustainable fuels we are investigating and 
the volumes we estimate to be required to fuel a business 
of our size. we are contributing to the development of a 
hydrogen factory in copenhagen and a green ammonia 
production facility in esbjerg, to better understand 
the production of green fuels and contribute to their 
availability. with projects like those, we aim to lessen the 
price gap between black and green fuels and sustain our 
commercial competitiveness. 
we are vocal about the sustainability challenges and 
possibilities that face the maritime industry. we pursue 
new knowledge and partnerships to help qualify our 
setting emission
targets for our ships
• we are fully committed to the 
international maritime organisation 
(imo)’s ghg (greenhouse gases) strategy 
and use “gross tonnage multiplied by 
distance travelled” when reporting on 
ghg emissions performance.  
• based on a 2008 baseline of 17.1 grams 
co² per gt-mile, the 2023 target is set at 
12.4 grams co² per gt-mile.  
• the 2030 target is set at 9.6 grams co² 
per gt-mile. we are therefore aiming 
for a 45% reduction between 2008 and 
2030. the development from 2008 to 
2020 showed a reduction of 21%. 
• achieving the 2030 target requires a 
29% reduction from 2020 levels.

contributing to regulation processes and are in close 
dialogue with customers to understand their expectations. 
testing biofuels based on agricultural waste
in 2019, we invested in mash energy, a start-up 
developing a method to produce commercially viable 
biofuel from agricultural waste. in 2021, we aim to test 
mash energy’s b11 biofuel based on leftover nutshells  
on our ferry pearl seaways. by testing the fuel, we can 
help create realistic alternatives and supplements to  
fossil fuels. 
improving air quality with scrubbers 
we are cutting sulphur levels through our pioneering 
work with air cleaning systems. we were one of the first 
shipping companies to deploy scrubbers on our ferries, 
installing the first system in 2009 on ficaria seaways. 
scrubbers are the best available option to combat so², 
and other air pollution particles. studies indicate that 
using scrubbers emits less co² than using low sulphur oil – 
in our case this means an estimated reduction in the total 
value chain of 25,000 tonnes of c0² in 2020. we also see 
indications of our scrubbers emitting considerably less so² 
than the compliance rules require. in 2020, we completed 
the installation of scrubber systems on board our ships 
in the mediterranean sea, bringing the total of vessels in 
dfds with installed scrubbers to 36. the two new freight/
passenger ferries we will deploy in 2021 and 2022 will 
also have scrubbers installed. 
upgrading our road fleet to cut emissions 
we invest in trucks with the highest 
possible euro class engines to reduce 
exhaust emissions and ensure optimal 
safety and efficiency. in 2020, we 
purchased 27 euro 6 standard volvo trucks 
for our uk operations. 98% of our 640 
trucks are now euro 5 or 6-certified. these 
vehicles effectively reduce harmful gas 
emissions, are fuel-efficient, and equipped 
with high-quality communication systems.  
across the logistics division, we are 
reducing emissions through improving fuel 
efficiency. we are training drivers in eco 
driving, optimising route planning, and 
using bio diesel (hvo). in sweden, we use 
biofuel in almost all logistics locations.  
we have initiated innovative partnerships 
with customers and truck manufacturers. 
in 2021, we plan to test fuel additives 
in a research set-up to confirm that this 
will increase fuel efficiency and reduce 
emission per kilometre. if the test results 
are positive, we plan to scale the test to a 
section of the fleet. we will also test our 
first electric truck next year. 
zero emission fuels: speeding up the the 
development of zero emission energy 
distribution at sea 
zeeds (zero emission energy distribution 
at sea) is an open innovation partnership 
across the maritime value chain. our 
partners equinor, wärtsilä, aker solutions, 
and grieg star have different competencies 
and knowledge that can help move shipping 
from where it is today to a zero-emission 
shipping future. there are several projects 
in development, like an island energy 
ecosystem, an offshore hub production unit 
for ammonia, an ammonia bunkering ship, 
and converting a vessel to run on ammonia. 
in 2021, there is a particular focus on the 
environmental aspects of using ammonia as 
a replacement for fossil fuel in a maritime 
setting.

the share of electric and hybrid vehicles in our terminal-
based fleet will increase significantly in 2021 because we 
across several locations no longer allow leasing of petrol or 
diesel vehicles. fully electric and hybrid vehicles eliminate 
or significantly reduce nox pollutants compared to diesel 
engines.  
shore power 
our work to cut local emissions of nox and particle matter 
includes installing shore power supply on vessels. doing 
this will enable us to switch off auxiliary engines during 
port stay, reducing emissions, harmful particles, and noise. 
it significantly improves local air quality and is potentially 
emission-free if derived from renewable electricity sources. 
all our newbuilds have a built-in shore power system 
function, and in 2020 we completed the last installation 
on the oslo-frederikshavn- copenhagen route. we remain in 
close dialogue with applicable authorities to determine port 
locations able and willing to install the infrastructure needed 
for shore power utilisation. the port of oslo completed their 
installation in 2020, and gothenburg will introduce a new 
electrical shoreside power supply system in january 2021. 
we have signed a letter of intent with copenhagen malmö 
port about shore power in copenhagen. the agreement states 
that the port will invest in a connection enabling us to fully 
utilise our existing onboard installations.  
responsible neighbour
taking local responsibility
we play a significant role as an employer in many local 
communities due to our sizeable operations and broad 
network. we operate in places where people live and work, 
and we must act as a responsible neighbour in all areas 
of our business. this involves improving our buildings and 
operations to make them more energy-efficient, shifting 
to hybrid and electric vehicles to improve local air quality, 
and governing the management of our inputs (responsible 
procurement) and outputs (waste management). 
tackling our land-based energy consumption in our local 
offices, warehouses, and terminals is crucial for reducing 
our local emissions. we measure the efficiency per 
fte, as the number of people working within a building 
there is the main driver of energy use. in 2020, we saw 
a significant reduction of 14% in energy consumption 
per fte. like the reductions in previous years, this is 
mainly due to increased awareness and local energy-
saving initiatives. that we had many employees working 
from home this year was also a contributing factor. in 
2021, we will start identifying locations suitable for the 
installation of solar panels. at our new headquarters 
being built in copenhagen, solar panels are part of the 
construction.

part of the planet’s longest-running
global marine survey
continuous plankton recorders (cpr) 
are towed after many of our ferries to 
collect data and help scientists measure 
the changing state and presence of sea 
plankton. every marine ecosystem relies 
on plankton for its basic food source, and 
it generates half the oxygen we breathe. it 
is crucial to all life on our planet. plankton 
also absorbs c0² emissions. the pandemic 
has paused much biological research, yet 
the plankton survey has been able to 
continue because the crews have been eager 
to prioritise it and do the necessary work.
marine environment
protecting ocean life
our day-to-day activities come at a risk to the marine 
environment. minimising water pollution, protecting ocean life, 
and supporting research and education are key elements in 
our sustainability strategy. vessels crossing seas can be the 
cause of oil spills and discharges and we unfortunately had 
one oil spill in 2020, caused by human error.
there is an increasing focus on biodiversity on land and 
in the marine environment. this is an area in which dfds 
can make a difference. a major step towards securing 
maritime biodiversity is to prevent the spread of potentially 
invasive aquatic species through ballast water from ships 
operating across regions. we work actively to reduce this 
risk by removing or inactivating biological organisms before 
releasing ballast water into the marine ecosystem. in 2020, 
we continued our ballast water management programme and 
installed ballast water treatment systems on eight ferries, 
making a total of 20. we expect to install eight new systems in 
2021 and installations on all ferries to be complete in 2024. 
we have an ongoing commitment to collaborate extensively 
with scientific research institutions to uncover crucial 
changes to marine environments and help inform and shape 
governmental policies to protect biodiversity. we provide 
access to data collection from our ferries, enabling our research 
partners to conduct a wide range of research at sea. our 
continuing projects include monitoring whales and dolphins 
with orca, monitoring cetacean and seabirds with marinelife, 
and long-term measurement of the ecological health of marine 
plankton with the continuous plankton recorder survey.

caring employer
diverse and inclusive workplace 
we move for all to grow
we believe a diverse workplace is an effective, engaged, and 
high performing workplace. diversity enables better business 
choices based on an individual’s unique contribution. bringing 
together people with various backgrounds and expertise 
creates a culture where different viewpoints are acknowledged, 
which helps prevent decision-making based on habits and 
unconscious bias. 
diversity & inclusion is at the top of our agenda and an  
integral aspect of all hr processes and our code of conduct.  
we aim to have a minimum of 30% minority representation  
by 2023, and in 2020 people division partners worked to 
include these considerations into operating procedures. 
our performance measurement focuses on improvements 
in gender diversity. however, to secure a truly diverse 
workforce, minority representation also relates to race, 
ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, age, 
education level, and socioeconomic status. 
gender diversity in dfds

associated with male attributes and continue to be so today,

health and encourage them to find 
opportunities to give back and do 
good in the societies where they

women in our company dipped this year. this was due to 
the structural changes we set in place because of covid-19. 
our passenger division was hit the hardest by furloughing 
and layoffs. as the gender diversity here is above the dfds 
average, organisational changes had a visible impact on the 
gender balance of the total workforce. 
on our ferries, the share of women is 15% of the total 
workforce. the ratio drops to 7% for managers, but this is 
still above the industry average. in 2020, we signed the 
charter for more women in shipping – an initiative led by 
danish shipping - committing ourselves to strengthening our 
focus on gender equality in our industry. an internal task 
force is currently looking at how we can segment and target 
our approach to make our industry more attractive to a more 
diverse audience whilst being realistic about how quickly we 
can progress, given the available talent pool. 
at the end of 2020, 27% of our staff on land are women and 
the ratio is the same for our managers. this is close to our 
target of 30% by 2023. achieving gender diversity remains 
a high priority as women are still underrepresented in many 
areas, for instance in senior management, where only 16% 
are women. in 2020, the entire senior management team 
prepared plans for how to incorporate diversity and inclusion 
in their daily priorities. this will be tracked and followed-up 
during 2021.
leading from a distance 
as people began working from home in march, it became 
clear that we needed to put extra efforts into making them 
feel included and part of a unified team. leading from a 
distance and keeping a dual focus on performance and 
well-being was new to many managers. as a response, 
we initiated remote leadership training for managers to 
give them a framework and tools for providing direction 
and a sense of belonging. we expect to have gone through 
training for all managers by q1 2021.

well-being for all employees
people’s safety always comes first 
operating a business where 45% of our employees 
work in high-risk working environments requires us to 
continuously assess and improve our overall health 
and safety performance. we have clear targets for this 
both on land and at sea. in 2020, we have again seen a 
positive decrease in our ltif (lost-time injury frequency) 
in both areas. but despite safety being top of everyone’s 
mind in high-risk locations, there are still too many 
accidents and we will continue to work to reduce them. 
in 2021 we will review our exiting targets to evaluate 
if they are ambitious enough. minor accidents are more 
frequent than major accidents and injuries. in 2020, the 
most common causes of minor accidents were slips, trips, 
or falls, or involved manual handling, lifting, or carrying. 
our approach to safety is based on risk. we set more 
safety controls and formal inspection regimes for higher-
risk locations like port terminals than for lower-risk 
places like offices. at sea, we carry out frequent reviews

cause of minor accidents
to identify and establish safeguards against risks to 
people, ships, and the environment. ashore, our approach 
to safety is to empower local management teams to take 
local responsibility. our safety culture is embedded in the 
dfds way and outlined in our code of conduct and health, 
safety & environmental policy. 
sadly, two accidents were fatal for two external 
contractors in 2020. in vlaardingen, a driver came 
between a standing and a moving trailer. our colleague 
who found the driver immediately alerted the dfds first 
aid team and emergency services. but despite a swift 
response, an ambulance arriving within minutes, and 
everyone doing everything in their power, the driver’s 
life could not be saved. in mersin, while pipes were being 
repaired on the deck of the freight ferry und atilim, a 
tugmaster hit the scaffolding while a supplier’s employee 
was working on it. the employee of the stevedoring 
company servicing dfds fell from the scaffolding and was 
taken to hospital immediately, but it was not possible to 
save his life. our health & safety team worked closely 
with authorities to support their investigations into these 
unfortunate and tragic accidents, and both cases were 
closed with no remarks to our responsibility. we want to 
make sure that these incidents do not happen again and 
carefully evaluated the situations leading up to their 
occurrence. besides local improvements, we implemented 
a new safety first programme as a result of these events.

new safety programme 
in 2020, we introduced a new safety programme across the 
business, safety first. its purpose is to track accidents and 
near-misses, strengthen our safety culture, reduce accidents, 
and help our colleagues become even more aware of what 
they can do to avoid dangerous behaviour. we started 
implementing it in high-risk ship/shore locations in 2020, and 
the work continues across all our locations in 2021. we also 
began tracking all health & safety data in one consolidated 
system in 2020. this was previously handled locally. by 
tracking safety in all locations and comparing data, we gain an 
overview of where accidents happen and what leads to their 
occurrence. this makes us able to better assess where to set 
in to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring again, share 
best practice, and benchmark health & safety performance. 
first maritime member of rail safety board 
in our efforts to live up to and set standards 
for safe transportation, we became the first 
maritime member of the uk rail safety 
and standards board (rssb) in 2020. this 
industry body works to achieve continuous 
improvement in railways’ health and safety 
performance in the uk. the rail industry has 
many similarities to port industries, and this 
membership will help guide us on how to 
continue to make rail transport safer and 
better across our network. 
a sound mind  
looking after the well-being of our people also includes awareness 
and support of their mental health. we increased communication 
to our colleagues both on business-related issues (to enable 
them to stay informed at a distance) as well as on more personal 
matters, as covid-19 forced us all to balance working from home 
with dealing with the insecurity of not knowing how long isolation 
would last. we introduced extensive testing procedures and safe 
bubbles within teams for our terminal, vessel, and warehouse 
employees. office-based employees have been working from 
home to stay safe and reduce their risk of infection. we have so 
far avoided operational challenges caused by local outbreaks of 
covid-19. sadly, we have seen a single death related to covid-19 
as one of our colleagues, a baltic crew member, passed away with 
it this year.  
as a seafarer’s work sometimes entails long absences from family 
and friends, they are more prone to experience mental health 
issues. at dfds, seafarers make up half of our employees. some 
of them have been impacted by the pandemic by being unable to 
get home or return to work due to ongoing travel restrictions. as 
an employer, we do everything we can to give them the support, 
guidance, and assistance they need in these difficult times. we 
continuously worked with shipowners' associations, unions, and 
other industry bodies during the pandemic to ensure safe crew 
mobility across borders. in some cases, we interacted directly with 
governments.  
in january 2021, we joined 300 other companies in shipping, 
transport, and supply chains in signing the neptune declaration for 
seafarer wellbeing and crew change, supporting actions we as an 
industry must address to facilitate crew changes and keep global 
supply chains functioning.

clear reporting lines and 
carefully ensure that any 
donation or sponsorship is

products to european countries for free. a partnership 
with the women entrepreneurs association of turkey 
(kagider) and 21 logistics partners, this project 
contributes to helping small business owners access and 
introduce their goods to bigger markets.
shortly before christmas, the french government closed 
its borders for passengers and lorry drivers entering the 
country from the uk because of a mutant coronavirus 
found in the uk. when the borders reopened, a queue 
of lorries and drivers faced having to spend christmas 
waiting for the next post-christmas sailing. dfds 
colleagues volunteered to keep ferries sailing despite the 
port normally being closed during this time of the year.
opportunities to do good
seize the chance to help where we can
we are a large company and a considerable local employer 
in parts of europe, uk, and turkey.. we are proud to be 
a business that has assets we can use to benefit people 
around us. there is no contradiction between having a 
business mindset and doing good. 
in 2020, we signed a contract with the uk government 
to ensure ferry capacity for transport of vital goods like 
medicine and food after the end of the brexit transition 
period. we have also renewed our agreement with danish 
armed forces to provide ships for the transport of military 
equipment in connection with nato preparedness and 
humanitarian crises. as a result of this cooperation in the 
past, the danish armed forces have taken part in many 
humanitarian operations using dfds ships, including the 
danish-led un mission to transport chemicals out of syria 
and libya and the un ebola effort in east africa.
our colleagues have a tradition of launching activities 
that help local people and communities. when the 
copenhagen - oslo route was temporarily suspended in 
april, large volumes of food on the two ferries on this 
route could not be used. copenhagen colleagues acted 
quickly and contacted the local youth shelter, rg60 and 
fødevarebanken, a danish organisation that fights food 
waste and helps distribute meals to socially vulnerable 
people. both organisations were happy to receive the food.

our policies provide clear guidance
providing maritime transport and logistics services mean 
we are always in close contact with people. it also implies 
that our activities can have an impact on human rights. it is 
a priority for us to pay attention to respecting these rights 
through clear policies designed to influence and determine 
all major decisions, actions, and activities that take place 
within their boundaries, as we do not tolerate any form of 
discrimination or harrasment.
updated code of conduct
times change and our code of conduct needed a brush 
up to live up to its purpose and remain relevant to 
employees in light of the challenges they face. we 
involved stakeholders across the organisation in 
reviewing it in 2020, and the new version is more simple 
and accessible, both in tone and format. it follows the 
principles laid out in the un global compact and describes 
what behaviours we emphasise and how employees 
should respond to ethical issues. it now includes gdpr 
(general data protection regulation) and other data 
privacy considerations. we work to ensure that all 
employees are aware of the code and use it as a guide  
to deal with potentially sensitive issues. it is an essential 
tool for us to value and develop our culture and ways  
of working.

to make sure everyone has the possibility to report 
unwanted behaviour in a structured way, we have a 
whistleblowing scheme covering the whole group. 24 
cases were reported in 2020, of which 25% were related to 
covid-19. we take all violations seriously and investigate 
every report to learn from them and prevent future cases. 
the whistleblowing scheme will soon be translated into 
selected local languages to avoid misunderstandings 
preventing people from reporting violations. in 2020, we 
released a renumeration report for the executive board 
for the first time as well as formalised our renumeration 
policy and group tax policy.
we take responsibility for our supply chains
we recognise the importance of building and sustaining a 
responsible supply chain. our procurement team strives to 
minimise the risk of us negatively affecting human rights 
(including labour rights) and the environment across our 
supply chain. 
we joined the responsible supply chain programme 
impa act in 2015. this initiative of the international 
marine purchasing association aims to improve the 
economic, social, and environmental compliance of its 
ship purchaser and supplier members. as many shipping 
companies share suppliers, a standardised common 
system helps keep the industry compliant. our supplier 
code of conduct incorporates the impa act supplier 
code of conduct, which is based on the un global 
compact and its guiding principles on business and 
human rights. it asks all dfds suppliers to conform to 
the code and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations 
where they operate. they must also have policies and 
procedures in place to respect human rights, address 
significant environmental impacts, counter corruption, 
and responsibly deal with ship recycling.

sustainable shipping forum (essf). this group promotes 
structured dialogue, technical knowledge exchange, 
cooperation, and coordination between relevant maritime 
industry stakeholders and the eu commission. we also 
participate in the imo’s marine environment protection 
committee (mepc). through our participation in interferry, 
we support the interests of the ferry industry, as well 
as in imo institutions. we are also active members of 
relevant national shipowners’ organisations, especially in 
denmark and the uk. collectively, shipowners’ voices are 
represented in ecsa (european community shipowners’

an independent non-profit organisation driven and financed 
by the members who want to explore the road towards 
emission-free maritime transport.
we disclose data to improve
we believe in total transparency and voluntarily disclose 
and/or verify esg (environmental, social and governance) 
data to the stakeholders like cdp, sustainalytics, and 
others. 
we want to set and impact standards 
business standards help us set priorities and ensure 
our awareness of and dedication to relevant practices. 
we support a range of standards and frameworks for 
responsible business, supply chains, and the protection of 
human rights.
we acknowledge the need to set science-based targets 
to ensure that our climate ambitions are in line with the 
responsible ship recycling
even though we rarely recycle ships, it is important
that we have policies in place to determine what
happens if we do. we have developed quality standards 
based on protecting the environment and making the 
recycling process safe.
if we need to recycle a ship, we will use an
approved yard, and carry out the work in line with eu
ship recycling regulations and the principles of the
international maritime organisation (imo)’s hong kong 
international convention. the convention aims to ensure 
that ships being recycled at the end of their operational 
lives do not pose unnecessary risks to safety and
human health or the environment.

 peder gellert was elected 
chairperson of marlog 
(maritime & logistics innovation 
denmark) in 2020. marlog is a 
cluster for promoting and sharing 
innovation and knowledge 
between companies and projects 
in the danish maritime industries, 
to reinforce denmark’s strong 
position in the global transport 
chain and work towards carbon 
neutral shipping.
 in 2020, we entered into a 
partnership that was granted 
€20 million in eu funding for 
the development of automated 
driving systems for heavy vehicles. 
automated driving systems can 
improve safety and efficiency in 
freight transport. optimisation 
of fuel consumption and better 
vehicle utilisation are just some of 
the benefits that can be expected 
when highly automated systems 
are used in logistics operations 
going from hub-to-hub in mixed 
traffic and in confined areas.
paris agreement. we do not currently calculate scope 3 
emissions as they are estimated to be below 10% of our 
total emissions. this ratio will be specified when we begin 
to set our own science-based target. we expect that this 
will happen in early 2021, when the official methodology 
for maritime transportation is ready.
we are committed to contribute to
sustainable development through partnerships
collaboration is key to solving the challenges of today 
and tomorrow. we therefore work with entrepreneurs, 
universities, scientists, companies, academia, ngos, and 
public institutions in solid, innovative, and dedicated multi-
sector partnerships to develop radical innovative solutions, 
business and financing models. we believe that venturing 
into broad partnerships with stakeholders that share our 
aim for sustainable development is what will bring our 
societies and industries in a healthier direction. given the 
ambition and extensiveness of our climate plan, many 
of our partnerships naturally focus on developing new 
fuels, cutting emissions, and reducing our environmental 
footprint. but we also actively seek out partnerships to 
learn and develop in other areas of the business.

co²e emissions  
direct co² emissions (scope 1 
as defined by the greenhouse 
gas protocol): all direct emission 
sources where dfds has operational 
control. this includes all use of fossil 
fuels for stationary combustion or 
transportation, in owned, leased or 
rented assets. it also includes process 
emissions (e.g. chemical processes, 
industrial gases, direct methane 
emissions).  
indirect co² emissions (scope 2 
as defined by the greenhouse gas 
protocol): indirect emissions related 
to purchased energy; electricity or 
heating/cooling where the dfds has 
operational control. the electricity 
emissions factors used are based 
on national gross electricity 
production mixes on a three-year 
rolling average (iea stat). the nordic 
electricity mix covers the weighted 
production in sweden, norway, 
finland and denmark, reflecting the 
common nord pool market area. 
emission factors per fuel type are 
based on assumptions from the iea 
methodological framework. factors 
for district heating/cooling are either 
based on actual (local) production 
mixes, or the average iea stat.
