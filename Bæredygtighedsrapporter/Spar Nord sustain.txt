overview: goals and actions at spar nord
as a result, our own challenges did not 
displace our focus on the challenges the 
world is facing, and our work towards a 
sustainable and responsible development 
remained on track during the year. this 
also applied to our efforts to comply with 
upcoming statutory sector requirements in 
the area.
the lockdowns made for a challenging 
year, but they also accelerated some of 
the measures already underway. carbon 
emissions dropped because of less trans-
port and more distance working, and new 
digital work methods proved efficient from 
day one. hence, the hurdles of the pan-
demic also contributed positively to the cli-
mate, work efficiency and job satisfaction.
at the beginning of 2020, spar nord 
became a signatory to the un global 
compact (corporate responsibility), the 
un principles for responsible banking (un 
prb) and the un principles for responsible 
investment (un pri). consequently, this 
report describes our continued efforts to 
implement these principles within our busi-
ness, organisation and culture, while also 
providing a status report on developments 
in our special focus areas.
i hope you will find it an interesting read!

it would be tempting to conclude that 
the best thing about 2020 is that it is now 
behind us. the global pandemic affected 
everyone's lives and tested the cohesion 
of our societies in every way imaginable. 
however, although 2020 was a challeng-
ing year, our employees and our business 
model demonstrated how strong we are 
when it really matters.
the lockdown enacted in denmark in 
march put the economy and markets in a 
state of emergency.  supply and demand 
were hit simultaneously, and danish banks 
assumed responsibility by making liquidity 
available to customers affected by the 
consequences of the pandemic. at spar 
nord, we benefitted from being a solid and 
personal bank with in-depth knowledge of 
our customers’ finances, which enabled us 
to accommodate 99% of our retail cus-
tomers’ and 95% of our business customers’ 
requests for extraordinary credits during 
the pandemic. this contributed not only 
to supporting our goal of helping create 
opportunities and prosperity wherever we 
are present, but also underpinned our goal 
of being a reputable and responsible bank.
while our business model stood its test, 
our employees passed with flying colours. 
every day, they were challenged by lock-
downs, distance working, online meetings, 
childcare, quarantines and changing work 
shifts. nevertheless, mutual solidarity and 
tolerance meant we were able to maintain 
job satisfaction as well as productivity 
under these difficult conditions.

business model
customers first
spar nord is a nationwide bank with 
335,000 retail customers and 49,000 
business customers. spar nord offers all 
types of financial services, consultancy and 
products, focusing on retail customers and 
smes in the local areas in which the bank is 
represented.
spar nord currently has a nationwide 
distribution network comprising 49 local 
banks, which will be expanded to 51 local 
banks in 2021.
as one of the country’s systemically im-
portant banks, it is not only our duty to 
contribute to positive and sustainable 
economic developments in the many local 
communities in which we operate, we 
also share a responsibility for promoting 
prudence and accountability in society in 
general.
born as a local bank, we have nearly 200 
years’ experience showing we do our best 
by being as close to our customers as 
possible. the core of our business model is 
local commitment combined with strong 
central support. spar nord consists of local 
entities with extensive decision-making 
powers in areas such as customer service, 
market canvassing and employee condi-
tions.
our decentralised and customer-focused 
business model allows the local spar nord 
branch to focus on customer proximity, 
while our headquarters deal with high-
ly specialised tasks in areas such as the 
development of responsible products, 
centralised management and monitoring 
of the credit area, investing, and in our ef-
forts to combat money laundering, terrorist 
financing and cybercrime.
  risks 
in line with all other banks, spar nord's business model is associated with a number of 
inherent risks. 
as a consequence, we are especially focused on maintaining and developing an agile 
organisation that adheres to sound practices and strengthens its resilience to the growing 
threats against our business, our customers and society at large. we aim to hedge risks 
through policies and actions that protect us from moving into zones that are grey from an 
ethical and legal perspective. 
our credit policy states that we seek to avoid loan exposures that could potentially harm 
the bank’s reputation, and we have procedures in place to ensure that sub-contractors 
and chains of sub-contractors are screened as far back as possible to ensure that our 
deliverables live up to spar nord’s code of ethics and legal standards.

spar nord has defined a strategic goal of 
being a reputable and responsible bank. 
this applies not only in relation to custom-
ers, employees and suppliers, but also from 
a social and global perspective. accord-
ingly, we have committed to implement-
ing responsible and sustainable business 
practices across all business areas and 
to promoting a responsible, inclusive and 
sustainable corporate culture.
in 2020, spar nord became a signatory to 
the un global compact, the un principles 
for responsible investment (un pri) and 
the un principles for responsible banking 
(un prb). this means the un goals and 
principles are now the overall benchmark 
for our initiatives, while our daily work is 
governed by our business strategy and 
prioritised through materiality analyses 
and assessments of the areas where we 
can make the greatest difference. for 2020 
onwards, we have selected six dedicated 
areas of priority.
while the un principles are the backbone 
of our csr efforts, national, european and 
sector-specific requirements and initiatives 
are also emerging. consequently, csr 
activities are naturally anchored in our 
management team.

csr and organisation
our responsibilities
csr organisation
the day-to-day management of 
spar nord’s various csr initiatives is 
handled by our csr organisation, 
which is anchored in the bank’s 
senior management team. the 
members of our csr organisa-
tion meet on a regular basis 
and constantly monitor risks, 
opportunities and progress in 
spar nord’s initiatives. 
the management of the csr 
organisation determines which 
measures and initiatives are 
required to achieve the bank’s 
current sustainability goals.
the un principles for responsible banking 
(un prb)
in 2021, we will make analyses and define priorities relative to the implemen-
tation of the un principles in the bank’s business procedures. 
the first csr report containing a full report in relation to the un principles for 
responsible banking will therefore be the report for 2021. 
alignment
we will align our business strategy to be consistent with and con-
tribute to individuals’ needs and society’s goals, as expressed in the 
sustainable development goals (sdgs), the paris climate agreement 
and relevant national and regional frameworks.
impact and target setting
we will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the 
negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and environ-
ment resulting from our activities, products and services. to this end, 
we will set and publish targets where we can have the most signifi-
cant impacts.
clients & customers
we will work responsibly with our clients and our customers to encour-
age sustainable practices and enable economic activities that create 
shared prosperity for current and future generations.
stakeholders
we will proactively and responsibly consult, engage and partner with 
relevant stakeholders to achieve society’s goals.
governance & culture
we will implement our commitment to these principles through effec-
tive governance and a culture of responsible banking.
transparency & accountability
we will periodically review our individual and collective implementa-
tion of these principles and be transparent about and accountable 
for our positive and negative impacts and our contribution to socie-
ty’s goals.

at year-end 2020, spar nord’s total loans 
and advances to retail and business 
customers stood at some dkk 138 billion 
with bank and leasing loans accounting 
for some dkk 44 billion and mortgage 
loans for some dkk 94 billion. by means of 
its lending, the bank helps finance a wide 
range of activities that may affect people, 
the environment and local communities, 
positively as well as negatively. therefore, 
spar nord is committed to developing and 
offering financial products that inspire our 
customers to make sustainable choices 
and also mitigate the negative effects of 
human activity on the environment, climate 
and social conditions.

sustainable finance
spar nord’s balanced credit policy was a 
key reason for the bank escaping relatively 
unscathed from the financial crisis. our 
lending policy has generally contributed 
to strengthening our integrity and the per-
ception of spar nord as a socially respon-
sible and sound bank. one of the corner-
stones of our lending policy is that we will 
not use risk tolerance as a competitive 
parameter or do business with customers 
who could potentially harm the bank’s rep-
utation. therefore, we continually monitor 
credit lines to ensure that the customer has 
the willingness and ability to pay, and we 
regularly pre-calculate loss risks.
bank and leasing loans:
2020 approx. dkk 44 billion 
(dkk 44.136 billion).
 
mortgage loans arranged
2020 approx. dkk 94 billion 
(dkk 93.892 billion).
 
total volume of loans arranged
2020 approx. dkk 138 billion 
(dkk 138.028 billion).
spar nord’s credit policy includes climate 
considerations and sustainability in the 
assessment of business customers. as a 
result of the policy, sustainable businesses 
are considered to be better equipped to 
handle market demands for green transi-
tioning and accountability.
increased focus on sustainable finance
in very general terms, every krone we lend 
has an environmental and climate impact. 
as part of our implementation of the un 
principles for responsible banking (un prb), 
we will therefore document the impact as 
precisely as possible going forward. this 
documentation will provide the foundation 
for our future efforts to promote sustaina-
bility through our lending activities.
 
as a first step, we have chosen to focus our 
sustainable finance efforts on specific loan 
products, beginning with car and home 
financing, and in future we will work with 
products targeting other areas.
by means of our sustainable finance 
initiatives, we expect to make our custom-
ers conscious of their choices, reduce the 
negative impact of our lending activity 
and generally improve our reputation. 
we launched our first sustainable finance 
product, bæredygtigbil (sustainablecar), in 
early 2020. at the same time, we started a 
collaboration with totalkredit and forenet 
kredit to make homeowners more aware of 
green construction and renovation.
in future csr reports, spar nord will report 
on our sustainable finance performance, 
including the number and volume of sus-
tainable loans.

  results 
at end 2020, the value of sustainable 
car loans totalled dkk 105 million.
  results 
in 2020, more than 2,600 persons used 
the tool for calculating energy savings 
at totalkredit.dk.
sustainable car loans
in denmark, cars drive an average of 
16,000 km a year, severely affecting the 
climate and the environment. against this 
background, spar nord has launched a car 
loan that contributes to reducing the glob-
al climate impact through purchases of 
carbon credits and investments in carbon 
reduction projects approved by the un. 
the loan can be taken out for the purchase 
of a new or used car, irrespective of fuel 
type, and an existing loan can be restruc-
tured into the sustainable variant.
when a customer finances a new or used 
car (petrol, diesel or hybrid), the average 
annual carbon emissions of that type of 
car may be compensated at a rate of 150% 
through the purchase of carbon credits. 
in this way, spar nord helps reduce the 
total climate impact from carbon dioxide 
emissions. 
at end 2020, the value of sustainable car 
loans totalled dkk 105 million.
green housing 
renovation 
some 40% of denmark’s energy consump-
tion derives from buildings, and a substan-
tial part of spar nord’s loan volume is for 
financing the construction or renovation 
of buildings. therefore, we participate in 
totalkredit’s initiative to promote green 
construction and energy-friendly renova-
tion projects. this is not only to the benefit 
of the climate and the environment, but in 
the vast majority of cases also the most 
cost-effective solution for the owner.
in 2020, around 2,600 persons used the 
tool for calculating energy savings at 
totalkredit.dk.
corporate social responsibility 2020
sustainable finance
  risks 
total loans and advances of dkk 138 billion entail a risk that the business activi-
ties we help finance have harmful effects on the climate, the environment and on 
human rights and conditions. this includes indirect effects, such as pollution and 
other environmental effects of driving, and more direct effects resulting from, for 
example, providing funding to companies that do not respect labour rights.

oil furnaces are being phased out as 
they are expensive and emit 70% more 
co2 than a heat pump. consequently, 
spar nord facilitates forenet kredit’s offer 
of a dkk 10,000 subsidy for replacing oil 
furnaces, which ran at the end of 2020.  
during 2020, 116 certificates with a value of 
dkk 10,000 were granted for the replace-
ment of oil furnaces. the replacement of oil 
furnaces with heat pumps is expected to 
reduce the carbon footprint from housing 
in denmark.

collaboration on 
green loans
spar nord is a shareholder of dlr, and 
from the beginning of 2021 spar nord and 
other shareholder banks will be arranging 
green loans for the agricultural sector, ur-
ban commercial property and for renewa-
ble energy projects. the loans are offered 
on attractive terms and conditions in order 
to speed up the green transition. as dlr 
plays an important role in the financing of 
the danish agricultural sector and danish 
rental properties, it has particularly good 
opportunities to contribute to the govern-
ment’s goal of achieving a 70% reduction in 
denmark’s carbon emissions by 2030.

responsible investment
spar nord offers proprietary and facili-
tates third party investment products for 
retail and business customers. investment 
always involves a risk of direct or indirect 
co-financing of activities which have an 
adverse impact on meeting the un sus-
tainable development goals. we therefore 
share a responsibility for ensuring ac-
countability in proprietary and facilitated 
investments. we have defined responsible 
investment requirements in our own invest-
ment policies and for investments made by 
our business partners.
committee for responsible investment
at the beginning of 2020, we became a 
signatory to the un principles for responsi-
ble investment (un pri), which are now the 
backbone of our responsible investment 
efforts and our development of responsible 
investment offers to customers. in 2020, we 
also set up a committee for responsible 
investment anchored in the bank’s senior 
management. the committee is charged 
with implementing our policy on respon-
sible investment and the un principles for 
responsible investment (un pri), including 
monitoring the normative screening of pro-
prietary and facilitated investments, moni-
toring the exercise of stewardship, defining 
targets and maintaining exclusion lists.
ongoing screening and stewardship
as a large proportion of the investment 
products spar nord offers its customers 
is developed and managed by suppliers 
and business partners, it is paramount for 
us that suppliers and partners meet the 
same standards for responsible investment 
as we do. consequently, we require that 
asset managers and unit trusts meet our 
own standards for responsible investment. 
in 2020, spar nord screened all portfo-
lios in which spar nord has a mandate 
to invest on behalf of its customers. we 
carried out a screening of esg issues and 
compliance with international standards 
and conventions, and the results showed 
that we generally succeeded in selecting 
investments that perform well in terms of 
esg and compliance with conventions. our 
screening procedures thus only resulted in 
a few divestments and exclusion of stocks 
in our portfolios. 
sustainable investment product
in 2020, spar nord started to offer its cus-
tomers the sustainable investment product 
bankinvest global equities sustainable 
development. the investment fund is an 
eco-labelled investment product with very 
ambitious targets for overall esg perfor-
mance, carbon emissions and compliance 
with the un sdgs. in 2020, spar nord’s cus-
tomers invested more than dkk 1.35 billion 
in bankinvest global equities sustainable 
development.
spar nord also collaborates with bank-
ernes edb central (bec) and other banks 
on developing and launching custom-
er-oriented digital tools which, in com-
pliance with upcoming eu legislation for 
sustainable investment, help customers 
define their own sustainability profile with a 
view to prioritising esg issues when making 
investment decisions. 
 
  risks 
spar nord manages its own and its customers’ investments in companies all over the 
world. this exposes spar nord and its customers to the risk of investing in companies that 
have an adverse environmental and climate impact or violate human rights. moreover, 
spar nord and its customers risk suffering financial losses on investments, which may result 
in impeded customer and business opportunities.  
spar nord corporate social responsibility 2020

the un principles for responsible investment (un pri)
we will incorporate esg issues (i.e. environmental/climate and social issues and 
responsible management) into investment analysis and decision-making 
processes. 
we will be active investors and incorporate esg issues into our 
investment policy.
we will seek appropriate disclosure on esg issues by the entities 
in which we invest.
we will promote acceptance and implementation of the principles 
in the financial sector. 
we will work together, where possible, to enhance our effectiveness 
in implementing the principles.
we will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing 
the principles.

any uncritical investment approach would entail a risk not only of contributing to breach-
ing international conventions, but also a risk of directly or indirectly promoting activities 
that could be harmful to human relations, the climate, the environment and anti-cor-
ruption initiatives. in addition, we risk jeopardising our reputation and thereby impair our 
market position.

cohesion
local commitment
spar nord builds on a locally-rooted 
business model, and we are committed 
to entering into healthy and sustaina-
ble relations with the local communities 
in which we operate. the locally-rooted 
model allows us to build better customer 
relations, and it facilitates the creation of 
local community cohesion through active 
participation in and support for local 
associations, initiatives and institutions. 
we want to continue and strengthen these 
initiatives as they contribute both finan-
cially and in terms of human value creation 
in society and in our bank. we believe that 
our role in society is to stimulate healthy 
and sustainable associations at all of our 
bank locations.
associations – be they local, regional or 
national – are the centre of attention for 
the spar nord foundation, which each 
year makes donations of dkk 40-50 million 
for small and large initiatives across den-
mark. the spar nord foundation owns 20% 
of spar nord bank, and the dividends from 
this ownership interest are channelled back 
into society.
the foundation and the bank remain 
focused on working with many local, small 
donations and sponsorships – partly to 
reach out to more individuals, and partly 
to make it easier for dedicated locals to 
reach their goals. in 2019, we studied the 
socio-economic impacts of the spar nord 
foundation’s donations and our sponsor-
ships, and we clearly saw that local dona-
tions and sponsorships are important and 
very valuable to local communities. in 2020, 
the spar nord foundation donated dkk 
40.7 million to support 681 different projects 
across denmark, while spar nord signed for 
a total amount of dkk 20.6 million. 
associations and the pandemic
danish associations were dealt a hard 
blow when the pandemic struck. many 
of them were just about to open for the 
summer season, and in many associations 
the membership income was threatened. 
many members were in doubt as whether 
to sign up because nobody knew how long 
the restrictions would last. as a result, the 
spar nord foundation decided to con-
tact to local associations and institutions 
encouraging them to seek donations, while 
the bank, using its network, marketing and 
advertisements in local media, encouraged 
everyone to protect and support their 
local associations. these initiatives led to 
donations and sponsorships despite the 
challenges of the pandemic. 
2019 donations from the spar nord foun-
dation: dkk 58,788,519 for 705 initiatives
2019 sponsorships from spar nord bank:  
dkk 23,367,000
2020 donations from the spar nord foun-
dation: dkk 40,692,552 for 681 initiatives 
2020 sponsorships from spar nord bank: 
dkk 20,573,000
  risks 
the digitalisation of business and social relations represents a risk to the local cohesion 
and the personal relations and commitments required to create positive change and pro-
gress in local communities. failure to stimulate meetings in person and practical collab-
oration in local communities entails a risk of reduced attractiveness of a local community 
and jeopardise the well-being of the citizens – to the detriment of citizens’ opportunities 
and spar nord’s business. however, the autonomous and decentralised commitment of 
each individual bank in local communities also involves a risk of favouritism and nepotism 
in relation to sponsorships and donations

climate and environment
a greener bank
carbon-neutral banking operations in 2021
climate and environmental impacts are a 
major challenge to our society, and spar 
nord takes an interest in and co-responsi-
bility for tackling this challenge. according-
ly, spar nord is a signatory to the un’s sus-
tainable development goals (sdgs) (un 
global compact), which forms the founda-
tion for our efforts to reduce our negative 
carbon footprint. as a part of spar nord’s 
strategy plan, operations should eventually 
be carbon neutral. our goal was originally 
to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, but 
in 2020 we came a major step closer to our 
goal by purchasing green power and opti-
mising energy consumption. consequently, 
we are now working to be carbon neutral 
by the end of 2021.
green culture
spar nord is continuously working to build 
climate awareness among its employees 
that goes beyond work-related efforts. this 
applies, for example, to transport, where 
we joined the “let’s bike to work” cam-
paign of the danish cyclists federation in 
2020, which prompted a large number of 
employees to leave their car and get on 
their bikes.
in 2020, spar nord contributed to the 
biodiversity of the local area around its 
headquarters by planting wild flowers to 
simulate biodiversity and the insect fauna.
covid-19 pandemic accelerated the 
transition.
the global pandemic in 2020 accelerated 
a number of changes that were already 
underway. this included the widespread 
use of internal online meetings, which not 
only reduced transport needs, but during 
the lockdown also showed the way forward 
to a different and less capacity-intensive 
organisation of our work. it also extended 
to customer meetings, most of which had 
to be held online, reducing our customers’ 
transport needs. the number of online 
meetings was thus 6-7 times higher than 
in 2019. the experience gained is now 
being reviewed with a view to reaping the 
benefits of online meetings and distance 
working more quickly than we originally 
planned.
transport and travel 
spar nord promotes sustainable transport 
solutions by buying environmentally friendly 
company vehicles (93% of the bank’s ve-
hicles in 2020 were energy-labelled a), by 
installing an initial two charging points for 
electric vehicles, by pursuing a climate-fo-
cused travel policy that encourages the 
use of public and/or environmentally 
friendly transport solutions, and by hold-
ing online meetings instead of travelling 
whenever possible. we also encourage 
our employees to carpool and to reduce 
work-related mileage in their own vehicles. 
reduced and greener energy consumption
starting in 2020, spar nord uses only certi-
fied green power from danish wind turbines, 
complemented by energy from our own 
solar cell panels. as part of our endeav-
ours to become carbon neutral in 2021, 
spar nord is making a dedicated effort to 
energy-optimise the interiors and exteriors 
of company-owned buildings and rented 
premises. these efforts include reducing en-
ergy-losses from new and existing buildings 
and implementing solar energy at suitable 
locations. the consumption of procured 
energy is reduced through improvements to 
buildings’ thermal envelopes and through 
the use of intelligent optimisation systems 
for managing heating, ventilation, cooling 
and lighting systems. at the same time, we 
are implementing sustainable technologies, 
such as the solar power-driven ice bank 
for cooling spar nord hadsund and the 
conversion to led light sources across the 
organisation. in addition, we are working 
to optimise our combined building stock by 
letting excess floorage, through the flexible 
use of office areas and via the relocation of 
activities to smaller and more energy-effi-
cient buildings.

reduced resource waste and 
environmental impact
spar nord works systematically to reduce 
resource consumption and to step up 
recycling efforts – through encouragement 
and campaigns, through waste sorting for 
recycling purposes and through initiatives 
such as giving away replaced furniture to 
various associations. for example, we now 
collect food waste that is processed into 
biofuel for use in local public transport.

the sustainable value chain
responsible business relations
spar nord buys goods and services from 
hundreds of danish and international sup-
pliers. consequently, spar nord takes joint 
responsibility for maintaining good and 
transparent supplier relationships, which 
underpin the bank’s good reputation, help 
attract good suppliers and retain and 
attract customers.
code of conduct for suppliers
spar nord requires that its suppliers main-
tain high environmental standards, respect 
human rights and pursue anti-corruption 
measures. we also require major suppliers 
to support the un sustainable develop-
ment goals and the ten principles of the 
un global compact. to ensure this, spar 
nord launched a code of conduct in 2019 
for major suppliers, which, with systematic 
follow-up from 2020, became a natural 
part of the bank’s central procurement 
processes and supply chain management.
complying with the code of conduct
in 2020, all major suppliers were asked to 
consider spar nord’s code of conduct for 
suppliers. the code defines requirements 
for suppliers in terms of adherence to laws, 
conventions and principles for the envi-
ronment and the climate, for human rights, 
for labour rights and for anti-corruption. 
furthermore, a number of major suppliers’ 
position on and compliance with a range 
of specific issues were uncovered through 
questionnaires. in 2020, 86% respond-
ed to the questionnaires, and the replies 
were generally satisfactory and did not 
give rise to criticism or termination of the 
collaboration. the remaining suppliers will 
participate in 2021, when the survey will be 
continued and extended.
  risks 
if spar nord engages with suppliers whose conduct is not sustainable, we risk promoting 
inexpedient conduct that could be harmful to the environment, the climate or human 
relations and rights. we would also risk irresponsible supplier conduct adverse affecting 
spar nord’s reputation and business.

responsible banking
countermeasures against money laundering and financial crime
countermeasures against money launder-
ing, terrorist financing and financial crime 
start with responsible banking. it is about 
putting the customers’ interests first with 
respect to advisory services and product 
innovation, about complying with appli-
cable laws and regulations and about 
ensuring that compliance and general 
conformity with the law form an integral 
part of the bank’s strategy and business. 
responsible banking is paramount given 
that the existence of cross-border finan-
cial crime and international terrorism is a 
basic condition for all banks. the risk of the 
bank being abused for purposes of money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism 
is present every day, and the threat level is 
rising. 
the role of the employees
consequently, it is the duty of spar nord 
to contribute actively to reducing the risk 
of money laundering and terrorist financ-
ing, and, to that end, we have defined a 
money laundering policy and a number of 
preventive measures which are regularly 
adapted to legislation and the current 
threat scenario. the policy, which, among 
other things, serves to ensure that finan-
cial transactions, customer relationships, 
employee matters and agreements are 
screened when entered into and are 
monitored on an ongoing basis, outlines a 
low risk exposure in the area. consequent-
ly, we regularly implement risk-mitigating 
measures and initiatives to strengthen the 
bank’s systems and employee capabilities 
in this area. a dedicated policy in this area 
sets out a number of measures. the policy 
encompasses six principal areas:
1.  know your customer procedures
2.  duty of investigation and recording 
3.  transaction monitoring 
4.  duty of notification 
5.  duty of record-keeping 
6.   screening against sanction lists and 
aml assessment of special risks
adhering to finance denmark’s principles 
of conduct
spar nord cooperates with the banking 
industry and the authorities to ensure 
responsible banking and conduct with 
respect to preventing money launder-
ing and financial crime. to that end, we 
adhere to finance denmark’s principles of 
•   we commit to combatting finan-
cial crime in a loyal and responsi-
ble manner. 
•   we recognise that the prevention 
and combatting of money laun-
dering and terrorist financing is not 
a competition parameter and that 
collaboration and joint solutions 
are desirable.. 
•   we will ensure that our manage-
ment and staff adhere to these 
six principles and relevant instruc-
tions:: 
 
1.  we always prioritise ethics over 
profit.
 
2.  we comply with the spirit and 
the letter of the law.
 
3. we welcome oversight.
 
4.  we have a targeted corporate 
culture commitment.
 
5.  we assume managerial respon-
sibility and ensure that all staff 
take responsibility for aml/ctf 
efforts
 
6.  we have constructive part-
nerships with all stakeholders, 
including the authorities.

  risks 
it is a basic condition for all banks that 
their services and products are at risk 
of being abused for money launder-

crime. this risk is considered high, and 
the threat is a global one. if the bank’s

incurring losses due to fines.

phd project financed by spar nord
spar nord supports research into methods 
to counter money laundering and financial 
crime, and in 2020 we sponsored the phd 
project machine learning for anti-money 
laundering, which examines and devel-
ops advanced machine learning models 
to combat money laundering. the project 
is a three-year collaboration between 
spar nord and the university of aarhus 
on machine learning and computational 
intelligence and is 100% financed by spar 
nord. the support will continue until 2023.

protection of customer data
data and cyber security
security in relation to data, it systems and 
their use is a prerequisite for spar nord’s 
credibility and competitiveness. our busi-
ness depends on our ability to keep our it 
systems operational and our lines of com-
munication open, while at the same time 
protecting our customers’ and the bank’s 
vital data from unauthorised parties. 
spar nord has implemented an extensive it 
security policy to prevent abuse, it-related 
crime, loss of data and operational failures. 
the policy covers spar nord, our subsidiary 
as well as all business partners, including 
sub-contractors and partners who have 
access to spar nord’s network and data 
internally and externally. 
given that the level of threat in respect of 
the bank’s data and it systems is con-
stantly changing, we regularly perform 
risk assessments and adjust our it security 
policy accordingly. any material change 
in spar nord’s it platform and it systems 
is always based on a risk assessment that 
includes an assessment of confidentiality, 
integrity and accessibility.
pandemic brings greater threat
during the pandemic in 2020, the threat 
against it security increased because the 
opportunities for conventional crime de-
crease when everyone stays at home and 
many businesses are closed. this causes 
criminals to increasingly turn to it crime, 
which is often performed by attacking 
customer data from the outside by way of 
fraud. consequently, spar nord has sought 
to draw attention to the problem through 
the media and by directly contacting older 
customers in particular via traditional mail, 
as isolated older people are more exposed 
to fraud and social engineering during the 
pandemic.
increase in it security investment
in 2020, the bank significantly increased 
its it security investments. the high level 
of investment was driven partly by the 
increased risk of cybercrime and the dy-
namic threat scenario, and partly by the 
fact that spar nord is now designated a 
systemically important bank in denmark. 
it is paramount for the public’s confidence 
in spar nord that we maintain a respon-
sible level of security relative to the threat 
scenario and that the level is at least equal 
to that of our peers. this work will continue 
in 2021, as we expect a further rise in threat 
level.
  risks 
while spar nord generally has secure and updated it systems, like all other banks we 
are under the constant threat of it crime. user behaviour with respect to our systems 
represents a risk. there is a risk of human error by ourselves or by our suppliers, and, in 
particular, there is a risk relative to our customers, where especially the skills of the older 
generation in it and it security represents a risk. furthermore, there is a general risk that 
process automation, the use of algorithms and the launch of artificial intelligence will 
increase the personal distance between advisers and customers, aggravate the negative 
consequences of system errors and make it difficult to allocate responsibility precisely.
we incorporate security in each and 
every component of our systems, our 
solutions and our conduct. 
that is a precondition for operating a 
reputable bank.

a healthy working environment
a decent workplace
spar nord’s most important resource is its 
employees. therefore, spar nord continues 
to take responsibility for creating a healthy 
and progressive working environment 
in which all employees can unfold their 
professional and personal potential in the 
best possible way. however, spar nord is 
responsible not only for regulating employ-
ee conditions in a proper manner, but also 
for promoting a culture in which employees 
consistently act responsibly towards cus-
tomers, colleagues, the bank and society 
in general. at the beginning of 2020, spar 
nord became a signatory to the un global 
compact, and over the course of the year, 
we implemented an updated responsible 
working environment policy in which we 
disclose that we respect the un’s universal 
declaration of human rights.
health and well-being during the 
pandemic
when the pandemic broke out in march 
2020, spar nord adhered to all recommen-
dations with a view to preventing covid-19 
from spreading. as a result, staffing at our 
headquarters and at individual branches 
was periodically limited to essential func-
tions, while the government’s recommen-
dations on gatherings, meetings, number 
of employees per area, ventilation, the use 
of sanitisers and canteen operations were 
implemented.
most employees worked from home during 
the lockdown, and meetings had to be held 
online, while our annual health week was 
cancelled. as this gave rise to concerns 
about our employees’ physical and psycho-
logical working environment, we launched 
a comprehensive information campaign 
about health in the home office. preliminary 
measurements of health and well-being 
show that changing working conditions 
have not had an adverse effect on the 
health of our employees and that they have 
in fact enhanced their well-being. con-
sequently, we will in 2021 seek to draw on 
these experiences by implementing the best 
new practice where relevant. we will also 
continue to monitor well-being and health 
closely, as the situation could change due 
to prolonged lockdowns or future reshuffles.
organisational diversity
we believe diversity is beneficial for devel-
oping both business relations and colle-
gial relations. spar nord therefore aims 
to strengthen its customer services and 
competitive strength by attracting as skilled 
employees as possible with respect to 
professional and human qualities. it follows 
from this that prejudice based on gender, 
age, skin colour, religion, sexual orientation, 
physical appearance or ethnic origin is a 
barrier not only to developing our business, 
but also to ensuring a healthy working envi-
ronment and a good reputation.
women in management and as board 
members
currently, the bank has defined a goal 
that women should represent at least 33% 
of board members by 2024. at the end of 
2020, this goal was not achieved with wom-
en representing 22% of board members. the 
reason was that a female board member 
resigned from the board in 2020.
  risks 
employee matters are affected by many factors which are outside spar nord’s 
control, including legislation and cultural trends. consequently, spar nord involves 
its employees in defining policies governing employee conditions. failure to do so 
would lead to a risk of the bank being out of step with cultural and social practice, 
which in turn could damage our reputation, the well-being of our employees, the 
ability to attract labour and our business in general. if we fail to comply with the 
policies for employee matters, we also risk discriminating or wearing down employ-
ees physically and mentally. the physical working conditions represent a risk in the 
form of accidents or attrition, and spar nord is therefore proactive in terms of pre-
venting accidents, illness and attrition. in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic represented 
a special risk in terms of employee health and public health in general. conse-
quently, spar nord complied with all government recommendations for containing 
the spread of covid-19 and will continue to do so in 2021.

of 33% women board members
• continue efforts to achieve a high 
level of well-being, satisfaction and

bank’s employees 
• continue to comply with govern-
ment recommendations on preven-
tion of spreading of covid-19
in terms of its general management, spar 
nord works systematically to identify and 
motivate employees with leadership po-
tential regardless of gender and to improve 
the retention of managers of both genders 
by offering opportunities and flexibility in 
relation to work-life balance. 
spar nord has defined a goal that there 
should be at least five qualified appli-
cants for managerial positions in the bank, 
and that at least two of these should be 
women. the long-term objective of the 
bank is to shift the gender breakdown at 
executive and executive mid-level towards 
a more equal distribution between men 
and women – from 21.8% women currently 
in the bank’s executive team to 25% women 
by 2024. as the above-mentioned goals 
were not fully achieved in 2020, the bank 
will focus on hr initiatives to support the 
intended developments in 2021.   
work-life balance
spar nord wants its employees to live a 
happy and balanced life, which in turn 
enables them to be a valuable resource at 
and to their workplace while also having 
time for family and friends. to achieve 
this, spar nord takes joint responsibility 
for ensuring a healthy work-life balance 
in all stages of life and career. in 2020, we 
adopted a senior policy, which lays down 
rules on considerations for the needs of 
older employees and their health at the 
workplace. spar nord also has a staff 
handbook, whose recommendations 
contribute to ensuring possibilities for 
employees of all ages and at all life stages 
to develop and thrive in their job at spar 
nord.
dialogue on special needs
spar nord aims to obtain close relations, 
confidence and a fruitful collaboration 
between managers and employees, so as 
to enable employees to express their wish-
es and seek help for special needs. this 
applies where there is a difficult situation 
in the employee’s personal life, which the 
bank may help to resolve, and also with 
respect to wishes for training and career 
development. to achieve this, the dialogue 
between employees and management has 
been formalised as ongoing status inter-
views and annual appraisal interviews.
training and education 
society, technology, behaviour and cus-
tomer requirements are changing con-
stantly, and spar nord, therefore, shares a 
responsibility for ensuring that employee 
skills are continuously being updated and 
developed, enhancing the bank’s com-
petitive strength and the employee’s value 
both to us and to others. this applies to 
professional and personal as well as social 
skills, which help ensure efficient collabora-
tion and well-being. 
however, spar nord’s training and edu-
cation initiatives are not only focused on 
skill-maintenance. we attach importance 
to accommodating requests for devel-
oping skills and talent, as this will give us 
flexibility, mobility and good management 
candidates within our organisation. in 2020, 
despite lockdowns and distance working 
because of the pandemic, at least 7,000 
hours of training were carried out, which 
we consider satisfactory under the given 
conditions.
recruitment and promotion 
being a large and important employer 
in the industry and the region, spar nord 
has a joint responsibility for ensuring that 
job candidates are treated equally and 
with an open mind. we aim to be fair and 
exemplary by ensuring equal opportunities 
for job applicants and access to the best 
possible candidates. we, therefore, look 
closely at the qualifications, experience, 
personal capabilities and social skills of 
candidates.
in 2020, we focused strongly on recruiting 
recent graduates within economics, and 
finance as well as academia. we consider 
reaching out to educational institutions 
and offering student jobs to young people 
to be a social obligation and a business 
advantage.
spar nord has a responsibility for and 
an interest in being a stimulating work-
place offering good career opportunities. 
consequently, we are making dedicated 
efforts to promote internal mobility among 
our employees, and we have defined 
fully transparent guidelines, which specify 
the efforts and results that may lead to 
upgrading to another pay bracket and 
one-off payments.

well-being and satisfaction
each year, spar nord measures employee well-being and satisfaction on a number of pa-
rameters. based on these measurements, new initiatives and efforts are planned together 
with the employees. for entities and departments whose measurements are significantly 
lower than the average, special initiatives and efforts are developed in order to improve 
well-being and satisfaction levels. the initiatives are monitored through interim measure-
ments. the results of our job satisfaction survey in 2020 showed an increase in well-being in 
all ten metrics and a total well-being score of 88%, which is the highest to date. 93% of our 
employees participated in the survey.
