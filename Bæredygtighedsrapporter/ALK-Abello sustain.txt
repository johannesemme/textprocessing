adding value to society
alk-abelló (alk) is a global 
allergy solutions company, 
with a wide range of allergy 
treatments, products and services 
that meet the unique needs of 
people with allergy, their families 
and healthcare professionals. 
alk offers products, services 
and resources covering a wide 
range of allergies. the company 
also has products in related 
areas, including diagnosis and 
emergency treatment. 
alk’s main product category, allergy 
immunotherapy (ait) comes in three 
different forms: injections, sublingual 
drops and sublingual tablets. in addition 
to ait, alk produces and distributes bulk 
allergen extracts primarily for the us market, 
adrenaline auto-injectors, and allergen 
extracts for skin-prick tests.
alk’s ait products are derived from 
allergenic source materials such as 
grass pollen, tree pollen and house dust 
mites. these are all by large grown at our 
production facilities in the usa, extracted 
locally and transported to denmark for 
final processing. once the allergens 
are processed, they are formulated into 
injections, drops, tablets and bulk extracts. 
alk produces the injections, drops and 
extracts in-house at our production facilities 
in denmark, the usa, france and spain, and 
collaborates with a supplier based in the uk 
for the manufacture of the tablets.
alk’s global headquarters are in hørsholm, 
denmark. our unique manufacturing 
processes ensure that our products 
meet required quality standards and 
represent a significant barrier to potential 
competitors, making them an important 
factor in maintaining our market position. 
globally, alk is present in 41 countries either 
directly, via our 23 subsidiaries, or through 
partnerships with distributors in additional 
markets. alk is predominantly present 
in europe, where more than 70% of alk’s 
revenue is generated.
alk is a publicly listed company and is 
owned by two majority shareholders: 
lundbeckfonden (the lundbeck foundation) 
has a 40.3% interest and atp has an 7.5% 
interest. 
alk’s products are distributed through 
healthcare professionals. alk also 
distributes home allergy tests directly to 
consumers through our sister brand klarify. 
klarify also provides services, such as the 
klarify app which helps users track and 
manage their pollen allergy. 
alk has approximately 2,500 employees 
across the globe, the majority of which are 
based in denmark and the rest of western 
europe (72%). 
alk has a two-tier management structure 
consisting of the board of directors and the 
board of management. the two boards are 
independent of each other.
the board of directors defines the strategic 
framework for alk’s action plans and 
activities on the basis of objectives, 
strategies and policies. the board of 
directors supervises the organisation, 
monitors procedures and responsibilities 
and sees that the company is managed 
appropriately and in accordance with 
legislation and alk’s articles of association.

adding value to society
alk’s business model
as a global allergy solutions company with almost a century of knowledge and expertise, 
alk helps people to take control of their allergy and their life.
key resources
people and culture: around 2,500 highly-skilled 
employees live our cultural beliefs every day in their 
work to help more people with allergy.
production/natural allergens:. alk’s biological 
medicines are derived from natural resources, such 
as pollen, which it harvests, standardises and quality 
controls at its own facilities.
scientific knowledge: alk continuously applies its 
scientific knowledge to help people take control of their 
allergy and their life.
sales and partnerships: in addition to its own sales 
organisation, alk partners for growth with leading 
specialty pharma companies worldwide. alk is present 
in 41 markets, either directly or via partnerships.
r&d: the completion of the tablet portfolio remains 
the primary focus of alk’s r&d efforts. in addition, 
the company is conducting research into innovative 
solutions for high-impact allergic conditions – such as 
food allergies.
value created
patients: alk’s tablet portfolio is helping to 
democratise ait by covering the most common 
respiratory allergies, and bringing new treatment 
options to people without easy access to allergy 
specialists. 
doctors: alk helps allergists to drive better access and 
outcomes for all ait-eligible patients, reaching out with 
support, disease information and treatment options.
people: alk is committed to a sustainable working life 
and keeps a constant focus on being a safe place to 
work for motivated and satisfied employees. 
society: alk addresses profound societal challenges 
by producing medicines for the leading cause of 
lost productivity and lost work days. the company 
partners with payers and health authorities to 
advance registered, documented ait products and is a 
signatory of the united nations global compact.
investors: alk works to create long-term value for its 
shareholders.
finished production
apis are purified, then formulated for 
subcutaneous injections, sublingual 
drops or sublingual tablets.
packaging and distribution
following careful quality control, 
the finished products are labelled, 
packaged and distributed.
through information resources, services 
and products, alk is working to support 
people with allergy early in their disease 
journey, smoothing the path to treatment.
people with allergies 
often endure a decade 
or more of symptoms 
before turning to ait.
allergy solutions for life
raw materials
allergenic source materials, such as grass 
pollen and house dust mites, are the main 
ingredients of our products. every year 
the company grows, collects or harvests 
several tonnes of allergens.
active pharmaceutical ingredient (api ) production
allergens undergo thorough analysis, standardisation 
and quality control, so that naturally occuring variations 
are minimised, ensuring quality and consistency in the 
finished products.

alks business model
2020 will go down in history as the year of great 
challenges, a year when many companies and 
people were put under pressure. as a company, 
fortunately, we have emerged from the covid 
crisis stronger. we have done this through the 
great support of our colleagues from around 
the globe. we demonstrated that despite 
difficulties, we stand united in the face of great 
challenges. in many ways, the global pandemic 
has shown us what is truly important; to create 
long-term value for people, the planet and the 
business.
access to allergy care for all
for the majority of 2020, we conducted a large-scale 
materiality assessment to ensure that our contribution to 
global sustainable development aligns with our ambitions 
and that of our stakeholders. the outcome is a new 
sustainability strategy focused on the areas where we can 
make the most impact to the world. our main focus continues 
to be on ensuring good health and well-being for all, which is 
now formalised in a new access to medicines strategy entitled 
‘access to allergy care for all’. access to allergy care for all, 
describes our ambition, purpose and long-term goals, with 
short-term milestones to measure progress. we want our 
products and solutions to be universally accessible, while 
ensuring that we continue to grow an ethical and profitable 
business. we believe that alk’s growth is closely linked to 
increased access to our treatment, and hence better patient 
outcomes.

in all our other areas of engagement, we have set short-term 
goals to ensure that we continue to contribute positively to 
global sustainable development.
sustainability is an integrated part of our overall business 
strategy, which we execute by following the principles 
outlined in the ten principles of the un global compact. 
we are proud to confirm our commitment to working 
within the areas of human rights, labour, environment and 
anti-corruption. we will continue to promote sustainable 
development, by contributing to the realisation of the 
un sustainable development goals, and to integrate 
the principles into the way we conduct business, while 
maintaining a close and transparent collaboration with our 
stakeholders. 
11 out of 14 goals achieved
2020 also marked the conclusion of almost all of our 
previously set sustainability goals. i am very proud of the way 
the entire alk organisation has pulled together to deliver 
these great results for the benefit of people and the planet. 
we reduced our co2 emissions and will continue to look for 
opportunities to invest in renewable energy to reduce our 
impact. overall, we achieved 11 out of 14 of the sustainability 
goals we set in 2018. i am especially proud of the fact that 
more and more people are treated with our documented and 
registered products. i can also look back at a year, where 
we put the health and safety of our people front and centre. 
we set up a global corona task force, ensured that our 
workplace is safe for all who were required at the sites and 
outlined a very conservative approach to battling the covid 
pandemic. how our people reacted to all these changes, still 
leaves me in awe. the amount of flexibility and tenacity in the 
face of challenges that our people demonstrated has been 
inspiring. all this to ensure that people with allergy could 
continue their treatments.

turning stakeholder 
input into an updated 
sustainability strategy
throughout 2020, we conducted an in-depth 
materiality assessment to assess whether 
our actions and initiatives are in line with the 
expectations of our stakeholders.
how we conducted the analysis
the materiality assessment was conducted 
in accordance with principles outlined in 
the gri standards (gri 101) and posed an 
opportunity for alk to explore and leverage 
the positive impact on societal challenges, 
while building a sound and profitable 
business. issues deemed the most relevant 
for alk were compared against the backdrop 
of the un sustainable development goals 
to determine our positive and negative 
impacts. the output is a materiality matrix 
that represents our most material topics.
stakeholder inclusiveness
external input was collected from relevant 
suppliers, ngos, investors and institutions 
through interviews and surveys. external 
sources such as sustainability ratings and 
assessments, and indices such as the access 
to medicine index were also used in the 
assessment. the internal input was collected 
from more than 15 key business units such 
as commercial operations, product supply, 
procurement, human resources (hr), 
environment, health and safety (ehs) etc. 
as well as from employees more generally, 
through interviews and surveys of employees 
in 18 different countries. several internal 
documents, such as policies, annual reports, 
risk assessments, strategy documents, 
financial targets and employee engagement 
results, were also used.
key findings
the assessment reconfirmed that alk’s 
biggest contribution to society stems from 
our products’ and services’ inherent benefits: 
making life with allergy simpler and healthier, 
but also substantially reducing the impact on 
global healthcare systems, through research 
and exploration of technologies.
the key issue identified that best benefits 
both society and alk, and warrants increased 
strategic effort to optimise positive impact:
• healthcare coverage and access to 
medicine for all
furthermore, four issues were identified 
that best benefit both society and alk, 
that warrant a continuous and systematic 
approach at operational level to ensure 
positive impacts:
• structural changes in relation to gender 
equality and empowerment
• green transition
• just and strong institutions 
• partnerships

sustainability report 2020 • alk
turning stakeholder input
materiality matrix
the assessment of the potential business 
impact from alk’s active commitment to the 
sdgs is based on our interest in exploring 
new business opportunities, enhancing 
customer satisfaction and reputation, 
savings, attracting and retaining talents 
and responsible employees, and meeting 
investor and stakeholder expectations.
the interlinkage of societal and business 
interest is visualised in a materiality matrix 
with societal impact on the y-axis and 
the potential alk business impact on the 
x-axis. the sdgs were placed based on 
two dimensions; their significance to our 
economic, social and environmental impacts 
combined with the importance assigned to 
the issues in stakeholder input.
the materiality matrix shows three tiers: 
sdgs that best accommodate the purpose 
of ensuring a sound and profitable business, 
as well as contributing to the global effort to 
achieve the sdgs in 2030; sdgs that require a 
continuous and systematic approach by alk; 
and sdgs that should be monitored by alk to 
handle any unexpected impact.

updated sustainability strategy
the matrix is the building block of a further-
strengthened sustainability framework and 
strategy, which allows us to concentrate 
our efforts on contributing to two sdgs, 
while integrating the other sdgs into 
operational activities. our core strategy 
contributes to sdg 3 (good health and 
well-being) supported by sdg 9 (build 
resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive 
and sustainable industrialisation, and foster 
innovation). 
by linking the access to medicines under 
sdg 3 with strengthened efforts to integrate 
research and technological development 
under sdg 9, alk may spark business 
opportunities through evidence-based 
treatment, partnerships to build local 
healthcare capacity and the outreach 
to more patients through new forms of 
communication.
the new structure of the report reflects 
the updated sustainability strategy. we 
periodically review the matrix based on 
trends and stakeholder input to ensure that 
our prioritisation remains relevant.

access to allergy care for all
allergy is the most common 
chronic disease in the world. 
allergic reactions to pollen, food 
and animals impact millions of 
peoples’ work and everyday life 
and well-being. allergic rhinitis 
affects 10-30% of the population. it 
is seen as the strongest risk factor 
for developing asthma and is 
described as a major global public 
health issue1.
the purpose of the alk access to medicines 
strategy is to enable access to allergy 
care for all. our products and services are 
relevant to populations across the entire 
globe, and our goal is to democratise and 
disseminate these to many more, earlier in 
their disease. 
we apply two principles to enable access to 
allergy care for all:
• our primary focus is people with allergy 
and their need for a correct diagnosis and 
treatment
• assisting healthcare systems and 
healthcare professionals is a precondition 
for providing efficient allergy care. without 
a healthcare infrastructure, people with 
allergy cannot benefit from our allergy 
solutions
in order to fulfil this purpose, we build on 
decades of research and development, 
and apply state-of-the-art pharmaceutical 
standards to deliver products and services to 
millions in need of effective allergy treatment.
realisation of our strategy
allergy care is especially important when it 
comes to children. worldwide, 40-50% of 
children are affected by one or more common 
allergens2, which has a significant impact on 
their schoolwork and social life3. 
we are conducting several studies to 
investigate the efficacy of our medicines 
in younger populations, with the intention 
of securing children’s indications for our 
tablets in several new markets, including 
emerging markets – although some clinical 
development activities were impacted 
by the covid pandemic and associated 
containment measures. subject to approval, 
these products could allow children to 
minimise their reliance on symptomatic 
treatments and, in some cases, could prevent 
the development of allergy-induced asthma 
exacerbations. with our solutions, we aim to 
help diagnose and treat allergy much earlier, 
and thus contribute to a better quality of life 
for children. 
partnerships with the public and private 
healthcare sector are an important vehicle 
for ensuring access to allergy care. in 
countries with no access to allergy medicine, 
partnerships often form the first step to 
making alk solutions accessible. in 2020, we 
explored several possibilities of expanding 
our treatments to new markets, both 
developed and emerging. 
allergy knowledge and competences among 
healthcare professionals are instrumental 
to ensuring better patient care. we engage 
systematically in educational activities, 
training, and dialogue to enhance insights 
into the diagnosis and treatment of allergic 
disease. in 2020, alk reached more than 
10,000 healthcare professionals through 
scientific publication views and downloads, 
attendance of alk company-sponsored 
scientific symposia and webinars, and alk 
coordinated medical expert meetings and 
scientific advisory boards. several projects 
have been initiated as a collaborative effort 
with alk strategic commercial partners and 
independent healthcare organisations to 
support training in allergy diagnosis and

access to allergy care for all
treatment in both developed and emerging 
markets.
with nearly 100 years of experience in 
allergy, we believe it is our responsibility to 
share our knowledge particularly in markets 
that have little or no tradition of allergy 
immunotherapy. through the world allergy 
organization (wao), alk regularly makes 
product donations for the benefit of wao’s 
world training schools (wats), which use 
our products to train physicians in emerging 
markets. 
we engage with the public and support 
patients’ organisations all over the world 
in their work to ensure public health via 
awareness raising, patient care and 
promotion of the safe use of our products. 
in addition, we continue our efforts to raise 
awareness about allergy in the general 
population through our sister brand’s klarify 
digital platform. these tools help people with 
allergy to achieve a better standard of living, 
by offering tips and guidance for alleviating 
and avoiding the symptoms of allergy. klarify 
is now available in six countries: the usa, 
germany, the uk, slovakia, ireland and 
denmark. 
target: we help create access to safe, 
effective, quality and affordable medicines 
and vaccines for people with severe allergy. 
goal: by 2020, we want to treat 2 million 
people with allergy with our allergy 
immunotherapy products, diagnostics and 
adrenaline auto-injectors. 
result: approximately 2 million people have 
been treated with alk products by the end of 
2020. 
goal: by 2020, we want to engage with 
20 million people through our consumer 
initiatives.
result: the goal was reached in 2019.

diversity and inclusion
throughout 2020, an international group of employees from human resources have been working 
on a project to establish a firm data foundation for our work with diversity and inclusion across the 
organisation. lisbeth kirk, svp hr & internal communications says: “we made significant progress 
and learned a lot about our organisation along the way. although we have made progress 
regarding the number of women in management over the years, our initiatives and activities 
seemed to fall short of making an impact on senior management positions. with the support from 
the board of management, we decided to pursue the matter further, and carried out a ‘deep dive’ 
into the data to understand the actual causes behind the low representation of women in senior 
positions. we have spent the better part of 2020 researching, benchmarking with peers, as well as 
gathering insights to ensure that any initiative that we will introduce over the coming years yields a 
measurable impact.”
the key findings of the investigation showed that if alk is to achieve diversity and inclusion in all 
aspects and within all business areas, as is the intention, the diversity levers that need to be pulled 
will be to raise awareness about diversity and inclusion in the organisation, unconscious bias 
training and integration of specific diversity and inclusion considerations into key hr processes, 
and in our upcoming engagement survey. the latter will provide valuable data and insights across 
the global organisation.
“
we believe that diversity only brings value if it is present in combination 
with an inclusive culture. through our leadership development activities, 
we are strengthening an inclusive culture at all levels of the organisation – from top 
management to employees. we are looking forward to kicking these initiatives off, and 
we are hopeful that they will be effective in ensuring a more diverse workforce across 
several different diversity characteristics, as well as reaching our target of having 
women make up 35% of vps and senior directors in 2025.

policy
alk is committed to respecting human 
rights in our business operations. alk 
follows the principles outlined in the 
universal declaration of human rights, 
the international labour organization’s 
declaration on fundamental principles and 
rights at work and the un guiding principles 
on business and human rights. we aim to 
protect human rights and to ensure that 
alk avoids being complicit in human rights 
abuses, as described in the un global 
compact principles 1 and 2.  
as part of several of our policies we: 
• take great care to protect human rights 
and to avoid being complicit in any human 
rights violations 
• prohibit all types of discrimination, 
offensive behaviour, harassment and 
retaliation, along with forced and child 
labour 
• educate our employees and implement 
preventative actions to ensure that health 
and safety risks are constantly reduced 
• ensure that occupational health and 
safety are proactively integrated into the 
planning and design of all projects 
• ensure a high standard of data protection 
and that the rights of data subjects are 
duly preserved and enforced in all areas of 
our business 
 
action
covid
the major focus of 2020 has been to ensure 
both the physical and the mental well-being 
of employees during the global lockdowns in 
response to covid. a conservative ‘people 
before profit’ approach was applied to 
ensure that no employee felt unsafe in 
coming to work. 
the board of management, as well as other 
senior managers, communicated weekly 
via video updates to energise, reassure and 
share knowledge with employees globally 
and locally. regular updates were shared 
via internal communication channels, and 
information and instructions were made 
available for all employees to ensure their 
protection. cleanliness protocols were 
updated to ensure that the risk of infection at 
work was minimised. 
for managers, tutorial videos and training 
material on how to lead remotely were 
made available. flexibility was shown for 
employees in special situations, such as 
those with small children, or who were 
otherwise living in circumstances that made 
working from home difficult. 
several initiatives were launched, such as 
the global move for allergy event, where all 
employees were encouraged to walk, run 
or cycle five kilometres to raise awareness 
about allergy. we also launched a global 
competition, stay connected. the primary 
goal of both initiatives was to reconnect 
employees across borders and departments.
employee health and well-being 
all employees are covered by a health 
programme, either made available through, 
or paid for, by alk.
together with human resources, the ehs 
organisation works to ensure that a healthy 
working culture exists at alk, both in terms of 
the psychological environment and a healthy 
work-life balance. ehs representatives are 
located at all production sites to ensure that 
the ehs policy and relevant procedures are 
followed. 
in denmark, a workplace assessment by the 
danish working environment authority was 
conducted towards the end of 2020. results 
of the assessment are pending. 
harassment, including sexual harassment 
is prohibited. alk does not tolerate written 
or verbal harassment, bullying, unwanted 
sexual advances, physical or graphic 
harassment that shows hostility or aversion 
toward an individual because of any 
characteristic protected by applicable law, 
including sex, race, religion or faith, political 
view, sexual orientation or other. 
safety 
the safety of our employees is a 
responsibility we take very seriously, and we 
work to ensure that systems and processes 
are implemented globally to support a safe 
work environment. 
we continued to monitor safety at all alk 
locations, and workplace assessments 
are conducted regularly to ensure that we 
mitigate any health and safety risks. safety 
training is adapted to local needs and 
allows flexibility in line with local laws and 
customs, if relevant. additionally, health 
and safety considerations are built into 
facilities upgrade plans, with a special focus 
on heavy lifting, ergonomics and chemicals 
management. 
in 2020, all relevant employees were trained 
in the chemical management system, which 
contains all alk’s safety data sheets and 
describes any hazards and precautions to be 
taken when using the chemicals. 
together with an external company, our 
procurement department has made risk 
evaluation engineering reports. these also 
include general risks for people, such as the 
risk of fire, work-related accidents etc.

human rights
many employees were advised to work from 
home to the extent possible. the task force 
will continue to meet in 2021 until the threat 
of covid subsides. 
our supply chain and operations are located 
in areas where the overall risk of human 
rights violations is considered low, as 99% 
of our main gxp suppliers are located in 
low-risk countries. however, as part of our 
commitment, in 2020, we continued to focus 
on mitigating human rights risks in high-risk 
countries. alk’s operations have a relatively 
small impact on human rights issues in 
the supply chain, however these risks are 
mitigated by the inclusion of human rights 
clauses, such as explicitly concerning child 
and forced labour in all new, large supplier 
contracts. internally, human rights risks, 
in particular risks of discrimination and 
harassment are prevented and mitigated 
through various mechanisms. each case is 
investigated fully, and appropriate action 
taken based on findings. 
although alk is a relatively low-risk company 
when it comes to safety, we do not accept 
accidents as part of our operations and 
seek to prevent them from happening. 
workplace risks at alk include the potential 
risk of exposure to allergens, which are 
our main raw material. for employees who 
handle allergens as part of their daily work 
processes, we conduct periodic screenings, 
and provide allergy testing. through our 
network of ehs employees, locally adapted 
information campaigns and training 
programmes on risks to safety are made 
privacy and data protection 
the alk data protection committee assists 
the board of management in fulfilling 
oversight responsibilities with regards to 
personal data protection and personal 
data use. the committee meets quarterly to 
oversee the coordination, communication, 
training and risk management of personal 
data protection governance activities across 
the entire organisation. 
in 2020, we continued work on ensuring the 
safety, and responsible use, of data in line 
with the general data protection regulation 
and other relevant data protection 
regulations. targeted training of groups of 
employees took place with a view to ’train the 
trainers’ on the handling of personal data, 
as well as conducting awareness-raising 
activities in individual business units, where 
relevant. 
 
risks
a major unforeseen risk in 2020, and one 
that will remain in place during 2021, was 
the covid pandemic. alk set up a corona 
task force to anticipate and mitigate the 
potential consequences of the virus. the task 
force’s approach was both proactive, in that 
it developed a wide-ranging contingency 
plan to safeguard both employees and 
the ongoing supply of medicines, and 
conservative, in that it applied a ‘safety first’ 
principle to all the scenarios it considered.

policy
our global hr policy seeks to create an 
appealing working environment to attract, 
develop and retain well-qualified and 
engaged employees. 
we foster an open and honest relationship 
with employees. we respect their right to be 
informed, heard and to voice their concerns 
in an open and transparent manner. all 
employees have access to internal and 
external training opportunities to ensure that 
they can continue to develop their skills. 
we continue to: 
• provide equal opportunities for all, 
regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, 
sexual orientation, religion or ability 
• provide fair wages by aligning our 
compensation with that of other 
companies in the geographical areas 
where we operate 
• provide re-employment opportunities 
in the event redundancies cannot be 
avoided. if there is no chance of re-
employment, social plans are developed 
in line with local laws and customs
• promote fair working conditions, equal 
pay for equal work, and freedom of 
association and collective bargaining
• ensure the well-being of employees and 
their families by being involved in local 
initiatives, practices and procedures with 
respect for local customs, conditions and 
needs 
• develop the competencies of employees 
at all levels 
we act in compliance with national legislation 
in the countries in which we operate, and 
we follow the un global compact principles 
3-6, as well as the eight fundamental rights 
described in the ilo core conventions.
 
action
all employees have freedom of association, 
and can exercise this right either formally 
in unions or internally in workers’ councils. 
employees in seven european countries have 
workers’ council representation.
employee engagement 
in 2020, a new employee engagement survey 
provider was identified, and a survey will 
be conducted in 2021. in 2020, a survey 
regarding alk’s work with sustainability, 
including work with sdg 8 covering 
decent work and economic growth was 
conducted as part of the updated materiality 
assessment. a total of 631 (26%) employees 
responded to the survey, most of them in 
europe. 75% of the respondents perceived 
alk as actively engaged in sdg 8. 
employee development
all employees’ performance is reviewed once 
annually, and performance objectives are 
set for the coming year. all employees have 
access to annual development agreement 
talks with their direct managers. in 2020, 
90% of employees completed an annual 
year-end review and 71% completed a 
development agreement. 
diversity and inclusion
at alk, we promote equal opportunities and 
believe that an organisation representing 
diversity in all its aspects, at all organisational 
levels, and within all competency areas, 
creates higher engagement and innovation, 
and provides the basis for better business 
decisions and results. we aim to create a 
diverse and inclusive work environment where 
different perspectives, abilities, capabilities, 
talents and experiences meet. to support our 
ambition, we have a global diversity policy 
and internal guidelines to ensure:
• respect for the fundamental rights of 
people
• that alk fosters an inclusive environment 
for everyone, regardless of age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, personality, 
tenure, education, economic background, 
organisational function etc. 
• that relevant and objective criteria 
are applied when making decisions 
about hiring or dismissals, promotions 
or changes in responsibility, and 
compensation
the diversity and inclusion project continued 
to gather insights and data during 2020 in 
order to set realistic and achievable goals 
for women in management. succession 
plans have been developed for all key 
positions at alk, including for diversity 
characteristics. as part of our work to 
continuously improve our gender balance 
and ensure talent development, a new 
programme was launched in 2020: aspire. 
aspire is specifically developed to nurture 
and grow talent in the organisation, that 
has the potential and aspiration to rise to 
more senior roles, either as a specialist or 
as manager. the programme encompasses 
several focus areas including age, gender, 
and geographic location. 
the board of directors 
at the end of 2020, the board of directors 
consisted of five shareholder- and three 
employee-elected members. of the 
labour rights
20
sustainability report 2020 • alk
labour rights
shareholder-elected members, one was a 
woman and two of the employee-elected 
members were women (see page 23). two 
of the members were independent. the 
average age of the shareholder-elected 
members was 58 years. 60% of the board of 
directors was of danish nationality. 
in november, alk announced that two new, 
independent members of alk’s board 
of directors would be nominated at the 
company’s next annual general meeting. 
if approved, the majority of shareholder-
elected members would be independent.
the board of directors wishes to ensure 
diversity at all management levels and 
alk is consequently building up an 
internal recruitment pool that will ensure 
a high degree of diversity. the nomination 
committee constituted by the chairmanship 
is responsible for selection and nomination 
of candidates for the board of directors. the 
selection is based on a process that defines 
the need for new talent, diversity, age and 
gender. the process is open and transparent, 
and the candidates are approved by the 
board of directors. more details about 
the board of directors’ competences are 
available on our website https://ir.alk.net/
corporate-governance/board-of-directors.
cf. section 107d of the danish financial 
statements act 
 
risks
the general nature of our production process 
and administrative activities require that 
we rely mainly on skilled labour. combined 
with the fact that our production facilities 
are located at sites in the highly developed 
countries of denmark, france, spain and 
the usa, the risk of labour rights violations 
is generally low. this extends to our 
supply chain as well, as the majority of our 
suppliers, and 99% of our biggest suppliers, 
are located in areas with no significant risk of 
labour rights violations.
our main risks in relation to labour rights 
violations stem from second and third tier 
suppliers. nevertheless, we take mitigating 
actions when needed, for example by 
using a standardised questionnaire that 
is mandatory for all alk sites as part our 
supplier management system, and by 
adding clauses to supplier contracts.
alk’s risks with regards to diversity are not 
fully explored on all diversity characteristics. 
for some characteristics, such as age 
and gender, the risks are deemed to be 
insubstantial. the overall gender and age 
distribution of employees at alk is healthy, 
however, this picture is not replicated at all 
management levels. as a result, although not 
substantial, alk nevertheless has a potentially 
elevated risk of missing opportunities for 
labour rights
21
sustainability report 2020 • alk
growth. this risk is mitigated through several 
internal programmes, approved in november 
2020, to ensure a healthy talent pipeline 
and, initially, to improve the balance of one 
diversity characteristic, gender.
 
 
targets and results
employee engagement
goal: by 2020, the individual development 
score is greater than 78. 
result: the 2019 development score was 
78. no employee engagement survey was 
conducted in 2020. 
goal: by 2020, the engagement score is 
equal to or greater than 80. 
result: the 2019 engagement score was 
82. no employee engagement survey was 
conducted in 2020.
diversity and inclusion
target: we promote equal opportunity for all. 
goal: by 2022, we want women to make up 
30% of the shareholder-elected members of 
the board of directors. 
result: the number of shareholder-elected 
women is 1 (20%). however, action has been 
taken, and two new members have been 
nominated, one of whom is a woman. should 
their nominations be approved, the number 
of shareholder-elected members on alk’s 
board would increase from five to seven, 
which would mean that 29% of the board are 
female (see page 23).
goal: by 2020, we want women to make up 
30% of functional managers and 40% of mid-
level managers.
result: the number of women on functional-
manager level remained stable at 21% 
versus 22% in 2019. the goal was not met.

may give slightly varying results year by year. 
actions, such as unconscious bias training, 
re-evaluation of internal processes etc. will 
be taken in 2021 to potentially improve the 
gender balance at this level in the future.
the number of women in mid-level 
management roles increased by three 
percentage points to 41%, and the goal was 
achieved. we expect that this development 
will have a positive influence on the number 
of women in senior management over the 
coming years (see page 23). 
kpi: local residents are employed, including 
in management positions. 
result: 93% of our employees are on 
permanent contracts, and locals are 
recruited at all levels at our headquarters 
and our 23 global subsidiaries. 
kpi: total number and rates of new employee 
hires and employee turnover by age group, 
gender, and region. 
result: alk continued to show a healthy 
trend in the gender and age distribution 
of new hires. a higher number of women 
versus men were hired on temporary 
contracts, which mirrored the fact that a 
higher number of women were hired in 
general. although more women were hired 
on part-time contracts, this imbalance is not 
unique to alk. 64% of new hires are aged 
39 or younger. a notable statistic was also 
the percentage of new, female hires, with 
women making up 66% of all new hires, and 
over 70% in the 30-39 and 60+ age groups 
(see appendix page 41). the vast majority of 
new hires were based in denmark (39%) and 
western europe (36%), which was consistent 
with the overall number of employees in 
these regions (72% of the total workforce).
employee turnover rate 
overall, the employee turnover rate figures 
(10%) were within normal limits and were 
in line with previous years, which means 
that the covid crisis had a minimal impact 
on alk’s workforce from a retention point of 
view. meanwhile, involuntary turnover was

maintain gender balance of approximately
50% 
at manager and director level
maintained at 3%, which was the same as in 
2019. the turnover by gender also remained 
stable. looking at turnover by age group, 
the highest turnover percentages were in the 
age group 29 and younger, and 60+ (14% 
for both). this was mostly attributable to 
voluntary turnover for the 29 and younger 
group, and retirement for the 60+ group. 
geographically, the turnover rates have 
remained stable and mirror the results from 
2019 (see appendix on page 40). 
kpi: ratio of basic salary of women to men by 
employee category, by significant locations 
of operation.
result: the ratio has been calculated by 
taking the average base pay of women and 
men at three professional levels, and at the 
same job grade. the pay ratio remained 
stable with minor fluctuations, which was 
not deemed a cause for concern. the only 
exception was france. alk france conducts 
an annual assessment of gender equality to 
comply with local law. equality is assessed 
on a number of metrics, including pay gap, 
individual salary, promotion and gender pay 
ratio among the 10 highest-paid employees. 
alk france gained 94 out of 100 in the 
assessment conducted for 2019. part of the 
explanation could be the difference in pay 
between large cities and urban areas, types 
of positions occupied by women versus men 
and seniority. it is also worth noting that 
due to alk’s size the number of employees 
compared on each level is relatively small 
and may also affect the score. alk will 
conduct a new assessment in march 2021 
that will explore the pay gap results in depth 
(see page 41).
 
planned activities for 2021  
and expected results
although the number of women in senior 
management is showing an upward trend, to 
reach our new goals, we will initiate several 
programmes, measure progress regularly 
and continuously evaluate their impact 
towards achieving a more equal gender 
balance. furthermore, we will expand 
our diversity data foundation to look into 
additional diversity characteristics.
going forward, a new categorisation method 
for management levels will be applied, 
reflecting actual roles and responsibilities, 
on the basis of the job the grading levels 
defined in our hr-system workday. as the 
goals set in 2018 have expired, two new 
goals have been set. applying the new 
categorisation, alk has achieved gender 
balance at manager and director level 
and will seek to maintain this positive 
development. the 2019-baseline figures 
show that women make up 45% and 52% 
at director and manager-level respectively. 
for alk to successfully increase the number 
of women at vp and senior director-level, 
several activities will be initiated in the 
following years. a combined target for 2025 
was set to advance the percentage of women 
at this level to 35% (baseline 25%).

turning waste 
into a resource
one of alk’s most successful products 
to date treats house dust mite allergy, 
which affects millions of people 
worldwide. the starting material 
for the majority of these allergy 
immunotherapy products comes from 
the usa, where house dust mites are 
grown with a precisely formulated food 
source, in specially designed chambers, 
that are custom built and maintained 
at the exact temperature and moisture 
levels needed for the mites to thrive. 
this is important because it takes 
600,000,000 mites to produce each 
kilogram of house dust mite source 
material. 
waste as soil supplement
cultivating mites and purifying them into an extractable form for 
use as an active ingredient, yields tonnes of waste in terms of 
excess mite food and proprietary purifying compounds. glycerine 
is one of the organic compounds used as a cleaning agent to purify 
the mites. these are all necessary steps to ensure a high-quality 
pharmaceutical product. for much of 2020, we have looked for 
ways in which we could put some of that waste to good use. 
the mite by-product is very high in organic matter and has 
many nutrients that can be beneficial to plants, insects, and soil 
microbes. this product could potentially reduce the amount of 
fertiliser needed on our rotational fields, increase soil biodiversity 
and is a great way to reuse our waste.
“
we have found two very useful ways to repurpose our waste,” says tim 
davis, vice president, product supply north america: “we learned that 
the nutritional content of the house dust mites’ waste could be used as soil 
supplement on our farm fields, where we grow grasses and trees. it is a win-win 
situation for us, as this means that we will use a clean, natural soil supplement in 
our fields and stop 20-30 metric tonnes of waste from ending up in a landfill.”

feeding microbes
until recently, our glycerine waste has either been sent to 
a landfill or other means of waste disposal. this year, we 
established a partnership with a local municipality that 
uses the glycerine to feed the beneficial microbes in their 
sewage treatment facility. 
“
we are happy that we found a way to 
work with the local community and their 
scientists to find a new use for the glycerine that 
we use in our production process. this is a great 
example of how circular thinking helps both us 
and the municipality to reduce both costs and 
environmental impact, as resources are reused. 
this partnership has helped us reduce waste by 
30-40 metric tonnes, and we will continue to look 
for new ways to reduce, reuse or recycle waste 
generated in our processes.”

policy
climate change is one of the biggest problems 
facing the world today, and an issue that 
concerns many of our stakeholders. some 
studies suggest that climate change might 
affect plant and pollen cycles, making allergy 
seasons longer1 and air pollution worse. 
rising temperatures could also cause more 
allergies in the future and make asthma 
attacks more severe2. we acknowledge that 
we, as a manufacturing company, are both 
part of the problem and contributors to the 
solution, which is why we strive for sustainable 
resource consumption and take measures to 
reduce the climate impact of our production 
processes. we consistently look for ways 
we can reduce our resource consumption in 
cultivating and harvesting raw materials, as 
well as the manufacturing, packaging and 
transportation of our medicines. 
alk’s global environment, health and 
safety (ehs) policy sets the standards for 
environmental protection in our daily work 
and strives to: 
• involve our employees in environmental 
work 
• educate our employees and implement 
preventative actions to ensure that 
factors, which represent environmental 
risks are monitored and constantly 
reduced 
• ensure that environmental issues are 
proactively integrated into planning and 
design work 
• measure the results of our efforts and set 
new goals for continuous improvements, 
particularly within the areas of energy 
consumption, co2 emissions and water 
usage 
all production sites3 adhere to the global ehs 
policy and are covered by the global ehs 
management system. guided by principles 
7, 8 and 9 of the un global compact, we take 
a precautionary approach to environmental 
and climate challenges. 
 
action
since the launch of our new code of conduct, 
all sites have been encouraged to take a 
precautionary approach to environmental 
and climate challenges. these include:
• being conscious of how impact can be 
reduced in our daily work 
• taking an active role in reducing risks
• reporting any situation that may pose 
both immediate and long-term risk to the 
environment 
these expectations extend beyond our 
environmental reporting scope (production 
sites only) and include all sites around the 
globe. all employees are required to follow 
the guidelines listed above to ensure that 
positive changes, however small, can be 
made, where applicable.
a large-scale internal review was initiated 
in 2020 to explore in-depth the possibilities 
of further reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions, water consumption and waste, as 
preparation for potentially setting science-
based environmental targets, as described 
in the science based targets initiative (sbti). 
due to travel restrictions imposed by various 
governments to combat the global pandemic, 
it has not been possible to fully explore and 
commit to initiating the sbti process in 2020, 
as originally planned. assuming the situation 
eases during 2021, the full results of this 
global review will be shared in our next report.
at our site in oklahoma, we upgraded 
two pieces of machinery that repurpose 
wastewater instead of sending it to a 
treatment plant. the upgrades reduced water 
consumption for 2020 by 30-40% at the site.
as part of our commitment to ensure that 
we contribute to the european union’s and 
danish government’s ambition to reduce

co2 emissions, in 2020, we began gathering 
and assessing our emissions, guided by the 
ghg protocol corporate value chain (scope 
3) standard. initially, we are looking into 
emissions in relation to employee travel, 
company cars and transportation of our 
goods.
in 2020, no incidents of non-compliance with 
environmental laws and regulations were 
recorded through our internal systems.
good farming practices
the source materials used in our products 
are largely cultivated in the usa. a 
working group, alk’s crop production 
team, is responsible for ensuring that 
our farming practices follow ecosystem-
based approaches designed to improve 
sustainability and preserve biodiversity. 
alk has been farming the same soil in 
plummer, idaho since 1996. based on annual 
samples taken every autumn, we have 
dramatically increased the level of nutrient 
exchange (cation exchange coefficient 
value), increased the level of organic matter 
(which decreases erosion and increases 
soil biodiversity), increased the ph by 
adding lime to bring the soil to more of a 
neutral (natural) ph value, and decreased 
the amount of non-native, invasive, and 
noxious weeds on the property through 
proper management. we have also planted 
more than five hundred trees on the property 
that bring numerous benefits to the soil, the 
ground water, and the atmosphere.

risks
although our key in-house production 
facilities are located in areas that have 
not historically been affected by natural 
disasters, this geographical spread calls for 
risk planning in order to avoid emergencies, 
such as lack of, or poor access to raw 
materials: for instance, pollen.
as part of the ehs management system, 
ongoing assessments for environmental and 
climate risks are conducted for routine and 
non-routine activities. no new risks were 
identified in 2020, and we continue to focus 
on monitoring and mitigating risks related 
to energy consumption, co2 emissions, 
waste and water usage, through relevant 
departments and business units.
handling of chemicals poses a risk of spills, 
which is closely monitored. in 2020, no 
significant spills or releases occurred. we will 
maintain a sharp focus on which chemicals 
we use and how they are used, with the aim 
of constant improvement. 
alk has yet to explore in full the impact of 
our upstream and downstream (scope 3) 
activities, however, due to our relatively small 
operation, the impact on a global scale is 
likely not very high.

targets and results
target: we implement preventative actions, 
monitor and constantly reduce risks, 
measure the results of our efforts and set new 
goals for continuous improvements. 
target: we seek to reduce energy 
consumption, co2 emissions and water usage. 
goal: by 2020, energy and water efficiency 
considerations will be an integrated part of 
facilities upgrade plans. 
result: in 2020, energy and water efficiency 
were considered in all major facilities 
upgrade plans, especially concerning the 
reuse of water. 
goal: by 2020, we want at least 30% of all 
consumed energy to come from renewable 
energy sources. 
result: in 2020, 38% of consumed energy 
came from renewable energy. our facilities in 
denmark, spain and france now run on 100% 
renewable electricity, through purchasing of 
green electricity certificates. 
goal: by 2020, we want to reduce 
co2 emissions by 25% compared to a 
2017-baseline. 
result: at the end of 2020, the co2 emissions 
had decreased by 32% to 6,612 tonnes

policy
alk’s code of conduct describes the 
standards, norms and principles for 
our interactions with stakeholders, and 
outlines our expectations when it comes to 
professionalism, honesty and integrity. alk’s 
managers are responsible for ensuring that 
each employee is familiar with the code and 
its importance. the code of conduct contains 
summarised versions of all broadly relevant 
policies including:
• interactions with healthcare professionals
• human rights
• anti-corruption and fraud
• competition
• marketing practices
• grants, donations and political 
contributions
in all of these areas, we follow international 
standards and codes of ethics, such as the 
codes set out by the european federation of 
pharmaceutical industries and associations 
(efpia), the ethical committee for the 
pharmaceutical industry, the uk bribery act, 
and the us foreign corrupt practices act as 
well as other international standards.
our code of conduct specifically prohibits:
• offering or accepting anything of value 
that could be interpreted as an attempt 
to influence behaviour that could 
inappropriately influence decisions 
• engaging with companies where there is a 
personal conflict of interest
• promotion of alk pharmaceutical products 
to the general public, with the exception of 
markets where this is expressly permitted
• collusion, conflicts of interest, price fixing 
or other anti-competitive behaviour
• interactions with healthcare professionals 
and patients’ organisations that do not 
serve a legitimate purpose
the code of conduct was developed in close 
collaboration with other relevant internal 
stakeholders. all subsequent revisions have 
been signed off by the board of management. 
the code of conduct is available in eight 
languages. all employees must read and 
sign off on the code of conduct and undergo 
code of conduct training once annually. the 
code of conduct can be downloaded from our 
website: https://www.alk.net/code-conduct 
in the development of branded and non-
branded promotional material, alk complies 
with national laws, codes of practice, 
regulatory legislation and standards for 
good ethical practice. the material must be 
accurate, balanced, fair and be approved 
by a medically qualified signatory, prior 
to publication. in addition, alk strives 
to develop promotional material that is 
unbiased and representative of the local 
population.
alk is committed to ensure transparent 
and ethical interactions with healthcare 
professionals, healthcare and patients’ 
orgsanisations and the general public.
tax policy
alk’s tax policy is publicly available on 
our website. the alk group must be in 
compliance with all relevant tax regulations 
and tax guidelines (including the oecd 
guidelines on base erosion and profit 
shifting). alk does not engage in tax 
reduction measures such as tax avoidance, 
use of tax shelters or transactions with 
significant reputational risk.
anti-corruption
we are committed to working against 
corruption in all its forms, and we take a zero-
tolerance approach to corruption, including 
facilitation payments, kickbacks, fraud and 
bribery. no alk employees are allowed to 
accept gifts of significant value. 
anti-corruption considerations are an 
integrated part of our business partner and 
supplier-handling process, and we ensure 
that our partners and suppliers acknowledge 
and respect this responsibility when doing 
business with us. legal entities within the 
alk group may adopt local policies and 
procedures that are more stringent than 
those contained in the alk policy. 
our commitment is set out in alk’s code of 
conduct and alk’s anti-corruption policy and 
supports the un global compact principle 10 
and un sustainable development goal 16. 
suppliers
a typical alk supplier would be an 
international, well-established supplier 
to the pharmaceutical industry, and often 
located in either the usa or europe. all 
suppliers of critical production materials 
are vetted and categorised based on risk 
in relation to quality, finance, ehs and 
sustainability. business review meetings 
are held on a frequent basis. alk maintains 
auditing rights for high-risk suppliers. in 
cases where supplies come from a third party 
(a tier 2 supplier), the original supplier must 
be an already-approved alk supplier. 
quality and patient safety 
quality is a strategic priority for us, as it 
concerns both patient safety and public 
health. it is essential to our daily work, 
and we continue to develop the methods 
we use to train our employees, in order to 
ensure standardisation and consistency 
and thereby, the safety and well-being 
of people who use our products. in the 
production of our treatments, we adhere to 
gxp requirements. all these requirements are 
described in various procedures within the 
quality management system.

safety, privacy and respect are watchwords 
in our clinical trials, which we conduct in close 
collaboration with healthcare professionals, 
scientists and people with allergy. we 
are also committed to the efpia’s and the 
pharmaceutical research and manufacturers 
of america’s (phrma) principles for 
responsible clinical trial data sharing 
guidelines in a manner that safeguards the 
privacy of patients, respects the integrity of 
national regulatory systems, and protects 
proprietary information. 
production and manufacturing processes are 
subject to periodic and routine inspections 
by regulatory authorities as part of their 
monitoring processes, in order to ensure that 
all manufacturers adhere to the prescribed 
requirements and standards. in 2020, 
four external inspections of our sites were 
successfully completed. two were performed 
on-site, while the other two were performed 
remotely. 
during 2020, alk had no product recalls or 
critical product issues. alk has a rigorous 
safety reporting system in place ensuring 
that safety data from any source, including 
clinical trials and from the market, are 
collected and analysed systematically by 
alk’s global pharmacovigilance team. 
we do this to ensure that the safety profile 
of our products stays beneficial, and that 
relevant authorities are aware of any safety 
issues arising from our products. alk’s 
pharmacovigilance processes are also 
subject to periodic and routine inspections by 
regulatory authorities and partners. 
all alk employees are required to report any 
case of side effects from alk products within 
24 hours of learning about them. in 2020, 
all employees were required to read and 
sign that they understood this obligation. 
furthermore, the reporting of side effects 
was included as a theme in the annual code 
of conduct training, which was completed by 
94% of employees globally.
animal welfare
alk is committed to focusing on animal 
welfare throughout our research and 
development of new medicines. alk must 
select professional animal suppliers, who are 
well recognised, and accredited (according 
to the federation of european laboratory 
animal science associations’ (felasa) 
guidelines) to serve the pharmaceutical 
industry. our commitment to animal welfare 
also covers the shipment and transport of 
animals to our animal facilities, which must 
also comply with international and national 
laws and be established to house laboratory 
animals in a manner that favours natural 
behaviour. 
scientific work involving laboratory animals, 
must be planned to minimise distress and 
pain, to refine experiments, to choose the 
right animal species and to reduce the 
number of animals. furthermore, all studies 
must be planned and executed in a way that 
recognize the 3 r’s: replacement, refinement

and reduction. alk strives to avoid any 
unnecessary repetition of animal studies. 
transgenically altered animals will be used 
when more exact research results can be 
obtained or when the use of transgenic 
animals requires fewer animals than 
conventional research. 
 
action
in 2020, we continued our anti-corruption 
awareness training as part of our extended 
code of conduct training. the themes 
covered in the training ranged from 
corruption, harassment, conflicts of interest, 
interactions with suppliers and healthcare 
professionals, and more. 
to further strengthen our commitment to 
transparency, and to promote a culture 
where feedback and open dialogue are 
welcome, we continued our awareness-
raising efforts by including guidance on the 
various ways in which employees can raise 
concerns, and how to approach situations 
where they believe the code of conduct may 
have been violated.
we continue to add anti-corruption clauses 
to new, large supplier agreements, which 
generally also contain audit rights, allowing 
us to access documentation to verify 
each supplier’s compliance. in 2020, no 
observations of violations were made in 
supplier assessments in relation to human 
rights, labour rights, environment and 
corruption.
in 2020, no incidents of anti-competitive 
behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices 
have been reported through alk alertline.
reaching our sustainability goals is an 
important issue for the board of management 
and the board of directors and, in 2020, 
sustainability goals became a part of 
the board of management’s incentive 
programme. the new sustainability goals, 
set in 2020, have been integrated into the 
balanced score card process for 2021.
alk employees are made aware of the 
different grievance mechanisms that exist 
at least annually, such as escalating issues 
through their reporting line, hr, ehs or via 
alk alertline. employees can file a report via 
alk alertline in multiple languages, either by 
telephone or via an online form. a direct link 
was made available on alk’s mobile intranet 
air for easy access to filing a report.  
 
risks
the main risks related to our activities 
include employees’ and business partners’ 
violation of our code of conduct and anti-
corruption commitment, along with any 
resulting legal and financial consequences. 
more than 99% of our major suppliers are 
located in europe and north america, regions 
generally perceived as being low risk with 
regards to corruption. in 2020, the risk of 
corruption and unethical business practices 
remained unchanged. however, we continue 
to conduct due diligence of third-party 
relationships, where relevant, on a risk-
based approach, either internally or through 
partners. the classification of risks in relation 
to corruption is based on international 
indicators such as transparency 
international’s corruption perceptions index.
mechanisms for mitigating and preventing 
corruption and bribery include: 
• an annual assessment of the risks in 
relation to our industry and the countries 
in which we operate, by the alk risk 
committee 
• the vetting of relevant external 
commercial partners in relation to 
corruption 
• ad hoc screenings and assessments, 
which are documented and if needed, 
mitigation plans are developed 
• ad hoc, third-party due diligence of 
partners and suppliers, where relevant 
responsible business practices are an 
integrated part of our operations, either 
through national and international codes of 
ethics, or our own positions. should alk’s 
risk map change, necessary measures 
will be taken to ensure that those risks 
are mitigated, either through increased 
monitoring or by modifying our governance 
processes.
meeting quality standards in our production 
and manufacturing processes is a 
prerequisite for alk’s licence to operate and 
our competitive strength. our production 
processes and quality standards have been 
developed and optimised over many years. 
to mitigate risks, we invest significantly in 
ensuring robustness and compliance in our 
processes. 
overall risk of counterfeiting of alk 
medicines is considered low. the main risks 
in connection with our products come from 
failures to report side effects. we monitor 
the effects of our products both before and 
after they gain marketing authorisations. if, 
despite the high levels of quality and safety, a 
situation should occur in which it is necessary 
to recall a product, alk has procedures in 
place to ensure that this can be managed 
swiftly and efficiently.
large contracts are reviewed and approved 
by global procurement who, jointly with the 
legal department, ensure compliance with 
our commitment to responsible business 
conduct, anti-corruption and sustainability. 
we aim to maintain our standing by acting in 
compliance with all applicable regulations 
and legislation.

targets and results
target: we do not contribute to political 
parties or candidates of any kind. 
kpi: amount contributed to political parties. 
result: no political contributions have been 
made on behalf of alk or reported via the 
alk alertline. 
target: we work to eliminate corruption and 
bribery in the entire value chain. 
kpi: number of reports regarding corruption 
and bribery received through alk alertline. 
result: no incidents of corruption or bribery 
were reported via alk alertline in 2020. 
however, two cases concerning other 
matters were reported through alk alertline 
and four cases via other channels, of which, 
the allegations were substantiated in one 
case, three were closed as unfounded after 
internal investigations, one was deemed to 
be outside the scope of alk alertline, and one 
is still being investigated.
kpi: percentage of employees who have 
read the alk code of conduct. 
result: 95% of employees read and signed 
off on our code of conduct in 2020. 
kpi: percentage of employees who have 
passed the alk anti-corruption training and 
test. 
result: in 2020, alk’s anti-corruption 
training was expanded to a broader code 
of conduct training, which is why this kpi is 
no longer applicable. corruption, bribery 
and fraud are part of, and will continue to 
be a recurring topic, in our code of conduct 
training in the future.
goal: by 2020, we want to test all employees 
on a yearly basis about their knowledge of 
business ethics compliance. 
result: 94% of employees successfully 
completed the code of conduct training. 
employees on long-term sick leave, parental 
leave or who left the company in the period 
when the training was open are not part of 
this statistic. 
goal: by 2020, we want to raise the quality 
mindset maturity index by 10% compared to 
baseline. 
result: the quality maturity mindset index 
(qmmi) is calculated by rating each site 
or area on how well they apply the quality 
mindset. the index rose 13% over the last two 
years, which is a significant improvement.

planned activities for 2021  
and expected results
a new sustainability committee will be 
established with overall responsibility for 
ensuring the implementation and monitoring 
of the alk sustainability policy and its 
governance. the committee will consist of 
several key business units, critical to the 
realisation of the new sustainability strategy, 
including members from the extended board 
of management.
having a strong quality mindset is striving to 
meet or exceed the needs and expectations 
of our colleagues and customers and to 
continuously improve the quality of our work. 
in 2021, we will further develop the quality 
mindset maturity index and continue training 
our employees and upgrading quality- 
related it systems.
we will continue our efforts in training 
employees on topics covered in our code 
of conduct. the selection of topics will be 
determined based on developments in 
society, as well as based on our own internal 
assessments. an additional policy is under 
development specifically concerning conflicts 
of interest. 
an assessment will be conducted to ensure 
that our whistle-blower hotline, alk alertline 
meets our requirements going forward, and 
whether additional safeguards need to be in 
place to protect anonymity.
to ensure continued focus on responsible 
business conduct, a new goal has been set.

sustainability reporting principles
alk uses global reporting initiative’s 
(gri) sustainability standards as guidance 
to determine report content in terms 
of stakeholder inclusiveness, context, 
materiality and completeness. the report’s 
quality is defined by balance, comparability, 
accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability. 
the reporting period covered by this report 
extends from 1 january 2020 to 31 december 
2020.
reporting scope
the reporting scope is differentiated based 
on the principles outlined above. the 
environmental data in this report covers only 
alk’s production sites in the usa, denmark, 
spain and france. all other data regarding 
human rights, labour rights and responsible 
business practices cover the entire alk 
group, unless otherwise specified. data from 
2019 will henceforth be used as the baseline 
for our sustainability work and reporting.
governance
alk’s sustainability planning and activities 
reflect actual and potential risks and 
opportunities covering human rights, labour 
rights, climate and environment, and anti-
corruption – directly or via alk’s suppliers 
and partners. 
the oversight, accountability, and 
responsibility for the alk sustainability 
purpose and strategy rests with alk’s 
build bridges

alk’s cultural beliefs
our cultural beliefs and behaviours describe the aspiration for our 
company culture and encompass the attitude and mindset required 
to become the world leader in allergy.

board of directors, who have delegated this 
responsibility to the board of management. 
relevant business units across alk are 
responsible for the daily management of 
the access to allergy care for all strategy 
and the operational-level targets, 
including monitoring of development, risk 
identification and management, integration 
into decision-making and processes and 
internal reporting to the alk sustainability 
team. the alk sustainability team 
coordinates and supports implementation 
and daily management of the sustainability 
strategy. the team is also responsible for 
monitoring sustainability performance 
and for supporting the organisation with 
expertise within sustainability, as well as 
reporting on risks, activities and progress 
to the board of management and board of 
directors. the identification and planning of 
connected activities are conducted by the 
alk sustainability team, with final approval 
by the alk sustainability committee.
the achievement of alk’s sustainability 
goals is guided by a set of guidelines, the 
alk code of conduct, which promotes alk’s 
cultural beliefs and business integrity, and 
underlines the obligation to comply with 
legislation and the un global compact which 
we signed in 2019. all alk employees must 
observe the code of conduct in relation 
to customers, colleagues, shareholders, 
society, suppliers and partners. our cultural 
beliefs and behaviours describe our 
company culture and encompass the attitude 
and mindset required to transform alk into 
the world leader in allergy.
due diligence, risk management and 
grievance mechanisms 
sustainability-related risk assessments 
are carried out as an integrated part of 
business-relevant risk assessment schemes 
and procedures, or as a sustainability due 
diligence process. 
the alk risk committee assists the board of 
management with the overall responsibility 
of risk management. the alk risk committee 
normally meets twice a year, or more, if 
required. the committee assesses risks 
relating to the entire alk group, including 
risks that could prevent us from reaching 
strategic and financial goals and risks that 
could damage our reputation. the committee 
is also responsible for overseeing the 
mitigation of these risks. sustainability risk 
assessments are integrated into the overall 
due diligence processes and procedures. 
alk takes additional responsibility by 
vetting relevant external partners through 
the procurement department to minimise 
sustainability-related risks. alk encourages 
suppliers and business partners to adhere 
to our standards in the areas of human rights 
and labour rights, the environment and anti-
corruption.
in addition to the alk alertline, our whistle-
blower scheme, alk has several internal 
grievance mechanisms for attending to less 
serious issues. these include, but are not 
limited to, preventative/protective functions 
within: employee representative groups, 
hr, ehs and legal. these business units and 
groups are responsible for managing and 
resolving grievances and relevant matters 
are reported to the board of directors.
reports received through the alk alertline 
are administered by an independent 
organisation, but processed internally, with 
oversight from the chairman of the audit 
committee. each report is evaluated and, if 
substantiated, corrective and preventative 
actions are taken. no retaliation towards the 
employee is allowed, regardless of whether 
the reports are made through the alk 
alertline or other channels.
external stakeholders such as customers, 
patients and the general public are able to 
make complaints through customer service 
or other similar channels. depending on the 
nature of the requests, these are handled 
either internally or externally.
grievance mechanisms that are applied 
by alk for both internal and external 
stakeholders are inspired by principle 31 of 
the un guiding principles for business and 
human rights.
transparency 
at alk, we do business with integrity and 
are committed to respecting the legal 
requirements and industry ethical codes of 
each individual market in which we operate. 
we are committed to providing open and 
honest information about our sustainability 
efforts, results and related policies, both 
internally and externally in relation to our 
stakeholders. 
our work with sustainability centres on an 
ambition to contribute to the 2030 agenda for 
sustainable development and is monitored 
on the basis of relevant indicators that 
have been developed by the gri, and other 
relevant standards. in addition to these, 
we follow the principles outlined in the 
un global compact, oecd guidelines for 
multinational enterprises, international 
labor organisation (ilo), uk bribery act, 
uk modern slavery act and the us foreign 
corrupt practices act.
our commitments, efforts and goals are 
disclosed in our sustainability report and on 
our website, and follow the danish financial 
statements act sections 99a, 99b and 107d.

explanation of calculations
employee data
all employee data in this report is presented 
as headcount. part-time work is defined as 
any work below the local national standard in 
the countries in which we operate. temporary 
employment is defined as employment, with 
a pre-agreed end-date. 
all employee-related data are downloaded 
from our internal hr-system workday, with 
the exception of ltif data, which is reported 
directly to the ehs organisation. 
germany, although within scope as a 
significant location of operations, is excluded 
from pay ratio by function calculations 
because local customs discourage 
implementation of a job grade system. 
the ratio is calculated by comparing the 
average employee base pay, only on those 
job grade levels in which the opposite 
gender is represented. should there be no 
comparable men or women at a certain pay 
grade, these averages are removed from the 
ratio. alk also reports a raw pay gap ratio, 
which includes the base pay and allowances 
of all employees except the ceo, to ensure 
an accurate representation of average 
employees. 
the turnover ratio is calculated  by dividing 
the number of employees who left the 
company by the average number of 
employees in the reporting year.
absence is calculated as number of workdays 
with absence due to sickness, divided by 
total scheduled working days.
people with allergy
the data regarding the number of people 
treated is calculated based on actual sales 
numbers combined with assumptions in 
markets where alk is not directly involved in 
the manufacture of the final product.
suppliers
supplier data is made available through our 
internal sap system and evaluated based on 
geographical location.
environment
our ghg emissions are calculated based 
on the ghg protocol corporate accounting 
and reporting standard. only production 
sites are within scope for environmental 
reporting within scope 1 and 2. co2 scope 
1 + 2 emissions include all material types of 
fuels and refrigerants, including hfcs, gas 
oil, diesel, heating etc. renewable energy 
is subtracted from reported total co2-
emissions.
quality
the quality maturity mindset index is 
calculated by rating each site or area on 
how well they apply the quality mindset. 
having a strong quality mindset is striving to 
meet or exceed the needs and expectations 
of our colleagues and customers and to 
continuously improve the quality of our 
work. the index measures the overall quality 
compliance maturity of a site or area.

 note: significant locations of operation are defined as countries with more than 200 employees. alk has a relatively small 
number of employees in each category that are used as a base for pay gap comparison. small differences in seniority, 
specialist area and geographic location may disproportionately affect the final results, especially when divided into 
locations.

co2 scope 1 + 2 emissions include all material types of fuels and refrigerants, including hfcs, gas oil, diesel, heating etc. renewable energy is subtracted from reported total 
co2-emissions. energy consumption in gj is calculated as mwh*3.6. all environmental data is reported for production sites only (hørsholm, madrid, vandeuil, varennes, port 
washington, post falls and oklahoma). 
social
workforce is calculated as the headcount of permanent + temporary employees on 31 december 2020. all data is downloaded from alk’s internal hr system workday. the 
gender pay ratio is calculated by comparing the median total compensation of men to women. the ceo is excluded. the turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the number of 
employees who left the company by the average number of employees in the reporting year. absence is calculated as number of working days with absence due to sickness, 
divided by total working days. 
governance
the ceo pay ratio is calculated as total compensation divided by median staff total compensation. the board meeting attendance rate is calculated as (number of 
meetings*number of members)-meetings not attended/(number of meetings*number of members)*100.
