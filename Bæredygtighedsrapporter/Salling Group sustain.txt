the goal of salling group is to develop our 
company and generate profits that enable 
our owners, the salling foundations, to 
support worthy causes in denmark.
this requires strong business sense which 
is our strength and something we take 
pride in and are proud of. we are also a 
responsible company as demonstrated 
by the numerous examples of our many 
ongoing csr initiatives in this report. 
salling group believes that running a suc-
cessful business is not incompatible with 
being a responsible company; on the con-
trary, our skills as merchants enable us 
to negotiate the price of organic products 
down to a level that makes it affordable 
for everyone to choose organic products. 
this makes good business sense which 
goes hand in hand with responsibility. 
this responsibility and business sense are 
also reflected in our stores’ commitment 
to reducing energy consumption. for 
example, we have installed doors on all 
freezers and coolers in bilka, føtex and 
netto which has resulted in significant  
energy savings and lower carbon  
emissions and energy costs. 
although 2020 turned out very differ-
ently than expected, salling group has 
not changed or suspended its ambitions 
when it comes to responsibility. we 
remain ambitious. not only on our own 
behalf, but also on behalf of the society 
we are a part of. 
covid-19 changed the everyday lives of 
everyone and presented new challenges 
that also demanded our time, effort and 
attention. but it has not changed our 
drive, and we have been working as hard 
as ever to achieve our goals and ambi-
tions – despite the changed conditions. 
sustainable and responsible choices are 
a natural part of our company, which in 
2020 enabled us to achieve results that 
reflect our ambition to reduce our carbon 
emissions, develop more climate-friendly 
initiatives and contribute to the achieve-
ment of denmark’s 2030 climate goals. 
food waste has a significant climate 
impact, and as a retailer with a large value 
chain we can make the biggest difference 
for the environment by reducing our own 
and our customers’ food waste.
ever since we published our total food 
waste figures for the first time – and as 
the first to do so in denmark – we have 
continuously taken steps towards halving 
2020 did not turn out the way we wanted 
or hoped. nevertheless, i am proud of 
the tremendous effort made by all salling 
group employees, the results we have 
achieved and not least our commitment 
to social responsibility. 
covid-19 has of course been a huge 
challenge for denmark and, by extension, 
for salling group. we have addressed a 
lot of problems in this respect and as a 
responsible company we have done our 
best to demonstrate corporate social 
responsibility. 
one of our first priorities was to secure 
our supply chain to make sure our stores 
were well-stocked with essential items to 
keep society going during the pandemic. 
we immediately paid over dkk 1.1bn to 
small danish suppliers to improve their 
liquidity. we refused government relief 
packages although more than 2,000 of 
our employees were furloughed. our 
owners, the salling foundations, also 
contributed significant covid-19 relief 
packages. 
such social responsibility is possible 
thanks to our skills as merchants.
our food waste. since 2014, we have  
reduced our total food waste by 44.6%.
we are proud of our progress and of the 
strong support we have received from 
colleagues, business partners and other 
food companies. in 2020, they decided to 
share our ambition and together we have 
committed ourselves to addressing food 
waste through the ‘denmark against food 
waste’ initiative. we helped launch the 
initiative in 2018, which has now become 
an essential part of denmark’s overall 
climate action. 
food waste is also a good example of 
the dilemmas that we and everyone else 
face when it comes to csr. because every 
choice has a consequence, and few solu-
tions are without downsides. 
we fight food waste by using plastic pack-
aging, among other things. however, we 
not only seek to reduce our food waste, 
we also seek to reduce our use of plastic 
packaging. the dilemma that the two 
can be mutually exclusive in some cases 
is something we need to be honest and 
transparent about. otherwise, we cannot 
tackle this task professionally and respon-
sibly and give our customers and stake-
holders insight into how social responsi-
bility is both demanding and complex and 
requires difficult choices. 
salling group wants to engage in an open 
dialogue about this, while continuing our 
work and even significantly stepping up 
our climate efforts. although we have 
come a long way in recent years and in 
2020, we are committed to continuing 
our efforts – and take responsibility for 
bringing about lasting change. for our 
customers, for our employees, for the 
environment and for society.

salling group owns the retail chains bilka, føtex 
and netto as well as the salling department 
stores, the toy chain br, affiliated online stores, 
the franchise chains starbucks and carl’s jr*. and 
netto stores in germany and poland. this makes 
salling group denmark’s largest retail group with 
almost 10.9m customers and guests per week in 
our stores and restaurants. 
salling group is wholly owned by the salling 
foundations. this means that salling group’s 
annual profits are reinvested in the business for 
the benefit of our customers who get an even 
better customer experience. in addition, each year 
the foundations make donations to worthy causes 
in denmark. 
since 2012, the salling foundations have donated 
more than dkk 1bn to culture, sports, charity, 
education and research. in 2020, the salling 
foundations donated dkk 139.1m to the climate 
academy and the concito climate database, 
among others, and financially supported a relief 
package for sports in aarhus, denmark. 
salling group and subsequently the salling 
foundations were established by our founders 
herman salling and ferdinand salling. in 2014, the 
salling foundations began the gradual buyback 
of shares from a. p. møller – mærsk which owned 
part of the company. today, salling group is wholly 
owned by the salling foundations. 
in 2018, the change in ownership was cemented 
by changing the company’s name from dansk 
supermarked to salling group – a nod to the 
company’s history which also marks its ties with  
the salling foundations. 
salling group is led by ceo per bank and his  
executive committee, while the board of directors 
is the owner’s representative with overall responsi-
bility for the company, including ensuring the right 
management composition. 
significant organisational 
changes in salling group in 2020 
•  nils smedegaard andersen hands 
over the chairmanship of salling 
group to bjørn gulden, who becomes

stores: 
we are constantly improving efficien-
cy in our stores in order to reduce 
energy consumption. new and better 
refrigeration systems, coolers with 
doors and led lights help reduce 
energy consumption. our stores also 
provide the framework for an inclu-
sive and diverse workplace. 
transport: 
we can achieve substantial climate 
gains in the transport area, and we 
continuously strive to maximise  
the efficiency of transport to and 
from our stores.  
 
production: 
we produce very few products 
ourselves which are subject to 
the same strict requirements as 
our suppliers. furthermore, we 
and our suppliers must follow 
and respect applicable laws, 
including human rights. in 2020, 
we implemented our plastic 
principles which are intended to 
provide guidance for our sup-
pliers and promote the use of 
sustainable packaging for salling 
group’s private label brands. 
raw materials/ 
primary production: 
although we do not grow raw 
materials ourselves, we have 
clear objectives and requirements 
aimed at ensuring sustainable 
and responsible production. as a 
result, we have established a code 
of conduct which all our suppliers 
must follow and we have specific 
policies for palm oil, soya and 
fishing, among other things. 
warehouses: 
we strive to reduce waste and 
energy consumption at our ware-
houses. the warehouses work with 
wefood (danchurchaid) and the 
danish food bank to donate and 
resell food products with damaged 
packaging. moreover, we focus on 
creating a healthy working environ-
ment and ensuring a high level of 
safety at our warehouses. 
transport: 
in 2020, we took over a number of 
logistics tasks previously handled 
by our suppliers which allows us 
to better plan warehouse to store 
deliveries and thereby reduce 
carbon emissions. 
customers: 
our main aim is to increase  
sales of healthy products and 
ensure that we can always offer 
our customers a healthier alter-
native. we are denmark’s largest 
retailer, and with that comes great 
responsibility. that is why we try 
to offer a wide range of products 
to make it easy to find and choose 
healthier options.

2020 was defined by the covid-19 pandemic 
which had a profound effect on the daily opera-
tion of salling group and our business – initially 
with the lockdown in germany and poland and 
later denmark. 
as denmark’s largest retail chain and one of 
denmark’s largest employers, we knew from the 
beginning that we have a special responsibility to 
curb the spread of covid-19 among our custom-
ers and employees. 
several safety measures were put in place and 
alternative shopping options such as online shop-
ping were upgraded to meet customer demand 
and comply with official recommendations. 
knowing what we know today, our social respon-
sibility efforts were successful. we managed to 
slow the spread of infection, and retail stores – 
which were not affected by the lockdowns – did 
not make shoppers feel unsafe or pose a particu-
lar risk of infection. 
the ability to make a difference
while much of society was shut down in march 
and april and the pandemic had a dramatic 
impact on many sectors, salling group was not 
affected in quite the same way, which was also 
the case at the end of the year when the second 
wave hit denmark. 
we were one of the first companies to refuse 
government relief in the form of salary com-
pensation for our more than 2,000 employees in 
salling department stores and br that had to be 
furloughed. we also decided to suspend credit 
times for approved invoices and immediately pay 
out dkk 500m in march to support small danish 
suppliers with liquidity problems. in december, 
we reaffirmed our support and immediately paid 
out dkk 600m in connection with the second 
lockdown. 
we supported the street newspaper ‘hus forbi’ 
with the sale of gift cards and a dkk 500,000 dona-
tion to secure meals for hus forbi vendors. 
our employees were honoured for their efforts in 
the form of an added employee discount on items 
purchased in our stores. 
our employees, in particular, deserve a lot of 
praise for their truly extraordinary contribution 
throughout the crisis. they have ensured a good 
and safe shopping experience and been extreme-
ly flexible as covid-19 restrictions changed our 
everyday lives. not only when face masks or face 
shields became mandatory in our stores, but also 
when seven municipalities in northern jutland 
went into lockdown and 450 employees showed 
great flexibility and switched workplace for a while 
so they could stay in their home municipality. 
throughout the pandemic, the salling foundations 
provided substantial financial relief packages to 
culture and sports.

same – especially when it comes to

as part of the process of ensuring ambitious 
and structured responsibility efforts, we 
launched our new csr strategy in 2019 which 
is based on un sdgs 3, 12 and 13. our csr 
strategy is centred on climate and health be-
cause we believe we can make a difference in 
those areas. in 2020, they have been incorpo-
rated across the entire organisation to ensure 
that everyone at salling group contributes to 
the fulfilment of the sdgs. 
in working with the sdgs, we are continuously 
assessing whether adjustments are needed to 
ensure that we are putting our shoulders to 
the wheel in areas where we can make the  
biggest difference. in 2018, it was sdgs 3 
(good health and well-being), 4 (quality edu-
cation) and 12 (responsible consumption and 
production). however, when we adopted our 
new csr strategy in 2019, where the focus 
is on employees, customers and products as 
the foundation of our company, we decided 
to replace sdg 4 with sdg 13 (climate action) 
while continuing to work on sdgs 3 and 12. 
with extensive training programmes for all of 
our 55,000 employees, we are still realising 
sdg 4, but as employee development is such a 
natural part of our daily working lives, we de-
cided that we could make a bigger difference 
with sdg 13 by taking responsibility for and 
intensifying our contribution to solving climate 
challenges.

sustainable development
positive impact: 
we believe that these 
sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) are the three 
goals where, as a retailer, 
we can have the biggest 
positive impact.
potentially positive 
impact: 
all these sdgs are goals 
where we have or poten-
tially can have a direct or 
indirect positive impact 
through our activities as  
a retailer.
potentially negative  
impact: 
these are goals on which 
we have the least direct or 
indirect positive impact, but 
where we are seeking to 
limit any potentially negative 
impact on people, society or 
the environment.

tackling global climate change 
requires ambition and hard work 
by everyone. salling group wants to 
be a responsible corporate citizen 
by taking action and contributing to 
achieving the goal of reducing global 
warming by 2030. climate issues are 
a common agenda that can only be 
addressed if we work together. 
in 2019, we formulated our first  
climate change ambitions. in 2020, 
we learned more about how we can 
contribute to reducing carbon emis-
sions as a retailer and decided to 
update our future carbon ambitions 
in mid-2021. 
going forward, we want to be even 
more transparent about our carbon 
emissions and set a clear goal for 
our carbon emission reductions and 
how we intend to achieve this goal.

climate reporting 1 - 2 - 3
we report on scope 1 and 2 emissions and to 
some extent on scope 3 emissions, which are our 
starting point for tracking and identifying initiatives 
to reduce our carbon emissions from the produc-
tion of the energy we source. scope 3 covers all 
other indirect emissions that occur as a result of 
our activities, but which we do not own or have 
control over. 
scope 1 
– direct emissions
direct emissions from 
sources owned or con-
trolled by the company:
• fuel consumption
•  refrigerant consumption
• heating oil consumption
scope 2 
– indirect emissions
emissions derived from 
sourced energy:
• electricity
• heat
• district heating
scope 3 
–  other indirect  
emissions
emissions from sources 
not directly controlled by 
the company but derived 
from the company’s 
activities:
• business travel (flights)
• food waste
• goods transport
this classification gives us detailed insight into 
our carbon emissions and allows us to take 
dedicated action where it makes the biggest 
difference.

climate communication 
for more climate-friendly choices
customers are willing to change ingrained eating 
habits to stop climate change the results of the 
‘shopping basket 2020’ consumer survey conduct-
ed by yougov on behalf of føtex show that danes 
are already making more climate-friendly choices. 
the survey also shows that they want more guid-
ance and inspiration for climate-friendly shopping 
and we want to give them that. 
climate database
enabling consumers to make more climate-friend-
ly choices requires insight and knowledge and we 
want to help compile solid and useful data that 
provides just that. in 2020, the salling foundations 
supported concito* with a donation to enable 
the development of a climate database in partner-
ship with 2.0 lca consultants. the climate data-
base will be accessible to everyone in early 2021 
and ranks different product categories in terms of 
their climate impact, allowing users to compare 
products. 
*concito is an independent green danish think tank which 
aims to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
and limiting the harmful effects of global warming. 
we want to make climate-friendly grocery 
shopping easier 
in august 2020, we introduced the first climate 
communication in bilka, føtex and netto which is 
based on concito’s initial calculations and gener-
al climate-friendly shopping tips. climate-friendly 
dietary advice gives customers concrete tips that 
can help them make climate-friendly food choices 
when they shop. the advice suggests choosing fish 
and chicken over for example beef, trying alter-
natives to butter or buying foods that are close to 
their sell-by date – small changes that can make a 
difference. 
we are aware of the dilemmas that this entails.  
for example, the data we receive from concito 
on tomatoes does not take into account whether 
the tomatoes are shipped from spain or from 
funen to the store. as the database grows, we 
expect to be able to further improve the accuracy 
of product data.
concito and 2.0 lca consultants,
supported by the salling foundations, 
publish the climate footprint of 500 
foods in ‘the big climate database’, 
which can be accessed by citizens 
and companies.

danish government’s climate partnership for trade
salling group has also joined the danish government’s 
climate partnership for trade, of which netto’s ceo 
michael løve was appointed chairman in 2020. through 
the partnership, we engage in dialogue with colleagues 
in the industry, producers and interest organisations 
about new initiatives and joint climate communication. 
we originally wanted to introduce a climate label, but we 
realise that this requires a common labelling scheme in 
order to provide our customers with simple and useful 
guidance. that is why we are now working together to 
develop joint climate communication.

many danes consider plastic to be one of the most 
important areas of environmental action. although 
plastic has a much lower climate impact than for 
example food, plastic is bad for the environment 
and the climate if it is not used and recycled  
properly. 
as a result, we are working to reduce the use of 
unnecessary plastic, while ensuring that as much 
as possible is reused or recycled.
we launched our plastic ambition in 2019 which 
formed the foundation for our work in 2019 and 
2020. 
2020-2023 targets / 
results achieved in 2020 
•  all plastic used in the transport of our 
products must be recycled / in 2020, 
90% of all plastic was recycled.
•  the amount of recycled plastic in 
packaging for own brands must be a 
minimum by 30% by 2023 / this target 
was met in september 2020 and we 
therefore increased the target to 40% 
by 2023.
•  we want to phase out all single-use 
cutlery and tableware in 2021.
salling group has replaced all 
cardboard boxes for fruit and 
vegetables with recyclable

salling group sets the standard for 
packaging
sustainable 
we cannot solve our or society’s plastic challenges 
alone; this requires cooperation across our entire 
value chain. in 2019, we developed our plastic 
principles to guide and help our suppliers choose 
and use the best and most sustainable packaging. 
throughout 2020, we worked with our suppliers 
to incorporate the plastic principles in their day-
to-day operations, and we are already seeing the 
results of these efforts. our packaging now uses 
less plastic and has increased recyclability. 
strong networks drive innovation 
we actively participate in strong networks. this al-
lows us to gain inspiration and new insight and to 
share our experience on the development of more 
sustainable packaging. we have joined the danish 
food cluster, sustainable packaging network, 
circular mono plastic packaging network, ocean 
plastic forum and the danish chamber of com-
merce, among others, where we focus on produc-
er responsibility.
examples of optimised packaging:
•  ollineo rapeseed oil and sunflower oil (sold by 
netto): optimised plastic bottle from 0 to 50% 
rpet.
optimised packaging for cold cuts:
•  egelykke spiced meat roll 150 g: reduction 
of 8.1 tonnes of plastic by removing the click lid 
and rpet underfoil
 
•  egelykke salted meat 120 g: reduction of 
2.2 tonnes of plastic by removing the click lid 
and rpet underfoil 
•  egelykke roast beef 70 g: reduction 
of 3.2 tonnes of plastic by removing the click lid 
and rpet underfoil
 
•  budget roast beef 80 g: reduction of 430 
kg of plastic by removing the click lid and rpet 
underfoil
 
•  budget salted meat 120 g: reduction of 430 
kg of plastic by removing the click lid and rpet 
underfoil
 
•  honey in squeeze bottle (both salling Øko and 
Øgo) now with 100% rpet lid and bottle
•  cotton buds – 2020 winner of the european 
private label awards – saving of 61 tonnes 
of plastic by removing the plastic stem and

energy and transport – in all parts of the business 
– are an important part of our efforts to reduce 
our climate impact. we use energy and resources 
for transporting goods, lighting our stores and 
keeping in-store freezers cold. 
if we can keep the amount of energy used to keep 
our frozen strawberries frozen or road transport 
to a minimum, we can not only save resources, 
but also reduce our climate impact. 2020 was one 
of our most successful years as we achieved the 
largest reduction in energy consumption in the 
company’s history. 
we are getting better every day
being a large company enables us to reduce en-
ergy consumption in many areas of the business. 
netto is in the process of revamping all its stores. 
with a new store concept where energy optimi-
sation is an integral part of the process, netto is 
working to create more sustainable retail stores. 
new and better refrigeration systems, coolers with 
doors and led lights help reduce energy consump-
tion. in 2020, netto refurbished 300 of its stores 
and the work continues in 2021. 
since 2015, the salling group has reduced total 
electricity and heat consumption across the  
business by 12 and 21 percent, respectively.  
this corresponds to a total co2 reduction of a 
total of 57,000 tonnes over the last five years.
less transport on danish roads 
efficient logistics is key to reducing energy con-
sumption. one of our initiatives in 2020 was the 
takeover of parts of the logistics and distribution 
of bread to our stores. until now, the large bread 
suppliers have handled all bread deliveries them-
selves, but handling this task ourselves will enable 
us to plan the logistics better, reduce the number 
of kilometres driven and avoid empty trucks. ini-
tially, it will reduce the number of truck deliveries 
from 80,000 to 40,000 per year. we took over the 
task in 2020 and will begin deliveries in april 2021.
energy improvements in germany and poland 
in 2020, netto poland installed a new refrigeration 
system at the central warehouse in motaniec.  
the new refrigeration system reduces energy con-
sumption thanks to a new and improved system 
that constantly monitors energy consumption and 
keeps it to a minimum while reusing all surplus 
energy. 
netto germany reduces carbon emissions from 
transport as just under 100 trucks belonging to  
our supplier kp logistik are now powered by lng.  
the move has resulted in a number of energy 
improvements:
•  in terms of carbon emissions, lng fuel emits 
about 14% less pollutants than diesel.  
the calculation for 2020 results in carbon  
emission reductions from deliveries to netto  
of 1,378,000 kg.
•  in terms of nox emissions, lng fuel emits 
about 17.5% less pollutants than diesel.  
the calculation for 2020 results in a reduction 
in nox emissions of 1,954,168 kg.
•  lng fuel reduces fine dust pollution by about 
92% compared to diesel fuel. for netto this 
resulted in a reduction in fine dust of 218,065 kg 
in 2020.
•  in addition, an lng engine emits 50% less noise 
than a diesel engine.

every day, almost 2,000 tonnes of food are dis-
carded in denmark, which has a major climate 
impact. food production has a much larger  
climate footprint than, for example, transport  
and packaging. 
reducing food waste is therefore important to 
salling group – not least in order to live up to and 
contribute to un sdg 12.3 on halving global food 
waste. at a large retailer such as salling group, 
food waste cannot be avoided, but this does not 
stop us from working purposefully, ambitiously 
and responsibly to reduce overproduction, min-
imise food waste at all levels of the organisation 
and thereby lower carbon emissions. 
since 2016, we have openly reported our food  
waste figures. we believe in transparency and 
want people inside and outside our organisation 
to be inspired by the results of our work. 
we strive to reduce food waste throughout the 
value chain, from raw material to store shelf. 
 this also presents a number of dilemmas, such as 
wanting more frequent deliveries while also aim-
ing to reduce the number of kilometres driven.  
we use data to balance these dilemmas and  
constantly focus on activities that have the  
greatest climate impact.

the price is marked down close to the sell-by date. 
as our products approach their sell-by date, we  
mark down the price and highlight it with a yellow 
sticker. many of our stores even have a dedicated 
area for such products to make them easy to find  
for our customers.
longer shelf life of fruits and vegetables. 
the apeel coating, which is made from plant- 
based ingredients, can prolong the shelf life of 
fruits and vegetables. in 2020, we tested the apeel 
coating on avocados with great success. in the  
run-up to christmas, we expanded the test to 
include oranges and satsumas.
once we have achieved a goal, we set a new goal 
with 2014 as baseline our goal was to halve our total 
food waste in all our chains by 2030. we have already 
achieved this goal for bilka and føtex, so our goal is 
now to cut food waste in the two chains by 75% com-
pared to the 2014 baseline. in 2020, netto took a big 
step towards reducing food waste to half by entering 
into a collaboration with the too good to go app.

even with a strong focus on efficient operations, 
our stores end up with surplus products that 
cannot be sold to customers. these can be 
products that are approaching their sell-by 
date, are mislabelled, have minor damage 
to the packaging or other imperfect items 
that cannot be sold in our stores. instead of 
discarding the products, we can, through good 
partnerships with social organisations, ensure 
that very little is wasted and instead does good 
elsewhere. 
food should be eaten
when a product approaches its sell-by date, the 
store marks it down and puts a yellow sticker 
on the packaging. netto compiles some of the 
discounted products in the food should be eaten 
food waste app. this allows consumers to quick-
ly see if an item on their shopping list has been 
marked down in their local store. customers can 
also upload a picture if they see an item in the 
store with a yellow sticker on it. the app is also 
used by other danish retailers. the food should 
be eaten app only features a selection of  
discounted items – not all discounted items.
donate when returning deposit bottles and 
buying bottled netto water
we do not just donate food to the danish food 
bank; our customers can also make a donation to 
the food bank when returning deposit bottles to 
our stores. in addition, in 2020 we donated dkk 
862,193 from the sale of netto’s own bottled water 
to the danish food bank. 
netto christmas cards that make a difference
in the run-up to christmas, netto sells christmas 
cards in its stores and donates the proceeds to the 
danish food bank. each christmas card costs dkk 
30 which pays for seven meals for a vulnerable or 
deprived citizen. 
føtex ‘bake & donate’ cookie jars 
in december, a very special cookie jar hit the 
shelves in our føtex stores. the cookie jar 
contained recipes and spice mixes and cost dkk 
50 with all the proceeds going to the danish  
food bank. 
holidays and local donations
during the holidays, the stores are closed which 
often results in an increased amount of surplus 
food and unsold seasonal items. here, too, we are 
working with the danish food bank to distribute 
them to those in need. 
bilka and føtex also work directly with a number of 
local organisations on donations at the holidays.

wefood 
danchurchaid’s six wefood stores receive surplus 
food. wefood is the world’s first supermarket sell-
ing surplus food and items that are either misla-
belled, have minor damage to the packaging or 
other imperfect items. the proceeds from the sale 
go to danchurchaid’s work to fight hunger around 
the world. wefood stores are run by volunteers 
and the salling foundations contribute to the  
running of all six stores. 
we do not just donate food. surplus products from 
br and our textile departments are donated and 
sold in danchurchaid’s second-hand shops with 
the proceeds going to their work in denmark and 
the rest of the world. 
too good to go
in 2020, we introduced a new collaboration with 
the too good to go app where customers can  
buy a mystery bag with surplus products from 
local stores at closing time. too good to go is also 
part of our efforts to reduce food waste in netto 
germany which already cover 50 stores.
fighting food waste and food poverty
we work with the danish food bank to fight food 
waste in denmark. the food bank collects fresh 
surplus food from central warehouses and 
selected stores and makes sure it is turned into 
meals for socially disadvantaged people in shelters 
or refuges. the food is also used by breakfast clubs 
in schools to give vulnerable children in particular 
a healthy start to the day and better conditions for 
a good school day. during 2020, netto intensified 
its collaboration with stop waste locally, which 
distributes food to people in need on a daily basis, 
such as socially disadvantaged people, homeless 
people and various institutions. 
pizza from green concert
the danish muscular dystrophy foundation had 
purchased 32,000 pizzas that had already been 
baked to feed happy concertgoers all over denmark 
at this summer’s green concert, which was cancelled 
due to covid-19. to ensure that the pizzas did not 
go to waste, bilka bought all the pizzas and sold them 
in its department stores. this benefitted not only 
green concert but also our customers who were 
able to buy 10 pizzas for dkk 100. 
denmark against food waste
no one has a recipe to fight food waste. on the 
contrary, food waste is a shared responsibility, 
where we can benefit greatly from the experience 
of others. that is why we have formed a unique 
national partnership with some of denmark’s 
leading companies: denmark against food waste. 
the companies commit to halving their food waste 
by 2030 and publishing their food waste figures. 
the partnership that salling group helped to found 
is currently run by the danish ministry of food, 
agriculture and fisheries’s think tank one third  
and aims to prevent food waste and food loss.

retail store
to solve our shared climate challenge we must 
think outside the box, for example when building 
new stores. that is why we in 2020 have built 
and opened denmark’s first stand-alone retail 
store with a focus on greater sustainability. in 
december 2020, a new store concept in bygholm 
bakker near the town of horsens was inaugurated 
in collaboration with c.f. møller architects. an 
innovative concept with respect for nature, the 
environment and local communities in bygholm 
bakker. the concept was also developed with a 
view to creating a more sustainable store with-
out additional establishment costs. 
facts about the bygholm bakker 
netto store:
•  the store is dgnb gold-certified  
– a certification that classifies it as 
sustainable
•  most of the store is made from sus-
tainable wood to minimise its environ-
mental impact
•  the building’s elements and mechani-
cal joints make recycling easy
•  the sedum roof helps store heat and 
keep the store cool
•  solar panels and a new energy system 
make the store partially self-sufficient
•  large windows ensure plenty of  
daylight in the store
•  improved air quality and a healthy 
indoor climate
•  charging station for electric vehicles
green key figures for bygholm bakker:
1.  the energy consumption for the new store as 
a whole is 40% lower than that of an ordinary  
netto store. (170,000 kwh for bygholm bakker 
compared to 280,000 kwh for an ordinary netto 
store)
2.  bygholm bakker’s annual carbon emissions are 
30 tonnes lower than those of an ordinary netto 
store – a reduction of 64%. (bygholm bakker 
emits 17 tonnes of carbon annually – an ordinary 
netto store emits 47 tonnes of carbon annually).

million fewer cigarettes 
40 young danes light up a cigarette 
every day for the first time, thus 
becoming part of the sad statistics of 
danish first-time smokers. we need 
to put an end to this trend. smoking 
is the biggest cause of health prob-

to hide cigarettes from plain view 
in 2018, we also said goodbye to 
significant sales. but it worked. over 
the past two years, we have sold 92 
million fewer cigarettes.
we still have ten years to achieve  
our shared ambition of a smoke-free 
generation by 2030, but the prelimi-
nary figures show that we are on the 
right track. salling group continues

every day 
healthy
when our customers visit our stores, we can help 
make their everyday lives healthier. we offer a 
wide selection of products and give customers the 
opportunity to find and choose healthier products. 
through dialogue, store design and inspiration, we 
want to guide our customers to help them make 
healthier choices when they shop. 
store design makes a difference 
in 2018, netto began a revamp of all its stores. 
the aim is to transform all netto stores into new 
and modern stores with a special focus on fruits 
and vegetables as well as healthy, easy-to-prepare 
convenience meals. in the new stores, the fruit and 
vegetables section is displayed prominently and is 
the first thing the customers see when they enter 
the store. discounted items along with sweets and 
soft drinks are less prominently displayed. and it 
works. comparing the sales of netto’s 3.0 stores 
with those of a non-revamped store, sales of fruits 
and vegetables have increased by +8% while sales 
of sweets and cakes have declined by 3%. 
so far, 167 of netto’s more than 500 stores in den-
mark have been refurbished. the refurbishment 
of our stores in germany and poland is also in full 
swing. the goal is to implement the new layout 
and concept in all netto stores by the end of 2024.
‘snitteriet’ 
it should be easier to eat healthy. that is why 
we are constantly testing new concepts to make 
it easier and more convenient for customers to 
choose vegetables. in 2020, bilka tested a con-
cept where customers can have fresh fruits and 
vegetables sliced in the store. the range comprises 
40-50 items that change continuously – depending 
on the season. it is expected that the ‘snitteriet’ 
concept will be available at all bilka stores in the 
course of 2021. 
new refurbishments of føtex stores
føtex is also in the process of refurbishing its 
stores. customers must be inspired while they do 
their shopping, and we can already now see that 
especially the new displays in the fruit and vegeta-
ble section are changing our customers’ shopping 
habits, and that more fruits and vegetables are 
being sold than before the refurbishment.

health and 
– doing good together 
well-being
being healthy is not only about what we eat and 
drink. it is also about wellbeing and feeling good 
about oneself. we are committed to helping danes 
lead an active lifestyle through numerous activities, 
donations and partnerships. 
deposit refund donations help local sports
with just one push of the button on the bottle re-
cycling machine, customers in bilka and føtex can 
donate money to local sports and other initiatives 
in their local community that promote mental and 
physical health. the donations are split between 
recipients across denmark, including: the social 
initiative næstehjælperne in ishøj, the sports clubs 
snekkersten idrætsforening and Øster ulslev 
boldklub and the vulnerable children’s charity 
julemærkehjemmet in hobro. 
netto poland supports big sports dreams
netto poland is committed to the health and 
well-being of children and young people. netto has 
been official partner of the borussia dortmund 
football club since july 2019. through the partner-
ship with the club and Łukasz piszczek’s bvb acad-
emy, netto supports the development of future 
football talents and has helped set up poland’s  
first football academy, among other things. 
together with the monika pyrek foundation 
named after a former olympic athlete, netto  
poland has set up the ‘jump into your dreams’ 
foundation. the foundation aims to support 
young, talented athletes and their sports career 
through professional guidance. 
food bank breakfast clubs 
according to the danish food bank, an increas-
ing number of children in socially disadvantaged 
residential areas do not eat breakfast before 
coming to school. as a result, they do not get the 
energy they need for the day which harms their 
well-being, concentration and ability to learn. to 
change this, føtex and the danish food bank have 
developed a concept at five schools where the 
pupils are offered breakfast when they arrive in 
the morning, so they get a good and healthy start 
to the day. the ambition is to expand the concept 
to other parts of denmark by 2021.
school olympics affected by covid-19
in the school olympics, pupils from all over den-
mark compete in child-friendly olympic disciplines 
that encourage movement, community spirit and 
positive experiences through exercise and healthy 
eating for children in primary and secondary 
school. the school olympics are supported by 
bilka, føtex and netto. unfortunately, the school 
olympics were cancelled due to covid-19, but we 
will be back next year when the school olympics 
will hopefully return.
løkkefonden also affected by covid-19 
since 2018, bilka has supported the løkkefonden 
foundation’s work which aims to help struggling 
young boys aged 14-25 lead a more structured life, 
a healthier lifestyle and improve their school and 
learning performance. among other things, this 
is achieved through a dedicated teaching pro-
gramme at the foundation’s drengeakademi and 
by testing the boys’ self-confidence and team spirit 
during the løkkefonden challenge which will see 
them cycle 500 km in five days. unfortunately, the 
løkkefonden challenge was also cancelled in the 
spring due to covid-19, but we look forward to 
the challenge in september 2021.

responsible 
and the products on our shelves
our employees
a healthy and well-run business is key if 
we are to be attractive to our customers. 
great service, friendliness, competence and 
respectfulness are a matter of course. in 
addition, we are committed to offering a 
wide and inspiring range of products. 
we want our customers to know that they 
can trust us to demonstrate responsibility 
when it comes to the products they buy.  
high animal welfare, safe working conditions 
and a production that cares for local 
communities and the environment are an 
important part of that work. we work on 
responsibility throughout the value chain 
in close dialogue with our local suppliers, 
through partnerships and recognised 
certifications that help raise the level of 
responsibility across the industry. 
our 55,000 talented employees, who make 
everyday life better on a daily basis – for 
each other, for our customers and for 
society – are fundamental to our ability to 
offer and present the products we sell in  
the best possible way.

salling group is a large company and it is 
our responsibility to ensure we take care of 
everyone. we provide the framework needed 
to ensure good working conditions for our 
employees. these include:
gender equality 
gender should not define the position you 
are employed in or your opportunities. both 
genders must be given equal opportunities re-
gardless of ethnicity, religion and background. 
it is a fundamental value of salling group that 
everyone should have the opportunity to fulfil 
their potential and be supported in achieving 
their own ambitions.
our ambition was that women should hold 
20% of director level positions and higher by 
2020. we did not quite achieve this goal, but 
we are on track. at the end of the year, the 
share was 17%. likewise, 40% of our board 
members must be women by 2025. at the 
end of 2020, 20% of our board members  
were women. 
zero tolerance for sexism
we have zero tolerance for sexism and abu-
sive behaviour at salling group. during the 
metoo debate in denmark in late summer, 
salling group’s ceo per bank encouraged all 
employees to come forward and report any 
abusive behaviour to him. 
whistleblower scheme
we strive to maintain and develop a healthy 
corporate culture, where our employees feel 
comfortable reporting any issues to their 
immediate manager.
 in addition to their immediate manager, em-
ployees can contact their health and safety 
representative and/or shop steward if one 
exists. they can also contact the hr depart-
ment or their manager’s manager. all reports 
are examined and dealt with professionally. 
the whistleblower scheme is mainly intended 
for the reporting of serious financial miscon-
duct and other serious incidents involving 
employees, such as sexual harassment and 
other abusive behaviour.
new collective agreement 
in 2020, a new collective agreement valid until 
2023 was negotiated. as part of the collective 
agreement, which comprises the majority of 
salling group’s employees, the contribution 
to the flexible spending account will increase 
from 4% to 7% up until 2023, the minimum 
wage will increase by dkk 401 for full-time 
employees, while giving families with children 
more flexibility with respect to their child’s 
second day of illness, time off for doctor’s 
appointments and parental leave. all adjust-
ments were made in may with retroactive 
effect as of 1 march 2020. 
inclusion 
at salling group, we recognise that we have 
a social responsibility towards society.
we strive to be an inclusive workplace with 
room for everyone, no matter who they are 
and where they are from. we are proud to 
create opportunities for those who may need 
a helping hand.
we reach out to fellow citizens who have diffi-
culty gaining a foothold in the labour market 
due to a stress diagnosis, long-term unem-
ployment, physical and mental disabi- 
lities, refugee status or other reasons.
we are sometimes criticised in the press for
our use of ‘unpaid trainee labour’. however,
the criticism is unfounded. in general we  
employ 47% of those who complete the  
internship and in our warehouses it is 67%.  
so we believe it is safe to say that the scheme 
is a success for both parties.

shopping with a clear conscience
responsible products 
shoppers do not just put groceries 
into their shopping basket – they 
also buy values. this means that we 
must ensure products with high an-
imal welfare, that we do not accept 
deforestation and child labour, avoid 
the use of pesticides and reduce pol-
lution. we strive to ensure that our 
products are sourced responsibly in 
terms of ingredients, production and 
transport. through external partner-
ships and recognised certifications, 
we work to raise the overall level of 
responsibility in the industry.
organic bananas
the pesticide chlorpyrifos is suspect-
ed of harming the mental develop-
ment of foetuses and children. we 
have therefore banned the use of 
the pesticide in our products. unfor-
tunately, chlorpyrifos is used in many 
conventional banana plantations. 
as a result, in 2020 we made the 
decision to only sell organic bananas 
in bilka, føtex and netto. 
more sustainable palm oil
palm oil is a widely used vegetable 
fat because it has a high melting 
point, a neutral flavour and is cheap. 
palm oil is found in many foods, 
near-food and non-food items. 
it is important that the production of 
palm oil does not lead to deforesta-
tion, loss of biodiversity nor should 
it have adverse social implications 
for the workers. today, most palm 
oil is produced in malaysia and 
indonesia – two countries that are 
already on amfori bsci’s list of high-
risk countries. as a result, social and 
environmental challenges are not a 
new phenomenon in these coun-
tries. however, we do not believe 
that boycotting products containing 
palm oil is the answer to the prob-
lem. instead, we must ensure more 
responsible palm oil production for 
both people and the environment. 
salling group has been working for a 
more sustainable supply chain since 
2014 by only accepting rspo-certified 
palm oil in our private label brands. in 
2020, we became a signatory to the 
danish alliance for responsible palm 
oil, facilitated by dansk initiativ for 
etisk handel (dieh). today, about  
65% of danish palm oil imports are 
sustainably produced, and the alli-
ance is working to make all palm oil 
imported into denmark sustainable. 
traceability of flowers and plants
flowers are beautiful and bring joy 
to our life and at special occasions. 
however, flowers also have a nega-
tive climate impact, and production 
takes place in countries where there 
is a risk of poor working conditions. 
in 2020, we mapped all in-scope 
growers in the flower and plant 
supply chain. by the end of 2020, we 
required all tier 1 plant growers to 
be at least mps abc-certified – or to 
be in the process of obtaining similar 
certification. the goal for 2021 is 
for all tier 1 suppliers to be audited 
according to a gap programme and 
ensure high environmental stand-
ards while continuing our work to 
improve the supply chain for flowers 
and plants. one of the tools is full 
traceability. 
focus on tanneries 
the leather industry is one of the 
most polluting industries in the 
world. not only in terms of the 
environment, because tanning is 
highly polluting, but also in terms 
of the impact on the health of the 
local community and workers when 
hazardous chemicals are used.
our two focus areas in this area 
are greater traceability and trans-
parency of the leather used in the 
products. in 2019, we expanded our 
genuine leather policy to include 
the next link in the supply chain as 
part of our responsible procurement 
process. now all in-scope suppliers 
are required to submit both social 
and environmental audit documen-
tation for all tanneries used by the 
end of 2020. this also applies to our 
reusable leather and tier 2 tanner-
ies. this work continues in 2021, with 
a focus on ensuring even greater 
transparency and improvements in 
the tanneries used. however, we are 
aware that the work poses consider-
able challenges and takes time.

our goal is a more sustainable 
soya production
soya is widely grown in south america and is a 
major contributor to increasing deforestation,  
especially in the amazon and cerrado biomes, 
which are rich in biodiversity.
in denmark, soya is mainly used in animal feed 
for meat and dairy production. research at the 
university of copenhagen has found that one kilo 
of soya imported from argentina to denmark has 
a carbon footprint of almost 5 kg (co2).
complex puzzle 
salling group plays an essential role in ensuring 
that products containing soya are produced in a 
more sustainable manner that does not lead to 
deforestation. at the same time, we are aware that 
we cannot achieve the desired results alone as  
we are a small piece in the complex global soya 
puzzle. in 2019, we therefore teamed up with oth-
er danish retailers and stakeholders to found the 
danish alliance for responsible soya, facilitated by 
the danish ethical trading initiative – an organisa-
tion we joined several years ago. in line with the 
alliance’s goal of moving towards importing only 
sustainable soya, we have developed an action 
plan which was published in april 2020 and has 
since been under implementation.
new certification goals 
the action plan focuses on the areas of our soya 
value chain where we can make the biggest differ-
ence. the goal is for all in-scope products to have a 
third-party sustainable soya certification scheme in 
place by the end of 2020. 
the work on sharing knowledge with the soya  
alliance and other partners continues in 2021. 
at the moment, we accept credits because we 
want to contribute to increasing the demand 
for verified sustainable production of deforest-
ation-free soya. however, our goal is to use only 
physically certified soya by 2025. we are in the 
process of calculating the actual soya quantities to 
ensure full traceability throughout our value chain. 
a challenging task that gives us important insight 
into our soya supply chain and the substantial  
traceability gap we need to close to achieve our 
goal for physically certified soya by 2025. 
our goal is 
to use only physically 
certified soya 
by 2025

making clothes more 
 
sustainable
vrs is salling group’s own clothing brand for the 
whole family and is available at bilka and føtex. 
climate-friendlier materials and less clothing waste 
are long-standing focus areas for us. in 2020, we 
took another important step with the development 
of a new csr strategy for textiles.
responsibility is about much more than produc-
tion. we strive to ensure responsibility throughout 
the value chain, from the design of the clothes and 
the choice of materials to when the used clothes 
are responsibly recycled or reused. 
when it comes to the choice of materials, we are 
committed to exploring new materials and reused 
materials. the demand for cotton clothing is, 
however, very high among our customers. conse-
quently, responsible cotton production is a very 
important area for us.
the cotton dilemma 
the dilemma is that cotton has a larger climate 
footprint than other textiles. this used to present 
a significant challenge, but now it is possible to 
buy organic cotton which has a climate impact 
that is as much as 60% lower than that of conven-
tional cotton. this is the type of cotton we use for 
our vrs brand. in 2020, organic cotton products 
accounted for 32% of our total vrs textile sales. 
we expect this share to grow in future. gots cer-
tification guarantees responsible organic cotton 
production throughout the supply chain. 
in 2020, gots-certified products accounted  
for 67% of all our organic cotton products.
focus on clothing waste
the fashion industry is characterised by chang-
ing wardrobes and new trends which can lead to 
overproduction, overconsumption and clothing 
waste. with fewer annual collections and the 
expansion of vrs’s range of basics for the whole 
family, we ensured greater continuity in produc-
tion and in our stores in 2020. the changes were 
welcomed by our customers. we want to inspire 
our customers to make more sustainable choices 
when shopping for clothes by launching cam-
paigns and providing clear labelling information 
on products and in our stores. 
recycling reduces clothing waste
through our collaboration with danchurchaid, 
our customers can donate used clothing by put-
ting it in clothing containers placed next to our 
stores. some of the used clothing is sold in sec-
ond-hand shops to support danchurchaid’s work, 
while the rest is distributed to charities around 
the world. surplus items from our production 
and stores are also donated to charity. items 
which cannot be donated are sent on for further 
processing and the fibres are recycled in different 
productions.
salling department stores and  
future fashion award 
in september, salling department stores held 
denmark’s first awards ceremony to celebrate 
designers and entrepreneurs forcusing on 
sustainability, the future fashion award. the 
artikel brand won the award for its focus on 
overproduction in the industry and desire to 
create durable unisex everyday clothing and 
collections with a long life cycle.

many consumers are very concerned about animal 
welfare and therefore choose high animal welfare 
products when they shop. we want to motivate 
our customers and suppliers to make choices that 
promote higher animal welfare. we are aware that 
there is a animal welfare-climate footprint dilem-
ma in several areas. that is why we are working on 
initiatives that encourage our customers to eat less 
but better quality meat. 
we guide our customers on animal welfare 
we work with animal protection denmark to  
constantly improve the level of animal welfare.
the collaboration is aimed at both producers and 
customers.
the ‘recommended by animal protection den-
mark’ label helps consumers find foods produced 
to the highest standards of animal welfare. 
the animal welfare label with 1, 2 or 3 hearts is the 
customer’s guarantee that the animals have had 
better living conditions than conventionally pro-
duced animals. the animal welfare label is subject 
to state control.

new ambition for fast-growing chickens 
salling group is denmark’s largest retailer of high 
animal welfare chickens, with high welfare chick-
ens from løgismose and ‘de danske familiegårde’ 
making up a considerable share of our product 
range and sales. 
we want to help raise animal welfare across the 
entire industry. as a result, we set a concrete am-
bition in 2020 to increase the share of slow-grow-
ing chicken breeds by introducing new products 
and motivating customers to choose higher 
animal welfare products. we strive to ensure that 
fast-growing chickens are eventually phased out, 
but it requires that our customers also join us on 
this journey.

mapping our value chains is a continuous, 
time-consuming and challenging process. this is 
because the value chains are complex and involve 
a number of technical issues, but also because 
not all suppliers are forthcoming when it comes to 
sharing sensitive production information.
agriculture 
almost all products found in our stores are from 
primary production, which has numerous envi-
ronmental implications. these include not only 
deforestation, loss of biodiversity and water scar-
city but also human rights, forced labour and child 
labour, the health and safety of workers and the 
rights of migrant workers. 
salling group has adopted the globalg.a.p. 
standard which focuses on good agricultural 
practice and comprises significant environmen-
tal requirements. the globalg.a.p. standard 
helps us to improve supply chain transparency – 
which is essential to our due diligence efforts.
social
in 2020, we expanded the transparency require-
ment to include fish farming and fishing boats for 
all fish and seafood suppliers. while much of our 
seafood comes from regions close to denmark, 
some products such as prawns are produced in 
high-risk countries. in these cases, we need to 
ensure that labour rights and worker safety are 
respected. 
environment
we continuously assess the possibilities of improv-
ing environmental performance in our agricultural 
supply chains. we have a particular focus on fresh 
fruits and vegetables, especially avocado produc-
tion, which requires large amounts of water. we 
are exploring the possibility of implementing 
globalg.a.p.’s water management programme 
spring in our avocado supply chains.

agents 
a significant part of our supply chain is made up 
of agents. our experience shows that the more 
agents there are in the supply chain, the more 
difficult it becomes to ensure transparency all the 
way back to the primary production. in addition, 
traders in the supply chain often focus on prices 
and logistics which can make it difficult to drive 
sustainability initiatives in multi-agent supply 
chains. 
traceability checks 
our suppliers provide information and docu-
mentation on production sites and whether they 
comply with our social and environmental require-
ments. to verify the validity of the information, 
we check the documentation to confirm that 
the information provided by the supplier on the 
manufacturer in question is correct. in 2020, the 
supplier checks have not been as frequent as in 
previous years, mainly due to covid-19. we hope 
to increase the number of supplier checks again in 
2021.
capacity building with suppliers
in recent years, we have significantly increased 
our capacity building activities with our suppliers, 
especially for those that import high-risk products 
with very complex supply chains. we consider it 
vital to put social and environmental sustainability 
high on the agenda of cooperation with our sup-
pliers. this approach has been essential to achieve 
greater transparency in our processed tomato 
supply chain and to implement social and environ-
mental standards in a sector that has historically 
been relatively unaffected by market-based sus-
tainability standards. this work has been ongoing 
in 2020 and will continue in 2021.
production/packaging 
many of our non-food and textile products in par-
ticular are produced in high-risk countries. in these 
countries, worker health and safety, fair working 
hours and building safety are some of the most 
prominent social problems which we address 
through our work and use of social compliance 
procedures. 
in addition to focusing on social aspects, we are 
increasingly looking into ways to improve environ-
mental performance at the factories in our supply 
chains, most recently by exploring ways to apply 
amfori’s business environmental performance 
initiative (bepi) to selected product groups.

building safety
building safety is a major challenge 
in high-risk countries, where most 
of our non-food and textile prod-
ucts are produced. the problem 
was highlighted by the rana plaza 
accident in bangladesh in 2013 
where the collapse of a garment 
factory resulted in the death of 
1,127 people.
since 2013, we have been a signatory 
to the bangladesh accord, which was 
established to draw attention to build-
ing and worker safety at garment fac-
tories in bangladesh. in may 2020, the 
bangladesh accord was transferred to 
a new organisation, readymade gar-
ments sustainability council (or rsc), 
and we are monitoring developments 
closely. 
environment
genuine leather
the leather industry is one of the 
most toxic industries in the world, 
both when it comes to environ-
mental impact and the impact on 
the health of communities and 
workers. the tanneries used in 
leather manufacturing are par-
ticularly vulnerable as they are 
usually located in high-risk coun-
tries and because large amounts of 
chemicals are used in the tanning 
processes. 
tanneries are often found further 
down the supply chain, making 
traceability and transparency sig-
nificantly more complex.
in 2020, we introduced an expand-
ed genuine leather policy to ensure 
greater traceability in our leather 
supply chain and to extend new social 
and environmental requirements to 
tanneries in the supply chain. the 
aim is to ensure continuous im-
provements at the tanneries, and we 
recommend to our leather manufac-
turers that they be inspected by one 
of the two market-leading auditing 
programmes in the sector: amfori’s 
bepi or leather working group (lwg).

food safety
improper food storage may 
pose a risk to food safety.
food safety includes food 
origin, including compliance 
with practices regarding food 
labelling and hygiene, addi-
tives and pesticide residues 
in order to avoid making 
consumers ill. poor food 
safety can affect a lot of peo-
ple, and in some cases food 
poisoning (from e.g. listeria 
and salmonella) can lead to 
deaths. foreign bodies in food 
can also endanger consumers 
(e.g. stones or glass).
third-party and internal checks of food, 
hygiene, preparation and storage in our 
stores and distribution centres.
netto germany is now reporting on the 
results of third-party food checks in its 
german stores.
due to covid-19, netto poland’s  
reporting system is not operational yet, 
but reporting is expected to start in 
early 2021. 
labour rights and work-
er health and safety
as a retailer, we offer a very 
wide range of products, re-
sulting in complex global sup-
ply chains. they often involve 
a number of risks related 
to human rights and labour 
rights. key risks include forced 
labour and child labour, fair 
wages and overtime in the 
textile and non-food sector as 
well as discrimination and the 
rights of migrant workers in 
the agricultural sector. 
the implementation of the amfori  
bsci code of conduct, salling group’s 
responsible procurement policy, as well 
as follow-up and monitoring of them.

water management
fresh water is essential to 
well-functioning operations 
throughout our supply chain. 
lack of water is a growing and 
widespread problem, and it 
has a direct effect on salling 
group’s supply chains, espe-
cially when it comes to the 
production of fresh produce.
we are exploring the possibility of 
applying globalg.a.p.’s add-on module 
spring to avocados. 
at the production level, we are looking 
into amfori bepi, starting with genuine 
leather.
deforestation
palm oil and soya are directly 
and indirectly used in many 
of our private label products. 
the production of these raw 
materials has some of the 
most harmful impacts on the 
climate and living conditions in 
local communities and results 
in loss of biodiversity in areas 
with high conservation value, 
especially in south-east asia 
and south america. 
in 2020, we joined the new danish alli-
ance for responsible palm oil and are 
in the process of updating our palm oil 
policy. the policy will be implemented 
in 2021.
as part of the danish alliance for re-
sponsible soya, we launched an action 
plan for sustainable soya in april 2020 
which has since been implemented. 
plastic
plastic often ends up in nature 
and especially in the oceans, 
where it poses a huge threat 
to marine life and biodiversity.
we raised our target for the use of 
recycled plastic in packaging on own 
brands from 30% to 40%.

employee accidents
at both our warehouses 
and stores, there is a risk of 
sudden accidents occurring in 
connection with the physical 
work involved in lifting boxes, 
slippery floors, using forklifts, 
knives, machines and tools.
thorough instruction to prevent acci-
dents. thorough and regular investiga-
tions into work accidents from the top 
level down to section level in each store 
and in all warehouses in order to prevent 
the same accident from happening again.
stress
our employees are at risk of 
suffering from stress. stress 
can affect the health of staff, 
reduce productivity and lead 
to employees taking time off 
or being on sick leave.
we seek to adapt the workload and the 
demands placed on our employees to 
their capacity and abilities. focus on the 
importance of early intervention, includ-
ing through pfa early care for employ-
ees who have joined pfa pension.
physical attrition
risk of physical attrition due 
to heavy lifting and moving 
or too much sedentary work 
may lead to a poorer quality 
of life, more frequent sick 
leave and higher employee 
turnover.
we seek to support job rotation, and em-
ployees with sedentary work are offered 
sit-stand desks.
the collective agreement for our stores 
makes it possible to convert current pen-
sion contributions and use the flexible 
spending account to pay for days off for 
senior employees.
staff diversity
a lack of focus on diversity can 
pose a risk to the company’s 
ability to attract and retain 
talent and drive innovation.
gender equality, for example, 
is therefore an important pa-
rameter.
as part of our efforts to appoint more 
women to senior positions, we held 
several workshops with a number of 
current female managers in 2019. the 
aim of these workshops was to identify:
•  which barriers – be they working 
conditions, working hours, workplace, 
culture, self-image etc. – discourage 
women from applying for more senior 
management positions and what it 
would take to remove these barriers
•  this work continued in 2020.
our employees are our most important resource, so we are committed to looking after 
them. therefore we take issues such as diversity, occupational health and safety, safety 
and health seriously.

goods and passenger 
transport
there is a risk of high carbon 
emissions from the transport 
of goods to and from our 
distribution centres as well 
as from driving in our own/
leased company cars.
we have in-sourced a number of logis-
tics tasks that optimize the product’s 
path from warehouse to store and thus 
reduce co2 emissions.
global warming poten-
tial (gwp)
global warming as a result 
of the use of refrigerants in 
cooling units.
the replacement of older cooling systems  
has been a priority since 2017 and we 
expect our central cooling systems to be 
freon-free by the end of 2025. 
energy consumption
unless our energy consump-
tion is under control, and if 
efforts are not being made to 
introduce sustainable/green 
solutions, there is a greater 
risk of excessive carbon emis-
sions.
in connection with the renovation and 
upgrading of light sources, we now use 
2nd generation led.
food waste
land, water, labour and other 
valuable resources are all used 
to produce the food we waste. 
in addition, food waste is a 
major source of greenhouse 
gas emissions, primarily in the 
form of methane.
our collaboration with denmark against 
food waste, under the auspices of the 
danish ministry of food, agriculture 
and fisheries/danish ministry of the 
environment, continues. netto started 
a collaboration with ‘too good to go’ in 
both denmark and germany.
business travel (flights)
the use of air travel rather 
than other means of transport 
contributes to increased carbon 
emissions and potentially  
increased global warming.
through our business travel partner, 
amex global, we have obtained report-
ing which shows the number of flown 
kilometres, destinations and the co2 
value of each ticket in order to highlight 
our climate impact.

tax
at salling group, we recognise that taxes are 
an important resource which can help improve 
public services and investment and thereby 
contribute to the fulfilment of the sdgs. 
our tax payments contribute not only to  
meeting sdgs 3, 12 and 13, which are the ones 
we primarily address, but also target 16.61.  
in the countries in which we operate, the goals 
help generate revenue for governments and 
organisations to enable them to improve social 
welfare and innovation, solve social problems 
and promote responsible social and environ-
mental conduct. 
our approach to tax is guided by our tax  
policy2, which is approved by the board of 
directors. 
commercial and legal considerations
we constantly strive to comply with the tax 
laws of the countries in which we operate, and 
we only use business structures driven by com-
mercial and legal considerations. in addition, 
we strive to maintain good relations with the 
tax authorities based on mutual respect, trans-
parency and trust. we also engage in construc-
tive dialogue with national and international 
governments and business groups to promote 
the development of efficient tax systems and 
tax administrations.
we have operating companies in denmark, 
germany and poland, but most of our activity 
takes place in denmark. 
according to the company’s published tax filing 
for 20193, f. salling holding a/s, the adminis-
trative tax unit of salling group, is the 23th  
1. developing efficient, responsible and transparent institutions 
2. https://storage.sallinggroup.com/media/2622/tax.pdf
3. we report 2019 figures as the 2020 figures were not available for all formats and countries at the time of publication of this report
4. the calculation is made in accordance with the standardised overall tax contribution method. 
5.  netto sweden was sold in the 2019 financial year and, consequently, the 2019 amounts are exclusive of sweden.  
in the 2018 financial year, the group’s total tax contribution was dkk 7,362m excluding sweden (dkk 7,711m including sweden)
largest corporate tax payer in denmark with  
a total tax payment of dkk 299m. f. salling  
holding a/s is responsible for making all  
corporate tax payments to the authorities on 
behalf of the danish companies in the group.
total tax payment
in 2019, the group’s total tax contribution4 
amounted to dkk 7,349m compared to 
dkk 7,362m in 20185 (dkk 7,711m including 
sweden). this includes taxes indirectly paid  
by our company (taxes collected), such as vat 
and employee income tax, as well as taxes 
directly paid (taxes incurred) such as corporate 
tax and property tax. 
taxes and duties collected
taxes and duties collected comprise vat, 
withholding taxes and excise duties. the vat 
amount is calculated as a net vat payment to 
the state, i.e. vat on sales less vat on purchases.  
excise duties collected in denmark (for exam-
ple on chocolate and alcohol) are only included 
for imported goods as excise duties on locally 
produced products are paid to the authorities 
by the manufacturing companies.
direct taxes and duties
the group’s own taxes and duties comprise  
corporate taxes, energy taxes, environmental 
taxes and property taxes. 
corporate taxes make up most of the group’s 
own taxes and duties (58%). the total corporate 
tax payment of the danish companies in the 
group amounted to dkk 299m. in addition,  
corporate taxes totalling dkk 76m were paid by 
the group’s companies outside denmark.

the degree of assurance expressed in the conclu-
sion is limited.
management’s responsibility
salling group’s management is responsible for the 
preparation of the csr report in accordance with 
the reporting approach and criteria described on 
pages 103-111. salling group’s management is 
also responsible for such internal control as the 
management considers necessary to enable the 
preparation of the csr report free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to conclude on salling 
group´s csr report on the basis of our proce-
dures. we performed our procedures in accord-
ance with isae 3000, “assurance engagements 
other than audits or reviews of historical financial 
information” and additional requirements under 
danish audit legislation to obtain limited assur-
ance for our conclusion.
ernst & young godkendt revisionspartnerselskab 
is subject to the international standard on quality 
control (isqc) 1, and thus uses a comprehensive 
quality control system, documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical re-
quirements, professional standards and applicable 
requirements in danish law and other regulations.
we comply with independence requirements and 
other ethical standards under fsr - danish audi-
tors’ code of ethics for professional accountants, 
which rely on general principles regarding integri-
ty, objectivity, professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality and professional conduct.
procedures:
as part of our examination, we performed the 
below procedures:
•   interviews of relevant company professionals 
responsible for csr strategy, management and 
reporting located at salling group’s headquar-
ters in aarslev, denmark, netto’s headquarters 
in køge, denmark, and netto’s international 
offices in poland and germany.
•   checks of whether data have been collected, 
assessed and quality-reviewed as prescribed in 
salling group’s manual for data collection.
•   analytical reviews, including trend analyses, of 
data supplied by salling group.
•   evaluation of the appropriateness of account-
ing policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by management.
we believe that our procedures provide a reasona-
ble basis for our conclusion.
the procedures performed in connection with our 
examination are less than those performed in con-
nection with a reasonable assurance engagement. 
consequently, the degree of assurance for our 
conclusion is substantially less than the assurance 
that would have been obtained had we performed 
a reasonable assurance engagement.
limited assurance conclusion
based on the procedures performed and the evi-
dence obtained, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that salling group’s csr 
report for the year ending 31st december 2020 
has not been prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the reporting approach and crite-
ria described on pages 103-111.

management statement
scope of the csr report
the csr report covers relevant and significant so-
cial, ethical and environmental issues for the finan-
cial year 1 january to 31 december 2020. we have 
received recommendations on our csr activities 
and reporting from our auditors ernst & young.
delimitation
entities included in the performance data in-
clude majority-owned subsidiaries/business units 
defined as companies that salling group owns or 
controls, including online stores, salling depart-
ment stores, bilka, føtex, netto, br, wupti.com  
and netto germany and poland. properties owned 
by salling group are excluded from both this  
and future reports, as are the franchises carl’s jr. 
and starbucks.
energy data
both majority-owned and controlled entities 
opened and closed during the financial year are in-
cluded in the reporting. if a store is opened during 
a reporting period, and the opening date is after 
the reporting start date, the store will be reported 
with an annual consumption of zero. if a store has 
data during a reporting period, and the opening 
date is before the reporting start date, the store’s 
consumption will be estimated until data acqui-
sition is established. if a store is closed after the 
reporting start date, consumption will be reported 
until the store is actually closed, and estimated for 
the rest of the period. estimates for stores with 
missing data have been prepared on the basis of 
yearly averages of comparable stores within the 
same retail chain and country. estimates in føtex 
account for 1.48%, in bilka 0.0%, in salling 1.42%, 
in netto denmark 7.69% and in br 42.91% of the 
total energy consumption for each chain. in netto 
outside denmark, estimates in germany account 
for 0.0%, and in poland 0.0%.
water data
both majority-owned and controlled entities 
opened and closed during the financial year are 
included in the reporting. if a store is opened 
during a reporting period, and the opening date 
is after the reporting start date, the store will be 
reported with an annual consumption of zero. if a 
store has data during a reporting period, and the 
opening date is before the reporting start date, the 
store’s consumption will be estimated until data 
acquisition is established. estimates for stores with 
missing data have been prepared on the basis of 
yearly averages of comparable stores within the 
same retail chain and country. estimates in føtex 
account for 9.41%, in bilka 0.76%, in salling 0.0%, 
in netto denmark 15.0% and in br 63.25% of total 
water consumption for each chain. in netto out-
side denmark, estimates in germany account for 
0.0% and in poland 0.0%
waste data
both majority-owned and controlled entities 
opened and closed during the financial year 
are included in the reporting. some stores have 
reported based on estimates. estimates in føtex 
account for 1.92%, in bilka 0.0%, in br 20.21%, 
in salling 0.0% and in netto denmark 0.55% of 
the total waste for each chain. in netto outside 
denmark, estimates in germany account for 
11.4%, in poland 0.0%. for netto germany, 
waste has been calculated based on a total of 
80 weighing samples throughout 2018 in eight 
sample stores. the estimates for the remaining 
stores in germany have been calculated on the 
basis of the average amount of waste per unit of 
revenue for the selected stores. for stores in netto 
poland, the waste calculation has been prepared 
on the basis of the exact number of containers 
multiplied by an average weight per container.

contents
construction waste resulting from the establish-
ment of new stores or major renovation projects 
is generally disposed of by the relevant contrac-
tors, and is thus not included in the waste data.
supplier satisfaction survey
the supplier satisfaction survey has been con-
ducted in cooperation with ramboll management 
consulting a/s. the invited respondents represent 
the list of regular suppliers to our danish stores 
(except salling) with whom we conduct trade term 
negotiations on a yearly basis.
supplier risk screening
supplier risk screening is conducted by means  
of our responsible procurement system (rps).
the system registers information on producers 
and documentation on social audits and/or suppli-
er certifications for our private label products and 
for unbranded products. the system uses a colour 
code, where green means that all the necessary 
audit documentation is in place, yellow means that 
it is in progress and red means that improvements 
are needed. no colour means that the supplier has 
not yet completed its profile and as a result it has 
not been assigned a colour code. 
food waste
food waste is calculated in tonnes and origi-
nates from our stores and distribution centres in 
denmark, germany and poland. the calculation 
is based on the number of stated units multiplied 
by the net weight. in the bakery category, in-store 
wastage has been added, as has the fruit and vege-
tables category in netto denmark. 
if the net weight of a given product is missing, we 
have used the average weight for other products 
in that category. the target baseline for denmark 
is calculated on the basis of our market share in 
2014 relative to the danish ministry of the environ-
ment’s calculations of the retail trade’s food waste 
in tonnes in 2014. the target baseline for netto in-
ternational is based on actual calculations of actual 
data from 2018. estimates in denmark account for 
0.1%, in germany 1.7% and in poland 0.03%.
inbound transport
the calculation of cubic metres for inbound trans-
port is based on inbound freight by all modes of 
transport, i.e. sea, air, road and rail. the data is 
derived from internal statistics and invoices from 
freight carriers. rail transport is calculated on the 
basis of data/methodology for road transport. 
tax footprint
taxes and duties collected include vat, income 
tax withheld from employees’ wages and excise 
duties. the vat amount included is calculated as 
the net vat payment to the state, i.e. vat on sales 
less vat payable. collected excise duties in den-
mark (for example on chocolate and alcohol etc.) 
are only included for imported goods, as excise 
duties on locally produced products are paid to 
the authorities by the manufacturers. our direct 
taxes comprise corporate taxes, energy taxes, 
environmental taxes and property taxes. most of 
the taxes and duties paid fall under corporate tax.
carbon footprint – scope 1
fuel and leased company cars
petrol and diesel consumption measured in litres 
and multiplied by british defra’s respective emis-
sion conversion factors (2020).
refrigerants
consumption of the refrigerants co2, r134 and 
r404 measured in kilos and multiplied by british 
defra’s respective emission conversion factors 
(2020).
natural gas
consumption of gas for heating measured in kwh 
and multiplied by the iea’s emission factor for 
natural gas (2020).
oil
consumption of heating oil measured in kwh and 
converted into litres and multiplied by british de-
fra’s oil emission conversion factor (2020).
carbon footprint – scope 2
electricity consumption
electricity consumption in denmark is measured 
in kwh and multiplied by the energi danmark 
group’s general emission conversion factor (2019), 
while for germany and poland it is measured in 
kwh and multiplied by the iea’s relevant emission 
conversion factor (2019 - table “iea (2020) emis-
sions factors”).
heat
heat consumption in denmark is measured in gj 
and multiplied by hofor – greater copenhagen 
utility’s general district heating conversion emis-
sion factor in the capital region (2019), while for 
germany and poland it is measured in kwh and 
multiplied by the iea’s relevant emission conver-
sion factor (2019 - table “iea (2020) emissions 
factors”).
carbon footprint – scope 3
outbound transport denmark
the calculation of carbon emissions only concerns 
outbound transport in denmark controlled by 
salling group. outbound transport is the trans-
port of goods from our distribution centres to our 
stores in denmark, and the emissions (excl. frozen 
pallets for bilka and føtex) are calculated on the 
basis of the number of kilometres driven, the car-
bon emission factor per kilometre and the number 
of pallets. the carbon emission factor is calculated 
on the basis of the number of kilometres driven 
per litre of diesel by haulier frode laursen. esti-
mates account for 1-3% based on the calculated 
co2 for most of our outbound transport.
outbound transport germany and poland
outbound transport is the transport of goods from 
our distribution centres to our stores in poland 
and germany. the transport is handled by a third 
party, which is responsible for calculating the  
carbon emissions.
flight mileage denmark 
flight mileage is based on reports from american 
express global business travel’s ghg emissions 
database, which monitors companies’, including 
salling group’s, carbon footprints based on the 
number of kilometres flown and the emission fac-
tors for the individual tickets/destinations based 
on the british government’s conversion factors 
(2020).
food waste denmark
the calculation is based on the data template  
produced by carbon trust advisory ltd, (2019). 
the model calculates the carbon footprint per 
food category based on the waste weight and 
emission factor of the category. average factors 
have been used for transport.
  
we report on 23 key areas. kpis, with definitions
