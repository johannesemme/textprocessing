2020 was an exceptional year. a year that 
forced us all to rethink our ways of living, 
working and socialising. while covid-19 has 
posed a threat to our health and how we 
organise our society, it has also posed an 
opportunity to rethink how we can act as 
responsible citizens and organisations and 
create value for each other.
in 2020, we witnessed how digital solutions 
and digital readiness tied societies and peo-
ple together in an unforeseen way. by utilis-
ing all conceivable technical and virtual tools 
available, authorities and companies have 
kept their wheels running. at netcompany, 
we felt committed to contributing by devel-
oping digital tools to help authorities moni-
tor and fight the spread of covid-19. 
looking across the world, there is no doubt 
that today’s digital opportunities have been 
crucial in ensuring that we find ourselves in 
a far better position today than we might 
have feared.
there is no doubt that digitisation is key in 
meeting the challenges we face as a global 
community, whether caused by political 
forces, climate change, or an unforeseen 
pandemic. in this way, 2020 has shown just 
how important it is that we develop strong, 
sustainable societies fit for the digital age. 
this is what we wish to contribute to each 
day at netcompany. throughout their lives, 
millions of citizens make use of netcompany 
services. this puts great responsibility on us 
as a company. responsibility for the solu-
tions we bring to societies and citizens. and 
responsibility for pushing the digitisation of 
societies forward in favour of our citizens. 
in order to do this, we must have a strong 
and sustainable organisation. this is why we 
put great emphasis on being a trustful and 
transparent it partner and employer. we act 
responsibly when it comes to our environ-
mental footprint, the well-being and oppor-
tunities of our employees, and the quality of 
our solutions to clients. 
by collaborating with companies, authori-
ties, and educational and political institu-
tions, i believe that we can find innovative 
and applicable solutions, thereby contribut-
ing to the un’s 17 sustainable development 
goals. by developing even more skilled it 
talents each year and educating society, we 
help create the foundation upon which the 
future world will be built. this way, i believe 
that netcompany as a responsible it part-
ner, can help make a real difference to socie-
ties, businesses, the environment, and our 
common future.

ingful to netcompany. our key figures are presented 
in our esg report as well as our annual report and

defined as all group companies, and where necessary, 
the individual companies are referred to by the 
countries they are located in.

as a corporate citizen, we enable 
digital societies.  
we want to share our 
extensive knowledge 
and expertise
we invest heavily in our 
employees’ personal 
and professional skills
there is no doubt that digitisation is key to meet 
the challenges we face as a global community, 
whether caused by political forces, climate 
change, or unforeseen pandemics. 2020 has 
shown just how important it is that we develop 
societies fit for the digital age.
for more than 20 years, netcompany has helped 
create strong, sustainable societies. societies in 
which millions of citizens make use of digital ser-
vices throughout their lives.
as a good corporate citizen and prominent ena-
bler of safe, modern, and sustainable societies, 
we have the responsibility to contribute to even 
more connected and cohesive communities – for 
the benefit of citizens as well as businesses. our 
expertise helps build innovative solutions, each of 
which improve quality of life for everyday citizens 
and the conditions in which businesses operate.
one of the greatest challenges companies and 
societies face is a lack of digital competency. to 
remedy this, netcompany is committed to devel-
oping an even greater number of skilled it talent 
each year and supporting the education of soci-
ety. we will continue to share our extensive 
knowledge of, and expertise in, governmental 
digitisation with countries around the world in 
order to create more safe, sustainable, and mod-
ern communities. 
our green footprint
at netcompany, we continuously explore and 
focus on ways to reduce emissions across our 
ways of working. we do so as one company and 
in all of our 10 international locations.
as an it company, our talented employees are 
our primary resource. our business model is 
therefore free from energy-exhaustive produc-
tion methods; the kind that emit large amounts of 
co2 into the environment. increasingly, our digital 
solutions help facilitate co2 reduction in our cli-
ents’ businesses as well.
this is how we will help build the foundation for a 
greener and sustainable world for us all.

our sustainability strategy
in 2013, netcompany signed up to the un 
global compact principles for how compa-
nies’ work with corporate social responsibil-
ity (csr), solidifying netcompany’s dedica-
tion to act as a responsible partner of this 
world. it is our goal to continuously improve 
our esg efforts and promote the un’s 2030 
agenda for sustainable development, so 
that we may all stand united and help each 
other in fulfilling the un’s 17 sustainable 
development goals (sdgs).
un sustainable development goals
as an it service provider, netcompany’s pri-
mary impact on society is related to the use 
of labour forces, as netcompany does not 
have any physical production capacity and 
therefore also has a somewhat limited 
impact on the environment. for the same 
reason, we have chosen to focus our esg 
ambitions on the sdg targets 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 
12, 16, and 17.
in the following summary, each of the afore-
mentioned sdg goals will be presented 
along with the specific sdg targets that 
netcompany is dedicated to fulfilling, as well 
as a summary of netcompany’s activities that 
contribute to the realisation of the un goals.
united nations global compact
netcompany has always belived in the three pillars 
upon which the 10 un global compact principles are 
built: improving people's  quality of life,  fostering  
 equitable growth,  and  protecting the environment

ates hundreds of new jobs each year, 
even during the covid-19 pandemic in 
2020, contributing to the general educa-

utes to the overall reduction of the 
unemployment rate within the youth 
labour force.

the world is currently in the middle of a 
 significant revolution as digital  transformation 
is fundamentally changing societies,  businesses, 
and the way we live our lives.  
who we are  
and what we do
as a trusted strategic partner, netcompany 
can help businesses and societies succeed in 
this transformation and ensure that we build 
the framework for a sustainable future and 
success in a digital world.
we do so by delivering society and busi-
ness-critical it solutions that accelerate our 
public and private clients’ digital transforma-
tion through digital platforms, core systems 
and infrastructure services, throughout 
northern europe. we have a relentless focus 
on always delivering our projects on time, on 
budget, and within scope.
netcompany was founded in copenhagen, 
denmark in 2000. since then we have 
expanded rapidly, now employing more 
than 3,000 people across 10 offices in 6 
countries.
we deliver some of the most complex sys-
tems introduced recently in denmark – sys-
tems like the new system for child support, 
housing benefits, handling distressed chil-
dren and youth, the new debt collection sys-
tem for the danish tax authorities and the 
new digital schooling platform in denmark.
our vision for netcompany is to become a 
northern european leader in showing how 
digital transformation can create strong, 
sustainable societies, successful companies 
and improve the quality of life for all.

in 2020, we took a pivotal step towards this 
goal by introducing the netcompany 
govtech framework with the aim to bring 
our govtech expertise to even more socie-
ties. we are already on our way to achieving 
this, delivering solutions to several european 
governments.
at netcompany, we believe that it is not only 
our future as a company, but as a society, that 
depends on it talents creating groundbreak-
ing progress and innovation. this is why we 
engage in numerous initiatives aimed at get-
ting more young people interested in it and 
technology, continue to work hard to be an 
attractive workplace, and invest heavily in our 
employees’ personal and professional skills.

netcompany’s business model
netcompany operates with its own unique, 
established, repeatable and scalable busi-
ness model designed to deliver excellence in 
digital transformation on time, on budget 
and within scope through three key pillars: 
outstanding talent and  
career  development model 
netcompany’s it professionals are highly 
skilled, many coming from top universities 
with advanced it or science-related 
degrees. netcompany focuses on talent and 
career development through our acceler-
ated merit-based career development pro-
gramme which rewards top performers with 
accelerated progression through the various 
career stages from consultant to partner.
disruptive management model  
and integrated sales approach 
netcompany’s business model is focused on 
a decentralised management model with it 
people leading it people throughout all lev-
els of the organisation. netcompany 
employs an integrated sales and delivery 
approach whereby the same individuals 
responsible for selling it services to custom-
ers are also responsible for delivering the 
systems and solutions, maintenance, and 
operations. in addition, netcompany's risk 
assessment calculation, which is important 
when pricing, scoping, and committing to 
new projects, is based on an operational 
evaluation by netcompany's experienced it 
professionals.
unique, agile, deliverable-driven 
 methodology and toolkit
netcompany’s business model involves the 
use of an agile, transparent, and delivera-
ble-driven methodology and toolkit which we 
believe is unique. this methodology and 
toolkit provide a complete set of guidelines, 
tools, and templates for planning, delivering, 
managing, and documenting complex inte-
grated it solutions. it is used across all pro-
jects and throughout all stages, from devel-
opment to maintenance and operations. 
netcompany’s supporting toolkit includes 
stringent collaboration and approval pro-
cesses with customers, to ensure that 
netcompany and its customers have a firm, 
mutual and completely transparent under-
standing of all deliverables as well as the pro-
ject progress.
central to the business model is the commit-
ment to “always deliver”, supporting 
netcompany and its customers in success-
fully meeting their needs. through the con-
tinued focus on delivery – on time, on 
budget and at an agreed quality – 
netcompany has, during the last 20 years, 
consistently built a track record unrivalled in 
the industry. the capabilities to build such a 
track record lie in our continued focus on 
talent and talent development.

environment
at netcompany, we believe that one 
of the keys to solving the climate 
challenges and creating a sustainable 
future for us all, is through the digiti-
sation of society.  
we also acknowledge that there are many other 
non-digital initiatives that are equally important in 
the fight against climate change and may contrib-
ute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and the 
preserving of the environment. this is why we 
believe it is important to address both aspects.
compared to production companies, 
netcompany does not have a large impact on 
the environment, as we don’t use any fossil fuels 
or water in a production capacity. instead, our 
resources descend from our talented employees 
in the delivery of our services. for the same 
reason, many of our esg-related initiatives are 
also focused on the un sdgs concerning social 
responsibility, as we believe it is the area where 
we can make the biggest difference in society. 
nevertheless, we are also deeply invested in 
optimising and increasing our environmental 
efforts as we wish to take responsibility for our 
impact on the environment. 
we always seek to find new ways to reduce our 
environmental footprint and as described in our 
esg report for 2019, we have, as part of our 
green journey, initiated several environmentally 
friendly initiatives in our offices, such as move-
ment censors on water faucets in office bath-
rooms and use of energy efficient led lightbulbs. 
we will continue to seek out areas and initiatives 
where we can optimise and reduce 
netcompany’s resource consumption and 
impact on the environment with the ambition of 
realising a greener and more sustainable future 
for us all.

climate impact
as an it service provider, netcompany’s cli-
mate impact is somewhat limited, as our 
main services are provided by labour forces. 
regardless, we are responsible for our car-
bon footprint. therefore, we have spent the 
past year, since our last esg report, further 
mapping our climate impact and investigat-
ing newer and greener solutions that may 
reduce our environmental footprint.
digital sustainability
digital sustainability is much more than just 
the digitisation of manual work processes. it 
is about increasing digital effectiveness to 
maximum capability so that energy con-
sumption is minimised as much as possible. 
at netcompany, we put a lot of time and 
effort into optimising our digital effective-
ness, hereunder the effectiveness of our 
datacentre hardware. this includes, but is 
not limited to, regularly following up on any 
hardware equipment that has reached end of 
life and replacing it with newer and more 
energy efficient hardware. we make a great 
effort to have the best possible utilisation 
rate and no equipment is switched on with-
out having an important business function. 
further to this, we continuously update our 
algorithms for automation of our digital pro-
cesses, so that routines become faster and 
more efficient, subsequently leading to a 
lower energy consumption. we aim to have a 
very high level of virtualisation in our server 
environment, thereby gathering the most 
possible workloads on fewer energy con-
suming hardware elements. today, our virtu-
alisation rate is close to 95%.
renewable energy
netcompany’s largest impact on the envi-
ronment is related to our electricity con-
sumption which supports our employees’ 
use of electronic devices, as well as the elec-
tricity used in the different office locations 
for lighting, heating, etc. as part of our jour-
ney towards environmental sustainability, we 
wish to reduce our climate impact where it 
matters. in 2020, netcompany in denmark 
subsequently chose to change all of its elec-
tricity sources so that all electricity pur-
chased directly by netcompany denmark 
will derive solely from renewable energy 
sources going forward. in addition, 
netcompany netherlands also purchases 
their electricity from 100% renewable 
energy sources. in the upcoming year, we 
will further investigate the possibilities of 
changing to sustainable energy sources for 
the rest of our entities, so that all electricity 
purchases in netcompany may one day be 
100% sustainable.

direct ghg emissions  
(co2e scope 1)
direct ghg emissions (co₂e scope 1) 
include emissions that derive from 
netcompany’s own combustion of fossil 
fuels and materials.
netcompany does not use fossil fuels in any 
production capacity and therefore neither pro-
duces nor emits any direct ghg emissions in 
this regard. netcompany’s direct ghg emissions 
are therefore also restricted to fuel bought in 
relation to the company car scheme. most of the 
fuel consumption under the company car 
scheme relates to the employee’s private usage 
of the cars and should therefore – strictly speak-
ing – not be included under netcompany’s ghg 
emissions. we have, however, chosen to report 
on the consumption for full transparency. our 
direct ghg emissions are based on the emission 
factors from defra 2020 for the relevant fuel 
type. it is noted that some of the data is esti-
mated due to insufficient data and that some 
data has not been possible to retrieve. 
the numbers show that there has been a 
decrease in netcompany’s direct ghg emis-
sions of 0.02 tons/avg. fte in 2020 compared 
to the emissions in 2019. the reason behind this 
is that the number of ftes has increased over 
the past year subsequently minimising the over-
all consumption measured per average fte, as 
the actual usage has largely remained the same.
in our esg report 2019 we set a target of 
minimising our direct ghg emissions in 2020 
and with the registered decrease the target 
has been achieved. 
the majority of the cars that are covered by 
the company car scheme are leased and less 
than three years old, making sure that the 
respective cars are the newest and most 
energy efficient models on the market. 
netcompany’s transport policy encourages 
all employees to minimise fossil fuel trans-
portation as much as possible.
indirect ghg emissions  
(co2e scope 2)
indirect ghg emissions (co₂e scope 2) 
include emissions that derive from the energy 
used to produce electricity, district heating, 
and district cooling, which netcompany has 
purchased for its use, except electricity deriv-
ing from renewable energy sources.
netcompany’s indirect climate emissions are 
related to netcompany’s electricity usage on 
company premises, including the use of elec-
tronic devices and the heating and cooling of 
the office buildings, and external server facili-
ties located at third parties. for netcompany 
denmark the electricity emission factors are 
based on factors deriving from energinet as 
heating is based on hofor’s climate declara-
tion 2019, and emissions from cooling are cal-
culated using the electricity emission factors. 
for the rest of netcompany’s entities the 
emissions factors are based on iea 2019 fac-
tors (latest actual values). it is noted that the 
consumption for the month of december 
(and november for netcompany poland) has 
been estimated based on the average con-
sumption in the previous months of 2020.
 direct ghg

presentation of the numbers for 2020
in the following section, we will report on 
our climate impact for the year 2020 follow-
ing the recommended guidelines and calcu-
lation formulas issued by nasdaq. as some-
thing new, we will also be reporting on our 
climate impact deriving from aerial trans-
portation and mileages under co₂e scope 3. 
due to the rapid increase in our number of 
employees over the past years, we will con-
tinue to report on netcompany’s consump-
tion per average fte where applicable. 
the energy data for 2017-2019 presented in 
the esg report 2019 has been updated to 
reflect the amount of renewable energy as 
part of the co₂e scope 2 emissions in 
accordance with the nasdaq esg key indi-
cator guide. furthermore, minor correc-
tions and recalculations have been made, 
which is mainly due to more accurate con-
sumption data having been made available 
from non-danish locations, and a correc-
tion in relation to the company car scheme. 
netcompany’s climate target numbers have 
also been updated in accordance herewith, 
as the overall target for 2020 of minimising 
netcompany’s climate impact has remained 
the same.
it is noted that the numbers include data 
from the offices of netcompany 
netherlands, netcompany uk and 
netcompany vietnam from before they 
became part of the netcompany group.

all of netcompany’s it equipment is state-
of-the-art and some of the most energy effi-
cient devices on the market, which keeps 
the energy consumption as low as possible. 
also, a large proportion of netcompany’s 
employees are working directly from cus-
tomer locations, which also has a subse-
quent effect on netcompany’s indirect ghg 
emissions. going forward, netcompany will 
continue to investigate the possibilities of 
decreasing the company’s indirect ghg 
emissions, including changing to sustainable 
electricity sources where possible.
other indirect ghg emissions 
(co2e scope 3)
other indirect ghg emissions (co2e scope 
3) include emissions that derive from busi-
ness travel by flight and car.
netcompany is an international company 
located in six countries. to promote knowl-
edge sharing and to support the implemen-
tation of netcompany’s processes and 
methodologies, as well as to perform the 
quarterly roadshows in connection to the 
quarterly reports, business travel by plane 
and car is an inextricable part of 
netcompany’s business operations. in con-
nection hereto, and as something new, we 
have chosen to report on netcompany’s 
ghg emissions under the co₂e scope 3 
deriving from business travels by plane and 
car to provide even greater transparency on 
our climate impact. business travel by car 
for the employees covered by the company 
car scheme is not included under co₂e 
scope 3 as it is included under co₂e scope 1.
emissions deriving from business travel by car 
are based on mileage reimbursals. at the time 
of writing, data for the month of december was 
not yet available and has therefore been esti-
mated based on the average for the previous 
months of the year. emission factors are based 
on defra 2020 and an average car with 
unknown fuel type. the only exception for this 
is netcompany denmark, whose emission fac-
tors are based on the factors from the danish 
energy agency. emissions from ﬂights are 
based on data from netcompany’s travel 
agency, which uses the defra emission factor.
looking back on netcompany’s ghg emis-
sions from previous years, 0.09 tons/avg. 
fte was emitted in 2017, 0.44 tons/avg. fte 
was emitted in 2018 and 0.69 tons/avg. fte 
was emitted in 2019. as the numbers show, 
emissions significantly rose in 2018, which, 
among other reasons, is because of a lack of 
previous data regarding the fuel consump-
tion under the company car scheme in 2017. 
furthermore, netcompany netherlands was 
acquired in 2018 which entailed more travel-
ling activities by plane in that period to 
secure a proper integration of the office in 
the netcompany family. it is further noted 
that emissions deriving from aerial transpor-
tation have not been included in the data up 
until march 2018, as the previous travel 
agency that netcompany used did not regis-
ter ﬂight mileages. therefore, it has not 
been possible to determine the amount of 
ghg emissions up until that point.
for the year 2020, we have registered a drop 
of  42.86% in netcompany’s indirect ghg 
emissions going from 0,21 tons/avg. fte in 
2019 to 0.12 tons/avg. fte in 2020. the 
reduction in our consumption is for a large 
part attributed to the derived effects of the 
covid-19 crisis, where many of our employ-
ees has been required to work from home for 
a greater part of the year. further to this, the 
numbers have been updated to account for 
netcompany’s usage of renewable energy. 
due to the extraordinary situation with 
covid-19 it is difficult to register or conclude 
anything on the effect of our environmental 
efforts based on this year’s data. hopefully, 
the situation will normalise during 2021, so we 
may be able to better track the results of our 
efforts in the future. 
last year we set a target of minimising our 
indirect ghg emissions in 2020, which, as the 
numbers show, has formally been achieved. 
the achievement should, however, be mindful 
to the reasons behind, as described above. 
all of netcompany’s  it equipment  is  
 state-of-the-art  and some of the most 
energy efficient devices on the  market, 
which keeps the  energy  consumption   
 as low as possible 
24
esg report 2020
environment
this year our total energy consumption has 
dropped 31.55% to 4.99 gj/avg. fte, how-
ever, the drop is mainly attributed to the 
derived effects of the covid-19 crisis, where 
the majority of our employees have been 
working from home during the better part of 
the year, subsequently reducing the energy 
usage on netcompany premises. for the 
same reason, we also expect to see an 
increase in our consumption level once soci-
ety stabilises and all our employees are 
allowed back on company premises. the 
total energy consumption is calculated using 
conversions and fuel properties from 
defra.
in 2019, we set a target to minimise our total 
energy consumption and as the numbers 
show, this target has been achieved. the 
result should, however, be viewed in light of 
the covid-19 crisis, as this year’s numbers 
do not accurately depict netcompany’s nor-
mal energy consumption. 
renewable energy share
the share of renewable energy of 
netcompany’s total energy consumption.
to provide more transparency about 
netcompany’s environmental impact, we 
have chosen this year to report on the share 
of renewable energy that we use as part of 
netcompany’s overall energy consumption.
as the numbers show, there has been a ﬂuc-
tuation of 8.46% in the years 2017 – 2020 
with 65.10% of netcompany’s total energy 
consumption being renewable in 2017, 
64.93% being renewable in 2018, 73.23% 
being renewable in 2019, and 73.39% being 
renewable in 2020. the reason for the ﬂuc-
tuation is mainly found in the various levels 
of energy consumption in the different enti-
ties, where some entities have a lower/
higher share of renewable energy and have 
used more or less energy in a particular year. 
the share of renewable energy used by our 
different entities has, as such, largely 
remained the same throughout 2017 – 2020. 
the only changes have been in 2020, where 
netcompany uk expanded to a rented office 
space that does not use 100% renewable 
energy, and where netcompany denmark 
switched to 100% renewable energy sources 
for its direct electricity purchases.
water consumption
water consumption includes the sum of all 
water used from all sources such as spring 
water, surface water, and groundwater.
as an it service provider netcompany does 
not use water in a production capacity and 
netcompany’s water usage is therefore lim-
ited to the water consumption of our 
employees. this puts a natural limit on how 
much we are able to reduce the overall  
in 2019, ghg emissions rose again. at this 
point in time netcompany increased its 
focus on global mobility in the netcompany 
group, so that employees from different 
entities could meet each other, share knowl-
edge, and work closely together at different 
locations, with the purpose of making the 
netcompany organisation a more integrated 
and unified organisation. this also meant 
that the amount of business travel increased 
during this period.
in 2020, netcompany’s ghg emissions have 
decreased substantially to 0.19 tons/avg. 
fte. the decrease must primarily be viewed 
in light of the covid-19 crisis, where the 
majority of the aerial transportation has 
been shut down due to worldwide restric-
tions on international travelling. 
subsequently, this year’s decrease in ghg 
emissions does not depict netcompany’s 
ghg emissions under scope 3 accurately and 
emissions are expected to rise as aerial 
transportation once again becomes possible.
energy consumption
total energy consumption includes energy 
consumed under co₂e scope 1 and 2 and 
energy from renewable energy sources.
at netcompany, we are greatly invested in 
finding new and more energy efficient ways 
of doing business. this is to help both our-
selves and our customers to create a more 
sustainable foundation on which to build our 
businesses upon.

water consumption of  the company. to 
lower our consumption as much as possible 
we have, however, implemented a number of 
initiatives, such as two-ﬂush toilets and 
movement sensors on bathroom water fau-
cets in some of our offices. the total water 
consumption of netcompany is based on 
registered water usage from our different 
locations as well as bottled water.
overall, our water consumption has largely 
remained the same throughout 2017 – 2019. 
in 2020, there has been a decrease of 1.33 
m³/avg. fte compared to last year, with a 
water consumption of 3.28 m³ registered per 
average fte. the lower consumption level is 
caused by the effects of the covid-19 crisis, 
where many of our employees have been 
required to work from home, subsequently 
causing the consumption level on company 
premises to fall.
in last year’s esg report we set a target of 
minimising our water consumption. as the 
numbers show, the target has been 
achieved. it should, however, be taken into 
consideration, that most of our employees 
have been working from home for the larger 
part of the year due to the covid-19 crisis.
it is noted that our water consumption data 
does not exist for all our offices as some is 
currently not possible to retrieve and some 
has not been registered in previous years. 
data for the month of december (and 
november for netcompany poland and 
netcompany uk) has furthermore been esti-
mated based on the water consumption 
from previous months of 2020.

solutions in society
with new technologies and digital efficiency, 
it solutions hold the potential to fundamen-
tally change the way society works, redefin-
ing company business models and society  
at large.
netcompany’s work with digital solutions has 
contributed to digital transformation for 
many years and through this, indirectly sup-
ported the un sdgs by optimising customer 
systems and workﬂows, which in many cases 
has also led to a derived and positive effect 
on the environment. at netcompany, we are 
grateful to be able to work within a field 
where we are able to continuously contribute 
to the fulfilment of the un sdgs, while simul-
taneously enabling our customers to further 
pursue the path of sustainable growth.
car scrapping online
in less than 9 months, netcompany in 
denmark delivered a new it system called 
digital pay-out and scrapping certificate 
system, which enables danish citizens to 
scrap their cars online. the citizens are only 
able to choose from a list of authorised car 
scrappers, which ensures that the disposal 
of cars abides by all environmental require-
ments regulating the proper disposal of 
vehicles. at the same time, the system 
reduces the risk of tax evasion, as the scrap 
compensation is paid out directly to citizens. 
the system replaced a heavily manual pro-
cess with barely any it involved. it is 
expected that more than 90% of all cases 
are now handled without human interaction 
and the processing of each case has been 
reduced from an average of 2 weeks to less 
than 2 days. since its launch in the begin-
ning of 2020, more than 32,000 citizens 
have scrapped their cars online,  rendering 
the system a digital success. 
the bluefin tuna
in our fight against climate change it is impor-
tant that we learn to understand how the cli-
mate is changing and how it affects our natu-
ral surroundings. as an example, netcompany 
supports the danish technical university’s 
(dtu) research project on bluefin tuna, which, 
after more than 50 years of absence, has sud-
denly and without any obvious cause 
returned to danish waters. this has led to a 
number of questions, such as why it has 
returned and why it even left in the first place.

smarter airports
case story
in 2020, netcompany denmark and 
copenhagen airport announced their new 
joint digital adventure, smarter airports. 
the aim is to develop a new market-leading 
digital platform for the efficient and sustain-
able operation of airports all over the world.
using data, algorithms and artificial intelli-
gence, the smarter airports platform will 
provide new opportunities for mapping and 
integrating huge amounts of data on traffic 
handling, flight times, check-ins, and secu-
rity. it will operate as an intelligent ecosys-
tem to help all stakeholders optimise the 
planning and execution of the airports' daily 
operations. this will be done through the 
digital coordination of the airports' various 
tasks. every actor is notified about import-
ant information relating to its respective 
tasks, making it possible for the actor to 
adjust its services accordingly. this will, 
among other things, help avoid delays and 
unnecessary time spent by aeroplanes on 
taxiways. it will also make it possible to min-
imise energy consumption, e.g. in terminals 
that are not being used, which alltogether 
will lead to a reduction in the airport’s over-
all energy consumption and ghg emissions.
the smarter airports platform facilitates an 
effective business infrastructure that simul-
taneously minimises the airport’s resource 
consumption and the airport’s business 
costs. it shows how the integration of envi-
ronmentally sustainable operations may 
also lead to a potential increase in revenue. 
it further depicts the endless possibilities of 
digital sustainability which netcompany 
believes are vital for a green transition and 
the preservation of our environment.
by facilitating a more  effec-
tive  business infrastructure, 
smarter airports will enable 
airports all over the world to  
 reduce  their  climate impact

changes may happen. this is why we try to 
make a difference wherever we can and 
encourage all actions to be taken, no matter 
how big or small their impact may be. 
one example is our office in copenhagen, 
denmark which introduced a waste sorting 
scheme in the summer of 2020, whereafter 
biodegradable waste is sorted from non-bio-
degradable garbage, thus securing a responsi-
ble waste management. waste sorting 
schemes are also implemented in netcompany 
netherlands, norway, and poland, and will, in 
2021, further be implemented in the aalborg 
office in netcompany denmark. 
another example is our use of recycled paper 
and office supplies in our copenhagen and 
oslo offices and the fact that we in general 
have a very low consumption of paper and 
other office supplies, as the majority of our 
work is carried out on computers. in addition, 
netcompany netherlands also donates their 
used printer toners to a charity called aap, 
where the proceeds from the collected ton-
ers go to the shelter, recovery, and care of 
monkeys. furthermore, netcompany poland 
collects plastic caps and delivers them to a 
charity organisation that helps people with 
disabilities making the best possible use of 
what would otherwise be considered waste.
travelling
as part of netcompany’s travelling policy all 
employees are encouraged to minimise the 
use of modes of transport that are dependent 
on fossil fuels. to this end we have also 
installed tele and video communication solu-
tions at all of netcompany’s offices allowing 
personnel to make contact with customers 
and other netcompany employees from afar, 
without having to spend time and fossil fuels 
on travelling. netcompany’s offices are also 
located in the city centres, making it much 
easier for employees and customers to com-
mute via public transportation.
in addition to the above, netcompany in 
denmark, poland, and vietnam make bicy-
cles available to the employees to be used 
for business meetings close by, just as 
netcompany in denmark offers all employ-
ees a travelling card for public transporta-
tion. due to high demands, the bicycle park 
in one of our copenhagen offices has been 
expanded even further in 2020 with more 
bicycles having been made available to the 
employees. 
whenever travelling is required, the transporta-
tion method is chosen based on the local infra-
structure, the environmental output, and any 
significant interests of netcompany.
introducing waste 
sorting schemes 
across locations 
to answer these questions and many more, 
bluefin tuna are, among others, marked with 
advanced digital transmitters that register 
and send back information to the research-
ers about the tuna’s surrounding environ-
ment, such as water depth, temperature, and 
lighting. the data is then used to track 
where the tuna has been, where it feeds, and 
where it breeds. this is all important infor-
mation to better understand the life pattern 
of tuna and help their safe return to danish 
waters. the bluefin tuna project is just one 
example of how the use of technology and 
digital solutions may help us gather informa-
tion about our surrounding environment and 
help us cultivate a healthy ecosystem for the 
animal world.
waste management and recycling
as an it company we are expected to be a 
front runner when it comes to new digital 
solutions available on the market. for the 
same reason, we have a high usage of it 
equipment as we always need to stay on top 
of any new or improved functionalities to 
make these available to our employees so 
that they may programme and operate our 
it solutions to the best of their abilities. to 
secure a responsible waste management of 
our it equipment, we have implemented 
internal procedures to ensure that all out-
dated equipment is either sold, recycled, or 
properly disposed of. we have also estab-
lished business relations with a number of 
environmentally sustainable business part-
ners, such as a recycling company certified 
under the iso 14001 scheme who purchases

donating computers
case story
at netcompany, we always seek to find 
meaningful purposes for the use of any out-
dated equipment that may still be of use to 
others. this makes sense socially as well as 
environmentally.
when buttershaw bec school in leeds put 
out a call for help, netcompany uk did not 
hesitate to respond to their call. the 
buttershaw bec school has a large number of 
children from disadvantaged backgrounds 
without access to computers at home, and 
when educational facilities were shut down 
due to covid-19, this naturally posed great 
challenges to the students. netcompany’s 
donation of computers to the school gave 
several students the means to continue their 
learning and development as uninterrupted 
as possible, while at the same time facilitat-
ing responsible waste management.
netcompany uk also donated several com-
puters to the organisation the connection, 
which is a charity organisation that helps 
the homeless move away from, and stay off 
the streets of london. the computers are 
used to train the organisation’s employees 
and its service users in applying for govern-
ment grants, housing and employment 
opportunities.
another initiative that netcompany has sup-
ported with the donation of computers is the 
redi school initiative in denmark that offers 
free it courses to women with a different 
ethnical background to danish. the objective 
of the initiative is to create digital empower-
ment for women through the acquisition of 
digital skills and by supporting women in 
accessing a social and professional network.

netcompany’s negative impact on the envi-
ronment is overall quite low since we do not 
use any fossil fuels or water in a production 
capacity. still, we take climate change very 
seriously, just as we take great responsibility 
in contributing to positive and scalable 
results through our digital solutions in 
regard to both our own and our customers’ 
effect on the environment.
relative to our business as an it service pro-
vider, our environmental risks are primarily 
related to our suppliers, our high usage of it 
equipment, our internal procedures, and the 
compliance of our employees.
the risks imposed by our suppliers relate to 
their own environmental profiles, including 
their use of climate-friendly materials, 
sub-suppliers, and internal procedures. a 
possible derived effect of our suppliers' envi-
ronmental impact is that our profile might 
not be as green as we perhaps thought and 
aspire for it to be. this could potentially lead 
to reputational damages and a lack of incen-
tive for customers to choose us as their busi-
ness partner. as part of our journey towards 
an increasingly greener profile, and to miti-
gate risks, we have intensified our focus on 
our suppliers' environmental impact and 
started looking for greener alternatives 
where viable. 
although we believe in the responsible use 
of resources, we are not able to reduce our 
use of it equipment, as we need to provide 
our employees with state-of-the-art equip-
ment in order for them to create, operate, 
and support the best and most innovative 
digital solutions. this is to the benefit of our 
customers and subsequently our society. 
however, we have made sure to implement 
environmentally friendly waste management 
procedures, which include donating func-
tioning equipment to philanthropic purposes 
and cooperating with a responsible waste 
management partner who purchases and 
recycles old equipment. through these 
environmental risks
procedures we believe that the environmen-
tal risks imposed by our relatively high 
usage of it equipment are mitigated appro-
priately and to the best of our abilities.
the environmental risks in relation to our 
internal procedures and our employees 
relate to the non-compliance of our internal 
policies and guidelines. to mitigate these 
risks our employees are required to read and 
familiarise themselves with our policies, just 
as we plan internal campaigns to raise 
awareness.
the digital world holds the key to endless 
possibilities, many of which we are still yet 
to discover. going forward, we will continue 
to explore new and innovative digital solu-
tions with our suppliers and customers, 
doing our part to contribute to the estab-
lishment of a greener future for us all.

at netcompany, we believe that 
 digitising societies is key to sustaining 
future growth and prosperity in our 
societies.  
for 20 years, we have helped develop strong, 
sustainable societies. societies in which millions 
of citizens make use of netcompany services 
throughout their lives. this puts a responsibility 
on us that we do not take lightly. we know just 
how fundamental it solutions can be in making 
the everyday life of citizens go on as it should. 
getting access to health information, social ben-
efit payments, home/school information, and 
digital mail are just a few of the hundreds of 
society-critical solutions we deliver.
when it comes to public digitisation, denmark 
takes the lead. in this, netcompany has played a 
key role. and we want to share our extensive 
knowledge and expertise within governmental 
digitisation with other countries around the world.
responsibility for the solutions we bring to socie-
ties and citizens is one of the social commitments 
we take. pushing the digitisation of societies for-
ward is another. and this is important, as one of 
the main challenges facing society today is a lack 
of digital competencies. we want to share our 
knowledge, educate, and develop more digital 
talent and it leaders, and open the world of it up 
to even more people – regardless of gender or 
other social identity. this applies to netcompany 
as well. without the absolute best employees in 
the field, we cannot deliver on these commit-
ments. therefore, we do our utmost to attract 
and develop strong it talents and leaders.
we have an extensive development programme 
in place, ensuring our employees continue to 
develop throughout their career. we also have a 
strong focus on bringing more talent to our 
company, getting even more young people 
interested in the world of it. this is because we 
are convinced that it is these it talents who will 
make a real difference to our societies, busi-
nesses, environment, and our future.

building sustainable,  
scalable solutions
netcompany focuses on delivering society 
and business-critical it solutions to public 
and private clients to support them in their 
digital transformation journeys. our public 
clients offer end-to-end it services to cen-
tral and local governments. this includes tax 
collection, payments of public benefits to 
citizens (e.g. pensions, children/family, and 
property/housing), central registries for 
companies, properties, employees, and pub-
lic and health self-service portals.
our private clients offer end-to-end it ser-
vices to businesses, membership organisa-
tions and trade unions. we deliver busi-
ness-critical it solutions covering various 
areas such as e-commerce, billing, docu-
ment and case management, system inte-
gration, customer relationship management 
and enterprise risk management, artificial 
intelligence, and information management, 
very often combined.
at netcompany, we believe that with new 
technology and digitisation we can make a 
difference and positively impact people’s 
lives. for us, digitisation is about how to turn 
technological development into value for 
the people it affects.
today, we are an integral part of several of 
the societies we operate in, delivering solu-
tions that have a fundamental role in peo-
ple’s everyday life. by providing these ser-
vices, we are playing a key role in a modern, 
state-of-the-art, fair, and corruption-free 
administration of the societies we operate in.
in the following section of the report, you 
can read about some of our solutions and 
initiatives that have contributed to building 
strong, sustainable, and digitised societies.
limiting the impact of a 
worldwide pandemic
2020 has shown us just how important tech-
nology can be when we face challenges to 
our health, society, work, and overall wel-
fare. covid-19 was an unforeseen crisis that 
has affected all of us – some more than oth-
ers. it forced us all to rethink how we do 
business, how we engage with other people, 
how we, together as a community, can over-
come this common challenge facing us all.
at netcompany, we felt committed to do 
what we could to help limit the impact of the 
pandemic. in denmark, we worked together 
with authorities to develop covidmeter and 
the ‘smittestop’ app – two solutions that 
help monitor and stop the spread of the 
virus. the latter has also been delivered to 
the norwegian authorities.
as we have kept the wheels running on our 
business, our need for new talent has 
remained as important as ever. we have 
continued to hire new employees at the 
same rate and speed as before the pan-
demic, contributing positively to the labour 
market in the countries we operate in.
to netcompany, sustainability is about being 
able to adapt to the ever-changing world we 
live in – whether the changes are caused by 
political forces, climate change, or an 
unforeseen pandemic. we are impressed by 
how our employees have adapted to these 
new and uncharted waters while still deliver-
ing the same high-performance results and 
level of professionalism that has always been 
netcompany’s trademark.

monitoring and controlling the 
spread of covid-19 in denmark
case story
we are all stakeholders in the fight against 
covid-19 and it is our joint responsibility to 
do everything in our power to eradicate the 
virus and minimise its impacts. as part of 
this responsibility, netcompany has helped 
the danish authorities develop covidmeter 
and smittestop, two platforms contributing 
to monitoring and controlling the spread of 
the virus in denmark. 
covidmeter 
covidmeter is a digital platform empower-
ing danish citizens to contribute to the work 
of the health authorities, by completing a 
digital questionnaire about the condition of 
their health on a weekly basis. the ques-
tionnaire results make it possible for the 
authorities to track the development of the 
disease and help form an informed and 
objective data-based foundation for the 
authorities to rely on when making deci-
sions about reopening the country. 
the smittestop app
the smittestop covid-19 contact-tracing 
app is an app that danish citizens can vol-
untarily download to their mobile phones to 
help authorities track the spread of the 
covid-19 virus. 
the contact-tracing app allows users to reg-
ister if they have been infected with covid-
19, after which, other app users who have 
been in contact with the infected user are 
notified of the risk. this way, the app helps 
citizens become aware of potential 
exposure to the virus, making it possible for 
them to take the necessary precautions and 
get tested, so any further spread of the 
virus can be avoided. 
the app was first developed for the danish 
authorities in the beginning of 2020. in 
autumn 2020, netcompany also signed an 
agreement to develop a norwegian version 
of the app, showing how scalability is an 
integral part of the way we develop it plat-
forms at netcompany.

the netcompany  
govtech framework
"with the  netcompany govtech framework  
we invite governments around the world to  
 use technology  to build and improve  strong,   
 sustainable societies  and create  better lives  
 for us all." 
over the past several decades, the devel-
oped part of the world has benefitted from 
more stable and reliable societies. many 
countries have built welfare states, where 
citizens enjoy a much higher quality of life 
than previous generations.
the latest un e-government survey (2020) 
puts denmark at the forefront of public dig-
itisation. as a leading supplier of govtech, 
netcompany has been key in this develop-
ment, providing hundreds of society-critical 
solutions to public authorities. and we want 
to help more societies embark on the digital 
transformation journey. this is why, in 
august 2020, we launched a unique plat-
form presenting all of our govtech solutions 
and pushing the agenda of the digital trans-
formation of societies forward. 
you can read about two of our govtech 
platforms developed in 2020 on the next

official donor register 
the donor register platform, developed by netcompany for the 
dutch government, is a great example of how digitisation can help 
build strong welfare societies and improve the life of citizens.
every day around the world, people are waiting for an organ or tissue 
transplant, and every year patients die because no suitable organ is 
available. in the netherlands alone, hundreds of people are currently 
waiting for an organ or tissue transplant. as of summer 2020, the 
dutch donor act introduced new rules on organ donation and the 
dutch government asks all dutch citizens to register in the donor 
register. the register is delivered by netcompany for the cibg —  
an agency of the ministry of health, welfare and sport.
the donor register is a self-service platform that will handle pro-
cesses regarding a citizen’s choice in opting out (or in again) as well as 
specifications regarding which organs and tissues may be donated. in 
the register, everyone in the netherlands can make their personal 
decision on whether they wish to donate organs and tissues to some-
one else after death. 
the platform automates the processing of donor forms and creates 
easy accessibility for a broad range of users. it has been developed to 
offer easy usability for visually and mentally impaired people and with 
a simple functionality for choosing and changing the options for organ 
donation. the platform has a modern and scalable architecture that 
supports high availability of the system and uses a technology that 
supports effective support and maintenance processes.
state pension and disability pensions
as an organisation within atp (danish labour market supplementary 
pension), europe’s 3rd largest pension provider, udbetaling danmark 
is responsible for the collection, disbursement and control of a num-
ber of public benefits on behalf of the danish state, and contributes 
to an efficient welfare society. 
a central task of the organisation is handling state pensions and early 
retirement pensions, as well as other pension related benefits for 
danish citizens in denmark and abroad. 
in need of a modern replacement, atp and netcompany engaged in 
close collaboration to deliver socialpension — a secure and efficient 
benefits platform that ensures the correct and timely pay-out of ben-
efits. benefits that for many recipients are their only income and, 
hence, are essential for their livelihood.
the platform covers a full range self-service portal, managing the 
assessment and calculations of benefits based on current legislation 
combined with different aspects in a pensioner’s life — such as income, 
cohabitation and death — as well as the management of the actual 
pay-out of benefits and updating all necessary peripheral systems.
the main objective of the project was to combine several obsolete 
and cost-intensive systems into one modern system with significantly 
lower operational and maintenance costs.
the platform was delivered during the covid-19 lockdown in spring 
2020, showing great skill, ambition, and commitment from everyone 
involved to succeed with the project and meet the deadline. this pro-
ject is also a testament to how netcompany’s platforms can be easily 
adapted to work across industries and sectors.

educating society
one of the great challenges companies and 
societies are facing today is a lack of digital 
competencies. a lack that may lead to 
decreased innovation and a loss of growth 
and competitiveness. at netcompany, we 
want to share our knowledge and educate 
and develop more digital talent and it lead-
ers.
pushing the digital agenda forward
we engage in constant dialogue and are 
represented at universities, trade organisa-
tions, and initiatives such as digital dogme, 
di digital, teknologipagtrådet, think tank 
europa, health tech hub copenhagen, the 
danish social investment fund, and the 
danish foundation for entrepreneurship. we 
do this to constantly push our society and 
future generations in a direction where it 
can help solve some of the many challenges 
societies and businesses are facing.
the danish foundation for entrepreneurship
netcompany has had a strong partnership 
with the danish foundation for 
entrepreneurship for years, and since 2018, 
ceo andré rogaczewski has been chair of 
the board of representatives.
the foundation is the danish national knowl-
edge centre and focal point for the develop-
ment of entrepreneurship teaching at all 
educational levels, and works to ensure that 
the ability to be innovative is a fundamental 
element of education, from primary school 
to phd. it is the foundation’s vision that 
innovation and entrepreneurship be 
integrated into the education system and 
become deeply embedded within educa-
tional institutions to a higher degree.
supporting the it talents  
of tomorrow
at netcompany, we believe that future it tal-
ents will be amongst those who will make a 
real difference to our societies, businesses, 
environment, and our future. that it is the new 
generation of it masterminds who will create 
groundbreaking progress and innovation. 
netcompany supports numerous initiatives 
aimed at getting more young people inter-
ested in it and technology and in supporting 
students and young people in general.
close collaboration with universities
netcompany has always had a strong collab-
oration with it universities. hiring up to 
1,000 new it talents each year, we are clearly 
interested in getting to know students early 
on, just as we wish to share our knowledge 
and offer interesting collaborations, guid-
ance, and more. we are a member of recruit-
ment panels, sit on the board of the 
university of aalborg, are a member of the 
industry advisory board at rmit university 
in ho chi minh city, participate in career 
fairs, offer thesis’ counselling, student jobs, 
and more.
reaching even more students  
with virtual events
with covid-19 restrictions meaning that we 
couldn’t go out and meet it students as we 
usually do, we had to come up with 
alternatives in the form of virtual events. 
this turned out to come with additional ben-
efits, allowing us to reach even more stu-
dents than when events took place physi-
cally. our renowned tech talks turned global 
as virtual tech talks and with great success. 
going online has meant that we have been 
able to reach way more students and others 
interested in our it topics. in 2020, we 
reached more than 4,000 users online 
through our virtual global tech talks.
we continued to host guest lectures at uni-
versities, this year mainly virtually. guest lec-
tures are a great way for us to share our 
knowledge and expertise in various fields 
within it, as well as giving students an idea 
of the people who work at netcompany. 
career fairs have likewise turned virtual, and 
we have participated in many, meeting 
potential future employees this way.

digital dogme
case story
if 2020 has shown us anything, it is the 
importance of being able to adapt to new 
unforeseen circumstances by making use of 
digital solutions. this requires that busi-
nesses and not least public authorities have 
the required digital skills and qualifications 
needed to think in new digital possibilities 
and make use of these solutions. 
this is the very purpose of digital dogme. 
to enhance the digital qualifications of 
employees and citizens. 
in 2018, netcompany initiated the digital 
dogme movement in collaboration with 
three other notable danish companies with 
the purpose of cultivating employees’ digi-
tal skills from within. at the same time, the 
idea was to make digital dogme a broad 
movement where member companies com-
mit to upskilling employees and sharing 
knowledge and experiences.
the vision of digital dogme is to strengthen 
denmark’s role as a leading digital nation 
and reduce the digital skills gap, thereby 
creating better conditions for growth and 
digital business development for the benefit 
of employees, companies, and society.
digital dogme acts as an education broker 
and creates value for members across 
industries through external partnerships 
with tech companies, industry organisa-
tions, and educational institutions.
through tailor made networks and events, 
digital dogme members live the motto 
“closing the digital skills gap” by actively 
creating and sharing upskilling products 
within four distinct competence areas: 
cybersecurity, world-class it skills, digital 
transformation, and technology understand-
ing and digital mindset. all created upskill-
ing products are available for all members 
through digital dogme’s learning academy.
in 2020, digital dogme and microsoft 
denmark engaged in a new collaboration on 
the enhancement of digital qualifications in 
denmark. together they will create a better 
analytical foundation in the area of digital 
qualifications and increase companies and 
the danish citizens’ access to relevant digital 
courses such as linkedin learning. through 
the collaboration, digital dogme will also aim 
to develop concrete solutions that minimise 
the digital qualifications gap in denmark. 
the collaboration will help meet danish 
businesses and public authorities’ demand 
for increased digital qualifications in the 
future and directly contribute to a contin-
ued digital transformation and innovation in 
denmark. in 2020, digital dogme has also, 
amongst other things, established det 
digitale kompetencebarometer – an official 
initiative that outlined the competency gap 
in denmark, hosted a fully booked confer-
ence on digital competencies at the danish 
parliament, established four networks based 
on the four competence areas, and initiated 
dialogue with trade organisations, educa-
tional institutions, tech companies etc., all 
interested in collaborating and committing 
to formal partnerships.
in 2021, digital dogme will continue to work 
on its goal to create more digitally skilled 
employees throughout denmark.

social
other social events have also been translated 
into online versions, with the added benefit 
of allowing both us and participants to inter-
act and network across locations. our social 
events aim to give participants insights into 
an it relevant topic and create fun network-
ing experiences with other it students.
one of the key social events we hosted this 
year was the virtual edition of the danish 
championships in programming. in the com-
petition, students get to test their coding 
skills and compete against other it students 
in denmark. aside from hosting the event, 
netcompany also sponsored all of the prizes.
we have held more than 100 physical and 
virtual events for students, participated in 
more than 20 physical and virtual career 
fairs, given more than 30 guest lectures, 
sponsored more than 20 education institu-
tions or networks and taken part in several 
partnerships and activities across the coun-
tries we operate in. alltogether, we have 
reached thousands of students throughout 
the year, motivating their interest in making 
a difference through a job in the it industry.
initiatives supporting new talent
engineer the future
netcompany is part of the technological alli-
ance “engineer the future” alongside other 
tech companies, educational institutions, and 
organisations. the aim of the alliance is to cre-
ate more support and understanding of the 
potential in engineering from the general pub-
lic, young people, and politicians in order to 
ensure more jobs, growth, and development.
in 2020, the alliance started a new initiative 
“book an expert” through which primary 
schools can book it experts from tech com-
panies to do guest lectures for their pupils. 
netcompany has signed up to the initiative 
with several experts. aside from teaching 
pupils about it, the aim is also to act as role 
models and inspire children to become inter-

for many years, netcompany has been sup-
porting the coding pirates initiative, whose 
purpose is to create awareness and engage 
children in the digital world from a young 
age, ensuring that both girls and boys are 
introduced to the digital world and its many 
possibilities.
in 2020, the danish ict industry 
association, netcompany, and a number of 
other supporting it businesses, hosted an 
online coding class, presenting three cases 
for students across denmark to find creative 
solutions to. netcompany’s case, code for 
love, focused on how many people spend 
too much time apart, especially during the 
covid-19 lockdown. the students were 
asked to come up with solutions to connect 
people. the students worked in teams and 
got to pitch their solutions to the companies.
more women in it
while it historically has been a male-domi-
nated field, we are happy to see that more 
and more women are choosing to study and 
work within it. this brings even more bright 
minds to the field, and it is a development 
that we have been supporting and will con-
tinue to support.
netcompany engages in a long list of initia-
tives aimed at getting more girls and women 
interested in it and attracted to the it indus-
try. in denmark, one of these initiatives is 
girls’ day in science, which is a nationwide 
event that aims to inspire girls across 
denmark to choose a path in education 
within science or technology. in 2019, more 
than 3,200 attended the event. we also sup-
port the it camp for girls, which is a three-
day event at the university of aarhus for 
young women focusing on technology and 
design, and the redi school initiative, which 
is a non-profit initiative located in 
copenhagen that offers free it courses to 
women with an ethnic background that is not 
danish.
in 2020/2021, netcompany participates with 
three female leaders in the danish ict 
industry association’s mentor programme 
for talented women with leadership ambi-
tions. the programme has been established

case story
in 2020, netcompany entered a large, 
three-year partnership with the danish foot-
ball club aab’s talent department, the aab 
academy, as well as a new collaboration 
with aalborg university and aab.
the collaboration establishes a platform for 
developing talent in the local environment. 
the objective is to engage youth in sports 
and social activities, enabling young talents 
to make friends, build strong personal rela-
tions and set a personal sports goal. the 
academy will use individual training, mental 
training, and international matching.
the partnership also aims to broaden and 
strengthen sports and athletics in general in 
aalborg Øst by working together with pri-
mary schools in the neighbourhood, focus-
ing on getting more young people inter-
ested in sports, and engaging in 
communities offered through sports.
as part of the collaboration, netcompany is 
teaming up with aalborg university. 
together, the partners will strengthen the 
use of data in aab as a performance plat-
form, just as the partnership will work on 
strengthening innovation and entrepreneur-
ship in all of northern jutland.

the it industry and aims to encourage more 
female employees to take on leadership 
responsibilities. the programme will allow 
the female mentees to engage in honest and 
open dialogue with their mentor about how 
to take their career to the next level, how to 
mature as a leader, and the obstacles they 
may face on their career path.
in norway, we support jenteprosjektet ada, 
which is a network for female tech students 
at norwegian university of science and 
technology (ntnu). ada works to increase 
the number of females who apply, enter, and 
graduate from technology degrees. in 
february 2020, netcompany held the event 
jenter i tech (girls in tech) at ntnu in col-
laboration with ada. this was a continuation 
of our annual event kvinner i tech (women 
in tech), where the aim was to inspire female 
tech students to be role models for each 
other and future students. netcompany 
norway also partners with the oda 
network, the leading women’s tech network 
in the nordic region, to work together 
towards the goal of a higher proportion of 
women in it. netcompany has, among other 
things, hosted their mentor programme, and 
several of the female employees in 
netcompany have participated as mentors 
at girl tech fest – an annual coding and 
tech inspiration event for more than 1,300 
girls in 10 norwegian cities, which is one of 
oda network’s many initiatives.
other initiatives 
across our various locations, netcompany 
engages in a large number of initiatives cov-
ering various areas such as supporting and 
hiring war veterans, raising money for can-
cer support, donating computers to those 
who are underprivileged, hiring people with 
autism, supporting financially and materially 
disadvantaged people, and more.
buttershaw bec
when the uk government instructed that all 
educational facilities close due to covid-19, 
how students would continue to learn and 
develop was a big concern. following the 
movement to online learning for students 
across the uk, the northern powerhouse 
partnership (a government body) put out a 
call to help a particular school in the leeds 
area (buttershaw bec) that had a large num-
ber of children from disadvantaged back-
grounds that did not have access to com-
puters at home, naturally complicating their 
learning even further. netcompany donated 
computers to the initiative, thereby giving 
several students the means to continue their 
learning and development.
donating computers to free it courses for 
women with a different ethnic background 
the redi school initiative is a danish non-
profit initiative that offers free it courses to 
women with an ethnic background other 
than danish. the objective is to create 
digital empowerment for these women 
through the acquisition of digital skills and 
by supporting them in accessing a social 
and professional network. netcompany has 
donated computers to the redi school.
helping homeless people return to work
netcompany recently worked with the 
homeless charity, the connection, to iden-
tify how we can help them tackle the under-
lying issues caused by homelessness and 
rough sleeping, and to provide a means to 
get back to work. in 2019, the connection 
helped over 2,600 people in london on their 
journey away from homelessness and rough 
sleeping. netcompany supports the 
connection through the donation of it 
equipment that is used to train people and 
support their service users in applying for 
government grants, housing, and employ-
ment opportunities.
raising money for cancer support
macmillan cancer support is there to help 
everyone in the uk with cancer live life as 
fully as they can, providing physical, finan-
cial, and emotional support. the covid-19 
pandemic has led to the postponement of 
many sporting challenges in 2020 and 
therefore caused a massive funding gap for 
uk charities. netcompany is supporting 
macmillan through innovative methods of 
raising money to support the organisation’s 
work such as bake offs, brave the shave, vir-
tual athletic events, and more.

customer satisfaction
it is deeply grounded in netcompany’s val-
ues to act as a responsible partner in society 
in all regards and to ensure equal opportuni-
ties for all. we feel strongly that we – as an 
industry leader – should lead the way in 
changing our society for the better, and it is 
important to contribute to the social welfare 
and benefits of the societies in which we 
operate.
a prerequisite for the welfare benefits in any 
society is that sufficient funding is available. 
this is typically accumulated through the 
means of direct and indirect taxes. we have 
a transparent tax disclosure policy, firmly 
in 2016, netcompany implemented a cus-
tomer experience management programme. 
fundamental to the programme is a cus-
tomer feedback system. the customer satis-
faction survey is conducted on an annual 
basis and netcompany tracks progress on 
its net promoter score (nps), which is 
assessed on a scale from -100 to +100.

havens and other methods of tax evasion. 
the executive management are fully taxable 
in denmark, where we were founded and 
where the vast majority of netcompany has 
been built over the last 20 years. the 
broader partner group pay income taxes in 
the countries where they live and work, and 
as a company, we pay corporate income 
taxes and other indirect taxes in all the 
countries in which we operate.
in 2020, netcompany paid more than dkk 
128m in corporate income taxes. in addition, 
netcompany paid indirect taxes such as vat 
and other similar taxes in excess of dkk 
535m. finally, the more than 3,000 employ-
ees at netcompany paid around dkk 400m 
in personal income taxes based on the sala-
ries they generated through their employ-
ment with netcompany.
in total, the netcompany group contributed 
more than dkk 1,063m in direct and indirect 
taxes in 2020 to the societies in the coun-
tries we are located in. we take pride in this 
and, based on our continued growth aspira-
tions, we expect to be able to continue con-
tributing more in the future.
this year, we received an nps of +20, which 
is in line with last year. 
generally speaking, a net promoter score 
above 20 is considered to be very good. we 
believe that the opinion of our customers 
serves as a powerful indicator in determin-
ing the success and performance of our 
solutions in the market. going forward, we 
will continue to translate the learnings from 
the survey and incorporate the findings into 
our engagement strategies for all our cus-
tomers.

human rights
netcompany’s approach to human rights is 
strongly rooted in our core values and ethi-
cal standards of being a people-orientated 
company. it is of great importance to us that 
everyone we meet and get acquainted with 
in our business dealings is treated with the 
dignity and respect that all human beings 
deserve. as such, we have also chosen to 
follow the united nations’ declaration of 
human rights through several policies 
including our code of conduct and anti-
slavery policy, just as we have implemented 
internal guidelines on non-discrimination 
and protective measures against any kind of 
harassment.
netcompany wishes to secure the human 
rights of every employee throughout the 
organisation. this also includes the employ-
ees of our subcontractors and business 
partners. for this reason, we have a whis-
tle-blower system in place, allowing people 
to report any suspicions or knowledge of 
any mistreatment either within netcompany 
or within the organisations that netcompany 
collaborates with.

labour
netcompany always operates under the 
highest ethics when using labour forces and 
has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of 
child labour, as well as forced and compul-
sory labour. these ethics are also embodied 
in the netcompany code of conduct and 
netcompany fully supports the convention 
on the rights of the child, stating that all 
children have the right to leisure and educa-
tion.
demonstrating netcompany’s commitment 
to acting ethically and with integrity in all 
our business dealings and relationships, we 
have implemented an anti-slavery policy, 
making employees aware of the issue of 
modern slavery and notifying them of 
netcompany’s whistle-blower system where 
any violations or suspected violations can be 
reported anonymously. to date, 
netcompany has not received any reports 
through the whistle-blower system concern-
ing the misuse of labour forces.
during the covid-19 pandemic, we have 
continued to hire new employees at the 
same rate as before the pandemic, contrib-
uting positively to the labour market in the 
countries we operate in.

in 2020, we have kept the engine running, 
hiring more than 900 people across our 10 
locations in 6 countries. this means that 
today, we are more than 3,000 people in 
netcompany. due to covid-19, many new 
employees have been interviewed, hired, 
and onboarded to the company and their 
respective teams online. while this was a 
radical change for our usual hiring methods 
with face-to-face interviews, we have proven 
that it can be done and with just as good 
results. also, we didn’t adjust our targets for 
new hires in 2020, thereby supporting a 
labour market that is currently under pres-
sure due to the struggles many companies 
are facing.
 
employee satisfaction
our employees are our most important and 
valued resource. they are the ones that 
steadily take us into the future, which is why 
their everyday work satisfaction is also of 
great importance to us and something we 
take very seriously. as part of our efforts to 
remain an attractive workplace with a posi-
tive employee morale, we conduct an annual 
employee satisfaction survey tracking our 
results in the employee net promoter score 
(enps), which is assessed on a scale from 
-100 to +100. 
the enps for netcompany is +42 in 2020. 
this is level with 2019 and an increase from 
+36 in 2018. benchmark data from bain & 
co. shows that an enps above +20 is high, 
which underlines that netcompany’s 
employees are motivated and loyal. 
netcompany continues to have a high focus 
on well-being for our employees and 
acknowledge that employee well-being is 
extremely important for delivery and busi-
ness performance.
it is also great to see that it students and 
professionals alike continue to view 
netcompany as an attractive employer, for 
example, in the annual universum ranking. in 
this year’s universum ranking in denmark, 
we moved into the top 10 employers 
amongst it professionals and were in the 
top 5 amongst it students.
work environment
health is an integral part of a person’s over-
all well-being and life happiness. as the 
average person spends more than 90,000 
hours of their life working, a tremendous 
amount of time is spent at the workplace. 
this leads to great responsibilities for all 
employers to secure a healthy and safe work 
environment for their employees. at 
netcompany we take this responsibility very 
seriously, as we want our employees to 
remain active and continue to be employa-
ble in the labour market for as long as they 
can and want to.
we have zero tolerance towards any kind of 
discrimination, harassment or bullying of 
employees due to any social identity, such 
as age, culture, nationality, ethnicity, gender, 
physical ability, political and religious belief, 
sexual orientation, and other attributes, as 
stated in our policy against harassment and 
sexual harassment. in 2020, we also sup-
ported the zero tolerance towards sexism 
initiative by lederne, a danish organisation 
for business leaders.
in 2020, our average sickness absence rate 
fell from 3.8% to 3.1%. we will continue to 
work to maintain and develop a work envi-
ronment that will positively affect the cur-
rent rate. 
in our esg report for 2019, we reported an 
average sickness absence rate of 2.7%. this 
number only accounted for january to 
october 2019. the total average sickness 
absence rate of 2019 was 3.8%. 
by providing a healthy work environment 
and by offering a range of health promoting 
initiatives such as sports clubs in our after 
dark community, discount on gym member-
ships, and bikes for commuting, we will con-
tinue to work towards further reductions in 
our employee’s absence ratings.
working remotely during covid-19
at netcompany, we have been working 
together virtually and digitally for many 
years. so, when covid-19 forced us to work 
from home, we already had a great toolbox 
for making this work. still, we knew that for 
many, this posed a significant change in 
their everyday lives, just as it inﬂuenced how 
they collaborated with colleagues and cli-
ents. we wanted to make the transition and 
processes as easy to deal with as possible. 
therefore, we developed several easy 
best-practice guides to support individuals 
and teams when working remotely. we make

covid-19 has, and still will, inﬂuence us all in 
ways we cannot predict, and this will also be 
different depending on which country you 
live and work in. at netcompany, we focus 
on providing our employees with continuous 
information with specific and easy-to-follow 
guidelines for each location. we know that 
the uncertainty can be troubling for many, 
and we do everything in our power to make 
these difficult times as easy to get through 
as possible.
creating a strong social community
at netcompany, we take responsibility for 
creating a strong social community and 
making sure that our employees have the 
best possible opportunities to participate. 
this is why netcompany after dark is such 
an integral part of netcompany. after dark 
is a community for all netcompany employ-
ees across all locations and it offers employ-
ees the chance to go to a large variety of 
events and social gatherings.
it is a culture and a community that we are 
proud of, as we believe that we perform our 
best when we know each other and have fun 
together.
our after dark community has a wide spec-
trum of offers. we have sports teams for 
running, badminton, football, yoga, climbing 
etc. we also have clubs for those interested 
in games, gaming, cultural experiences, and 
much more. we believe that social activities 
help us to maintain a high employee satis-
faction, a low absence from sickness and 
create unity across projects, teams, and 
physical locations – and the events are able 
to be attended by everyone. despite our 
size, we do not focus on hierarchy, and 
employees and managers are approachable 
across all levels, sharing an after-hour beer 
or attending after dark events together.
in 2020 due to covid-19, we have had to 
rethink how we interact with each other and 
how to continue to build strong social com-
munities. through virtual friday bars, lunch, 
and coffee breaks on teams and more, we 
have found new ways to keep our social 
engagement thriving. in 2020, we also intro-
duced our online global updates as a means 
for all employees in netcompany to connect, 
sharing good stories on projects, celebrating 
new wins, and more.
development, training,  
and education
netcompany has an extensive development 
programme, including our netcompany 
academy, guaranteeing that employees are 
challenged and supported throughout their 
career at netcompany.
netcompany hires hundreds of new gradu-
ates each year, creating outstanding career 
opportunities for many young people com-
ing straight out of school. we hire people 
who are committed to making a real differ-
ence and are ready for a steep learning 
curve right from the start.

we also hire experienced professionals,  
taking their career to the next level with 
increased responsibility, new skills and lead-
ership roles.
it people leading it people
at netcompany, it people lead it people. 
this is fundamental to how we do business 
and work together. it is unique and creates a 
workplace where everyone speaks the same 
language, where employees get frequent 
and relevant feedback from managers and 
mentors and can learn from their peers. this 
also helps to create the optimal conditions 
for development. because at netcompany, 
development is everything. and we aim to 
develop the it leaders of tomorrow.
long-term mentoring 
all employees are assigned a personal men-
tor, ensuring a continuous and consistent 
development within a company, where 
employees often change projects and move 
on to new tasks with new managers.
netcompany academy
we believe that as people, we never stop 
learning. this is also why our extensive 
development programme is for everyone 
and tailored to meet the needs of the indi-
vidual employee.
all netcompany employees are enrolled in 
netcompany academy, which supports devel-
opment through mandatory seminars, certifi-
cations, and pop-up courses. the timing and 
content of the mandatory seminars are aligned 
with employees’ chosen career paths, ambi-
tions, and progression. all seminars and 
training courses are designed specifically to 
supplement the skills and knowledge gained 
from the daily project and team tasks and 
responsibilities. all training courses are for 
netcompany participants only, the content is 
tailored specifically to be netcompany rele-
vant and most courses are conducted by 
netcompany professionals. this ensures that 
both content, cases, and discussions are of 
high quality and high relevance.
netcompany academy also allows employees 
to build a strong social network with col-
leagues across projects and countries, creating 
a stronger community across the organisation.
as an experienced employee at 
netcompany, netcompany academy 
courses and seminars will focus on manage-
rial skills, in-depth understanding of meth-
odology, leadership, and strategy, allowing 
experienced professionals to gradually take 
on more responsibility and management 
roles, including creating motivation and job 
satisfaction among team members.
in 2020, we gave our academy a lift, making 
it more ﬂexible and even better suited to 
meeting the individual needs of each 
employee. we also strengthened the acade-
my’s ability to create alliances and strong 
internal networking across countries with 
global multi-day workshops, bringing 
employees from our locations across the 
world together. this way we can, to an even 
larger extent, share competencies and our 
distinct netcompany culture.
diversity and inclusion
netcompany recognises that a diverse and 
inclusive workplace is imperative for secur-
ing and maintaining competitiveness in the 
market and securing better problem-solving 
abilities and innovation.
it is also by reﬂecting the diversity of our cli-
ents and the population in the countries that 
we work in that we can better understand 
and meet the needs and requirements of our 
clients. that is also why we consider diver-
sity and inclusion as a business opportunity 
and not a compliance necessity.
it is our people who allow us to deliver on our 
purpose – to build strong, sustainable socie-
ties around the world. this requires a culture 
of inclusion where all employees feel sup-
ported, valued, and enabled to be their best. 
diversity is found in any social identity, such 
as age, culture, nationality, ethnicity, gender, 
physical ability, political and religious belief, 
sexual orientation, and other attributes. it is 
our intention to continue to safeguard a cul-
ture where every employee, no matter their 
social identity, can experience the same 
opportunities for career development and 
advancement.
the numbers for 2020 show a slight 
decrease in the percentage of women in 
netcompany, but we are still close to our set 
target for 2020 of 20% females. in 2021, we 
will work even harder to reach this goal.
at netcompany, 
we believe that as 
people, we never

netcompany’s aspiration for diversity and 
inclusion is anchored in three pillars: diverse 
talent, equal opportunities, and inclusive 
culture. it is these three pillars that guide 
how we approach and support the integra-
tion of diversity and inclusion in our core 
processes where relevant and possible, and 
ensure that we increase awareness and 
secure focus on creating and maintaining a 
diverse and inclusive workplace.
diverse talent
it is our objective to have as many skilled 
candidates as possible, of any social identity 
and with a broad array of experiences, to 
choose from when filling positions, including 
management positions. for this reason, we 
strive to broaden the field of candidates as 
much as possible, and our employment pro-
cedures are designed to give applicants, 
regardless of social identity, equal opportu-
nities to apply for and obtain any position at 
any level. still, we only employ the best can-
didates and the decisive factor, in external 
as well as internal recruitment processes, 
shall be the candidates’ qualifications.
to support equal access for everyone to 
vacant positions at netcompany, we continu-
ously focus on any barriers that may prevent 
underrepresented minorities from being 
appointed to a position, including manage-
ment positions. this applies to all steps of the 
employment procedure, including job 
descriptions, job advertisements, screening 
of applicants and job interviews. we have 
targets for recruitment in order to secure 
diversity in our shortlists, and we follow up 
on these targets, measuring the gender com-
position throughout the recruitment process.
attracting more women to it both in gen-
eral and in netcompany specifically is also a 
key ambition in our employer branding, and 
we engage in a long list of initiatives to pro-
mote it among girls and young women. 
equal opportunities
netcompany focuses on creating an attrac-
tive working environment which promotes 
equal career opportunities for all employees 
regardless of social identity. we believe that 
it is through different perspectives and 
experiences that we can gain the competi-
tive advantage needed and leverage the 
effect of diversity for business growth. this 
requires a focus on equal opportunity 
throughout the organisation.
through our global internal career develop-
ment programme, netcompany academy, 
and our global performance and progression 
processes, we make sure that all employees 
are treated equally and are offered similar 
opportunities across locations. 
at netcompany, we have transparent and 
fair promotion processes. it is experience 
and qualifications that determines the salary 
level, and equal pay is given for equal work 
regardless of gender or any other unjust 
reason that does not reﬂect the true qualifi-
cations of our employees.

inclusive culture
at netcompany, we strongly believe that we 
create the best results when we know each 
other and have fun together. for this to hap-
pen, you need an inclusive culture that 
allows all employees regardless of social 
identity to feel valued, involved, and 
accepted. only by having such a culture can 
you allow for true creativity, inspiration, 
innovation, and growth.
key to an inclusive culture is inclusive lead-
ers. leaders who show commitment to 
diversity and inclusion and make it a per-
sonal priority. in 2020, we decided to make 
inclusive leadership training an integral part 
of our management seminars.
following up on diversity and inclusion
2020 was also the year we established an 
internal group consisting of managers from 
hr, legal, communication and employer 
branding, focusing and following up on 
diversity and inclusion initiatives and tar-
gets. the group has quarterly meetings, fol-
lowing up on the progress on our diversity 
and inclusion ambitions on a continual basis, 
and aims to ensure that the d&i efforts build 
traction across the company. the group is 
also responsible for an annual review – and 
potentially revision – not only of progress, 
but also of initiatives and corresponding 
ambitions. netcompany also sits in on di’s 
special committee for diversity, which aims 
to find tangible solutions to promote diver-
sity and equality in companies.
you can read more about our approach in 
our diversity & inclusion policy.
netcompany is operating in a market with an 
increasing need for highly qualified it profession-
als. unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly diffi-
cult to hire talented personnel with relevant edu-
cational backgrounds, simply because the number 
of it graduates each year is not large enough to 
cover the market needs. furthermore, female 
interest in the industry is still low, imposing a risk 
for the loss of many of the advantages of gender 
diversity.
at netcompany, we understand that our employ-
ees are key to maintaining our position and one of 
our greatest risks is, as a consequence, the lack of 
qualified employees to support the increasing 
workload, as well as the lack of diversity that is so 
immensely important to the development of new 
and innovative solutions. these challenges could 
potentially lead to an unwanted cap on 
netcompany’s revenue, not because we aren’t able 
to handle the amount of assignments in a fully 
competent and responsible manner, but simply 
because we could risk not having access to the 
required workforce. for the same reason, we are 
greatly invested in maintaining a high level of 
employee satisfaction, while at the same time gen-
erating an increased interest in employment within 
the it industry for all, and in particular, for women. 
we will continue to care for our employees both 
professionally and personally through 
netcompany academy and our mentor pro-
grammes, social activities, and general employ-
ment conditions, just as we will continue to pro-
mote the great and many advantages of 
employment in the it industry. in addition, we will 
continue our work with digital dogme, which we 
truly believe will become an imperative part of 
meeting the future and increasing needs of it 
qualified personnel.
despite our greatest attempts to the contrary, we 
are always at risk when it comes to the compliance 
of our employees and our business partners in 
terms of violations of applicable rules and regula-
tions, including our internal policies. the conse-
quences of such violations could result in loss of 
goodwill and related losses in revenue, financial 
costs and corporate liability. in order to prevent 
and mitigate these risks as much as possible, we 
have implemented a whistle-blower system, which 
makes it possible for all to report any suspicions or 
knowledge of illegalities without fear of repercus-
sions. in 2020, we made a campaign to increase 
awareness of internal policies amongst employees.

governance
responsibility is one of our absolute core values, 
as we know it is a fundamental part of creating 
a foundation of trust between netcompany and 
our customers, employees, shareholders, society, 
and other stakeholders.  
trust is crucial in any business relationship and 
it always begins with responsible corporate 
governance.
to netcompany, responsible corporate govern-
ance is a matter of setting out directions and 
guidelines for the company that embody both 
an ethical business approach and a fair balance 
between the interests of netcompany’s many 
stakeholders. it is about holding ourselves 
responsible for our actions and inactions and 
ensuring that what we say is also what we do.
corporate governance is an indispensable 
instrument in securing accountability through-
out an organisation, and it is accomplished by 
means of transparency and supervision of the 
company processes. through our governance 
reporting we wish to provide the necessary clar-
ity and transparency about the ways that 
netcompany do business so we may earn the 
trust of our stakeholders and accomplish our 
goal of long-term sustainability.

management
at netcompany, we have a two-tier manage-
ment structure consisting of the board of 
directors and the executive management. 
the board of directors is responsible for the 
overall and strategic management of 
netcompany and is involved in the decision 
making concerning all major investments, 
risk management, significant operational 
issues, and more. the executive 
management is responsible for the day-to-
day management of netcompany, including 
the organisation of the company, implemen-
tation of strategies, and allocation of 
resources. the executive management is 
supervised by the board of directors and 
the two bodies are held separate from each 
other so that no one serves as a member of 
both bodies, thus avoiding any conﬂict of 
interest. the division of responsibility 
between the board of directors and the 
executive management is set out in the 
rules of procedures for the board of 
directors and executive management 
instructions.
board of directors and  
executive management
the board of directors of netcompany 
group a/s currently consists of five mem-
bers who are all considered independent 
under the recommendations on corporate 
governance. the chair and the deputy chair 
are chosen among the board members and 
appointed by the board of directors. each 
member is elected for a one-year period and 
may be re-elected. the board of directors 
must always consist of at least three and no 
more than seven members elected at the 
general meeting.
netcompany believes that a diversified 
board of directors is of great importance to 
any company. as such, each of netcompany 
groups a/s’s board members contribute 
with a different competency profile supple-
menting the rest of the board and strength-
ening the overall management of 
netcompany to the best interests of the 
shareholders, company employees, custom-
ers, and other stakeholders. 
the board of directors meets at least five 
times a year and holds extraordinary meet-
ings whenever it is required. 
during 2020, the board of directors con-
ducted a self-evaluation. the evaluation 
included, among other factors, effectiveness, 
performance, achievements, and composition 
of the board of directors, including an evalua-
tion of the performance of the individual 
members of the board of directors as well as 
the collaboration with the executive 
management. the results of the evaluation 
were that there has been a good and con-
structive collaboration between the board of 
directors and the executive management 
throughout 2020 where everybody has con-
tributed with their individual competencies. it 
was also concluded that both the board of 
directors and executive management is com-
posed of highly qualified and diverse mem-
bers in terms of qualifications, educational 
background etc. 
the members of the executive management 
currently consist of the ceo, coo and cfo. 
the executive management is registered 
with the danish business authority.

board committees
netcompany has chosen to establish three 
different board committees with the pur-
pose of assisting the board of directors with 
its preparatory tasks. the board 
committees consist of an audit committee, 
a remuneration committee, and a 
nomination committee.
along with their preparatory work, the com-
mittees also make recommendations for the 
board of directors, who in turn makes the 
final decision regarding the matter at hand. 
the responsibilities of the committees are 
stipulated in separate committee charters, 
which are reviewed annually by the board of 
directors and updated as appropriate.
audit committee
the objective of the audit committee is to 
provide the board of directors with a finan-
cial overview of netcompany’s businesses 
along with an overview of netcompany’s 
statutory audit matters, internal controls, and 
risk management systems. furthermore, the 
audit committee is responsible for supervis-
ing the procedures for election of the exter-
nal auditor and the external auditor’s inde-
pendence.
the audit committee currently consists of 
three members of the board of directors, 
Åsa riisberg (chair), scanes bentley and 
juha christensen, and meets at least four 
times a year.
remuneration committee
the remuneration committee assists the 
board of directors by preparing and 
presenting proposals and recommendations 
on all matters concerning the remuneration 
of the executive management and the board 
of directors and its committees.
the remuneration committee meets at least 
two times a year and currently consists of 
two members of the board of directors, 
juha christensen (chair) and bo rygaard.
nomination committee
the nomination committee assists the 
board of directors by preparing and pre-
senting decision proposals regarding the 
composition of the board of directors and 
executive management, including the nomi-
nation of candidates and evaluation of the 
overall composition of the board of 
directors and executive management.
the nomination committee consists of two 
members of the board of directors, juha 
christensen (chair) and bo rygaard. the 
nomination committee meets at least two 
times a year.
attendance on board meetings
the members of the board of directors all 
understand and respect the extent of the 
work required by a board member of 
netcompany group a/s and they are all 
devoted in fulfilling their essential obliga-
tions of their respective positions. this is 
also reﬂected in the high attendance rate in 
the board and committee meetings.
in 2020 the board of directors met seven 
times of which five of the meetings were con-
ducted fully or partially as a conference call 
due to travel restrictions. none of the mem-
bers were prevented from attending any of 
the meetings and there were, as such, full 
attendance at every board meeting held in 
netcompany group a/s, which also means 
that the set target in last year’s esg report of 
a 97% attendance rate was achieved. this is 
also the case regarding the committee meet-
ings where there was also a 100% attendance 
rate.
recommendations on  
corporate governance
netcompany group a/s is listed on the 
stock exchange of copenhagen and is there-
fore subject to the danish corporate 
governance recommendations. the 
recommendations on corporate 
governance are based on the principle of 
comply or explain, so that any legitimate 
reasons for derogating from one or more of 
the recommendations may be explained 
appropriately. as per 2020, netcompany 
complies with all 47 of the recommenda-
tions.
pursuant to the danish financial statements 
act section 107(b), a statement on corporate 
governance for the financial year 2020 has 
been prepared. the statement forms part of 
the management’s review and can be

to secure the whistle-blower 
system's  independence  and   
 autonomy,  the system is 
governed by an  external law    
 firm 
in 2017, netcompany implemented a whis-
tle-blower system with the purpose of provid-
ing a channel through which persons related 
to netcompany could anonymously report 
serious offences or suspected offences that 
could possibly affect netcompany in a nega-
tive way or affect the life or health of an indi-
vidual. reports may be filed by employees, 
members of the executive management and 
board of directors, auditors, lawyers, busi-
ness partners and suppliers.
to secure the whistle-blower system’s inde-
pendence and autonomy, the system is gov-
erned by an external law firm (plesner) who 
receives all reports that are submitted to the 
system. if a report is received it is forwarded 
to the chair of the board of directors who in 
turn investigates the matter promptly and 
makes sure that appropriate actions are 
taken.
in 2020, three reports were submitted via the 
whistle-blower system. the reports were 
investigated thoroughly by all relevant par-
ties. one report was assessed to be out of 
scope by the external law firm, while appro-
priate action was taken on the reports which 
fell within scope.
whistle-blower system
whistle-blower cases are always taken very 
seriously, and netcompany has enhanced the 
awareness of good conduct and that inci-
dents can be reported through the whis-
tle-blower system.

at netcompany, we are determined to work 
towards a more representative and inclusive 
society where female leadership and diver-
sity is encouraged and valued. it is our 
ambition to nourish and safeguard a com-
pany culture where every employee may 
experience the same opportunities for 
career development and advancement.
in 2020, we updated our diversity policy to a 
diversity & inclusion policy, which embraces 
both gender diversity and diversity in gen-
eral for all levels of the organisation, includ-
ing the board of directors and the executive 
management. it is a stated target therein, 
that we will keep working for upholding a 
culture of equality and inclusion for all. 
netcompany’s esg report includes the stat-
utory corporate social responsibility state-
ment on the underrepresented gender, cf. 
section 99(b) of the danish financial 
statements act for both netcompany group 
a/s and netcompany a/s. also included is 
netcompany group a/s’ statutory state-
ment on diversity in the board of directors 
and executive management according to 
section 107(d) of the danish financial 
statements act. the following describes the 
development in netcompany a/s and 
netcompany group a/s. 
gender balance and diversity at  
board level 
at netcompany, we truly believe that diver-
sity is key in achieving the best results in any 
type of business. we are therefore always 
seeking to fill the board of directors with 
the most qualified and diverse members so 
that they may complement each other to the 
greatest extent possible. the board mem-
bers and their individual positions are chosen 
accordingly, based on objective criteria such 
as education, experience, netcompany’s 
business strategy, and the overall composi-
tion of the board of directors. 
results and development
our internal guidelines for diversity and inclu-
sion were a great focus point when two new 
members to our board of directors were 
elected in 2020. in our esg report for 2019 
and in our diversity & inclusion policy we set 
a target of two female members of the board 
of directors in netcompany group a/s to be 
achieved by 2022. we are proud to report 
that we have achieved this goal two years 
earlier than originally targeted and that two 
new female board members, hege skryseth 
and Åsa riisberg, were appointed to the 
board of directors at the extraordinary 
general meeting in august 2020.
we can subsequently report that netcompany 
group a/s fulfils the requirements for equal 
representation in the board of directors as 
40% of the board members are female. 
likewise, netcompany a/s also fulfils the 
requirements for equal representation as one 
out of four of the board members is female.
the board of directors in netcompany 
group a/s is composed of five very differ-
ent profiles, who each contribute to a 
diverse composition of the board of 
directors. four different nationalities and 
different generations are represented in the 
board of directors, providing important 
knowledge about different markets and 
other aspects of running a sustainable busi-
ness. furthermore, the members have differ-
ent educational backgrounds, experiences, 
and fields of expertise e.g. financial, govern-
ance, and technical expertise.

gender balance and diversity at 
 management level 
netcompany’s career model and business 
model are based on a vision of it people 
leading it people. for the same reason it is 
of high importance that the employees that 
are holding the managerial positions in net-
company are the best within their field so 
that they can always help and guide the rest 
of their team to the highest standards pos-
sible. as with any other areas in life, it takes 
hard work and time to become the best, and 
in general it takes about 5+ years working 
for netcompany to become manager, even 
more to become principal, and 12+ years to 
become partner. 
as part of an industry that is still primarily 
occupied by male personnel, this naturally 
proposes some challenges to the rate at 
which women will be equally represented at 
management level in netcompany due to 
the general lack of women within the it 
industry in both current, and especially pre-
vious, generations. 
although the netcompany career model is 
based solely on objective criteria, such as 
experience, performance, and seniority, we 
recognise that we need to be extra obser-
vant of the female talents within our organi-
sation. for the same reason we continue to 
focus on any barriers that may prevent 
women from being appointed to managerial 
positions. this applies to all steps of employ-
ment, such as, job descriptions, job adver-
tisements, screening of applicants and job 
interviews, just as we cover managerial

training an integral part of our manager 
training. the training will focus on creating 
space for others to contribute, awareness of 
bias and personal blind spots, how to 
demonstrate an open mindset and having 
curiosity about others, with the purpose of 
giving all new managers the tools to, among 
others, recognise and discover potential 
management talents, hereunder female tal-
ents, and ensure effective collaborations 
throughout the organisation.
at netcompany, we have a transparent and 
fair promotion process based on the same 
performance criteria for each employee 
group. we are constantly monitoring our 
process and adjusting it where needed, so 
we can ensure that all employees are 
assessed in a fair and consistent way. further 
to this, we measure all our development and 
performance processes on a continuous 
basis and measure perception of training

agement assessments), promotion ratios etc.

ing years. this also goes for the representa-
tion of women in the principal and partner 
group as more women are being promoted to 
managers. it may take time to achieve our set 
target, but we are determined to do all within 
our power to achieve our goals and will con-
tinue our efforts towards female representa-
tion in management positions.
with a diverse management we can challenge 
each other and open for new ways of think-
ing. the management in netcompany is com-
posed of a variety of different profiles both in 
terms of gender, educational backgrounds, 
nationalities, and generations. we support 
and encourage diversified management in all 
layers of the organisation and will keep safe-
guarding our mentality of inclusion.

diversity and diversity at manage-
ment level
a great part of including more women in 
management is to ensure more women in 
the workforce in general. to this end, we 
interviewed a focus group of women in 
netcompany in 2020 and initiated an analy-
sis of how we can attract more women to 
join us. based on the results we are currently 
investigating what initiatives we should pri-
oritise and proceed with and we are excited 
to follow up on this in 2021. 
to increase focus on our female talent pool 
and to secure a diverse and inclusive culture, 
we have further updated our diversity policy

employee development interviews, and aim 
to offer a sensible work/life balance for all. 
our efforts towards gender equality and 
inclusion also apply to the general composi-
tion of the management, as it is highly 
important to us that it is comprised of a wide 
range of profiles. this is so that netcompany 
may represent all sides of the societies we 
are working in and accomplish great results, 
which we believe is best achieved through 
the potency of different mindsets. 
results and development
last year we set an ambitous target of 13% 
females in management positions by the end 
of 2020. this year’s results show that we have 
had a 1% decline from last year with 11% 
females registered at management level in 
2020. our target was an ambitious target 
considering the well-known challenges in 
recruiting women with the required seniority 
to accede management positions due to the 
general lack of women in current and previ-
ous generations. we chose to set an ambi-
tious target because we believe we can 
achieve it and as the numbers show we are 
also very close. to make sure that we go all 
the way and accomplish our set target, we 
have implemented several initiatives, as previ-
ously mentioned, and we are happy to see 
that our female talent pool of potential man-
agers is steadily growing. female representa-
tion at entry and senior level has, as such, 
been ascending during recent years, and we 
therefore expect to see an increase in the

our executive management and employees 
are all remunerated according to the same 
principles, taking into account the general 
salary level within netcompany, the responsi-
bilities and workload defined in the different 
positions, the general market standards, and 
standards within comparable companies.
in 2019 and 2020, client facing employees 
received an average increase in salary of 7% 
per employee. the executive management 
did not receive any increases in 2019 due to 
the general adjustment of their salary, fol-
lowing the introduction of netcompany to 
the public market in 2018. in 2020, the 
executive management received an increase 
in salary of 2.5%.
in 2021, the executive management will 
receive a 5% increase in salary. in compari-
son, client facing employees (partners and 
principals excluded) will receive an increase 
in salary corresponding to an average of 7% 
per employee.
ceo pay-ratio
this is the first year that we report on 
netcompany’s ceo pay-ratio. to provide a 
transparent and meaningful insight of the 
pay-ratio, we have chosen to base the 
reporting on all netcompany entities as 
opposed to netcompany group a/s where 
only the executive management is employed.
in 2017, the ceo pay-ratio was 1:06, reﬂect-
ing that the main element of the ceo remu-
neration then was embedded in the share-
holding of netcompany to be ipo’ed. as 
previously mentioned, the executive 
management did not receive any salary 
increase in 2019 due to the general adjust-
ment mid 2018 following the ipo of 
netcompany. however, since the increase in 
2018 happened during the year, the ratio 
increased from 1:12 in 2018 to 1:17 in 2019. in 
2020, the ratio increased to 1:18, which was 
mainly caused by the long term incentive 
programme being gradually built up. the

the right to data protection and privacy are 
fundamental rights, which must always be 
respected and protected in line with any 
other fundamental rights. with the digital 
transformation, the importance of safe-
guarding the right to data protection and 
privacy has become even more imperative 
than ever as vast amounts of data are daily 
being processed with little regulation and 
sometimes at high risk for the data subjects.
as an it service provider, we handle large 
amounts of data, both in our role as an 
employer and on behalf of our customers. at 
netcompany, we understand the great 
responsibility that our data processing activi-
ties entail, and we take this responsibility very 
seriously. the protection of data, including 
personal data, is and always has been one of 
the core foundations of netcompany’s busi-

tion and the netcompany methodology. we 
take great pride in being a responsible busi-

in denmark obtained the iso/iec 27001

netcompany uk and netcompany vietnam

in 2020, a new regulation was adopted  
into the danish financial statements act 
section 99(d), making it a requirement for 
companies of a certain size to account for 
their data ethics policy in the annual report 
based on the principle of comply or explain. 
even though the reporting is first made 
mandatory as of the financial year begin-
ning on 1 january 2021 or later, we have 
chosen to report on netcompany’s data 
ethics principles and policy now. the reason 
behind this is that we firmly believe in the

security, integrity and trust
case story
netcompany’s data ethics policy and data 
ethical principles are embodied in three key 
principles: security, integrity, and trust.
technical and organisational security is an 
essential part of any safe data processing, 
and netcompany’s daily operations are con-
sequently based on a highly detailed secu-
rity policy and organisational procedures, 
which are founded on the international 
security standard iso/iec 27001. we pro-
cess all data with the outmost respect of 
the individuals and the sensitivity of the 
data - all to earn the trust of our customers, 
employees, shareholders and any other 
stakeholders.
at netcompany, we process personal data 
as both data controller and data processor. 
when processing data as data controller, we 
mainly process data about our employees 
and job applicants, which is provided by the 
employees and job applicants themselves. 
when processing data as data processor, it 
is done on behalf of our customers.  
the data is provided by our customers e.g. 
in connection to the maintenance or hosting 
of their systems. 
the data we process both relates to regular 
personal data, such as names, addresses, 
and phone numbers, and sensitive personal 
data such as health information or union 
membership. whether we process regular 
or sensitive personal data it is always part 
of our data ethical considerations what type 
of data we are processing, as we always 
want to make sure that the right security 
measures are implemented so they may cor-
respond to the sensitivity of the data. 
internal audit controls are implemented to 
secure compliance with both information 
security and data protection requirements, 
and all our employees are continuously 
trained in the netcompany methodology, 
which embodies data protection security 
through a complete set of guidelines, tools, 
and templates for planning, delivering, man-
aging, and documenting complex integrated 
it solutions. further to this, all data is 
securely stored at two different data cen-
tres, making sure that data availability is 
always upheld in the unlikely event of tech-
nical failures. 
we do not sell or profit from data in any 
way and our use of artificial intelligence and 
machine learning is considered with due 
regard to our data ethical principles and 
policy.

business ethics are and always have been a 
vital part of netcompany’s way of doing 
business. unfortunately, not everyone shares 
the same values, and bribery and corruption 
are regrettably an unavoidable part of the 
world we live in. as part of society we must 
take responsibility for minimising unethical 
behaviour and practices to the furthest of 
our abilities. as a step on this road, we have 
implemented an anti-bribery and anti-
corruption policy, in which netcompany 
clearly disassociates itself from any type or 
form of bribery and corruption.
the anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy 
supplements netcompany’s code of conduct 
by providing minimum standards for compli-
ance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery 
laws. furthermore, the policy stipulates strict 
company guidelines that all  employees, 
board members, agents, suppliers, and other 
business partners must adhere to. alongside 
this, our code of conduct also stipulates that 
all associated with netcompany’s business 
dealings must always abide by applicable 
laws and regulations, as well as good busi-
ness practices and ethical behaviour.
anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption
due to the many and substantial it projects 
that netcompany delivers to public authori-
ties, special attention is brought to this area 
in the anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
policy. to this extent – and to the general 
extent of eliminating bribery and corruption – 
netcompany has also implemented a system 
of approval, where the receiving or offering 
of gifts, meals, and other entertainment ges-
tures, must be approved by a superior. this 
aligns with our systematic control of all com-
pany expenses which must be attached to an 
appendix and approved by two independent 
parties, ensuring that no amounts are leaving 
the company without just cause.
netcompany’s anti-bribery and anti-
corruption policy, as well as netcompany’s 
code of conduct, is mandatory reading for all 
company employees and is part of the 
onboarding programme. in 2020, we launched 
an awareness campaign about our anti-
bribery and anti-corruption policy reminding 
our employees about our guidelines. 
along with netcompany’s internal policies 
and procedures, we have also implemented  
a whistle-blower system to further minimise 
the potential risks of bribery and corruption. 
the whistle-blower system allows all to 
anonymously report any unethical or crimi-
nal behaviour, or suspicion thereof. the 
reports are investigated by an external law 
firm and always handled with the utmost 
respect and seriousness.
there have been no reports made to our 
whistle-blower system regarding bribery or 
corruption during 2020.
as part of society, we must take  
 responsibility  for  minimising unethical   
behaviour and practices to the furthest  
of  our abilities

governance
risk management is an important part of any 
sustainable company, including netcompany, 
as it helps protect both financial and reputa-
tional values. at netcompany, risk manage-
ment is a fundamental part of our everyday 
business, and all substantial risks are 
reported to the executive management and 
the board of directors correspondingly.
as a service provider with a high number of 
employees, our main risk within the field of 
governance is our employees’ compliance 
with current regulations and legislation, as 
well as internal policies and procedures. this 
also applies in our dealings with external 
business partners and other collaborators, 
who may not always share the same values 
and ethical beliefs that we do.
to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and 
violations of legislation we have implemented 
a whistle-blower system, where reports may 
be filed without any fear of repercussions. 
further to this, all our employees are required 
to acquaint themselves with our corporate 
policies, which are followed up with internal 
awareness campaigns.
living in a digital age, cybercrime is of 
course also a risk and a risk that we take 
very seriously. it security is a top priority in 
netcompany and we have implemented 
numerous technical and organisational secu-
rity measures to mitigate any potential 
threats, just as we have implemented inter-
nal processes, continuously monitoring our 
cyber security. further to this, we provide 
governance 
risks
security training for our employees on a 
continual basis, so they may always be ready 
to take appropriate action if a situation 
should ever occur. 
as a large and continuously growing com-
pany, we must anticipate that our business 
and governance risk will rise and change over 
time. for this reason we will continue to iden-
tify and address all potential risks so that we 
may continue to uphold a strong corporate 
sustainability.

esg in the future
2020 showed us that digital readiness is key in the 
world today. digital solutions have tied societies and 
people together to an extent we have never seen 
before. this has only strengthened our belief that by 
contributing to building strong, sustainable societies, 
we help make the world a better and safer place for 
us all. 
in 2021, we will keep delivering projects that help 
transform governmental institutions and businesses 
and create a framework for a sustainable, digital 
future. in 2021, we also hope that with covid-19 vac-
cines in place, we can start reopening and rebuilding 
society. 
as a responsible organisation, we will continuously 
look at how we can make a stronger contribution to 
moving our society forward. by developing stronger 
digital minds and skills, offering development and 
equal opportunities for all, finding greener solutions 
to how we operate, and ensuring secure and trans-
parent collaborations with all our stakeholders.
in 2021 and onwards, we will continue to do this, so 
that we together can create a stronger society and 
better future for us all.
2020 showed us that  digital readiness  is
