introduction
for	topdanmark,	csr	means	a	close	link	
between	business	and	sustainability.	every	
day,	we	work	to	create	financial	and	social	
security	for	our	customers,	employees	
and	in	society	–	and	we	want	to	contribute	
to	solutions	for	climate	changes.		
	
it	is	our	ambition	to	firmly	anchor	and	
integrate	csr	fully	into	our	core	business	
and	business	model.	in	2020,	we	have	
once	again	taken	steps	to	ensure	further	
csr	integration	into	the	entire	value	
chain,	and	we	expect	to	have	a	joint	
strategy	and	action	plan	ready	in	2021.		
	
when	looking	at	2020,	the	year	for	
topdanmark	has	also	been	marked	
by	covid-19,	and	we	have	helped	a	
record	number	of	customers	with	the	
consequences	of	the	pandemic.	thus,	we	
have	very	much	lived	up	to	the	customer	
promise	we	launched	this	year:	“we	are	
here	to	help.”	a	promise	which	underlines	
that	we	take	care	of	our	customers	all	
through	their	lives,	and	we	proactively	
help	with	service	and	advice	when	needed.		
the	new	top	promise		helps	set	the	
direction	for	our	csr	work	and	take	
responsibility	and	assist	our	customers.	
not	only	ensuring	their	financial	assets	
but	also	their	health.	among	our	health	
offerings,	we	have	launched	a	free	online	
medical	assistance	app	in	2020.	it	is	
called	sundhedshjælp	(health	support),	
and	so	far,	it	has	been	offered	to	500,000	
private	insurance	customers.		
	
likewise,	2020	marks	a	milestone	for	
the	integration	of	sustainability	into	
our	pension	products.	in	february,	we	
launched	formålspension	(purpose	
pension)	in	which	the	customers	can	
choose	green	transformation	as	one	
of	four	specific	investment	purposes.	
furthermore,	all	investments	are	subject	
to	extended	esg	requirements	and	
exclusion	of	e.g.	companies	producing	
fossil	fuel.	less	than	a	year	after	the	
launch,	the	investments	in	formålspension	
have	already	rounded	dkk	1bn.		
	
we	have	strengthened	our	focus	on	
responsible	investments	by	appointing	
an	esg	asset	manager,	and	we	have	
set	an	objective	of	having	approx.	
20%	of	provisions	placed	in	the	green	
transformation	by	2020.	
in	2020,	we	have	also	continued	the	
work	on	our	ambition	from	last	year’s	
csr	report	of	becoming	co2	neutral	in	
2030.	more	specifically,	we	have	had	a	
reduction	of	15%	compared	with	2019.	
furthermore,	we	have	looked	into	how	
we	can	reduce	co2	emission	in	the	entire	
value	chain.	
we	are	committed	to	a	serious	and	
ambitious	approach	to	csr,	and	since	
2010,	we	have	been	affiliated	to	the	un	
global	compact.	we	want	to	send	a	clear	
signal	to	the	surrounding	world	that	we	
are	proud	of	our	many	csr	actions,	which	
you	can	read	more	about	on	the	following	
pages.
i	hope	you	enjoy	reading	the	csr	report!

welcome to topdanmark’s csr report 2020, in which

sustainability.

topdanmark’s	primary	task	is	to	help	our	
customers.	therefore,	we	have	defined	a	
top	promise	in	2020:	we	are	here	to	help.	
the	promise	is	the	foundation	of	our	daily	
work	in	which	we	want	to	make	a	difference	
for	our	customers.	it	is	also	the	foundation	
of	our	customer	aspiration:	
“as	a	topdanmark	customer,	you	need	not	
worry	about	insurance	and	pension.	we	
will	take	care	of	this	for	you.	based	upon	
your	requirements,	we	make	provisions	
for	your	security.	making	sure	that	being	a	
topdanmark	customer	is	easy	and	simple.	
we	are	proactive	and	available	when	you	
need	our	assistance.”
the	customer	aspiration	reflects	that	
we	want	to	help	our	customers	with	our	
products	and	services	regardless	of	the	
situation.	not	only	do	we	want	to	protect	
our	customers’	financial	assets	but	also	
their	health.	
we	want	to	be	proactive	and	help	with	
prevention,	so	that	damage	and	injuries	
do	not	occur,	and	we	want	to	promote	
well-being	and	health.	when	the	damage	is	
done	or	the	customer	has	fallen	ill,	we	help	
limit	the	consequences	in	the	best	possible	
way	and	we	pay	out	compensation.	we	also	
help	our	customers	with	advice	and	pension	
payments	when	working	life	ends.	we	take	
responsibility	for	our	customers	–	and	we	
want	to	be	the	best	at	it.

introduction
the importance of the main stakeholders 
topdanmark	has	three	mutually	
dependent	main	stakeholders:	
customers,	employees	and	
shareholders.
our	starting	point	is	that	
qualified	and	committed	
employees	in	an	organisation	
with	a	high	level	of	well-being	
and	job	satisfaction	are	a	
prerequisite	for	achieving	
high	customer	satisfaction.	
customer	satisfaction	is	again	
crucial	for	customer	retention	
and	recommendations	–	and	
thus	a	prerequisite	for	creating	
a	good	business	–	which	again	
is	key	in	ensuring	satisfied	
shareholders	by	achieving	a	
long-term,	competitive	and	
stable	return.
our business structure
our	distribution	structure	is	to	combine	our	own	sales	channels	such	
as	online	sales	via	the	website,	insurance	agents	and	telephone	sales,	
and	sales	and	referrals	through	a	number	of	partners.	
6
how we work with csr
for topdanmark, csr means a link between business and sustainability. every day, we 
work to create financial and social security for all our customers, for our employees and for 
society in general– and we contribute with solutions to the climate challenges.
introduction
topdanmark’s	promise	of	helpfulness,	the	
top	promise,	and	customer	aspiration	
also	form	the	basis	for	our	approach	
to	csr	and	sustainability.	through	
our	products	and	advice,	we	help	our	
customers	and	contribute	to	financial	and	
social	security.	however,	we	also	want	
to	contribute	to	the	development	of	a	
socially	and	environmentally	sustainable	
society.		
we	want	to	make	a	difference	in	the	
society	of	which	we	are	part	of	by	playing	
an	active	part	in	the	solution	of	general	
social	problems	i.a.	within	climate,	the	
environment,	health	and	well-being.	we	
want	to	contribute	both	through	our	
products	and	advice	by	applying	our	
knowledge	to	relevant	partnerships,	and	
by	supporting	and	contributing	to	selected	
projects	and	organisations.	
part of the un global compact
we	are	part	of	the	un	global	compact,	
and	we	continuously	analyse	how	we	
can	integrate	the	ten	principles	into	
our	csr	and	busines	strategy.	this	also	
includes	an	analysis	of	where	we	are	at	
risk	of	non-compliance	with	the	principles	
and	the	potential	consequences	to	our	
business.	furthermore,	we	also	include	
the	expectations	of	our	stakeholders	as	
well	as	general	csr	risk	assessments.	
un’s sustainable development goals 
we	also	want	to	contribute	to	the	un’s	
17	sustainability	goals	by	impacting	a	
positive	development	and	by	ensuring	
that	we	do	not	contribute	to	a	negative	
development.	we	have	chosen	to	work	
with	a	number	of	specific	sustainability	
goals	to	focus	on	as	we	believe	them	to	
be	the	most	relevant	in	respect	to	our	
business	and	csr	strategy.	
in	the	sections	of	this	report,	the	
sustainability	goals	in	question	will	be	
evident	as	well	as	how	we	contribute.	
organisation of csr 
the board of directors:	approves	csr	policies,	policies	on	active	ownership	and	
diversity	policies	
executive management: approves	annual	csr	reporting,	selected	policies	and	
projects	
csr steering committee:	consists	of	nine	general	managers	with	our	head	of	
secretariat	(strategy	and	csr)	as	chairman.	the	steering	committee	is	responsible	
for	the	csr	strategy	and	action	plan,	csr	and	esg	reporting,	and	evaluation	of	
results.	four	meetings	are	held	annually.	
csr manager:	ensures	implementation	of	the	csr	strategy,	prepares	csr	and	
esg	reporting	and	other	communication.	engages	in	dialogue	with	ngos	and	other	
stakeholders. 
in	2020,	our	csr	officer	was	moved	organisationally	to	be	part	of	the	management	
secretariat.	this	is	to	ensure	increased	focus	on	csr	across	topdanmark’s	business	
units	and	divisions	and	a	stronger	link	to	our	business	strategy.	read	more	about	
the	organisation	of	responsible	investments	on	page	31.
7
reporting
we	prepare	an	annual	mandatory	csr	
report,	which	is	also	a	progress	report	for	
the	un	global	compact.	it	thus	constitutes	
our	mandatory	report	on	corporate	
social	responsibility	(see	sections	132a	
and	132b	of	danish	executive	order	
on	financial	reports	for	insurance	
companies	and	lateral	pension	funds).	
our	aim	with	this	report	is	to	present	
an	open	and	transparent	description	of	
topdanmark	and	our	work	with	social	
responsibility.	
esg report with data
we	also	publish	an	annual	esg	report	(in	
english)	which	primarily	contains	data,	
method	description	and	comments	on	
selected	key	figures,	and	it	also	covers	the	
financial	year	concerned.	with	the	report,	
we	want	to	meet	the	need	of	investors	
and	esg	rating	agencies	to	get	a	quick	
overview	of	esg	objectives	and	indicators.
limitations and evaluation of data
the	csr	report	as	well	as	the	esg	
report	cover	the	financial	year	2020.	
the	reports	apply	to	all	subsidiaries	of	
topdanmark.	in	the	esg	report	for	2020,	
the	method	for	the	calculation	of	data	is	
thoroughly	explained.
climate report
topdanmark	reports	to	the	cdp	(carbon	
disclosure	project),	an	international	
environment	reporting	initiative,	which	
works	for	transparency	and	dialogue	
around	co2	emissions	and	climate	
strategies	in	businesses.	the	purpose	
is	to	make	this	knowledge	available	to	
investors	and	other	stakeholders.	
a	report	is	awarded	a	score	on	the	
following	scale:	a,	a-,	b,	b-,	c,	c-,	d,	d-	
with	a	being	the	highest	possible	score.	in	
2019,	topdanmark’s	report	scored	a	c.	
in	2021,	we	also	expect	to	report	on	the	
recommendations	from	task	force	on	
climate-related	financial	disclosures.

materiality assessment 
our csr actions are selected based on 
three overall criteria. 
• risks: areas	which	pose	a	financial	or	
reputational	risk	to	our	business.		
• opportunities:	areas	in	which	we	can	
contribute	to	a	sustainable	develop-
ment	of	society	through	our	products	
and	services,	and	at	the	same	time	be-
nefit	our	business.		
	
• responsibility:	areas	in	which	we	have	
a	special	responsibility	to	prevent	a	
direct	or	indirect	impact	on	people,	so-
ciety,	climate	and	the	environment,	and	
areas	to	which	we	contribute	positively	
through	our	organisation.	
the	requirements	and	expectations	from	
a	number	of	stakeholders	are	included	in	
the	analysis,	e.g.	employees,	customers,	
investors,	professional	associations,	
suppliers,	ngos,	governmental	institutions	
and	esg	rating	agencies.	
in	the	table	to	the	right,	the	result	of	the	
analysis	is	illustrated	and	provides	the	
connection	to	the	seven	overall	themes	of	
our	strategy.

future plans 
it	is	our	ambition	to	fully	embed	
and	integrate	csr	into	our	core	
business	and	business	model,	
and	at	the	same	time	contribute	
positively	to	a	sustainable	
development	of	the	society	of

taken	several	initiatives	for	
full	integration,	but	we	are	not

expect	to	have	ready	a	strategy,

and	an	action	plan	for	2025.	this	
also	includes	an	assessment	of	
the	extent	to	which	it	is	possible	
to	analyse	any	negative	impact	
on	the	sustainable	development	
goals	from	our	business	and

indledning
customer relations
at topdanmark, we want to build trust and create good 
customer relations through high-quality service and advice 
with a focus on transparency and good communication at 
eye level. 2020 has also been marked by covid-19.
with	our	products	and	services,	we	want	to	help	our	
customers	regardless	of	the	situation.	we	want	to	
address	our	customers’	concerns	in	everyday	life	and	
help	them	along	in	life.	with	the	sales	of	our	products	
and	services,	we	have	a	big	responsibility	-	which	we	
take	very	seriously.
responsibility	is	about	i.a.	being	attentive	to	the	risks	
relating	to	our	business	e.g.	
•	 inappropriate	customer	advice	and	product	sales	so	
that	the	cover	does	not	match	the	customer’s	wants	
and	needs
•	 lack	of	clarity	on	terms	and	conditions,	prices	and	fees
•	 errors	in	our	claims	handling	so	that	the	customer	
does	not	receive	the	correct	compensation.
in	order	to	minimise	these	risks	and	to	increase	the	value	
for	the	customer,	we	continuously	work	on	improving	
our	customer	services,	claims	process	and	sales	process.	
in	the	customer	relation,	we	always	strive	to:
•	 be	easy	to	understand,	accessible,	precise	and	balan-
ced	product	information
•	 be	transparent	regarding	price	increases
•	 ensure	that	the	customer	has	easy	and	fair	claims	
handling
•	 give	the	customer	easy	access	to	a	fair	complaints	
process

responsible sales 
we want our customers to have the cover that specifically matches their needs and 
requests. this way, they will enjoy the financial and social security that they need. we 
are aware that this requires that customers receive good and accurate advice from 
competent employees. 
all	our	salespersons	are	trained	at	
forsikringsakademiet	(the	insurance	
academy),	and	new	employees	are	
thoroughly	trained	in	topdanmark’s	
business	procedures	for	what	we	consider	
to	be	an	expedient	and	responsible	
sales	process.	we	also	ensure	ongoing	
improvement	of	the	skills	and	personal	
competences	of	all	our	employees.	
	
directive on correct communication
topdanmark	has	implemented	idd	
(insurance	distribution	directive),	a	
european	directive	on	correct	insurance	
communication,	which	has	now	been	
applied	to	danish	national	rules.	the	rules	
have	been	set	up	to	ensure	increased	
consumer	protection.	this	means,	among	
other	things,	that	our	employees	are	
obliged	to	clearly	state	what	coverage	is	
provided	with	our	insurance,	so	that	the	
customer	can	make	an	informed	choice.
quality requirements are monitored
we	have	central	as	well	as	several	local	
compliance	units,	which	ensure	that	our	
salespersons	adhere	to	our	business	
processes	and	quality	requirements.	we	
have	a	reporting	system	which	means	
that	we	evaluate	inappropriate	situations	
to	improve	customer	service	and	avoid	
mistakes,	e.g.	in	our	claims	handling.
easy-to-understand product 
information 
we	service	and	provide	advice	on	subjects	
and	situations	that	may	be	complicated	
for	our	customers.	for	example,	this	
applies	when	purchasing	our	products	
–	particularly	online	and	without	direct	
contact	to	an	employee.	
therefore,	we	have	prepared	information	
on	products,	prices	and	coverage	so	that	
it	is	easy	to	comprehend	and	find.	it	is	also	
clearly	stated	what	is	not	covered.
when	topdanmark	prepares	new	
insurance	terms,	customer	feedback	is	
included	in	addition	to	general	experience.	
all	information	on	the	insurance	is	stated	
in	the	terms	-	no	information	is	hidden	or	
‘written	in	small	print’
the price reflects the concrete risk 
we	use	micro	tariffing	to	determine	the	
price	on	our	insurance	products.	this	
means	that	the	price	is	based	on	a	number	
of	criteria	to	reflect	the	concrete	risk	as	
well	as	the	competitive	situation	for	the	
given	situation.	
the	criteria	that	we	use	are	based	on	
actual	experiences	with	our	hundred	
thousand	of	customers.	we	use	both	
statistical	customer	data	as	well	external	
data	and	analyses,	e.g.	national	statistical	
weather	data,	local	theft	statistics	etc.	
control procedures
we	have	strict	guidelines	and	procedures,	
including	control	procedures,	for	the	
calculation	of	prices	which	ensure	that	
only	actuarial	relevant	criteria	are	used.	
we	do	not	use	the	individual	customer’s

race	or	ethnical	background	as	criteria	for	
our	pricing.	this	also	applies	for	gender	
for	the	individual	pricing.	note	that	for	
individual	contracts	entered	before	the	
change	in	legislation	in	2012,	gender	
was	used	for	pricing.	thus,	gender	can

our	prices	are	transparent,	and	thus	it	is	
always	clear	to	our	customers	what	they	
should	pay.	fees	which	are	not	directly	
related	to	the	insurance	price	are	stated	
on	our	website,	e.g.	early	termination	fee.	
changes	to	fees	are	notified	according	to

fair and easy claims handling  
topdanmark wants to help customers and ensure that they always receive easy and fair 
claims handling, so that they feel comfortable with the products they have purchased from 
us. our objective is for customers to receive compensation quickly, efficiently, with great 
service and according to the terms of the policy.
we	have	implemented	solutions	that	
ensure	that	our	customers	quickly	get	an	
understanding	of	how	they	are	covered	
and	how	the	further	process	will	be.	we	
continue	to	improve	these	solutions.	
we pay attention to errors
we	process	more	than	300,000	claims	
a	year.	therefore,	errors	cannot	be	
completely	avoided	in	our	claims	
handling	–	e.g.	errors	in	data	entry	when	
creating	a	claim.	we	aim	for	as	few	
errors	as	possible,	as	errors	are	of	great	
inconvenience	to	our	customers.	
when	we	become	aware	of	an	error,	we	
fix	it	immediately.	if	the	error	has	an	
impact	on	the	customer’s	compensation	
or	the	future	process	that	the	customer	
has	to	go	through,	we	pay	any	difference	
that	may	be	and	inform	the	customer	
accordingly.
in	order	to	minimise	the	number	of	errors,	
our	claims	handling	is	continuously	
quality	assured	through	internal	controls,	
dialogue	with	employees	and	feedback	
from	customers.	the	best	sparring	for	
improvement	we	actually	get	from	the	
customers	who	have	been	through	a	
claims	process.

error in the compensation for pregnant 
women was discovered in 2020
unfortunately,	like	other	insurance	and	
pension	companies,	topdanmark	has	
had,	for	a	number	of	years,	derogations	
for	pregnant	women	as	part	of	the	
insurance	terms	particularly	for	our	
health	insurances,	but	also	to	a	lesser	
extent	for	other	insurances,	e.g.	travel	
insurance	and	accident	insurance.	
the	reason	for	this	is	that	we	have	
not	paid	sufficient	attention	to	the	
special	legislation	for	equality	within	
insurance	which	means	that	pregnant	
women	should	be	treated	equally	to	
non-pregnant	women.	
therefore,	we	have	unjustified	
dismissed	some	pregnant	women	with	
pregnant-related	injuries/illnesses	
which	typically	require	physiotherapy	
and	chiropractic	treatment.	likewise,	
there	have	been	errors	in	the	treatment	
of	pregnant	women	in	connection	with	
other	insurances.	
practice has been rectified
we	became	aware	of	the	problem	
when	it	was	brought	up	in	the	industry	
association	insurance	&	pension	
denmark	(forsikring	&	pension)	in	2020.	
we	have	rectified	our	practice,	and	we	
comply	with	the	guidelines	from	the	
gender	equality	board.	subsequently,	
we	have	identified	as	many	customers	
as	possible,	and	initiated	the	process	
of	contacting	them.	and	we	have	
provided	the	affected	customers	with	
the	compensation	to	which	they	were	
entitled	to	the	greatest	possible	extent.	
furthermore,	we	have	asked	our	
external	auditors	to	check	the	process	
for	the	identification	of	the	affected	
parties.	
in	2021,	we	will	continue	to	investigate	
how	the	error	could	occur.	furthermore,	
we	have	initiated	a	due	diligence	
process	to	ensure	that	similar	cases	of	
discriminating	claims	handling	can	be	
avoided.

assistance to customers during 
covid-19
the	year	2020	has	to	a	great	extent	been	
marked	by	covid-19.	we	have	been	very	
busy	helping	the	customers	with	travel	
insurance	with	us	when	e.g.	they	could	not	
travel	as	planned	or	were	stranded	abroad.	
in	march	and	april,	we	had	a	141%	
increase	in	email	enquiries	compared	with	
the	same	period	in	2019,	and	a	417%	
increase	in	telephone	enquiries.	also,	a	far	
greater	number	of	claims	for	the	travel	
insurance	was	reported	compared	with	the	
year	before	–	a	268%	increase.	
in	record-time,	we	were	able	to	establish	
an	emergency	task	force	to	handle	the	
many	claims,	and	this	made	it	possible	to	
handle	the	extra	workload	that	our	travel	
department	faced.	
helping danish businesses 
we	also	wanted	to	contribute	to	the	
danish	businesses	making	it	through	
this	extraordinary	situation	–	and	society	
in	general.	therefore,	we	came	up	with	
solutions	to	help	our	different	customer,	
e.g.	in	terms	of	liquidity.	here	is	a	number	
of	examples:
•	 both	business	and	private	customers	
with	topdanmark	livsforsikring	were	
able	to	get	a	reduction	or	periodic	stop	
for	employers	and/or	employees’	contri-
bution	to	pension	savings.	
•	 commercial	and	agricultural	customers	
could	change	to	monthly	payments	
without	the	normal	fee.	
•	 private	customers,	who	were	carrying	
out	emergency	services	or	other	volun-
tary	work	in	connection	with	covid-19,	
kept	their	premium	on	their	accident	
and/or	personal	accident	insurance	even	
though	their	risk	profile	changed	with	
the	voluntary	work.
•	 free	counselling	was	offered	to	our	mink	
farming	customers
•	 businesses	that	needed	to	reorganize	
their	operations	to	help	society	in	the	
strained	situation,	e.g.	with	producing	
hand	sanitizer,	we	swiftly	helped	in	get-
ting	cover.	
examples of other activities in 2020
•	 customers	were	contacted	by	telephone	
instead	of	by	post	if	we	had	complex	
messages	to	convey	e.g.	in	connection	
with	a	claim	–	and	thus	we	want	to	en-
sure	that	the	customer	concerned	is	fee-
ling	well	informed.
•	 to	a	greater	extent	than	previously,	we	
have	contacted	customers	by	telephone	
to	ensure	that	they	have	the	relevant	in-
surance	cover	for	their	wants	and	needs.

evaluation of customer 
satisfaction in 2020
the	results	of	the	internal	and	external	
surveys	point	to	different	directions.	the	
internal	surveys	show	improvement,	e.g.	
we	have	an	increase	in	tnps	for	customers	
who	have	called	us.	it	is	more	than	10	
points	higher	than	in	2019,	which	is	a	very	
satisfactory	result.	we	see	it	as	an	indicator	
of	us	becoming	even	better	at	assisting	our	
customers	in	a	satisfactory	manner	both	
before,	during	and	after	a	claim.	
covid-19 has caused challenges
the	results	of	the	external	surveys	are	at	
the	same	time	satisfactory	and	giving	food	
for	thought.	according	to	the	epsi	survey,	
there	is	an	improvement	in	the	satisfaction	
level	of	our	commercial	customers,	which	
is	very	satisfactory.	however,	among	
private	customers,	the	satisfaction	level	
has	decreased	for	the	entire	non-life	
insurance	industry.	this	is	also	the	case	for	
topdanmark,	however,	less	than	for	our	
biggest	competitors.	
we	assess	that	the	decrease	in	the	epsi	
rating	is	mainly	due	to	covid-19	which	has	
challenged	our	ability	to	provide	the	service	
that	the	customer	expected	and	needed.	
likewise,	topdanmark	livsforsikring	drops	
in	the	aalund	rating	which	we	ascribe	
to	a	year	marked	by	instability	and	it	
implementations.

complaints are used to 
improve matters
topdanmark processes approx. 300,000 claims a 
year. therefore, it cannot be avoided that we receive 
complaints from customers about the compensation or 
service they have received. we use the complaints to 
improve our communication and advice.
insurance	and	pension	products	can	
be	difficult	to	understand,	and	in	some	
cases	the	compensation	or	assistance	
in	the	claims	situation	does	not	live	up	
to	the	customer’s	expectation.	this	may	
for	example	be	due	to	restrictions	in	the	
terms	of	which	the	customer	has	not	been	
aware,	or	that	the	customer	is	unable	to	
document	the	values	to	be	replaced.
we	attach	great	importance	to	our	
customers	being	clearly	informed	about	
their	avenues	of	complaint.	for	example,	
the	information	is	available	on	our	
website	and	in	our	correspondence	to	the	
customer	if	we	turn	down	compensation.	
we	endeavour	to	ensure	an	easy	and	fair	
complaint	process
internally,	we	use	customer	complaints	
to	assess	how	we	can	improve	our	
communication	and	advice.	
correct decision is the objective 
if,	in	private	insurance	cases,	the	
customer	disagrees	with	our	decision	
on	a	claim,	the	customer	is	entitled	to

(ankenævnet	for	forsikring).	the	number

demonstrates	that	our	decisions	are

not only do we want to protect our customers’ financial 
assets but also their health. therefore, health and 
well-being initiatives play a central role in our business. 
illness	and	injuries	often	have	far	greater	
consequences	than	just	the	financial	
consequence.	this	applies	to	both	the	
individual	customer,	to	topdanmark	and	
to	society	in	general.	
some	of	the	most	severe	injuries,	both	
physical	and	mental,	involve	the	risk	of	
losing	part	or	all	earnings	capacity,	and	
thus	contact	with	the	labour	market.	in	
the	last	resort,	this	can	lead	to	a	life	on	
disability	pension.
we	want	to	help	prevent	serious	injuries	
and	illnesses,	and	therefore,	health	and	
well-being	initiatives	are	such	a	central	
part	of	our	business.	when	an	injury	or	
illness	occurs,	we	also	have	initiatives	that	
help	limit	the	scope	of	the	injury	or	illness	
–	and	thus	help	the	injured	party	back	to	
everyday	life.	
our actions make a difference
many	initiatives	can	come	into	play	in	
relation	to	loss	of	earnings	capacity	
insurance,	health	insurance,	workers’	
compensation	and	liability	insurance.	
we	continuously	evaluate	our	different	
processes	and	methods,	and	evaluations	
show	that	the	actions	do	make	a	
difference	to	our	customers.

the	purpose	of	the	screening	is	to

can	be	combined	with	a	physical	health

topsund	shows	good	results
in	2020,	a	company	underwent	a	
follow-up	health	screening	after	they	
had	implemented	a	number	of	health	
initiatives	in	collaboration	with	topdan-
mark.	the	result	showed	a	significant	
improvement	on	all	health	parametres,	
and	in	the	same	period,	the	company	
reduced	their	expenses	for	absence	due	
to	illness.	
free workplace assessment for small 
companies 
in	2020,	we	offered	free	health	
screenings	and	help	to	carry	out	work-
place	assessments	for	small	companies	
a	pilot	project.	the	statutory	workplace	
assessment	can	be	a	burden	on	the	
small	companies	to	carry	out,	and	the-
refore,	it	is	often	omitted.	
health advice in the light of 
covid-19
based	on	the	covid-19	situation,	we	
have	paid	great	attention	to	advice	
on	physical	and	mental	well-being	at	
the	home	office.	counselling	has	been	
given	as	virtual	presentations	as	well	
as	by	sending	out	various	material	on	
health	and	well-being	targeted	at	the	
circumstances	during	the	restrictions	
in	force.	
topdanmark	livsforsikring	wants	to	have	
the	strongest	health	concept	on	the	market	
based	on	evidence	and	valid	research	results.	
therefore,	we	have	a	wide	range	of	health	
and	prevention	concepts	which	can	be	applied	
according	to	the	needs	and	challenges	of	the	
individual	businesses,	so	that	the	actions	make	
the	most	sense.	
topsund is targeted prevention 
one	of	the	specific	concepts	we	offer	our	
business	customers	is	topsund.	
the	core	of	the	concept	is	an	initial	online	health	
screening	which	includes	both	physical	and	
mental	health.	subsequently,	each	employee	
more health to the many
through our life insurance company, we work actively on creating physical and mental well-being with the employees 
in the businesses insured with us. thus, we come into contact with and help many people across society with their 
health, e.g. by health checks and screenings.

free health support through an app
in 2020, there has been an increased focus on the danes’ health – both physical and mental health. this focus we

sundhedshjælp	includes	two	services	
supplied	by	an	external	supplier:	
talk to a doctor
online	or	telephone	consultation	with	a	
danish	speaking	doctor	who	can	assist	
in	both	mild	and	more	severe	cases	of	
illness.	it	is	possible	to	book	consultations	
all	days	of	the	week	from	06	–	21	no	
matter	where	in	the	world	you	are.

assessment	(also	called	a	second	opinion)	
from	one	or	more	international	experts	
if	you	have	been	diagnosed	or	are	in	a	
course	of	an	illness.
the	support	is	freely	available	for	all	
registered	customers	and	employees,	
and	it	can	be	used	as	a	supplement	to	
the	regular	health	care	system.	with

improvement of mental 
health
more and more people get affected by stress and other 
mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression. in 
2020, topdanmark actively entered a new partnership to 
relieve the tendency. 
according	to	numbers	from	the	national	
research	centre	for	the	working	
environment	(nfa),	the	number	of	sick	
notes	due	to	mental	illness	have	increased	
in	recent	years	in	danish	society.	today,	
mental	health	issues	account	for	between	
26%	and	48%	of	the	total	absence	due	
to	illness	and	approx.	42%	of	all	early	
retirements	nationally.	
increased attention on mental health 
for	several	years,	topdanmark	has	made	
it	a	priority	to	take	action	in	regard	
to	mental	health,	partly	in	terms	of	
prevention,	and	partly	when	the	damage	
is	done.	this	focus	was	increased	in	
2020,	when	as	the	first	commercial	
pension	company	we	entered	into	
collaboration	with	sammen	om	mental	
sundhed	(together	on	mental	health)	–	a	
multidisciplinary	partnership	initiated	by	
the	danish	ministry	of	health.	by	doing	so,	
we	engage	to	work	for	improvement	of	
mental	health	in	workplaces	in	denmark.	
this	will	be	through	actions	for	both	our	
own	employees	and	for	the	employees	of	
our	business	customers.	
new knowledge for better advice
as	part	of	the	partnership,	we	expect	
to	have	the	latest	knowledge	in	the	
field	and	the	possibility	of	sparring	on	
new	evidence-based	initiatives	in	the	
workplaces.	thus	we	can	improve	our	
advice	and	health	products,	and	in	that	
way	contribute	to	improved	well-being	
and	less	absence	due	to	illness	in	society.

facts about the partnership
•	 the	aim	is	to	establish	binding	collaboration	with	relevant	stake-
holders	on	mental	health	at	the	workplace.
•	 the	target	group	is	all	workplaces	in	denmark	and	all	types	of	
employee.
•	 sammen	om	mental	sundhed	is	financed	via	the	budget.
•	 so	far,	the	partnership	consists	of	46	players	across	the	private

help after a severe injury or illness
when customers or people covered by our insurances are hit by severe illness or are severely injured, we try to help 
with individualised efforts, so that they can get back to normal everyday life. 
we	have	many	different	health	
programmes	which	we	apply	in	different	
situations.	we	apply	the	concept	
topomsorg®,	in	the	event	of	severe	and	
long-term	course	of	disease	of	injury	
covered	by	the	loss	of	earning	capacity	
insurance.	
individualised programme through 
topomsorg®
a	programme	with	topomsorg®	is	
individually	adjusted	with	a	focus	on	the	
situation	and	needs	of	the	individual.	this	
is	intended	to	help	the	claimant	back	to	
health	and	back	to	a	normal	everyday	life.	
we	attach	great	importance	to	starting	
the	efforts	as	early	as	possible	to	increase	
the	possibility	of	recovery.	
help where it benefits the most
with	topomsorg®,	we	offer	help	in	
the	areas	where	we	assess	that	help	is	
lacking,	and	where	it	is	most	beneficial.	
the	claimant	gets	affiliated	with	a	social	
worker	who	helps	navigate	between	
the	many	parties	involved	and	also	
helps	to	plan	the	optimal	programme	
of	treatment.	the	assistance	can	also	
consist	of	dialogue	with	the	workplace	and	
ultimately	help	in	finding	a	new	job.
we	also	cooperate	with	the	local	job	
centres,	so	that	the	sick	person	gets	
a	holistic	programme.	there	may	be	
situations	in	which	the	local	authorities	
do	not	have	the	opportunity	to	make	the	
necessary	efforts.
individualised programme for 
work-related injuries and third-party 
liability 
topdanmark	itself	employs	a	number	of	
social	workers	and	health	professionals,	
who	are	used	for	the	individual	
programmes	covered	by	workers’	
compensation	and	third-party	liability	
insurance.	furthermore,	we	employ	
specialists	for	specific	disease	areas.	this	
could	e.g.	be	rehabilitation	of	people	who	
have	been	seriously	injured	-	primarily	
work-related	injuries.	
an	individual	programme	is	planned,	
which	may	include	e.g.	counselling	
from	social	workers,	physiotherapists,	
psychologists	or	pain	doctors.

injuries.
help in getting back to normal everyday 
life 
we	continuously	evaluate	the	different	
efforts	and	concepts,	both	to	assess	
whether	they	really	do	help	the	claimants	
in	their	recovery	and	returning	to	a	
normal	everyday	life,	but	also	to	develop	
the	concepts.	our	overall	assessment	is	
that	the	efforts	do	help	the	claimants	in	
their	recovery	–	this	is	illustrated	in	the

in recent years, we have experienced more extreme 
weather as a result of higher temperatures and general 
climate change. we want to contribute with solutions that 
benefit both our customers and society.

we	contribute	specifically	to:	
12.5:	before	2030,	the	generation	of	
waste	should	be	reduced	significantly	
through	prevention,	reduction,	re-
covery	and	recycling.
we	also	contribute	to:
13.1:	strengthen	resilience	and	
adaptive	capacity	to	climate-related	
hazards	and	natural	disasters	in	all	
countries.	
the	more	extreme	weather	poses	a	
challenge	to	everybody,	also	to	us	as	an	
insurance	company.	we	need	both	quick	
solutions	to	how	we	adapt	to	changing	
weather	conditions	and	long-term	solutions	
in	which	everyone	should	be	involved	in	
partnerships:	citizens,	public	authorities,	
private	players,	ngos	-	and	topdanmark.
we	support	the	paris	agreement’s	target	of	
a	maximum	temperature	rise	of	1.5	degrees	
by	2050,	and	we	want	to	integrate	climate	
considerations	into	the	way	we	do	business.	
at	the	same	time,	we	want	to	support	the	
government’s	climate	act	and	the	goal	of	a	
70%	co2	reduction	in	2030.	
prevention and risk-based pricing 
to	an	insurance	company,	climate	changes	
pose	a	business	risk,	as	it	can	lead	to	
increased	claims	costs.	we	mitigate	the	risk	
e.g.	through	a	comprehensive	reinsurance	
programme,	preventive	actions	either	as	a	
requirement	to	the	customer	or	as	an	offer	
possibly	in	combination	with	a	reduction	of	
the	premium,	and	risk-based	pricing.	
climate-friendly solutions 
the	new	weather	challenges	also	call	for	
us	to	continuously	develop	new	products	
and	services	that	meet	the	customers’	new	
needs	for	security	and	stability	in	everyday	
life.	this	also	applies	in	situations	with	more	
extreme	weather.	
environmental challenges
in	addition	to	climate	change,	society	faces	
a	number	of	challenges	in	relation	to	our	
environment.	for	example,	in	denmark	
-	and	globally	-	there	is	a	reduction	of	
biodiversity,	too	much	nitrogen	emission	in	
maritime	areas,	and	excess	consumption	
of	resources.	we	want	to	contribute	
to	solutions	through	our	products	and	
services	and	the	way	we	handle	claims.

prevention – an innovative approach
prevention of damage to buildings and machines does not only benefit our customers, 
but also limits the negative impact on climate and the environment. we want to be 
front-runners within the field. 
prevention	of	damage	to	buildings	and	
machines	does	not	only	benefit	businesses	
and	farmers	as	it	provides	stable	
operations.	it	also	has	a	positive	impact	
on	both	climate	and	the	environment	as	it	
e.g.	prevents	water	spillage	and	prevents	
co2	emissions	by	limiting	the	need	for	
repairs	and	reconstruction.	
we	want	to	be	front-runners	within	
prevention,	and	therefore	we	continuously	
work	on	providing	new	solutions.	we	see	
a	potential	in	using	new	technologies	such	
as	iot	solutions.	
new solutions – and challenges 
we	have	an	experimenting	approach	
based	on	analyses	of	our	customers’	
needs	–	also	in	relation	to	climate	and	
environmental	problems.	in	collaboration	
with	relevant	partners	and	customers,	we	
test	the	new	solutions.	
however,	we	have	experienced	that	we	
are	not	always	successful	in	finding	new	
innovative	prevention	solutions	that	our	
customers	will	adopt.	for	example,	we	
have	offered	a	sensor	solution	for	slurry	
tanks	which	can	prevent	both	damage	to	
the	tank	and	limit	slurry	spillage,	while	at	
the	same	time	provide	the	farmer	with	
a	better	overview	of	the	capacity	of	the	
tank.	the	solution	was	free	of	charge,	
however,	the	interest	was	low.	
continued learning
we	learn	from	this	and	other	cases,	and	
we	continue	to	explore	and	experiment	
to	find	just	the	right	solutions	that	
prove	to	be	relevant	for	our	private,	
commercial	and	agricultural	customers.	
this	also	applies	in	relation	to	the	green	
transformation	which	occupies	many	of	
our	customers.

concept	of	donating	usable	furniture

instead	of	sending	it	for	incineration.	
the	idea	seemed	promising,	however,	it	
turns	out	that	in	practice,	the	quality	of	
the	furniture	is	too	low	to	be	sold	at	the	
charity	shops.	due	to	a	too	low	amount,	
the	project	was	terminated.	
sustainability in claims handling
as a non-life insurance company, we process much damage to buildings, cars and

help to farmers in climate changes 
more extreme weather can cause a lower crop yield for the farmers. with a new 
insurance, they can cover their losses caused by the weather.
the	consequences	of	climate	change	with	
more	extreme	and	unpredictable	weather	
can	adversely	affect	crop	yields,	and	thus	
hit	farmers	hard	financially.	therefore,	
as	the	first	danish	company,	we	have	
introduced	a	crop	insurance	that	provides	
compensation	for	loss	of	crop	yield	
caused	by	extreme	weather.	
stable operation and income
the	product	itself	does	not	directly	
contribute	to	solving	the	climate	
challenges,	but	it	helps	farmers	to	have	
a	more	stable	operation	during	the	
new	weather-related	circumstances.	
the	insurance	covers	up	to	80%	of	the	
farmer’s	lost	earnings.	in	the	future,	this	
may	help	to	smooth	cyclical	fluctuations	in	
relation	to	effects	of	the	climate	changes.
farmers expect more unstable weather 
prior	to	the	development	of	the	new	
insurance	product,	we	have	researched	
the	agricultural	sector’s	needs	and	
concerns	in	relation	to	severe	weather	in	
the	future,	and	how	it	will	affect	the	crop	
yield.	of	the	responding	farmers,	59%	
responded	that	they	expect	more	unstable	
weather	over	the	next	10	years.	drought,	
cloudbursts,	storms	and	hail	were	
primarily	identified	as	the	major	adverse	
climate	impacts	for	the	harvest.	the	same	
proportion	of	farmers	expressed	interest	
in	an	insurance	product.
activities in 2020 
after	launching	the	first	version	of	the	
crop	insurance,	the	cover	has	now	been	
extended,	so	we	are	now	able	to	offer	
the	insurance	on	the	most	common	
agricultural	crops	as	well	as	several	
specialised	crops.
the	product	has	been	well	received	on	the	
market,	but	as	with	all	new	products,	the	
customers	need	time	to	get	accustomed	
to	it.	furthermore,	as	the	weather	in	2020	
provided	the	farmers	with	nearly	optimum	
conditions	for	growth,	this	has	most	likely	
also	affected	the	interest	in	the	product.

investments
we want to give our customers the best possible return that can ensure their financial 
security when work life ends. at the same time, we make sure that the investments are 
responsible and support the paris agreement.
topdanmark	invests	both	the	insurance	
reserves	and	pension	customers’	savings	
until	the	funds	are	paid	in	the	form	of	
compensation,	pension	payments	and	
the	like.	topdanmark	wishes	to	attain	the	
biggest	possible	return	on	investments	in	
relation	to	risk,	but	we	also	wish	to	ensure	
that	value	creation	is	responsible	and	not	
in	contravention	of	the	internationally	
recognised	standards	and	principles	or	
conventions	adopted	by	denmark.
against	this	background,	we	have	
prepared	policies	on	responsible	
investments	and	active	ownership	which	
describe	the	criteria	applicable	to	our	
investment	activities.	we	have	our	own	
asset	management	which	invests	actively.	
that	means	that	we	select	for	ourselves	
which	shares,	bonds,	property	types	etc.	
to	invest	in	and	for	how	long.
in	2020,	we	have	strengthened	the	area	
by	appointing	an	esg	asset	manager.
support to the paris agreement
in	the	investment	activities	undertaken	by	
topdanmark	livsforsikring,	topdanmark	
will	take	into	account	the	transformation	
of	the	energy	supply	in	accordance	with	
the	un	climate	convention	unfccc	-	
which	the	paris	agreement	is	part	of.	
against	this	background,	the	company	
has	set	a	goal	that	green	investments	will	
constitute	approx.	20%	of	the	provisions	
in	topdanmark	livsforsikring	in	2030.
new policy on responsible investments
topdanmark’s	policy	on	responsible	
investments	was	updated	in	2020.	based	
on	the	un	global	compact,	the	policy	
takes	the	identification	of	potential	
negative	impact	as	a	starting	point.	
we	have	a	process	for	exclusion	of	
companies	in	the	event	of	continued	
and	verified	breaches	of	the	un	global	
compact,	as	well	as	exclusion	of	
companies	producing	thermal	coal	and	
tar	sands	(the	revenue	threshold	is	max.	
5%),	and	exclusion	of	all	companies	that	
produce	smoking	tobacco.	
we	do	not	invest	in	the	production	of	
controversial	weapons.	likewise,	we	
have	a	limit	to	which	government	bonds	
topdanmark	invests	in.
the	policy	is	implemented	through	
continuous	screening	and	evaluation	of	
existing	and	potential	investments	in	
order	to	identify	any	breaches	of	the	un	
global	compact.	
integration of esg factors
in	2020,	we	started	to	integrate	esg	
factors	(environment,	social	and	
governance)	into	the	investment	process	
with	the	aim	of	assessing	the	return	
potential	based	on	both	conventional	
financial	analysis	and	from	a	sustainable	
perspective.	
likewise,	we	have	started	to	apply	
company-specific	esg	and	co2	analyses	
i.a.	to	assess	the	companies’	exposure	to	
the	green	transformation.	
see	the	result	of	our	analyses	in	the	chart

new policy on active 
ownership
in 2020, our policy on active ownership was also updated 
with a new ambition on active ownership.  
as	active	owners,	topdanmark	will	
support	the	long-term	value	creation	
of	the	companies	in	which	we	invest.	
henceforth,	we	will	conduct	active	
ownership	to	a	greater	extent	by	voting	
at	the	annual	general	meetings	of	both	
danish	and	foreign	companies.	
henceforth,	we	will	also	to	a	greater	
extent	than	previously	enter	into	dialogue	
with	companies	where	we	assess	that	
there	is	a	verified	breach	of	the	un	
global	compact.	if	the	dialogue	does	not	
lead	to	a	change	in	conduct,	it	can	lead	
to	divestment.	we	will	also	enter	into	
dialogue	with	companies	if	we	assess	that	
there	is	an	esg	problem	needing	attention	
–	also	if	it	is	not	yet	a	verified	breach.	in	
both	situations,	dialogue	will	be	through	
our	external	screening	agency.
active	ownership	by	voting	and	dialogue	
was	initiated	in	q4	2020.
furthermore,	in	the	future,	we	will	have	
increased	focus	on	transparency	as	we	
want	it	to	be	easier	for	our	customers	to	
see	what	their	funds	are	invested	in.	this	
includes	information	on	
•	 our	active	ownership
•	 the	esg	quality	of	our	investments

formålspension	is	a	life-cycle	product	in	
which	customers	can	choose	between	four	
specific	purposes	in	which	the	customer’s	
pension	funds	must	be	invested:	green	
transformation,	technology,	danish	
investments,	and	global	investments.
regardless	of	the	investment	choices	made	
in	formålspension,	the	investments	are	
subject	to	increased	esg	(environmental,	
social	&	governance)	considerations,	and	
producers	within	the	following	industries	
are	excluded:	fossil	fuels,	extraction	of	
raw	materials	outside	the	industrialised	
countries,	tobacco,	adult	entertainment,	
online	betting	and	weapons.	
formålspension	is	off	to	a	good	start	and	
has	been	well	received	by	the	customers.	
by	the	end	of	2020,	dkk	1bn	was	invested	
in	the	new	pension	scheme.	among	the	four	
possible	purposes,	“green	transformation”	
was	the	largest	with	40%.	
	
through	invest-
ments	under	
formålspension,	
several	goals	are	
supported	–	of	
which	goal	7	and	13	
are	the	primary.

active ownership through dialogue 
in	2020,	we	have	been	in	dialogue	with	
two	companies	in	which	there	were	
breaches	of	the	un	global	compact:	
•	 danske	bank:	principle	10	
•	 volkswagen:	principles	7-9	
at	year	end,	after	along	positive	dialogue,	
volkswagen	was	no	longer	considered	
being	in	breach	of	the	un	global	compact.	
the	company	has	been	moved	to	our	
watch	list.	we	continue	to	have	a	positive	
dialogue	with	danske	bank.	in	2020,	
we	have	also	increased	focus	on	three	
companies	in	risk	of	breaches	to	the	un	
global	compact:	bhp	group,	dupont	and	
sanofi.
active ownership through voting
in	2020,	we	have	voted	at	the	agms	
of	chr.	hansen,	tryg,	coloplast	and	
scalepoint	technologies.
esg risk
topdanmark’s	total	esg	risk	for	the	
equity	portfolio	landed	on	21.7	against	
our	benchmark	score	of	22.8.	our	result	
was	mainly	driven	by	good	esg	risks	
with,	among	others,	vesta	and	pandora,	
whereas	our	investments	in	demant,	
volkswagen,	steris,	danaher	and	dupont	
de	nemours	impacted	our	esg	risk	
negatively.	the	result	indicates	that	our	
esg	risk	is	better	than	benchmark.
climate and 2 degrees scenario 
analyses
based	on	a	2	degrees	scenario	analysis,	it	
can	be	concluded	that	our	equity	portfolio	
is	significantly	less	exposed	to	coal	and	
oil	production	compared	with	benchmark,	
and	at	the	same	time	investing	more	in	
sustainable	energy.	also,	our	investments	
are	23%	below	the	co2	intensity	of	our	
benchmark	indicating	that	the	companies	
in	which	we	invest	emit	less	co2	than	if	we	
were	investing	passively.	
looking	forward,	the	portfolio	will	
continue	to	be	exposed	to	more	
sustainable	energy	in	accordance	with	a	
temperature	rise	less	than	1.75	degrees.	
all	in	all,	the	analysis	has	not	given	rise	
to	a	change	in	our	investment	strategy	in	
relation	to	achieving	our	objective	of	20%	
investments	in	the	green	transformation

business management
responsible business management 
trust is an important issue in every situation in life, also in the relationship between company and society. we 
strengthen the fiduciary relationship between topdanmark and society by acting in compliance with legislation and 
international standards. 
topdanmark	considers	responsible	
corporate	governance	a	prerequisite	for	
maintaining	and	developing	long-term	
relationships	with	all	stakeholders	that	
contribute	to	our	business	and	the	society	
we	are	part	of.	
to	us,	responsible	corporate	governance	
means	that	we	comply	with	legal	
requirements,	recommendations	for	good	
corporate	governance	as	well	as	rules	
and	recommendations	from	the	danish	
trade	association	for	insurance	companies	
and	pension	funds	forsikring	&	pension	
(insurance	&	pension	denmark),	and	that	
all	is	fully	integrated	into	the	operation	of	
our	business.	it	also	means	that	we	live	
up	to	the	expectations	of	the	un	global	
compact	on	the	integration	of	the	10	
principles	in	how	we	conduct	our	business.	
continuous assessment of risks and 
actions
we	continuously	assess	which	risks	
we	have	for	negatively	affecting	the	
principles	and	what	consequences	this	
will	have	for	our	business.	based	on	this	
assessment,	we	decide	how	to	deal	with	
the	challenges	we	find.	we	divide	it	into	
the	following	areas:	
•	 human	rights
•	 climate	
•	 the	environment	
•	 anti-corruption	
on	the	pages	37-47,	you	will	find	
descriptions	of	each	area	including	
accounts	for	policy,	risk	assessment,	
objectives,	annual	activities	and	results.	
on	page	36,	there	is	a	description	of	two	
of	the	actions	that	cover	all	principles.

two new initiatives in 2020
as a part of our continued work with responsibility, we 
have started two initiatives in 2020: a new csr-programme 
for suppliers and an internal code of conduct.
csr programme for suppliers 
topdanmark	wants	to	help	our	customers	
in	the	best	possible	way,	both	before,	
during	and	after	damage.	we	do	so	
through	a	number	of	suppliers	e.g.	after	
damage	to	buildings	or	an	accident.	
we	also	purchase	for	the	operation	of	
our	business,	e.g.	office	supplies	and	
it.	furthermore,	we	have	outsourced	a	
number	of	tasks	to	external	consulting	
firms.	the	vast	majority	of	this	being	
procurement	of	deliveries	for	our	
customer	support,	and	this	procurement	
is	business	critical.
regardless	of	the	type	of	procurement,	
we	want	to	establish	a	trusting	and	
professional	collaboration	with	the	
supplier	with	a	focus	on	quality,	
responsibility	and	sustainability.	
irresponsible	conduct	in	the	supply	chain,	
for	example	non-compliance	with	the	
principles	of	un	global	compact,	is	not	
only	incompatible	with	our	csr	policy,	
but	it	can	also	damage	our	reputation	and	
consequently	our	revenue.	in	order	to	
counter	this	risk,	we	have	established	a	
csr	programme	for	suppliers.	
activities in 2020
in	2020,	we	have	initiated	a	process	
which	will	result	in	more	systematic	
integration	of	csr	into	our	purchasing	
processes	than	previously.	the	new	
programme	will	i.a.	mean	that	moving	
forward	a	code	of	conduct	will	be	part	
of	the	contract	in	addition	to	specific	
requirements	for	selected	suppliers,	
e.g.	actions	on	co2	emissions	and	for	
products.	csr	will	also	be	part	of	a	set	of	
parametres	in	tender	rounds.	
the	following	concrete	activities	in	2020	
can	be	mentioned:
•	 csr	was	a	parameter	in	connection	
with	two	tender	rounds
•	 a	3-year	collaboration	agreement	was	
entered	into	with	a	taxi	company,	and	
from	now	on	topdanmark’s	taxi	rides	
will	be	primarily	by	electric	taxis.
future plans
in	2021,	we	will	complete	the	final	
design	of	a	new	csr	programme	
including	setting	concrete	objectives	
and	kpis.
code of conduct
to	support	responsible	corporate	
governance,	in	2020,	we	have	
prepared	an	internal	code	of	conduct,	
which	is	a	set	of	overall,	ethical	
guidelines	for	us	as	a	company,	for	
our	employees	and	for	our	partners.	
it	is	based	on	i.a.	a	number	of	existing	
policies	and	all	the	principles	under	
the	un	global	compact.	
the	code	of	conduct	has	been	
approved	by	topdanmark’s	board	of	
directors,	and	will	be	implemented	
in	2021,	partly	through	mandatory	
e-learning.	likewise,	we	will	implement	
an	external	code	of	conduct	
addressing	i.a.	suppliers.

human rights 
as a company, we have a significant responsibility to ensure that human rights are 
respected in our entire value chain. we take our responsibility seriously and comply 
with legislation and international guidelines.
topdanmark	respects	internationally	
recognised	human	rights,	and	our	aim	is	
to	never	infringe	them.	
we	only	do	business	in	denmark.	
topdanmark	follows	and	complies	with	
danish	legislation,	which	incorporates	
internationally	recognised	human	rights.	
this	means	that	e.g.	equality,	inclusion,	
workers’	rights,	health	and	safety	are	
integrated	into	our	values	and	policies.	
against	this	background,	we	do	not	
come	across	any	challenges	from	a	legal	
perspective	in	this	area.	
however,	in	2020,	it	became	known	that	
we	unfortunately	–	like	other	companies	
in	the	industry	–	have	not	complied	with	a	
section	in	the	sex	discrimination	act	and	
thus	have	discriminated	against	pregnant	
women	e.g.	in	terms	of	health	insurance	
for	a	number	of	years.	read	more	on	page	
14.	
responsible value chain
externally,	we	practice	human	rights	by	
investment	screenings	for	our	customers.	
the	screenings	are	based	on	the	un	
global	compact	principles.	we	also	do	this	
within	our	supplier	management,	in	which	
compliance	with	human	rights	is	a	central	
benchmark.	
we monitor development closely
inspired	by	the	united	nations	guiding	
principles	on	business	and	human	rights,	
we	continuously	monitor	what	human	
rights	topdanmark	may	find	challenging	
both	in	relation	to	the	operation	of	our	
business	and	our	products	and	advice	–	in	
addition	to	what	is	legally	expected	of	us.

diversity in management
topdanmark wants to be a diverse workplace, i.e. a workplace where diversity is 
accepted and used as a strength. therefore, as a company we work to maintain and 
develop openness in our company culture to counter any form of discrimination, and for 
all to have equal opportunities in topdanmark. 
to	topdanmark,	diversity	means	that	
there	is	no	difference	in	the	conditions	
of	employment	based	on	age,	ethnic	
background,	gender,	sexual	orientation,	
disability,	health	and	race.	this	also	
means	that	topdanmark	does	not	
discriminate	based	on	this.	we	want	to	
demonstrate	and	encourage	tolerance	
allowing	room	for	exchange	of	views	and	
differences.	tolerance	should	be	based	
on	respect	for	each	employee	and	ensure	
a	good	working	environment	for	all	
employees.
equal pay for equal work
topdanmark’s	position	on	diversity	and	
equal	opportunities	for	all	also	applies	in	
relation	to	remuneration.	it	is	our	policy	
that	remuneration	depends	solely	on	
objective	criteria	such	as	experience,	
competence,	effort,	results	and	the	
content	of	the	position.	
balanced gender distribution in 
management 
a	particular	focus	area	of	the	diversity	
policy	is	women	in	management.	we	want	
the	executive	team	to	be	represented	by	
the	best-qualified	candidates,	but	we	also	
want	a	fair	gender	distribution.	we	have	
set	up	a	number	of	objectives	that	we	
work	to	achieve	–	see	the	chart	on	page	
39.
topdanmark’s	board	of	directors	annually	
approves	our	policy	on	diversity	and	
its	objectives.	likewise,	the	board	of	
directors	is	annually	informed	about	the	
development	in	topdanmark’s	gender	
distribution	for	executives.				
activities in 2020
in	order	for	us	to	live	up	to	our	policy	
on	equal	pay,	we	have	implemented	a	
structure	to	ensure	that	people	in	the	
same	positions	are	employed	on	the	
same	terms.	that	way,	we	achieve	both	
 
21% women in executive management
our executive management includes the executive  
board (four people) and the top management team  
(20 persons). (2019: 21%).
 
41% women in management
our objective: both genders should be represented by at least 
40% at all management levels - on average. (2019: 41%).
goal	5:	gender	equality
with	our	actions	we	specifically	con-
tribute	to	target	5.5:	ensure	women’s	
full	and	effective	participation	and	
equal	opportunities	for	leadership	at	
all	levels	of	decision-making	in	politi-
cal,	economic	and	public	life.
consistency	and	ensure	that	terms	are	not	
about	the	person	or	the	gender.		
we	have	strengthened	our	focus	on	
recruitment	processes	supporting	policies	
on	diversity	and	the	related	objectives.	
this	has	been	done	e.g.	by	formulating	job	
postings	in	a	way	that	is	appealing	to	all	
regardless	of	gender.

for	a	number	of	years,	we	have	set	a	minimum	of	40%	women	on	average	for	all

diversity	at	the	two	highest	management	levels.	as	we	want	gender	diversity	
and	a	balance	between	male	and	female	values	at	all	managerial	levels,	we	will	
sharpen	our	focus	on	increasing	the	number	of	female	managers	in	our	executive	
management	in	2021	and	in	the	future.	more	specifically,	we	will	look	into	how	we	
can	motivate	more	women	to	apply	for	positions	in	executive	management,	and	
how	we	can	work	with	differentiated	terms	or	the	like.

protection of personal data
customers and other persons covered by our insurances should trust that we handle their personal data in a 
responsible manner. therefore, we have great focus on data and it security. 
as	an	insurance	and	pension	company,	
we	collect	and	process	a	large	volume	of	
customer	information,	including	personal	
data	such	as	health	information	on	our	
customers,	claimants	etc.	
personal data collection with a purpose 
topdanmark	processes	personal	data	
with	the	purpose	of	facilitating	and	
administrating	insurance	and	pension	
schemes.	we	also	process	data	in	
connection	with	human	resource	
management	for	our	employees.	we	do	
not	sell	personal	data,	and	on	our	website	
we	state	how	we	process	personal	data.	
the right to the protection of personal 
data  
in	topdanmark,	it	is	our	responsibility	to	
ensure	that	personal	data	is	processed	
in	a	way	so	that	we	always	protect	
the	fundamental	rights	and	civil	rights	
of	people,	namely	their	right	to	the	
protection	of	personal	data	–	and	thus	the	
right	to	privacy.
correct handling of data
to	ensure	that	the	customers	can	
trust	that	we	protect	their	data,	we	
have	implemented	a	comprehensive	
management	system	for	data	protection,	
including	procedures	and	a	policy	on	how	
to	handle	personal	data.	
furthermore,	we	focus	on	compliance	
with	the	legislation	in	force	on	processing	
of	personal	data,	i.a.	the	general	data	
protection	regulation	(the	gdpr).	thus	
we	process	all	personal	data	of	all	
stakeholders	in	a	legitimate,	fair	and	
transparent	manner.	this	is	ensured	i.a.	
by	continuous	training	of	our	employees	
and	pointing	out	how	they	can	contribute	
to	protecting	privacy.	
responsibility
topdanmark’s	management	is	generally	
responsible	for	compliance	with	the	
gdpr	rules.	in	2020,	topdanmark	has	
appointed	a	dpo	(data	protection	officer)	
who	advises	management	and	
employees	on	legislation	as	well	as	
ensuring	compliance.	
how we prevent data breaches
we	want	as	few	data	breaches	as	possible.	
but	even	though	we	have	great	focus	
on	data	security	and	a	comprehensive	
management	system,	errors	leading	to	
data	breaches	cannot	be	avoided.
we	endeavour	to	have	an	open	and	
learning	approach	to	handling	data	
breaches	in	order	for	us	to	prevent	
them	from	happening	again.	we	report	
breaches	to	the	danish	data	protection	
agency	if	we	cannot	exclude	that	there	is	
a	risk	for	the	aggrieved	parties.	we	also	
notify	the	aggrieved	parties	if	there	is	a	
high	risk	that	their	rights	or	civil	rights	
may	be	infringed.	
we	implement	corrective	action	where	
necessary,	and	employees	and	managers	
are	continuously	informed	about	the	
importance	of	protecting	the	privacy	of	
the	data	subjects.	
 
 473 employees 
have completed mandatory 
e-learning on gdpr in 2020.

it security against cybercrime  
topdanmark	has	strict	requirements	as	
regards	data	security.	the	requirements	
should	ensure	that	information	is	stored	
and	processed	in	a	way	that	the	right	to	
privacy	is	not	challenged	by	e.g.	it	and	
cybercrime,	which	is	a	real	threat	to	our	
business.	
this	is	done	through	our	it	systems	which	
ensures	that	personal	data
•	 is	up-to-date
•	 is	not	distorted
•	 is	deleted	when	no	longer	relevant
•	 is	not	accessed	by	unauthorised	per-
sons
in	2020,	it	was	mandatory	for	1,664	
employees	to	complete	e-learning	on	data	
security.	
the right to access and to be forgotten
we	continuously	work	on	improving	our	
procedures,	so	that	it	gets	easier	for	the	
data	subjects	to	make	use	of	their	right	to	
access,	to	be	forgotten,	to	object	etc.	and	
ensure	that	it	is	done	in	due	time.	
future plans
we	continuously	work	to	
improve	our	processes	and	it

case	in	2021.

we	have	updated	our	mapping	of	where,	
how	and	why	processing	of	personal	data	
is	carried	out.	this	has	been	done	through

data ethics
as a non-life and life insurance company, we use data to assess the concrete insurance 
risk of the customers. with digitalisation, the possibilities for the application of data is 
nearly endless. we comply with the ethical principles of the industry. 
in	january	2020,	the	board	of	directors	
of	forsikring	&	pension,	of	which	
topdanmark	is	a	member,	adopted	a	set	
of	joint	data	ethical	principles.	they	are	
on	transparency,	personalisation	and	
prevention,	and	data	security.	we	have	
chosen	to	make	the	joint	data	ethics	
of	the	industry	our	own,	and	since	the	
launch	of	the	principles	we	have	worked	to	
implement	the	principles	into	our	business.	
as	from	the	financial	year	2021,	we	will	
report	thereof	in	the	annual	report.	
artificial	intelligence	with	responsibility
at	topdanmark,	we	use	artificial	
intelligence	to	support	the	daily	work,	for	
example,	to	assess	risks	and	to	give	our	
customers	a	good	and	efficient	customer	
experience.	to	ensure	responsible	use	of	
artificial	intelligence,	we	have	defined	five	
ethical	principles.	the	principles	have	been	
approved	by	our	executive	board,	and	our	
compliance	department	is	responsible	for	
the	principles	being	observed	in	practice.

forsikring & pension (in danish)
1.	 thoughtfulness.	artificial	intelligence	must	be	
developed	and	used	with	care	and	respect.
2.	 professional	security.	artificial	intelligence	
must	be	used	within	a	fixed	framework	and	
be	built	on	the	latest	technological	knowledge	
and	thorough	tests.	
3. reliability.	artificial	intelligence	must	be	
reliable,	based	on	facts	and	free	of	biases.
4. transparency.	we	must	understand	how	
artificial	intelligence	works,	so	that	the	
models	function	safely	and	only	for	the	
purposes	for	which	they	were	created.
	5.	data	security.	artificial	intelligence	must	live	
up	to	the	requirements	of	the	data	protection	
legislation	and	be	protected	against

co2 neutral in 2030
we support society’s goal of limiting climate changes. 
the more unpredictable and extreme weather also has an 
impact on our own business. therefore, we have defined 
an ambitious objective of becoming co2 neutral in 2030. 
as	an	insurance	company,	we	feel	the	
consequences	of	climate	changes	in	the	
form	of	more	unpredictable	and	extreme	
weather,	e.g.	cloudbursts,	drought	and	
more	rain	than	usual.	this	has	an	impact	
on	our	business,	both	in	terms	of	increased	
risk	but	also	as	business	opportunities,	
described	in	the	section	on	responsible	
products	on	page	26.	
in	2019,	we	made	a	decision	to	become	
co2	neutral	in	2030	in	terms	of	buildings,	
company	driving	and	air	travel.	this	
decision	has	also	been	the	beginning	of	
a	process	in	which	we	have	analysed	the	
possible	co2	reductions	in	our	entire	value	
chain-	read	more	on	page	46.		
scope of the project
our	objective	of	becoming	co2	neutral	in	2030	has	2019	as	the	baseline	with	
7,082	tonnes	co2	emission.	it	includes	three	areas
operation of buildings
•	 co2	emission	from	consumption	of	natural	gas	(scope	1)
•	 co2	emission	from	district	heating	and	power	consumption	(scope	2)
company driving
•	 co2	emission	from	company	driving	in	topdanmark	cars	(scope	1)
•	 co2	emission	from	company	driving	in	privately	owned	cars	(scope	3)
air travel
•	 co2	emission	from	air	travel	(scope	3)
the	objective	has	been	approved	by	topdanmark’s	board	of	directors,	but	the	
responsibility	for	the	actual	implementation	is	with	the	csr	steering	committee. 
activities in 2020
how we will reach our goal
in	2020,	we	have	continued	the	work	on	
finding	concrete	solutions	to	how	we	can	
become	co2	neutral	in	2030:
operation of buildings
a	step-by-step	plan	for	2021	to	2025	has	
been	made,	and	it	includes	i.a.	phasing	
out	natural	gas,	concrete	optimisation	
actions	and	a	shift	to	co2	neutral	power.	
furthermore,	all	light	bulbs	will	be	
changed	to	led	bulbs	on	an	ongoing	basis	
towards	2029.	
business travel in topdanmark cars
approx.	100	cars	are	leased	by	
topdanmark.	we	are	working	on	the	
following	plan:
• reduction of driving: based	on	the	po-
sitive	experiences	from	covid-19,	a	de-
cision	has	been	made	to	continue	using	
digital	collaboration	tools.		
• change to low emission cars: a	gradu-
al	transition	to	hybrid	or	electric	cars	is	
expected	to	be	initiated	and	completed	
before	2030.	
business travel in privately owned cars 
this	is	primarily	company	driving	in	
privately	owned	cars	by	our	salespeople	
and	claims	adjusters.	this	is	the	majority	
of	our	indirect	co2	emissions,	but	is	
unfortunately	also	the	most	difficult	part	
to	change	since	we	have	little	influence	on	
the	choice	of	cars.
• reduction of driving: we	will	continue	
to	use	digital	customer	meetings.	when	
it	comes	to	inspection	of	property	and	
buildings	in	connection	with	preparing	
an	insurance	contract	or	after	a	claim,	
we	will	also	introduce	digitalisation	to	
reduce	driving.	
• change to low emission cars: we	are	
yet	to	find	a	model	for	the	transition	to	
low	emission	cars	for	privately	owned	
cars,	but	the	work	continues	in	the	
years	to	come.	
air travel
the	majority	of	air	travel	is	by	external	
it	developers	employed	by	topdanmark	
in	connection	with	different	projects.	
furthermore,	air	travel	is	connected	to	
investor	meetings	and	other	business	
meetings	as	well	as	participation	in	
conferences	etc.	
• reduction of air travel: continued	use	
of	digital	platforms.	
in general
for	the	co2	emissions	that	remain	
after	the	implementation	of	all	actions,	
we	will	look	into	procurement	of	co2	
compensation.

environment is also less plastic
topdanmark wants to contribute to a better environment through responsible and 
sustainable operations of our offices and canteens. a special focus area is the reduction 
of disposable materials.
topdanmark	focuses	on	climate	and	
the	environment	in	connection	with	
procurement	for	the	operation	of	the	
business.	for	example,	we	aim	to	buy	
office	supplies	which	are	labelled	with	the	
nordic	ecolabel	(cleaning	agents,	paper	
and	printed	matter),	fsc	(paper	and	
wood),	eu	ecolabel	(paper	and	toner)	or	
are	organic.	furthermore,	we	have	a	goal	
of	reducing	the	use	of	disposable	plastic	
towards	2021	-	see	the	chart	on	this	page.
activities in 2020
we	have	launched	a	number	of	initiatives,	
among	other	things:		
• reduction of disposable cups:	in	
2020,	all	employees	could	choose	an	
individual	cup	designed	by	danish	ce-
ramists.	all	employees	were	also	given	
a	water	bottle.	moving	forward,	all	new	
employees	will	receive	a	cup	and	a	wa-
ter	bottle	instead	of	flowers	which	has	
been	custom	up	to	now.

new level of ambition 
for climate and the 
environment 
in 2020, a task force has been looking into how we can 
integrate climate and the environment into the entire 
value chain. here is an overview of the plans so far. 
build knowledge internally 
we	consider	building	knowledge	across	
the	organisation	as	being	essential	for	
implementing	our	ambitions	for	the	
area.	therefore,	we	want	to	look	into	the	
possibilities	of	a	training	programme	on	
climate	and	the	environment	for	selected	
employees,	and	let	sustainability	be	an	
active	element	in	the	recruitment	for	
relevant	positions.	
future plans
in the first half of 2021, we expect to 
prepare an action plan with concrete 
objectives and kpis for 2025.25. 
reduction of customers’ climate and 
environmental footprint
we	want	to	integrate	climate	and	
the	environment	into	our	product	
development	with	the	aim	of	developing	
products	and	services	that	help	the	
customers	reduce	their	climate	and	
environmental	footprint.	
reduction of employees’ climate and 
environmental footprint
we	want	to	look	into	the	possibility	of	
establishing	an	internal	community	
with	the	aim	of	finding	initiatives	
that	can	promote	further	climate	and	
environmentally	friendly	solutions	and	
behaviour	at	our	workplace	and	provide	
inspiration	outside	working	hours.	
reduction of partners’ climate and 
environmental footprint
we	want	to	introduce	a	new	csr	
programme	for	the	procurement	policy	
and	the	supply	chain	with	a	focus	
on	climate,	the	environment	and	co	
reduction	–	read	more	on	page	36.	
we	want	to	integrate	climate	and	the	
environment	into	our	partnership	
strategy.	this	means	that	climate	and	the	
environment	will	be	permanent	elements	
in	the	dialogue	with	all	strategic	partners	
with	the	aim	of	collaboration.	
reduction of climate and environmental 
footprint from investments
in	2030,	green	investments	will	make	up	
approx.	20%	of	our	investments.	as	from	
2020,	we	conduct	analysis	of	the	co2	
emissions	from	the	equity	portfolio,	and	
we	have	excluded	thermal	coal	and	tar	
sands.	read	more	on	page	31.

anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery 
we do not tolerate any form of corruption and bribery. 
we have clear guidelines for presents and entertainment 
which we consider the area to pose the biggest risk 
topdanmark	wants	to	be	part	of	a	
professional,	orderly	and	trustworthy	
business	environment.	we	therefore	
do	not	tolerate	corruption	and	bribery	
neither	from	our	employees,	suppliers	nor	
from	other	partners.	
it	is	our	assessment	that	the	biggest	risk	
of	corruption	and	bribery	is	related	to	
presents	and	entertainment	in	relation	to	
customers,	suppliers	and	other	business	
partners.	however,	we	also	assess	the	risk	
to	be	generally	low.	
internal guidelines
we	are	confident	that	our	employees	use	
their	common	sense	and	good	judgment	
when	it	comes	to	gifts	and	entertainment	
in	relation	to	customers,	suppliers	and	
other	partners.	
to	support	this,	we	have	drawn	
up	guidelines	which	state	when	
topdanmark’s	employees	may	give	and	
receive	gifts	and	when	they	are	allowed	
to	hold	or	participate	in	events	and	
arrangements.	the	purpose	of	the	policy	
is,	among	other	things,	to	prevent	and	
avoid	business	decisions	being	influenced	
by	personal	or	non-business-related	
considerations	and	interests.	
activities in 2020 
in	2020,	we	continued	the	work	on	
preventing	and	avoiding	business	
decisions	being	influenced	by	personal	
or	non-business-related	considerations	
and	interests.	we	do	this	by	i.a.	
communicating	our	guidelines	to	all	new	
employees.	it	is	our	assessment	that	there	
have	been	no	situations	that	have	been	in	
conflict	with	our	guidelines.	
furthermore,	we	have	started	to	draw	
up	a	formal	anti-corruption	policy	as	
we	consider	it	relevant	with	a	further	
clarification	of	our	position	and	expected	
behaviour	in	this	area.	in	that	connection,	
we	have	revised	our	internal	guidelines	
for	presents	and	entertainment.
future plans 
the policy on anti-corruption 
will be completed and 
implemented in 2021.   
money laundering and 
financing of terrorism 
the	risk	of	money	laundering	
and	financing	of	terrorism	is	
more	significant	in	topdanmark	
livsforsikring	than	in	the	topdanmark	
non-life	insurance	business.	however,	
generally	the	risk	is	low.	we	meet	the	
requirements	of	the	danish	anti-money	
laundering	act,	which	means,	for	
example,	that	e-learning	is	obligatory.

corporate culture
corporate culture  
we want to provide the best customer service in all situations. competent and 
motivated employees are a critical factor in this respect, and therefore, we strive to 
have a high level of employee job satisfaction and well-being and a workplace where 
you can be yourself. 
we	have	formulated	an	ambition	that	we	
want	to	have	a	bolder	workplace,	a	healthier	
working	life	and	a	fun	working	day.	we	want	
to	provide	a	working	community	which	is	
accommodating	for	all	types	of	person.	a	
workplace	at	which	you	can	be	yourself.	
we	believe	that	it	increases	both	well-being	
and	commitment	as	well	as	contributes	to	
attracting	and	retaining	the	highly	skilled	
manpower	we	need.	therefore,	well-being	
and	commitment	are	central	elements	of	
topdanmark’s	business	strategy.
close dialogue is the foundation 
a	close	dialogue	between	the	executive	
board	and	the	employees	is	important	to	us,	
among	other	things	through	a	cooperation	
committee	with	employee	representatives.	
the	committee’s	task	is	to	take	on	and	discuss	
work	related	and	organisational	issues	and	find	
solutions	to	these	problems.	furthermore,	we	
have	a	competence	committee	that	specifically	
considers	training	and	development,	as	well	
as	a	job	satisfaction	committee	discussing	job	
satisfaction,	well-being	and	health.	
with	our	actions	we	contribute	to	
target	8.5:	by	2030,	achieve	full	and	
productive	employment	and	decent	
work	for	all	women	and	men,	including	
for	young	people	and	persons	with	
disabilities,	and	equal	pay	for	work	of

50
well-being and commitment 
focus this year has been on ensuring employee well-being in a completely new situation 
with working from home being prevalent without any physical contact with managers 
and colleagues. it also points towards what we call the future workplace. 
to	ensure	a	continuous	dialogue	between	
employees	and	managers	on	any	
challenges,	we	i.a.	make	use	of	locally	
embedded	well-being	dialogues	which	
should	support	the	continuous	work	on	
well-being,	commitment	and	motivation.	
based	on	the	replies,	we	plan	the	required	
actions	for	the	coming	year.
we	also	conduct	an	annual	group	survey	
on	well-being	and	commitment	at	group	
level.	we	use	the	result	as	an	indication	
of	the	general	level	of	well-being	in	
topdanmark.	
activities in 2020  
comprehensive well-being assessment 
at	the	beginning	of	2020,	we	conducted	
a	comprehensive	assessment	of	the	
employees’	well-being	based	on	both	the	
result	of	the	annual	survey	on	well-being	
as	well	as	the	workplace	assessment	in	
addition	to	anonymized	data	from	health	
checks	in	2019.	
the	assessment	gave	rise	to	a	number	of	
observations,	i.a.	a	widespread	opinion	of	
having	too	great	a	workload	at	too	high	a	
pace	with	the	risk	of	stress.
however,	the	continued	work	on	defining	
relevant	solutions	to	the	challenges	
was	put	on	hold	when	covid-19	hit	the	
country	at	the	end	of	february.	after	
this,	all	focus	was	targeted	at	managing	
the	completely	extraordinary	situation	
to	avoid	dissemination	among	our	
employees.	
management of covid-19
topdanmark	has	complied	with	all	
official	recommendations	set	for	private	
businesses	e.g.	working	from	home	to	
limit	infection.	thus,	in	march	2020,	more	
than	2,000	remote	workstations	were	
established	in	14	days.	
•	 all	year,	we	have	worked	to	ensure	the	
health	security	and	general	well-being	
of	our	employees.	for	example,	we	
established	a	hotline	responsible	for	
advising	our	employees.	we	have	intro-
duced	the	use	of	face	masks	in	the	can-
teen,	and	all	employees	have	received	
fabric	face	masks.
•	 we	have	focused	on	establishing	digital	
tools	for	collaboration	and	distance	
management	to	ensure	continued	close	
contact	to	our	employees	-	professio-
nally	and	socially.
•	 it	was	–	and	still	is	–	possible	to	borrow	
an	ergonomic	seat	pad	or	office	chair	
and	to	get	advice	on	ergonomics	when	
working	from	home.	we	have	also	made	
a	number	of	short	training	videos	to	get	
our	employees	moving	when	working	
from	home.	
•	 we	have	organised	social	online	events	
for	the	group,	e.g.	a	digital	christmas	
event	to	gather	and	get	the	feeling	of	
being	together.

future plans
the future workplace 
the	experiences	with	working	from	
home	during	covid-19	have	overall	
been	positive.	among	other	things,	
we	have	seen	that	tasks	are	solved	
satisfactorily,	sometimes	even	more	
efficiently	when	working	from	home	
and	attending	online	meetings	instead	
of	physical	meetings.	at	the	same	time,	
we	also	see	that	working	from	home	
gives	our	employees	more	flexibility	
in	their	everyday	lives.	this	has	given	
inspiration	to	how	we	organise	our	
workplace	and	working	life	in	the	best	
possible	way	in	the	future.	
in	2020,	we	have	launched	a	pilot	
project	in	which	a	maximum	of	75%	
employees	are	physically	present	at	the	
workplace	–	also	after	the	covid-19	
restrictions	are	lifted.	we	call	it	the	
future	workplace.
the balance is crucial
we	are	aware	that	increased	work	
from	home	also	poses	dilemmas,	e.g.	
in	relation	to	social	and	professional	
cohesion.	but	we	believe	that	the	right	
balance	between	working	from	home	
and	working	from	our	locations	can	
contribute	to	an	increase	in	employee	
well-being,	reduce	stress	and	absence	
due	to	illness	as	well	as	increase	
flexibility	for	certain	types	of	task.	
the	individual	employee’s	need	
for	physical	meetings	and	contact	
with	colleagues	and	the	tasks	of	the	
individual	will	be	the	point	of	departure.	
at	the	same	time,	we	will	look	into

survey on sexism in the wake of the metoo campaign
the	year	2020	has	been	marked	by	an	increased	attention	to	sexism	at	the	
workplace	and	in	society	in	general.	we	have	chosen	to	address	the	issue	and	
conducted	a	survey	among	all	our	employees	in	order	for	us	to	learn	the	scope	in	
our	own	organisation.	from	the	survey,	it	is	evident	that	we	have	isolated	cases	with	
abusive,	insulting	and	sexist	behaviour,	which	is	completely	unacceptable.	
therefore,	in	2021,	different	activities	will	be	launched	to	ensure	understanding	
of	our	different	boundaries.	we	will	also	emphasize	in	our	internal	communication	
that	employees	can	trust	that	cases	will	be	handled	consistently	and	professionally.	
among	other	things,	we	will	use	dialogue	questions	to	support	an	open	dialogue	on	
the	tone	and	culture	in	the	individual	departments.	
the future workplace will give less driving. thus it can contribute to 
our goal of reducing co2 emissions in our entire value chain.

all	topdanmark	employees	are	offered	
a	health	screening	during	working	hours	
every	second	year	–	most	recently	in

employees	who	are	at	risk	of	getting	
lifestyle	diseases	have	been	offered	
an	individual	health	programme,	my	
health,	against	a	minor	charge.	each	
programme	has	a	duration	of	3-4	
months	and	they	have	provided	unique

evaluation of health initiatives
we	continuously	evaluate	the	many	
initiatives,	i.a.	in	a	job	satisfaction	
committee	in	which	it	is	discussed	
whether	the	initiatives	positively	
contribute	to	a	healthier	working	day

evaluation	of	2020	has	been	special	
due	to	covid-19.	the	initiatives	have	
been	well	received	by	our	employees,	
and	they	have	contributed	to	increased	
health	and	well-being,	and	also	in	making	
topdanmark	an	attractive	workplace.	
health in everyday life  
we want to give our employees the opportunity of a 
healthier working life by offering a number of initiatives, 
from the near to the broad which can give energy both 
during the working day and at leisure.

our	need	for	competencies	in	the	
organisation	is	continuously	evaluated	
through	dialogue	with	the	individual	
departments,	management	and	the	
executive	board.	against	this	background,	
a	strategy	for	training	and	development	is	
prepared	for	the	individual	employee.	
we	have	several	training	programmes	
depending	on	which	part	of	the	
organisation	you	are	working	in.	there	
is	a	number	of	mandatory	courses	
that	all	employees	must	complete,	e.g.	
data	protection,	it	security	and	money

offer	internal	training	courses	appealing	to	
all	employees.	
leadership training
we	have	a	target	of	completing	a	
comprehensive	managerial	training	
programme	for	a	total	of	approx.	250	
managers	on	four	levels.	the	programme	
is	carried	out	over	2-3	years	in	which	
all	managers	are	trained	in	a	number	
of	subjects	e.g.	strategy	development,	
understanding	transformation	and	
management	skills.	furthermore,	the	
programme	includes	tactical	toolbox

impacted	by	covid-19	and	the	widespread	
use	of	working	from	home,	there	has	
been	an	increased	focus	on	developing

there	has	been	an	increased	focus	on

the competencies of the future
targeted competence development for the individual employee is important so that everyone can

responsibility in society
as a non-life and life insurance company, we help many customers every year when 
they become ill or suffer an injury. we also want to help more broadly and globally 
when people are in difficult situations. that is why we collaborate with humanitarian 
organisations. 
topdanmark’s	programme	for	charity	is	
based	on	initiatives	that	contribute	to	
humanitarian	relief	and	humanitarian	
assistance	both	in	denmark	and	
internationally,	and	which	are	related	
to	our	core	business.	this	could	e.g.	be	
health	and	exercise	activities	with	a	
preventive	perspective	which	also	provide	
the	possibility	of	employee	participation,	
either	in	the	form	of	financial	
contributions	and/or	participation	in	
events.	
more	specifically,	we	have	chosen	to	
collaborate	with	three	humanitarian	
organisations:	kræftens	bekæmpelse	(the	
danish	cancer	society),	doctors	without	
borders	and	the	blood	bank.	
activities in 2020
exercise for the knæk cancer 
through	particitation	in	the	knæk	cancer	
campaign	(cancer	fundraising)	under	the	
danish	cancer	society,	we	are	given	the	
opportunity	to	focus	on	several	issues	
that	are	central	to	our	business:	health,	
exercise	and	prevention.	furthermore,	we	
can	contribute	to	an	important	healthcare	
project,	and	at	the	same	time	create	great	
internal	togetherness.	
money for calories
we	collect	contributions	to	the	campaign	
in	different	ways.	the	employees	pay	a	
participation	fee,	and	topdanmark	pays	
for	the	calories	burned	through	cycling,	
dancing,	running,	and	other	activities.	
there	is	also	a	raffle	with	prizes	donated	
by	our	collaboration	partners.	
covid-19-friendly event
in	2020,	we	participated	in	the	knæk	
cancer	campaign	for	the	seventh	time.	
the	campaign	has	become	part	of	our	
corporate	culture,	but	in	2020,	it	was	
a	new	edition	adapted	to	the	covid-19	
situation	and	with	many	restrictions.	
new	ideas	saw	the	light	of	day,	and	
e.g.	exercise	from	the	home	office	was	
also	an	option.	all	in	all,	it	was	a	really	
nice	campaign	with	great	and	positive	
commitment	from	the	employees,	and	it	
created	joy	and	togetherness.	
	
humanitarian relief across borders
we	have	been	cooperating	with	doctors	
without	borders	since	1996.	we	have	
chosen	doctors	without	borders	as	we	
trust	that	our	contribution	is	spent	in	
a	responsible	manner	in	the	world’s	
hotspots.	
on	a	voluntary	basis,	employees	can	
contribute	to	doctors	without	borders	
via	their	salary,	and	topdanmark	will	
contribute	an	equivalent	amount.		
furthermore,	in	connection	with	the	
christmas	present	for	the	employees	in	
2020,	the	organisation	received	dkk	100	
per	christmas	present,	and	the	employees	
could	also	donate	their	christmas	present	
amount	to	the	organisation.	
blood gives new life 
every	day,	the	danish	hospitals	rely	
heavily	on	donor	blood	to	treat	patients.	
as	a	blood	donor,	you	help	ensure	the	
necessary	blood	supply	and	thus	make	
a	huge	difference	to	many	people.	we	
would	like	to	contribute	to	this	effort.	
therefore,	since	2005,	the	employees	at	
topdanmark’s	head	office	have	been	able	
to	donate	blood	to	the	blood	bank	during	
working	hours.	topdanmark	is	among	the	
companies	that	donate	the	most	blood	per	
number	of	visits	by	the	blood	bank.
responsibility in society
future plans 
topdanmark’s	programme	for	charity	
is	reviewed	annually.	in	2020,	it	
was	found	that	a	more	thorough	
evaluation	of	the	programme	is	
needed	–	a	process	that	will	be	
initiated	in	2021.

education in the industry
we see it as part of our social responsibility to contribute 
to education in the insurance industry. therefore, we 
employ a number of finance trainees as well as offer 
internships every year. we attach great importance to 
well-being and personal development.

finance	trainees	in	a	2-year	education,	
and	we	also	offer	internships	for	financial

trainees get well equipped for the 
industry 
we	have	a	long	tradition	of	trainee	
education,	and	many	of	our	current	
employees	and	managers	have	been	
trainees.	according	to	legislation,	we	
are	obliged	to	employ	finance	trainees,	
but	as	a	company	we	want	to	contribute	
more	than	just	what	legislation	requires	
us	to	do.	therefore,	we	strive	to	employ	a	
minimum	of	20	trainees	annually.	
it	is	important	to	us	to	ensure	that	all	
trainees	complete	the	education	with	good	
results,	so	that	they	are	well	equipped	
for	the	requirements	in	the	industry.	
therefore,	they	receive	a	structured	
education	programme	with	interplay	
between	theory	and	practice.	we	organise	
special	events	focusing	on	the	well-being	
and	personal	development	of	the	
trainees	in	order	to	support	them	in	their	
education.	
responsibility in society

tax contributions are also 
social contributions
topdanmark contributes to danish society through both 
direct corporate taxes and indirect taxes. more than 
99% of our income is taxed in denmark. in our opinion, 
we contribute to society as a responsible employer and 
through tax payments. 
by	operating	a	profitable	business,	
topdanmark	contributes	significant	
annual	amounts	to	the	danish	state	
through	direct	corporate	taxes	and	
indirect	taxes.	
more	than	99%	of	our	income	is	taxed	in	
denmark	which,	taking	the	organisation’s	
size	into	account,	is	unusual	since	other	
big	danish	companies	pay	a	large	part	
of	their	corporate	tax	abroad	due	to	the	
activities	in	the	international	market.	in	
this	way,	topdanmark,	relatively	speaking,	
pays	more	to	the	danish	state	than	many	
other	big	companies.	
in	the	most	recent	public	statement	on	
tax	payments	from	2018,	topdanmark	
was	the	17th	largest	contributor	of	
corporate	tax	in	denmark.	among	
insurance	companies,	we	were	the	largest	
contributor	of	corporate	tax.
