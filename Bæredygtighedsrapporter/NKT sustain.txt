letter of commitment
we connect a greener world 
as the world moves towards 
green energy, we are proud 
to take center stage. our 
power cable technology is 
key to a future based on 
clean and renewable energy.
in nkt, we have made it our purpose to  
connect a greener world by delivering  
the power cable technology essential for 
the green transformation. this journey 
continued in 2020. 
as the first major power cable  
manufacturer we committed to the  
science based target initiative to  
become a net-zero emissions company 
no later than 2050. this commitment 
further accelerates our sustainability 
journey and in 2020, we have taken steps 
to reduce the environmental impact of 
our operations. here, a key one was to 
power all our power cable production 
with electricity generated from renewable 
energy leading to a 72% reduction in our 
greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) from 
electricity compared to 2019*.
in 2020, we have also continued to con-
nect the power grids of europe ensuring 
the infrastructure needed to efficiently  
exchange renewable energy.  further-
more, we are a key partner in connecting 
solar farms, on- and offshore wind parks 
as well as in upgrading and developing 
the global power grids. here, a highlight 
was our significant order wins for the ger-
man corridor projects which are essential 
to the green transition in germany.
in a year shaped by the covid-19 
pandemic, our primary focus has been 
and still is to safeguard the health and 
safety of our employees. we have 
instituted a number of initiatives across 
the organization, while complying with 
recommendation of the authorities in the 
markets we operate in. throughout 2020, 
we have managed to keep our production 
running without significant impact. 
we promote diversity and equality across 
our organization, and we are committed 
to connect a greener world based on 
responsible and ethical behaviour defined 
in our code of conduct. furthermore, we 
conduct our business in accordance with 
the relevant un sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) expressing the most impor-
tant global challenges.

solutions
specializes in high-voltage power cable solutions. nkt 
provides a broad range of solutions for off- and onshore 
power transmission systems, and supplies both ac and 
dc power cables. further, nkt offers complete and 
customized end-to-end turnkey solutions, including full 
installation services.
nkt has two high-voltage production facilities in germa-
ny and sweden. centrally situated in the north european 
market, these sites have sea and river access. this 
enables convenient and efficient logistics for offshore 
solutions around the world as well as ideal access to 
onshore opportunities in europe. these production sites, 
combined with nkt’s installation expertise and dedicat-
ed cable-laying vessel, make nkt a leading company in 
the high-voltage interconnector, offshore wind, and oil & 
gas segments. 
applications
offers a broad range of low- and medium-voltage power 
cable solutions. nkt markets high-quality products that 
conform to regulatory requirements and high customer 
expectations and has developed ergonomic solutions 
that are easy to install. these solutions are important 
contributors to the ongoing electrification of societies. 
telecom power cables are also developed and marketed 
with a view to addressing future opportunities in the roll-
out of 5g mobile networks.
applications has five main production sites located in the 
czech republic, denmark, poland and sweden. nkt 
holds strong positions in these markets. further, nkt is 
relatively well placed in other european markets, such as 
germany and norway. the proximity of the production 
sites to the markets are important to ensure fast delivery 
and cost-efficient solutions.
service & accessories 
supplies off- and onshore power cable services and 
offers a full portfolio of power cable accessories across 
the medium- and high-voltage categories.
the service business focuses on servicing high-voltage 
power cables. these generally require limited mainte-
nance, but unfortunate events will occur due to external 
damage caused by anchor drag, excavation works, etc. 
this can lead to power cable failures. to avoid such 
events and to shorten potential downtime, monitor-
ing solutions and rapid response are in demand. nkt 
provides these services from teams based in denmark, 
germany and sweden.
accessories are critical components in any power cable 
system. in the high-voltage market, nkt’s technological 
competence is key as only a few suppliers can match 
the requirements that accessories must deliver. nkt 
provides market support for accessories from three 
production sites in germany and sweden.

the materiality assessment 
enables the identification 
and prioritization of social 
and environmental issues 
presenting risks and 
opportunities for nkt and 
stakeholders. 
the assessment furthermore supports the 
visualization of global changes and trends 
and their potential effect on the business. it 
also helps reporting on the issues of greatest 
importance to relevant stakeholders.
interactions with stakeholders associated with 
sustainability related matters are conducted 
through several channels, utilizing methods 
such as interviews, surveys and informal 
dialogues. the feedback collected has been 
included in this year’s materiality assessment 
and in the general sustainability processes of 
nkt.
sustainability aspects are evaluated on the ba-
sis of risks, opportunities and trends in relevant 
industries and in political agendas. changes in 
legislation, technology and general develop-
ments in the sustainability agenda have also 
been assessed. 
the identified issues and opportunities have 
been processed in an impact valuation based 
on the nkt enterprise risk management 
framework using multiple criteria to identify their 
significance for relevant stakeholder groups.

responsible business
business ethics 
responsible business sets 
the foundation for global 
sustainable development 
and is a key priority for nkt. 
 
corporate governance within nkt is  
managed by the ethics & compliance 
board overseeing the initiatives contained 
in the ethics & compliance programme 
which is ultimately supervised by the 
audit committee on behalf of the board 
of directors. in 2020, a new ethics & 
compliance strategy was implemented 
setting the direction for the compliance 
programme, and the process for internal 
controls were strengthened. 
ethics and compliance
nkt is committed to promoting ethical 
behaviour across the company, and  
ensuring ethical compliance across all 
segments, markets and entities is funda-
mental to commercial success.  
the approach in this area is  
continuously improved via a broad- 
reaching compliance programme. nkt 
complies with applicable laws, regulations 
and international standards, and strive to 
meet stakeholder expectations.
code of conduct
the code continues to define the funda-
mental principles of conduct in nkt in  
relation to employees, vendors, business 
partners and the public. it includes policies 
governing the approach to business 
responsibility and covers the expectations 
placed by nkt on its customers and 
external partners.
improved risk management
nkt is committed to the management of 
risks in accordance with good corporate 
governance and to the application of best 
practice to internal risk processes.

developed in 20201. 
as shown on page 8, a detailed  
materiality assessment dedicated to 
sustainability has been completed.
anti-bribery and anti-corruption
nkt tolerates no form of bribery or 
corruption as described in the code of 
conduct and related training and aware-
ness initiatives are regularly provided to all 
relevant employees. strict guidelines and 
requirements governing gifts, entertain-
ment and hospitality are also in place.
corruption and bribery risks

bribery risks arises principally through 
interactions with external suppliers and 
business partners in connection with ten-
ders and business agreements. initiatives 
minimizing this exposure are constantly 
ongoing including targeted training and 
awareness campaigns. with an enhanced 
third-party compliance process respon-
sibility and transparency throughout the 
value chain has increased. during 2020, 
an improved risk assessment process 
was developed to help further identify key 
compliance risks.

training in competition law 
during 2020, a dedicated focus to 
strengthen the training and awareness 
activities relating to anti-trust and com-
petition law was initiated. this was part 
of the strategic initiatives in the awake of 
the alleged price-fixing described below, 
along with an unannounced inspection 
conducted in 2019 by the authorities 
at the polish facility in warsowice. the 
inspection arised out of concerns of unfair 
competition in the market for low- and 
medium-voltage power cables. nkt 
cooperated fully with the polish authori-
ties and the matter was dismissed by the 
authorities after a short investigation.
in may 2020, the appeal against the 
fine imposed by the european general 
court following investigation into alleged 
price-fixing on high-voltage power cable 
projects was partially upheld by the  
european court of justice. the fine and 
scope of nkt’s alleged conduct was 
reduced. nkt has lodged objections 
against the judgement which is currently 
being considered by the european court 
of justice1.

engaged, committed employees 
nkt considers a culture driven by high 
engagement to be a key enabler, and  
delivering this is a long-term focus. to 
track the progress in this regard, an 
annual survey measured by an employee 
engagement index is conducted. here, 
the company ambition is to have an  
employee engagement index in the top 
quartile compared to the global bench-
mark. the positive index trend recorded 
in 2019 continued in 2020, with leaders at 
all levels continuing to initiate actions that 
foster engagement.
to further strengthen the focus on  
engagement in the leadership domain, 
two new programmes were launched 
in 2020; one for project managers and 
one for first line leaders in production. 
furthermore, a follow-up initiative was im-
plemented to cement the nkt leadership 
model after completed training.
new pipeline of engineering talents
as a leading company in the power 
cable industry, nkt has high demands 
for technical competencies to continue 
building the necessary infrastructure for 
the transition to renewable energy. this 
programme, which will run for 12 months, 
will operate from the high-voltage  
engineering centre and manufacturing 
site in karlskrona, sweden. 
after completing the programme, the 
participants are expected to continue in 
relevant positions throughout the nkt 
organization.
community engagement
across the nkt organization, employees 
engage and make a difference to their 
local communities. some examples of the 
voluntary community service from 2020 
are presented below.
people in the accessories business line 
continued their work with local organi-
zations to support children in the local 
communities. this collaboration, which 
began in 2017 at the site in nordenham, 
germany, has since widened to include 
other german and swedish locations, fo-
cuses on giving underprivileged children 
a merry christmas in the form of gifts and 
social activities. 
in alingsås, sweden, employees helped 
provide a fun christmas for 30 families 
and 116 children through collaboration 
with the local lions club. in berlin and 
cologne, germany, nkt employees are in 
touch with local help organizations such as 
elisabethstift, one of the oldest children's 
homes in berlin. in addition to making their 
annual cash donation, the employees or-
ganized an event in which they responded 
to a 'wish list' submitted by 30 children 
and young people.
dedicated employees from 
the shared service center in 
kaunas, lithuania, are getting 
ready to support local chil-
dren in need with equipment 
supporting a life of wellbeing.
as in 2019, employees in kaunas,  
lithuania, continued their partnership 
with the local order of malta organiza-
tion which provides financial and other 
support to elderly, families and children in 
need. in 2020, employees dedicated their  
efforts towards helping the children visit-
ing locally run day centres where they can 
do their homework, play and interact in a 
safe and supportive environment. to help 
give the children a foundation for a good 
education, a variety of school equip-
ment as well as sports and recreational 
supplies for after-school activities were 
provided.
in asnaes, denmark, the long-term 
collaboration with the local red cross 
continued to engage people with special 
needs in meaningful work. the local 
workforce is converting old wooden cable 
drums into fashionable furniture being 
sold locally. the money generated is 
being spent on special activities in their 
protected accommodation.

social
health and safety
the safety of employees, 
suppliers, customers and 
partners is paramount to 
nkt. the corporate safety 
culture is continuously 
strengthened by mitigating 
risks and supporting the 
necessary behaviour for 
ongoing improvements.
throughout 2020, steps were taken at 
corporate level to continue to build a 
strong safety culture. a key initiative was 
the implementation of the centralized  
ia system1 at all manufacturing sites.  
this will strengthen data collection, anal-
ysis and reporting on a global scale and 
enable improvements and risk mitiga-
tions within health and safety.
another central development in 2020 
was the transition from ohsas 18001 to 
the new health and safety management 
standard iso 45001, which will improve 
processes, help monitor progress and 
support building a strong safety culture. 
with iso 45001 in place, health and 
safety will be more extensively  
integrated into the general processes, 
driving an overall focus on safety across 
the nkt organization.
furthermore, the hv solutions land-
based operations of nkt was accred-
ited according to level 3 of the safety 
culture ladder certification standard. 
this helps drive engagement, develop 
risk awareness and build a safety-fo-
cused mindset. the certification stand-
ard  provides a framework for working 
safely in various sectors and for promot-
ing a robust safety culture throughout 
the  entire value chain of products and 
services. in 2021, the safety culture 
ladder certification standard will be 
expanded to nkt's hv solutions  
offshore operations to further advance 
the corporate safety culture. 
positive development
progress from the initiated safety initiatives 
was reflected in the primary kpi, lost time 
injury rate2 (ltir), which decreased from 
0.73 in 2019 to 0.41 in 2020.  
safety week 2020 in 
karlskrona 
nkt’s corporate life saving principles, 
cpr procedures and safety on the 
road were all part of the agenda for the 
safety week 2020, a local initiative at the 
high-voltage engineering and manufactur-
ing site in karlskrona, sweden. the event 
is a great example of how local initiatives 
support the corporate focus to constant-
ly strengthen the safety culture. due to 
covid-19 restrictions the safety week was 
held online. the event will be repeated in 
2021 and has the potential to become a 
company-wide initiative.

the positive development was pri-
marily driven by focused efforts by the 
hse-organization in the form of initiatives 
to mitigate identified unsafe acts and 
conditions, implement lessons learned 
from previous workplace incidents and 
mobilize local campaigns promoting safe 
behaviour. the decrease in ltir can 
also partly be attributed to the covid-19 
pandemic, which led to extra safety 
measures, an increase in the general fo-
cus on safe behaviour, and to employees 
periodically working from home. 
it has been decided to update the cor-
porate health and safety kpi framework 
with a view to continued transparency, 
improved data collection and enhanced 
monitoring. from 2021, the corporate 
progress will be measured based on 
three main kpis: lost time injury rate 
(ltir), total recordable injury rate3 
(trir), and lost work day rate4 (lwdr). 
all three are normalized over the total 
number of hours worked, which enables 
faster identification of trends and helps 
decrease statistical fluctuation.

local mental health focus 
psychological and social stressors in the workplace have been 
identified as a safety risk, especially at predominantly  
white-collar locations. at the danish headquarters, the working 
environment committee is currently executing a three-year action 
plan on mental health. in 2020, as part of this initiative, the  
committee hosted two workshops with an organizational  
psychologist and stress prevention coach. one workshop was for 
the danish organization and one for managers. the workshops 
were recorded and can be watched on the local intranet.
“ these sessions were prominent building 
blocks in our mental health action plan. 
they supplement a dedicated stress policy, 
our mental health guidance documents and 
our external support hotline. due to the

becoming a net-zero emissions company
as a central player in the 
global transition towards 
renewable energy, nkt is 
continuously minimizing the 
environmental impact of its  
activities.
 
the sustainability journey of nkt contin-
ued through 2020 with several initiatives 
significantly reducing the corporate carbon 
footprint. a key step was the commitment 
to become a net-zero emissions company 
by 2050. to fully focus on reaching this tar-
get nkt committed to the science based 
target initiative providing a scientifically 
based method to validate the climate strat-
egy. while the pathway towards net-zero 
emissions is being validated, the journey 
continues, and corporate targets have 
been set to cut greenhouse gas emissions 
(ghg) with an average of 5% annually. 
to take steps reaching this target all 
power cable factories switched to using 
electricity based on renewable energy 
leading to a 72% reduction in ghg  
emissions from electricity consumption
climate action programme
nkt is currently developing a climate ac-
tion program which will address the jour-
ney towards reducing fossil dependency 
in all emissions scopes both related to 
production and operation (scope 1 and 2) 
as well as from the value chain (scope 3). 
the programme will include requirements 
and goals for all steps of the process.
decarbonization of supply chain
as nkt is a major player in the power 
cable industry, an important element of 
the journey towards net-zero emissions is 
to decarbonize the supply chain, which 
accounts for a significant part of the 
corporate ghg emissions. a suppli-
er engagement programme has been 
launched to drive the decarbonization 
process. close supplier collaboration is 
considered essential to succeed in driving 
reduction of supply chain emissions. to 
initiate this dialogue and assess the level 
of maturity within the main critical suppli-
ers, 21 strategic suppliers in high-impact 
areas have been asked to disclose their 
emissions. all suppliers have committed 
to the programme, and the focus to build 
a sustainable supply chain to decrease 
the corporate scope 3 emissions will 
continue in 2021.
climate impact reductions
the focus on climate and energy efficiency 
in is directed by the corporate environmen-
tal council, ensuring a systematic approach 
to energy efficiency at all factories. to 
ensure progress in this regard energy 
performance is closely monitored to enable 
rapid response to anomalies and provide 
the necessary data for projects increasing 
energy efficiency.
green power cable production
in 2020, all power cable factories switched to  
using electricity based on renewable energy 
reducing the ghg emissions with more than 
38,000 tonnes of co2e in a single year from  
production and the cable-laying vessel  
nkt victoria. the change in energy supply is 
documented by eu guarantees of origin,  
market-based instruments which are certified by 
an auditor and provide proof that electricity  
consumption is based on renewable energy for 
the power cable production in germany, denmark, 
sweden, norway, poland and czech republic. 
driving energy efficiency
during the year, local initiatives included 
installing energy meters on machinery at 
the plant in warzowice, poland, which pro-
vided  increased transparency and over-
view of energy consumption. in alingsås, 
sweden, an extensive mapping of energy 
consumption has been completed to iden-
tify energy efficiency projects leading to a 
reduction in energy used for cooling. 
energy programmes at the high-voltage 
factories in karlskrona and cologne have 
yielded impressive results generating 
2,485 mwh in energy savings. the work 
was performed on various equipment 
throughout the factories by working with 
lighting, ventilation and isolation.

reducing fuel consumption 
switching to certified renewable electricity 
along with additional reduction of fossil 
fuels have been key drivers in reducing 
the scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60% 
compared to 2019. in 2020, fuel for 
stationary and non-stationary equipment 
accounted for 47% of the corporate 
greenhouse gas emissions (ghg emis-
sions) making reduction in fuel consump-
tion central to the ambition to become a 
net-zero emissions company. the work to 
convert processes and  
machinery to renewable energy sources 
has been initiated with a dedicated focus 
on the transition of the company fleet to  
electrical/hybrid vehicles (ev). to support 
this change, electric chargers will be 
installed at several sites during 2021. 
at the high-voltage cable factory in 
karlskrona, sweden, forklifts have been 
upgraded to run on alternative fuel. this 
project will be evaluated on an ongoing 
basis with a view to implementation 
company-wide.
in poland, a local initiative aimed at 
optimizing truckloads has produced 
positive results in the form of reduced fuel 
consumption as fewer trucks are needed 
to transport goods. it is currently being 
investigated to implement the initiative at 
other sites. 
the cable-laying vessel nkt victoria  
accounts for a significant part of the 
corporate fuel consumption, contributing 
to 19% of the overall scope 1 and 2 emis-
sions in the reporting period. accordingly, 
she has a central role in the ambition 
to consistently reduce the offshore 
environmental impact, and is constantly 
the focus of initiatives to reduce fuel 
consumption and ghg emissions and to 
increase onboard energy efficiency.  
fuel consumption is significantly lower for 
nkt victoria than for equivalent vessels 
due to a unique combination of technol-
ogies, including azipod propulsion units, 
energy storage for marine applications, 
and a specially designed onboard grid. 
last but not least, nkt victoria is also 
equipped to be powered by electricity 
when in port significantly reducing her 
fuel consumption.
“ we were motivated to do small but important 
contributions to become more sustainable 
by reducing the emissions caused by our 
transportation. several departments engaged 
to make the project a reality and it has positive 
impact on both our work environment, cost 
efficiency and of course the environment. on 
top of that our customers were satisfied as 
they could receive their orders sooner.”

nkt has committed to 
reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions by an 
average of 
5%
 
annually.
risks
for nkt, the principal environmental 
exposure relates to the handling and use 
of chemicals, the consumption of energy 
arising from manufacture of power cables 
and accessories, and the consumption 
of fuel for power cable installations and 
transport of goods. 
to mitigate this exposure, a dedicated 
qhse policy is in place as well as proce-
dures for ensuring compliance with inter-
nal guidelines and external regulations. 
to continuously track and minimize the 
environmental footprint, nkt has a kpi 
framework including monthly follow-up 
procedures for data analysis. during 
2020, four gas leakages were detected 
which were quickly neutralized using 
established procedures. the root causes 
are being investigated so that mitigating 
actions can be implemented.

taking recycling to a new level 
in 1960, nkt developed the first methods of recycling cable scrap at the dedi-
cated facility in stenlille, denmark. since then, the methods for recycling power 
cables have been innovated while reprocessing tonnes of cable scrap every 
year. the stenlille facility has now entered a new era with the acquisition by the 
norwegian recycling specialist kabel metall & trafo gjenvinning as (kmt). it is 
a transaction which opens a new chapter for the facility itself and further drives 
the recycling commitment of nkt. the divestment of the facility supports the 
corporate ambitions to take full product responsibility and contribute to the 
circular economy by increasing the recycling rate from the power cable  
production. this will include increasing recycling and reuse of metals and 
plastics and reducing waste. nkt continues to be a long-term partner at the 
recycling facility in stenlille.
circularity
journey to zero waste
nkt is committed to eliminating waste, 
and progress is based on a long-term 
focus on the reuse and recycling of 
cable scrap and other materials. in 2020, 
several local initiatives supporting the 
zero-waste objective were launched.  
teams at all factories are reducing the 
use of the landfill and current state is that 
use of landfill constitutes only 4% of the 
total waste treatment processes of nkt. 
when it comes to waste reduction,  
production processes play an important 
role and efficient material utilization has 
been a long-term focus area. 
part of the ambition is to become free of 
single-use plastics, and in 2021 efforts to 
realize the ambition will continue across 
the organization.

polyethylene (xlpe). in close collabora-
tion with the swedish research institute 
rise ivf, axjo plastic and materials  
specialist borealis, nkt succeeded in 
recycling xlpe material, an important 
step in driving sustainability in the entire 
life cycle of the product portfolio.  
with the successful industrialization of 
this process, axjo plastic is now  
manufacturing robust cable drums from 
recycled xlpe with clear benefits; the 
material costs are significantly reduced 
compared to new raw materials and  
approximately two tonnes of co2e are 
saved for every tonne of recycled xlpe.

eco-design and innovation
nkt is continuously developing new 
technologies to enable more efficient,  
reliable and sustainable power transmis-
sion based on environmentally friendly 
materials. the need for new technology 
is essential for a low carbon future as 
the global power grids are constantly 
expanding, driven by megatrends such as 
urbanization, decentralization and a  
growing demand for electricity produced 
from renewable energy sources. 
as a technology leader in the power 
cable industry, nkt has a long-term 
strategy to be an key player in develop-
ing the next generation of power cables 
and accessories to deliver the solutions 
needed to drive the transition to renewa-
ble energy. 
superconducting technology 
during 2020, nkt began developing the 
prototype technology for the world’s long-
est superconducting power cable system. 
this system, which is being developed in 
close collaboration with five other part-
ners and will be specially designed for the 
city of munich, germany, is a milestone 
project that will take superconducting 
technology to a new level.  
superconducting power cables have 
massive potential for creating the infra-
structure needed to meet the growing 
demand for clean energy in large cities 
as it is extremely compact compared to 
conventional power cable technology and 
can be installed with less construction 
work. 
materials development
in nkt, environmental impact and carbon 
footprint are core considerations in the 
development of new products and solu-
tions. a key focus in this development is 
to design for sustainable manufacturing 
processes, efficient material usage, long 
product lifespan and potential for decom-
missioning and recycling. nkt investi-
gates, develop and test new materials on 
an ongoing basis with constant focus on 
minimizing the environmental impact of its 
products and solutions. 
the development of new and 
more environmental friendly 
materials is key to become a 
net-zero emissions company.

tion for the supplier base in high-impact 
categories. 
nkt has a supplier qualification process 
in place to ensure due diligence and trans-
parency in the supply chain: the process 
includes confirmation of compliance with 
the code of conduct, including specific 
elements relating to quality, health, safety, 
environment and iso-certifications.  
during the year, all strategic suppliers 
were qualified covering up to 80% of 
annual spend.
digital procurement processes
in 2019, nkt market place, an automated 
ordering platform which facilitates compli-
ant ordering from approved and qualified 
vendors, was introduced.  
the primary benefits of the platform 
are optimal operational efficiency and 
increased transparency as all actions 
are digitalized. furthermore, nkt market 
place is linked directly to corporate 
policies and the code of conduct, 
strengthening the overview of supplier 
compliance. 
nkt market place processed more than 
5,500 purchase orders in 2020 pertaining 
to the high-voltage manufacturing sites.  
in 2021, the implementation continues to 
the remaining manufacturing sites,  
targeting 80% automation in ordering 
when fully implemented in 2022.

greenhouse gas emissions:
scope 1: reporting is conducted based on the greenhouse 
gas protocol (ghg protocol) and covers direct nkt emissions 
included in the scope of reporting. emissions are calculated 
based on the emission factors applicable to the type of fuel. 
emissions from the biofuels are excluded from the scope 1 
emissions and are reported separately as per ghg protocol.
scope 2: reporting is conducted based on the ghg protocol 
and covers indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the gen-
eration of power, heat and steam purchased and consumed 
by nkt. the calculation is conducted based on the volumes 
purchased and average emission factors based on the site 
location. within the method is based on emission factors. 
market based calculation is based on the guarantees of origin 
certification as well as other calculations.
scope 3: reporting is based on the ghg protocol using the 
quantis scope 3 evaluator tool which divides the scope 3 in-
ventory into 15 subcategories. c5 are calculated based on ac-
tual waste data multiplied by relevant emission factors. c6 are 
calculated based on ghg emissions from airplane travel provid-
ed by our travel agent. c9 are calculated based on volumes of 
residual products, estimated distances transported and relevant 
ghg emission factors for transportation. the subcategories 
c10 and c12-c15 are not relevant for nkt operations. 
carbon intensity: calculated based on the total scope 1 and 
2 (market based) of emissions divided by the revenue.
environmental incidents: reported based on the hse 
reporting principles.
an environmental impact incident is defined as discharge or 
release of hazardous substances into the environment, or 
negative impact on stakeholders, have occurred. discharges 
or releases that have been decontaminated before causing 
harm to the environment is not classified as an environmental 
impact incident but reported as an environmental incident.
green electricity share: calculated based on the share of 
verified green electricity subtracting the entities where  
non-renewable electricity are used.

description of business model photonics
nkt photonics is an active 
corporate citizen with 
a global mindset and is 
committed to responsible 
and ethical business 
conduct.  
developing and fostering long-lasting 
relationships with stakeholders is integral 
to the business philosophy of nkt  
photonics, and this is achieved through  
a compliance regime. 
compliance landscape
in 2016, nkt photonics adopted an 
updated compliance landscape cover-
ing the period to 2020. the vision is to 
maintain and further develop a strong 
ethos of compliance within the compa-
ny, and the purpose of the compliance 
landscape is to ensure conformance with 
laws, regulations, international stand-
ards and stakeholder expectations. the 
compliance landscape is anchored in the  
business code of conduct, which applies 
to all employees, and representatives of 
the company.
developing a strong compliance mindset 
across the company demands proper 
training. accordingly, training in line with 
the established compliance landscape 
continued in the organization in 2020. 
business code of conduct
the nkt photonics business code of 
conduct applies to all employees and 
defines the fundamental principles gov-
erning the behaviour internally as well as 
externally in relation to vendors, partners, 
the supply chain and the general public. 
the principles set out in the code are de-
signed to guide and ensure the right de-
cisions are taking in all business actions. 
the code identifies how business must 
be conducted across the organization 
and includes policies relating to business 
integrity, anti-corruption, environment, fair 
competition, human and labour rights, 
information security, product compliance 
and quality, compliance management, 
and misconduct reporting.
training and awareness  
as part of an extensive onboarding 
processes, all new employees in nkt 
photonics are introduced to the business 
code of conduct and trained and tested 
in its use by means of e-learning courses. 
a video presentation by the ceo explains 
the importance of correct business 
conduct and what the code of conduct 
means to the company. 
the focus and emphasis on proper busi-
ness conduct was maintained in 2020. 
strong focus is placed on minimizing this 
exposure both internally and externally, 
and anti-corruption is also an integral part 
of the corporate training agenda, which 
also includes the code of conduct.
since 2016, nkt photonics has extended 
the availability of the whistleblower hotline 
to external stakeholders for reporting 
instances of unethical behaviour.
sustainability focus areas
to ensure commitment at senior level and 
support at local level, the managements 
of all nkt photonics’ entities have signed 
a statement of representation based 
on the principles of the business code 
of conduct for the reporting of potential 
violations. the contents of the individ-
ual statements of representation are 
subsequently consolidated and potential 
actions are taken accordingly. policies, 
actions, goals, and plans are presented 
in the sections below for the following

anti-corruption 
participation in corruption and bribery is 
contrary to the business values of nkt 
photonics, and the company refrains from 
such activities.
the company has a clear anti- 
corruption policy; no officer, employee, 
or representative may directly or indirect-
ly offer, give, or accept money or  
anything else of value as part of business 
dealings in order to obtain an improper 
advantage. 
key risks in regard to corruption and 
bribery are primarily linked to the interac-
tion with external vendors, suppliers, and 
business partners. 
nkt photonics works to minimize these 
risks both internally and externally: 
anti-corruption is an integral part of the  
corporate training program covering 
among others the business code of 
conduct in which all employees receive 
appropriate training. 
sustainability report 2020 | nkt a/s | 39
nkt photonics is committed 
to working for a sound 
environment through 
sustainable business 
practices.
nkt photonics has implemented an  
environment, energy and climate policy 
company-wide through campaigns and 
training to ensure a high level of aware-
ness throughout the organization.
product manufacture at nkt photonics 
entails little environmental footprint and 
relatively small amounts of raw materials 
are used. no material environmental 
exposure is deemed to exist. the majority 
of the products are manufactured in 
compliance with regulations such as the 
rohs directive, which restricts the use of 
hazardous substances in electronic and 
electrical equipment.
the corporate operations have very 
limited environmental impact compared 
with conventional industry. the total 
energy consumption is also determined 
more by current product mix – e.g. the 
ratio of high-power lasers to lower-power 
lasers – than by the energy economies 
introduced. it is therefore difficult to define 
relevant kpis for consistent and long-term 
measurement, and no such kpis have 
therefore been introduced.
supporting wind power 
environment 
energy and climate
the latest generation of wind 
lidar from nkt photonics 
enables continuous optimiza-
tion of the turbine, resulting 
in up to 5% higher turbine 
efficiency.
as electricity generation 
becomes more distributed 
with the increase in 
renewable energy sources 
like wind and solar, and 
as demand becomes more 
complex, cable operators 
are facing higher demands 
for up-time and for 
sophisticated balancing of 
grid load. 
nkt photonics produces sensing 
systems that monitor the power cables 
used in the energy grid using an optical 
fiber embedded in the power cable. this 
enables the system to monitor and predict 
cable conditions, ensuring more efficient 
utilization of the power grid, fewer disrup-
tions and enhanced load balancing from 
the distributed renewable energy sources.
increasing wind turbine efficiency
efficiency and reliability of modern wind 
turbines rely on accurate measurement 
and prediction of wind speed and direc-
tion, so that turbine orientation and blade 
angle can be continuously adjusted to 
changing wind conditions. nkt photon-
ics’ koheras fiber lasers are used in wind 
lidar equipment that is capable of meas-
uring 3d wind speed and direction in real 
time. these systems are traditionally used 
to determine the ideal location for new 
wind farm installations, ensuring optimum 
placement and high efficiency.
the latest generation of wind lidar from 
nkt photonics is designed to be mount-
ed directly on each wind turbine, where 
it constantly measures the wind speed 
before it hits the turbine blades. this 
enables continuous optimization of the 
turbine, resulting in up to 5% higher tur-
bine efficiency and reduced component 
wear. combined, nkt photonics’ lasers 
enable both more reliable and efficient 
wind energy production. combined, nkt 
photonics’ lasers enable both more relia-
ble wind power and higher efficiency.

from nkt photonics 
makes wind turbines 
up to
5%
 
more efficient.

ensuring a healthy, safe and 
secure working environment 
is fundamental to the 
continued growth of nkt 
photonics and is therefore an 
intrinsic part of the everyday 
activities.
nkt photonics values all employees and 
consider them key to company success. 
hence, diversity in the workplace is per-
ceived as a key asset and the company 
does not tolerate any form of harassment 
or discrimination and is firmly committed 
to equality of opportunity for all employ-
ees.
at nkt photonics, the principal expo-
sure in terms of human and labour rights 
relates to safety and employment, and 
clear processes and policies are therefore 
in place to mitigate these risks.  
all employees are employed on contracts 
that comply with local labour laws and 
their safety is closely monitored.

as nkt photonics mainly operates in 
low-risk countries. a key element in risk 
prevention is the whistleblower hotline.
reporting according to the uk 
modern slavery act 
as stated in the policy on human and 
labour rights, nkt photonics rejects any 
form of forced labour, including bonded 
labour, indentured labour, slave labour 
and human trafficking. furthermore, the 
company does not condone the hiring 
of child labour. in view of the countries in 
which it mainly operates and the nature of 
the production, nkt photonics does not 
deem to be materially at risk in this  
regard. however, employees are com-
mitted to continuously identifying and 
mitigating potential violations. 
the company’s business partners are 
expected to comply with the principles 
set the in the business code of conduct, 
and relevant due diligence processes is 
pursued in conjunction with mergers and

diversity
diversity is encouraged in the organiza-
tion of nkt photonics, as it is believed 
to enrich the corporate culture as well 
as the long-term competitiveness. nkt 
photonics is committed to promoting 
gender equality without compromising on 
qualifications in terms of professional skills 
and personal competencies. the industry 
– especially in r&d departments – typical-
ly has a relatively high over-representation 
of males.

driving healthcare innovation
nkt photonics produces 
several products targeted 
at the medical and life 
science markets with the 
aim of improving health and 
wellbeing globally.
nkt photonics’ unique supercontinuum 
white light lasers are incorporated in all 
high-end confocal microscopes from 
leica microsystems. used in medical 
research around the globe, these micro-
scopes deliver unprecedented resolution 
and ability to distinguish between differ-
ent kinds of cells in a sample. in a recent 
example, leica’s microscopes were used 
in covid-19 research, helping to detect 
antibodies important in vaccine devel-
opment. in 2020, leica also launched an 
all-new mid-range microscope equipped 
with nkt photonics’ technology, thereby 
bringing high-end performance to labora-
tories that could otherwise not afford it.
driving healthcare with ultrafast 
lasers 
in addition to its supercontinuum white 
light lasers, which are used in a wide 
array of bio-imaging applications, nkt 
photonics produces ultrafast lasers. 
these lasers also have several medical 
applications, the most important being for 
ophthalmology and marking of medical 
devices. 
in ophthalmology, nkt photonics’ ultra-
fast lasers are used for eye surgery, the 
very short and clean pulses from these 
lasers replacing traditional methods using 
scalpels. consequently, the cuts are more 
precise, and the risk of complications and 
recovery time are reduced. moreover, au-
tomated surgery with lasers requires only 
weeks of training to perform, whereas it 
typically takes years to train a skilled eye 
surgeon. with this technology, life-chang-
ing surgery can therefore be delivered 
both at lower cost and in areas where 
skilled surgeons are not available. 
finally, ultrafast lasers are used for mark-
ing of medical equipment, such as sur-
gical tools or vials containing medicine. 
this marking is critical to ensure tracing 
and authentication of both equipment and 
medicine. furthermore, the marking must 
be inert and able to withstand autoclave 
sterilization without changing, something 
that is beyond most traditional marking 
techniques. this is because the high tem-
peratures and humidity of the autoclaves 
quickly erase the marking, or result in rust 
if the surface has been removed by the 
marking technique. using ultrafast lasers, 
hospitals can reliably track all equipment 
and its state of sterilization.
in the case of vials containing medicine, 
authenticity and trackability are a major 
concern. as some medicaments can 
cost enormous sums per dose, counter-
feit medicine is a significant problem in 
certain parts of the world. ultrafast lasers 
can be used to embed barcodes and 
serial numbers directly inside the glass 
vial, which cannot be changed or copied, 
thereby ensuring that the vial content is 
authentic.
nkt photonics’ unique super-
continuum white light lasers 
are incorporated in all high-
end confocal microscopes 
from leica microsystems. 
recently used to detect an-
tibodies important in vaccine 
development for covid-19.

whistleblower hotline
in 2016, nkt photonics extended the whistleblower 
scheme to enable instances of unethical behaviour 
also to be reported by external stakeholders. the 
whistleblower policy has also been incorporated in the business 
code of conduct, which has been implemented through awareness 
campaigns and e-learning courses mandatory to all employees 
worldwide. in 2020, no reports were filed which necessitated 
material adjustments in business procedures.

group
nkt a/s monitors progress 
on sustainability by means 
of three main elements:
1.  key performance indicators have been 
developed based on relevant policies 
and corresponding data is collected. 
this data covers parameters such as 
occupational injuries, environmental 
impact, material utilization and diversity 
development at board and senior 
leadeship level. the business units are 
responsible for kpi quality and data 
collection.
2.  an annual statement of representation 
covering the principles of the code of 
conduct is signed by senior manage-
ment representing the activities of the 
two standalone companies.
3.  a whistleblower hotline, maintained by 
an external provider, allows all employ-
ees as well as external stakeholders 
to raise concerns about seemingly 
inappropriate conduct, events or 
circumstances.
group compliance and reporting principles
reporting methodology
the reporting parameters used in 2020 
are largely unchanged from previous 
reports. the present report covers all enti-
ties of nkt a/s unless otherwise stated.
data integrity
the data is considered to be valid.
auditing
the present report has not been audited 
by an external auditor.
reporting period
for all environmental data the reporting 
period in this report is from q4 2019 to 
q3 2020 and full year for social and  
governance reporting. nkt photonics 
reports full year in all areas. 
diversity and inclusion 
as described in the diversity policy, nkt 
a/s is firmly committed to equality of 
treatment for all employees. as part of 
this commitment, the workforce com-
position and changes are monitored as 
shown below. nkt a/s promotes equality 
of gender representation and are further 
committed to promoting equality of 
career opportunities, nationality, religion, 
age and other factors. diversity is a key 
consideration when hiring for executive 
management and the board of directors. 
at board level, a target has been set 
to have at least two members from the 
underrepresented gender amongst the 
six annually elected board members. 
this target was achieved in 2020 and is 
unchanged for 2021.
