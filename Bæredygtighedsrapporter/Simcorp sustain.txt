making everything 
count
at simcorp, sustainability and financial performance go hand 
in hand. while our main focus is on delivering value to our 
clients and shareholders, our business decisions are also guid-
ed by considerations that include our people and our planet. 
acting responsibly is realizing that everything counts. for the 
people we engage with, for us as a company, as well as for the 
planet and future generations we impact by our choices.
acting responsibly  
is about choices and 
mindset, but it also 
makes sense. now and 
for the future.
our employees and who we are as a company 
enable us to make a positive contribution to 
the world, just as we take responsibility for 
reducing the negative impact of our opera-
tions. while we believe that everything counts, 
we want to direct our efforts towards those 
areas where we have the biggest impact.   
four key focus areas 
in 2020, we have taken a decision to make 
sustainability part of our corporate strategic 
agenda and ambition. based on a materiality 
assessment, taking into account our business 
and operating model, culture, and values, 
and including a systematic assessment of our 
impact on the sustainable development goals 
(sdgs), we have identified four key areas of 
impact: ‘reducing co2 footprint’, ‘expanding 
esg investment support’, ‘fostering a truly 
diverse and inclusive culture’, and ‘creating 
meaning in work’. these four impact drivers 
will contribute particularly to three un sdgs: 
‘climate action’ (sdg 13), ‘responsible 
consumption and production’ (sdg 12), and 
‘decent work and economic growth’ (sdg 8).

we have identified four key value drivers 
rooted in who we are as a company
where can we make most impact?
we set and commit to our goals
technology will be the key driver of positive 
climate impact, and as a software-enabled 
services provider, we will leverage cloud 
and new technologies to help reduce co2 
emissions. during covid-19, we have wit-
nessed how technology has enabled business 
continuity, as virtual collaboration has re-
placed face-to-face meetings with colleagues 
and clients across the globe. travel-related 
co2 emissions by far constitute our main 
footprint and we commit to supporting virtual 
collaboration and reducing our travel activity 
in 2021 by 50% compared with 2019 levels.
esg investments have become a major driver 
of redefining the role investment manage-
ment firms can and must play in ensuring 
global sustainable development. simcorp’s 
services enable the world’s largest investors 
to optimize wealth creation for millions of 
people, and at the same time maximize their 
impact on the well-being of humans and our 
planet through sustainable investments. we 
commit ourselves to expanding the scope 
and strength of our esg investment support 
to help sustainable investments become 
mainstream and part of the new normal.
we are committed to making simcorp a truly 
diverse and inclusive workplace. a workplace 
where all employees have equal opportunities, 
feel included, and are valued for the different 
perspectives and competencies they bring. 
specifically, we want to build an inclusive 
culture, boost diverse talent, and increase 
female leadership. we commit to increasing 
the share of women at all management levels 
and on our board.
meaning in work means something different 
to each of our employees. therefore, we 
commit to supporting meaning in work in a 
number of different ways: through profession-
al development, by enabling employees to 
contribute to sustainability, and by supporting 
work-life-balance and well-being. because 
everything counts. 
staying accountable
this report is our second communication on 
progress (cop) on our efforts to integrate the 
un global compact’s ten principles into our 
business strategy, culture, and operations. we 
reaffirm our support of the principles and stay 
accountable for acting responsibly. in 2021, 
we will work to identify important industry 
sustainability agendas and explore how we 
can play a role to increase the corporate re-
sponsibility taken on by our industry at large.

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  policies, principles and supporting actions    6
policies, principles and 
supporting actions
simcorp’s approach to corporate social responsibility 
and sustainability is rooted in our dna and integrated in 
how we act and do businsess. our policies and guidelines 
are developed to help us and our stakeholders act in 
 accordance with our values and regulations.
policies and guidelines
our board of directors have adopted our 
polities and guidelines, which can all be found 
on our website:
• corporate social responsibility policy
• diversity and inclusion policy
• guideline for good business behavior
• remuneration guidelines
• corporate governance guidelines
• tax policy
• whistleblower policy
our policies and guidelines, as well as our 
contracts, are aimed at ‘doing the right 
thing’ concerning social and labor matters, 
human rights, anti-corruption, bribery, and 
the environment. we commit to ensuring 
a sustained adherence to the principles by 
carrying out training and information activities 
for those to whom they apply and perform 
continuous monitoring.
supporting actions and processes
reflecting who we are as a company, we run a 
number of activities and processes to support 
the ten principles of the un global compact 
and our commitment to corporate social 
responsibility. these activities focus on:
• social and labor matters;
• human rights, anti-corruption, and bribery;
• impact on the environment.
we stay accountable for our commitment to 
these focus areas and track our performance 
on a selection of related non-financial metrics, 
included in the esg report on pp. 14-17. 
furthermore, simcorp’s compliance with the 
danish corporate governance recommenda-
tions is covered in our corporate governance 
report, which is part of the management 
report of simcorp’s annual report 2020.
social and labor matters 
employee programs 
we regard the continual development of our 
employees’ competences and their social, 
mental, and physical well-being and safety 
to be of high importance. in all our business, 
and to realize our strategic priorities, we 
rely on our employees’ financial expertise, 
software skills, and diversity. our employees 
have many different educational backgrounds, 
spanning from economics, it, and engineering 
to ux design, communication, psychology, 
and more, and we have a strong focus on 
ongoing training and knowledge sharing. new 
employees are informed about the simcorp 
code of conduct and how we do business, all 
outlined in our guideline for good business 
behavior. in addition, all simcorp policies and 
procedures are available on our intranet. 
we run a comprehensive training program, 
which aims to ensure that all employees 
update and develop their qualifications on 
a regular basis. an important feature of 
simcorp’s training program is the simcorp 
dimension academy certification program, 
which is mandatory for all new simcorp di-
mension consultants and developers. a global 
well-being program is also in place, including 
a number of regular activities, which focus on 
the social, mental and physical well-being of 
all employees (see also p. 13 on resilience and 
employee well-being during covid-19). 
our working environment organization 
(weo) at simcorp’s headquarters in copen-
hagen is established to manage and bring 
attention to health and safety in our work 
environment. we run a workplace assessment 
every third year to ensure that employee input 
on health and safety is discussed and consid-
ered. employees have a weo representative 
to whom any working environment issue 
should be reported.
human rights, anti-corruption,  
and bribery
our approach to human rights, anti-corrup-
tion, and bribery, as well as the principles to 
which we as employees and the company’s 
suppliers should adhere, are outlined in 
simcorp’s guideline for good  
business behavior

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  policies, principles and supporting actions    7
simcorp’s guideline for good business 
behavior, which is found on our website.
simcorp’s guideline for  
good business behavior
for employees  
simcorp’s guideline for good business 
behavior acts as a framework to guide and 
support our employees to act within sim-
corp’s core business principles. the guideline 
is established as a means of ensuring that 
we continuously maintain a high standard in 
our conduct and it sets forward principles 
directing employees to:  
• avoid conflicts of interest
• avoid insider trading 
• avoid bribes and facilitation payments or     
     any kind of corruption* 
•  maintain high standards when it comes to 
information security and privacy**
*zero tolerance towards bribes and 
 facilitation payments
simcorp has zero tolerance towards bribes 
and facilitation payments. our corporate 
anti-bribery rules and guidelines are described 
in our guideline for good business behavior.
**information security and privacy 
simcorp maintains an information security 
policy, which defines the security-related 
rules and requirements for use of information 
technology across the company. the policy 
also defines the rules for monitoring and 
logging events in order to detect and investi-
gate security incidents. 
this policy is based on iso27001 principles. 
it is reviewed and updated at least annually 
and subsequently approved by the executive 
management board and the board. the 
audit and risk committee is responsible for 
maintaining the policy and overseeing our 
compliance with the policy. 
additionally, our ‘simcorp dimension as-a-
service’ (asp) offerings are supported by 
isae3402 and soc2 third-party audit reports, 
which document the control framework and 
operating effectiveness of this service.
we provide our privacy policy to all new 
contacts (clients, prospect clients, and visitors 
to the company’s website) that are registered 
in the company’s crm system to inform them 
about our protection of personal data. the 
privacy policy is compliant with eu general 
data protection regulation (gdpr) and 
informs contacts about their right to insight, 
deletion, and to complain about processing 
of personal data. the privacy policy is easily 
accessible on our website.
further, we provide employee privacy policies 
detailing the information gathered and used 
by simcorp during the course of the em-
ployee’s employment with simcorp. simcorp 
dimension supports the clients’ efforts to 
ensure compliance with gdpr, including 
functionality to better protect and separate 
personal data within the application. when 
dealing with suppliers, simcorp enters into 
data processing agreements, whenever this is 
required under gdpr. 
for suppliers  
our guideline for good business behavior 
also applies to our procurement process and 
to all our suppliers. we will on a regular basis 
inform them about the provisions and any 
amendments hereto. suppliers are requested 
to confirm adherence to these principles:
• 
 suppliers must ensure that they, and any 
relevant sub-contractors, comply with the 
un convention on child labor, article 32.1, 
and must recognize children’s rights to be 
protected from economic exploitation and 
from performing any work that is likely 
to be hazardous or to interfere with the 
child’s education, or to be harmful to the 
child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, 
moral, or social development.
• 
 suppliers must respect equal status 
between the sexes and between persons 
of different races and religion.
• 
 suppliers must not offer products and 
services, which have directly or indirectly 
been designed, manufactured, produced, 
or procured in contravention of local 
environmental legislation or other legisla-
tion, or by means of corruption, bribery, or 
other fraudulent behavior.
compliance 
from time to time, we carry out tests and 
surveys to ensure that all employees and 
suppliers are familiar with the terms of these 
guidelines. 
in 2020, one non-compliance incident was 
registered (2019: 0 incidents).
whistleblower policy
simcorp’s has established whistleblower 
system as a means of increasing focus on 
transparency. the whistleblower system 
allows employees, management, members of 
the board of directors of simcorp, and other 
stakeholders of simcorp (such as supplier 
representatives, clients, or simcorp share-
holders) who believe they have become aware 
of actions or omissions that could damage 
simcorp whether financially, reputationally, or 
in some other way to pass on this information 
to a whistleblower hotline.
our policies and guidelines are aimed at 
addressing any risks that our business could 
generate concerning social and labor matters, 
human rights, anti-corruption, bribery, and 
the environment.  
content
simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  policies, principles and supporting actions    8
the board of directors has appointed two 
board members to oversee whistleblowing. 
the board of directors is responsible for 
appointing representatives who possesses 
the professional qualifications and integrity to 
safeguard the administration of the whis-
tleblower policy.
any information received via the whistleblow-
er system will be passed on as appropriate to 
the ceo and the chairman of the board of 
directors who will then consider the appropri-
ate measures, and all cases are monitored to 
their conclusion. reports and questions that 
are received via the whistleblower system are 
treated confidentially.
one report relating to employee data security 
was submitted through the whistleblower 
hotline in 2020 (2019: 0).
impact on the environment
we work to run our business operations in 
a continually more sustainable way, thereby 
reducing our negative environmental impact, 
which almost entirely relates  to energy con-
sumption. in 2020, we have made ‘reducing 
our own and our clients’ footprint’ one of four 
key focus areas of simcorp’s sustainability 
agenda. for more information on our specific 
goals and actions, see p. 11.

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  business model and  stakeholder engagement    9
business model and  stakeholder engagement
simcorp’s business model is highly transparent, and we maintain 
an open ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders. the past year 
has demonstrated the robustness of our business model during a 
time of unprecedented challenges and volaility. 
a robust business model
simcorp’s business model builds on four main 
revenue drivers: software licenses; software 
updates and support; professional services; 
and hosting and other services. our role in 
society is to generate economic value for all 
our main stakeholders; clients, shareholders, 
employees, and society alike.
as reflected in our business model, simcorp 
contributes to society through job creation, 
tax payments, and contribution to gdp. 
simcorp is committed to fulfilling the tax 
requirements in all the countries where we do 
business, including paying corporate income 
tax and payroll tax from salaries paid to our 
employees. simcorp’s corporate income tax is 
included in our esg report pages 14-17.
during covid-19, we have continued our 
nurturing of client relationships through vir-
tual meetings, workshops, and training pro-
grams. the strength of these relationships 
and a resilient operating model have enabled 
our solution delivery and business continuity 
to be largely uninterrupted, allowing us to 
continue carrying out implementations, 
software updates and support activities, 
client-driven development programs, and 
our professional services operations.
nurturing and measuring 
stakeholder engagement
we maintain an open dialogue with our stake-
holders and actively nurture engagement. 
in our regular client satisfaction survey, net 
promoter score (nps), we gauge our clients’ 
satisfaction with our solutions, services, and 
support. in 2020, we managed to reach an 
impressive score of 44 points (2029: 39), 
largely driven by high levels of product quality 
(see esg report pages 14-17). 
internally, we pride ourselves on having a 
straightforward dialogue with and among all 
of our employees. our employee engagement 
survey, which is carried out twice a year,  
ensures that we have a constantly high level 
of engagement and motivation among our 
employees across the organization and are 
able to address any potential issues (see also 
page 12).

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  key sustainability  impact drivers    10
key sustainability  impact drivers
our commitment to sustainability is about making everything 
count and having a long-term impact. although, we are a 
small part of a large ecosystem of financial institutions and in-
vestors, we are a leader in our field. and with our size and role 
comes responsibility. to embed  sustainability in everything we 
do, as individuals and as a company, and to focus where we 
can make the most impact.
our commitment to sustainability
sustainability takes an holistic approach and 
it is not about cherry-picking or doing quick 
fixes. it is about working for the greater good 
in the long term. simcorp’s commitment to 
sustainability is to make everything count, 
while focusing on where we can make the 
biggest impact. we have chosen four key 
sustainability impact drivers that are rooted in, 
who we are as a company: 
• 
 reducing our own and our  
clients’ co2 footprint
• 
 expanding our support for  
esg investments
• 
 ensuring a truly diverse and  
inclusive culture
• 
creating meaning in work
while currently focusing our efforts on these 
key impact areas, we continue to assess 
where we can make the most impact and, if 
necessary, adjust our priorities. 
impact mapping  
- because everything counts
to help assess the impact of our activities, we 
divide these into three categories and regard 
these as equally important (see illustration to 
the right):

internal impact 
e.g. through reducing

e.g. through reducing co2 
emissons from simcorp 
offerings consumed by 
our clients and choosing 
suppliers who are aligned 
with simcorp’s values and 
principles.
global impact
e.g. indirectly through 
expanding our support for 
our clients’ esg invest-
ments, which can drive a 
massive positive impact 
and significantly reduce 
negative impact.

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  key sustainability  impact drivers    11
reducing our own and our clients’ 
co2 footprint 
there is a need to help protect our planet 
from climate change caused by increasing 
global resource consumption. we want to 
contribute by reducing simcorp’s and our 
clients’ co2 emissions, short and long term.
decarbonizing our offerings and operations
intelligent ressource optimization is a key 
driver of reducing our co2 emissions, enabled 
by modern technology and behavioral change.
overall, our goal is to reduce our co2 emis-
sions by 50%. to achieve this, we will focus on 
where we have the biggest negative impact 
and reduce our energy consumption by:
• 
 reducing air travel and increasing virtual 
meetings to reduce carbon emissions
• 
 moving simcorp’s and our clients’ opera-
tions from on-premise to cloud (microsoft 
azure) for improved data center energy 
efficiency.
• 
 applying modern computing to improve 
overall energy footprint and utilize digital 
resources in optimized ways. 
we have set specific targets for these three 
focus areas along with energy consumption 
related to our office buildings. these targets 
and our results can be found in our esg 
report on pages 14-17.
initiatives, goals, and achievements:
 
air travel 
 virtual meetings
our goals is to reduce co2 emission from air 
travel by 50% compared with 2019 level.
on-premise 
 cloud
in 2019, simcorp started decommissioning its 
own datacenters as part of a cloud transition 
with microsoft azure as our main cloud 
supplier. microsoft’s public cloud services have 
been operating 100% carbon neutral since 
2012 by applying a global internal carbon fee 
model that charges microsoft business units 
for carbon emissions from their operations.  
microsoft has pledged to reduce its operational 
carbon emissions by 75% by 2030, against a 
2013 baseline, and to purchase 70% renewable 
energy for their datacenters by 2023, on a path 
to 100% (60% in 2019). our goal is to reduce 
co2 emission from internal server installations 
by 45% in 2022 (compared with 2019). 
also, we offer clients to move simcorp opera- 
tions to cloud computing. our goal is to move 
35% of our client business to cloud by 2025.
high performance computing
a number of r&d projects apply modern 
computing to investigate how simcorp can 
apply for instance high performance comput-
ing that provides much faster processing and 
consumes less energy. this will allow us to 
offer and our clients to consume services with 
a reduced co2 footprint.
reducing food waste
at simcorp headquarters, our canteen staff 
have investigated what measures would have 
most impact in order to reduce food waste 
and co2 emission from providing breakfast 
and lunch to our employees. the analysis 
clearly documented that knowing the exact 
number of people to serve and portioning the 
food instead of serving a buffet can poten-
tially reduce food waste and co2 emissions 
by around 50%. based on these finding, we 
have made it mandatory to register whether 
you are having lunch at the office and all 
food is portioned. with most people working 
from home due to covid-19, the canteen is 
currently only serving very few employees, 
but we will maintain these measures, when 
more return to the office, as well as look into 
how reducing e.g. the consumption of meat 
can help reduce co2 emissions.
expanding our support for esg 
investments
simcorp’s ambition is to become a leading 
provider of an esg investment platform and 
a digital enabler of esg investments globally. 
simcorp will help enable the world’s largest 
investment institutions to turn sustainabil-
ity into a mainstream activity across their 
businesses.
we want to help our clients comply with 
current and future regulations applying 
to esg investments by providing data 
transparency in the growing landscape of esg 
investment opportunities, where financial and 
non-financial data together shape new forms 
of complexity, and by ensuring sufficient 
data management and portfolio construction 
capabilities.
simcorp’s main product offering simcorp 
dimension® and its regulatory compliance 
services already enable global investment 
managers to meet increasing general 
demands for transparency and reporting, 
thereby supporting sdg target 10.5: improve 
the regulation and monitoring of global finan-
cial markets and institutions and strengthen 
the implementation of such regulations.
ensuring a truly diverse and 
inclusive culture
operating from 26 locations, counting 
68 nationalities, simcorp is a truly global 
workplace. our ambition is to put diversity 
into play, to ensure different perspectives can 
come together, and that all voices are heard. 
great minds don’t think alike and that is what 
fuels an innovative company like simcorp.
 
at simcorp, we want to create a strong 
sense of belonging for all our employees and 
nurture a culture of inclusion. we will do this 
by advancing equal career opportunities and 
by welcoming every new perspective to spark 
collaboration and innovation. we will promote 
a culture where everyone can bring their true 
selves. 
 
we believe that this [sustainable innovation] 
will both help create sustainable solutions for 
our clients and increase meaning in work for 
our employees.

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  key sustainability  impact drivers    12
we make a sustained effort to be able to 
attract and retain a highly talented, qualified, 
and diverse staff in simcorp. our managers 
play a crucial part in acting as role models for 
inclusion and creating an environment where 
diversity can thrive. therefore, all managers 
are trained in how to support inclusive behav-
iors in their teams. this training also includes 
focus on race and how to overcome taboos 
related to race. furthermore, all simcorp 
employees are offered training in how they 
can contribute to an inclusive culture and 
support colleagues from minority groups. 
within diversity, we have a special obligation 
as an it company to help increase the share 
of women especially at management levels, 
where women are underrepresented across 
the industry. to measure our achievements, 
we have set specific goals for women in 
management to be reached by the end of 
2023 (see esg report pages 14-17). 
our efforts to support un sdg 5, ‘gender 
equality’ (specifically indicator  5.5.2 | propor-
tion of women in managerial positions), are 
described in-depth in our diversity report.
in 2020, simcorp was included by goldman 
sachs in the europe womenomics basket 
(gsstwomn), which contains companies 
with a relatively high level of women at all 
levels of the organization.
creating meaning in work
meaning in work can mean and be something 
different to different people. we will strive to 
ensure that all our employees feel that they 
have a meaningful worklife. for instance, 
we will give employees opportunities to 
contribute to sustainability, hereby helping 
simcorp drive its sustainability agenda and 
also contribute to the greater good. we will 
also make it transparent how each single 
employee contributes to fulfilling simcorp’s 
overall strategy in their daily work. we believe 
that every single employee’s contribution 
to sustainability and to fulfilling simcorp’s 
strategic goals is valuable - because every-
thing counts.
sustainable innovation
going forward, we will be putting more atten- 
tion on sustainable innovation. in 2021, we 
have become part of un global compact’s 
young sdg innovators program, and we 
already include sustainability as one of the 
criteria assessed when considering new 
development ideas. we believe that this will 
both help create sustainable solutions for our 
clients and increase meaning in work for our 
employees.
monitoring meaning in work 
to keep an open dialogue and monitor 
the perception of meaning in work among 
our employees, we run biannual employee 
engagement surveys, which include questions 
related to meaning in work. latest score in 
september 2020: 72 (2019: 69).

to sustain engagement and open dialogue 
with our employees, we will implement three 
key actions points in a future where working 
remotely will be part of normal business:
•  ensure focus on virtual leadership and 
make sure that employees feel a sense 
of belonging and engagement despite 
working remotely
•  continue monthly q&a meetings where 
top management communicates key 
strategic activities and goals, and offer the 
opportunity to ask questions
•  making feedback an integrated part of 
how we collaborate across simcorp, from 
manager to employee and back.

simcorp sustainability report 2020  |  a resilient organization    13
a resilient organization
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for individuals, 
businesses, and society. a crisis-prepared organization put simcorp in a strong 
position to adapt and innovate, keeping all of us safe, while building resilience for 
the challenges and opportunities beyond the pandemic.
people and technology
at simcorp, our people are the foundation for 
everything we do, and ensuring their safety 
is our main obligation. while technology is 
key to our business as a software company, 
it is also key to ensure the well-being of our 
employees and to help us keep creating value 
for our clients.
through the covid-19 crisis, simcorp teams 
have showed amazing adaptability to working 
virtually with each other and our clients 
across borders to ensure business continuity 
and ongoing value creation for our clients. no 
doubt, a great technical setup and relentless 
commitment, high skills, and creative thinking 
by all our employees have made virtual collab-
oration a success at simcorp. looking ahead, 
we will continue to make large investments in 
digitalization and technology, which will also 
be crucial in a post-covid-19 environment, in 
order to keep ensuring the well-being of our 
employees and to better serve our clients.
ensuring well-being in a virtual 
working environment
while working from home can be technically 
possible and sometimes improve work-life 
balance due to less travelling and commuting, 
it presents other challenges to mental health 
and well-being.
our daily routines have been disrupted and 
uncertainty can lead to anxiety and stress. 
isolation, too little exercise, and a bad physical 
working environment can be other downsides 
of working from home.
at simcorp, we have taken a number of 
measures to mitigate the physical and mental 
risks of going to work or working from home. 
social distancing and frequent cleaning 
have been put in place to safeguard those 
who have come to the office, where this has 
been possible. employees have been able to 
participate in online meditation, yoga, and 
pilates sessions guided by a professional 
instructor. we have also established a number 
of online discussion forums, where employees 
can share ideas for improving the working 
from home situation and keeping up the spirit.
furthermore, we offer ergonomic home work 
stations.
the 4cs 
our employees share four key behavioral 
traits that have been and will continue to be 
instrumental in keeping us all well through 
challenging times, while also making sure that 
we do our outmost to support our clients: 
• curiosity
• courage
• collaboration
• capability
combined, these traits fuel our passion for our 
clients and the positive and lasting change we 
want to make in the world.

environmental data
a stable climate is a critical factor in the 
growth and advancement of human societies.
failure to mitigate climate change caused by 
the build-up of greenhouse gases presents an 
existential threat to human civilization. 
simcorp’s carbon footprint is related to elec-
tricity and heating consumption (scope 1 and 
2) and travel (scope 3). we are committed to 
tracking and reducing our negative impact.
co2 emission scope 1 and 2 
our co2 emission related to electricity and 
heating consumption has been calculated 
based on the carbon calculator formula.
for hq, electricity consumption data has 
been submitted by the provider Ørsted/
radius and heating consumption data by the 
provider hofor. the remaining data has been 
provided by our landlord. for our subsid-
iaries, data has been provided by the office 
managers based on provider input. input for 
the co2 emission calculation is based on the 
consumption of electricity and heating and 
the use of leased company cars. 
co2 emission scope 3 
our co2 emission based on travel activity has 
been calculated by our travel agency egencia 
and is almost entirely based on air travel.

social data
we are living in a connected world in which
society is increasingly committed to the 
values of responsible business, sustainable 
economic development, and long-term 
value creation. organizations like simcorp 
are expected to embrace human rights, by 
fostering diverse, inclusive workplaces, by 
ensuring well-being and safety for its employ-
ees, and by offering all those with a stake in 
the firm’s value creation the opportunity to 
thrive and grow.
people are crucial for every organization 
and their growth – in knowledge, prosperity 
and well-being – and central to the success 
of all organizations and societies. we are 
committed to ensuring that all our employees 
can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality 
and in a healthy environment.
we are also committed to measure and 
disclose information on how we continue 
to ensure an engaged, skilled, thriving, and 
healthy workforce across our business. 
due to covid-19, we have had to cancel a 
limited number of training programs for our 
employees in 2020, which explains the slight 
decrease in the overall training activity (see 
table to the right), but fortunately, we have 
been able to transform most training into a 
virtual setting.
