ceo, maersk drilling
captured and stored. the transformation is 
monumental and will take time.
oil and gas are needed to continue to grow and 
develop global wealth and living conditions. 
hydrocarbons constitute an essential ingredient 
for many indispensable products such as building 
materials, packaging, pharmaceuticals, and 
they are instrumental in securing affordable 
energy, not least in developing countries. even as 
renewable energy options gain traction, oil and 
gas will be a vital part of the energy mix for many 
years to come. maersk drilling is ready to help 
meet this challenge while actively supporting the 
energy transition by reducing co2 emissions.
maersk drilling plays an active role in the energy 
transition in several ways. we strive to design and 
operate energy and emission efficient offshore 
drilling solutions to locate and extract the 
hydrocarbons that society still needs. we work 
closely together with our trusted partners to 
develop safe ways to store co2 below the seabed 
in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. responsible 
drilling can reduce emissions by millions of 
tonnes of co2 every year, and there is enormous 
potential in carbon capture and storage (ccs). in 
the international energy agency’s sustainable 
development scenario, ccs will play a key role in 
the global efforts to reach the ambition of the 
paris agreement.
with our commitment to reduce the carbon 
intensity of our operations by 50% by 2030, 
maersk drilling is taking a leading sustainability 
position in the drilling industry. i am proud 
that maersk drilling is piloting this important 
development, and i look forward to helping our 
customers meet their climate ambitions.
achieving the climate target will require strong 
partnerships with customers, suppliers and the 
countries where we operate. as a global operator, 
we are dependent on governments’ willingness to 
the sustainability challenges we see today are 
transforming communities, industries and daily 
lives across the world, and climate change is a 
topic that has rightfully risen to the top of the 
agenda. for companies in the oil and gas industry, 
it begs the question: how can we do our part?
maersk drilling is defined by our heritage and our 
values. we act with integrity, and every decision 
is underpinned by high ethical standards – this 
is part of our dna. we are proud of our ambition 
to lead the way towards a more sustainable 
future for people and the planet guided by our 
commitment to the un global compact principles 
and the un sustainable development goals (sdgs).
in 2020 maersk drilling developed and launched 
a new, ambitious sustainability strategy based on 
three pillars: sustainable energy future, caring for 
people, and responsible business. climate action 
is at the centre of our efforts. the global fight 
to address climate change has accelerated plans 
and actions from all parts of society. industries, 
governments, research institutions and citizens 
like you and me are all coming together to fight 
climate change. this challenge is unlike any other 
the world has seen, and we need more than one 
solution to the problem: consumption patterns 
must be changed, renewable energy supplies must 
be ramped up, low-carbon products marketed, 
production processes decarbonised, and co2 
establish economic frameworks that support the 
substantial investments needed. and even more 
importantly, we need the curiosity and courage 
of our people to challenge traditional ways of 
thinking and develop new innovative solutions. 
with the investment we have made in recent years 
in building up a strong innovation capacity, we are 
well-positioned to create new climate businesses 
drawing on our offshore expertise and ability to 
run large technical operations.
to drive change, we want a working environment 
based on openness, respect and diversity of 
thought – a culture where all employees have equal 
opportunities to develop and thrive, regardless 
of gender, nationality, or religious beliefs. this is 
why we have set to increase diversity, starting with 
tackling gender imbalance.
in maersk drilling, we have what it takes to 
challenge the status quo. for decades, we have 
worked hard to make safety a cornerstone in 
our culture. with a strong focus on the human 
factor in our safety as capacity strategy, we have 
significantly improved our performance in recent 
years. i am proud and deeply grateful that serious 
incidents causing permanent physical damage to 
people have been entirely absent in 2020.
when addressing a year so heavily marked by the 
covid-19 pandemic and its trail of human and 
economic costs, it is easy to zoom in on the 
challenges that we all face. still, i sincerely believe 
that we also sowed the seeds for a new beginning 
in 2020. maersk drilling has indeed embarked on a 
journey which points towards a more sustainable 
future for our industry.

as part of the oil and gas value chain, maersk 
drilling seeks to do business in a responsible and 
sustainable manner, acting with integrity and high 
standards of business ethics. 
in 2020, we reassessed the main priorities for our 
future sustainability work. based on a stakeholder 
analysis and materiality assessment, the project 
identified nine un sustainable development goals 
(sdgs) where the maersk drilling business has, or 
could have, major impact. it also assessed which 
of the sustainability topic areas were already well 
addressed and which required a dedicated focus to 
close gaps or address opportunities. 
the outcome of this strategic work is structured in 
our sustainability framework, showing our efforts 
spanning three strategic pillars. these pillars 
address relevant sdgs and reflect our company’s 
strategic sustainability initiatives. in particular, 
improvement opportunities were identified 
within climate action and diversity & inclusion, 
and specific targets and action plans have been 
launched for these topic areas.

launching a  
 
new sustainability 
strategy 
in 2020 maersk drilling established a new sustainability 
strategy based on three strategic pillars: sustainable energy 
future, caring for people and responsible business.
“though sustainability isn’t new to 
maersk drilling, the challenges we 
see today are different in nature, 
and climate action is rightfully a top 
priority for communities and industries 
all over the world. i am deeply proud 
of our company’s new sustainability 
strategy – not least our industry-
leading ambition to reduce emissions 
and increase equality.”

oil’s contribution is forecasted to fall from 31% in 
2019 to 23% by 2040.  
society’s continued reliance on hydrocarbons is a 
natural consequence of more than a hundred years 
of economic and social development based on fossil 
fuels. affordable energy is fundamental for today’s 
welfare and development and is a prerequisite for 
essential functions such as education, trade, food 
production and much more. today, scalable and 
economically viable substitutes are not available for 
aviation, maritime transportation, heavy industries 
and petrochemicals, and development and 
deployment of new technologies to replace oil  
and gas will take time.
maersk drilling has the opportunity to contribute 
to a sustainable energy future and is doing so in 
several ways.
oil and natural gas will continue to be major 
contributors to global energy consumption for 
many years to come. in its most recently published 
world energy outlook 2020, the international energy 
agency updated its sustainable development 
scenario. this scenario outlines a transformation 
of the global energy model, in alignment with the 
ambition of the paris agreement and meeting 
climate-related sdgs. based on this scenario, oil 
and gas will still account for 46% of the world’s 
energy demand in 2040. natural gas will satisfy 
roughly 23% equal to its contribution in 2019 while 
decarbonising  
drilling activities
oil and gas constitute one of the largest supply 
chains in the global economy. according to the iea, 
the energy needed to extract, process and distribute 
the oil and natural gas required by society, currently 
accounts for around 15% of global energy-related 
co2 emissions. drilling activities fall under the 
extraction of oil and gas. this means that there is 
significant potential in decarbonising these activities. 
in 2020, maersk drilling launched an ambitious 
plan to cut the carbon intensity of our operations 
by 50% by 2030. with this target – the most 
ambitious in the industry – maersk drilling aims 
to inspire and accelerate the offshore drilling 
industry’s decarbonisation journey. the target 
is more ambitious than the savings needed to 
fulfil the requirements for the industry in the iea 
sustainable development scenario 1. this scenario 
is built on a reduction of approximately 40% from 
the oil and gas sector by 2030 in order to be in line 
with the paris agreement. 
to reach its target, in a way which is both 
sustainable and financially viable, maersk drilling 
will use a combination of known technological 
solutions, behavioural and digital solutions for 
efficiency improvements, as well as emerging 
technologies which are still at an early stage. in 
addition, carbon offsets may be used to achieve 
any residual savings. over the past three years, 
maersk drilling has invested heavily in establishing 
an innovation department with process and 
technology experts, and this unique function, 
along with our engineers, will play a key role in 
developing and adapting future climate-conscious 
technologies to offshore drilling needs. 
concrete steps 
 
 
towards a  
 
low-carbon world
climate change is one of the most significant challenges 
facing global society today. as a company operating in the 
oil and gas industry, maersk drilling can play an important 
role to help shape a sustainable energy future.
“we have set the 
drilling industry’s most 
ambitious climate target. 
halving our carbon 
intensity footprint in 
ten years will be a huge 
challenge, and we will 
deploy all our skills  
and expertise to make  
it happen.”
libbe skovgaard-petersen head of business 
development and partnerships
1  upon the creation of maersk drilling’s 2030 climate plan, the establishment of science-based targets for the oil and gas industry was still under development.  
once finalised, these targets will be reviewed by maersk drilling and any relevant adjustments will be incorporated in the future sustainability strategy work.

maersk drillings’ 
main activities
maersk drilling’s approach to partnering activities 
with customers and suppliers will be instrumental 
in realising our climate ambitions. in addition, the 
right economic framework conditions are crucial. 
today, our activities on the norwegian continental 
shelf (which accounted for 39% of maersk 
drilling’s revenue in 2020) are leading climate 
developments in the industry, facilitated by a 
supportive economic framework which incentivises 
investments in low-emission technologies and 
taxes carbon-heavy solutions. our solutions 
include the world’s first electrified offshore 
drilling rig able to use shore power from land and 
low-emission hybrid rigs equipped with battery 
systems and nox filters. maersk drilling supports 
a broader application of climate-related taxation 
and support regimes, incentivising our customers 
to contract low-emission rigs, thereby allowing the 
drilling companies to make the necessary long-
term investments in new climate technologies.
where do our emissions come from?
maersk drilling reports ghg emissions according to the greenhouse 
gas protocol which classifies emissions into scope 1, 2, 3 emissions. 
scope 1 includes emissions from sources directly owned or 
controlled by the company. scope 2 accounts for ghg emissions 
from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the 
company. scope 3 is an optional reporting category that allows for 
the treatment of all other indirect emissions. scope 3 emissions 
are a consequence of the company’s activities, but occur from 
sources not owned or controlled by the company. maersk drilling 
reports scope 1 and 2 emissions, but not yet scope 3 emissions.
maersk drilling’s scope 1 emissions come from the main engines, 
which deliver power to the rigs while operating and while at 
quayside. for floating units – the drillships and the semi-subs  
– the main engines also provide power for station keeping and 
moving the rig to new locations.
scope 2 emissions are derived from our rig maersk invincible 
when operating in a location which is electrified. when the 
harbour is capable of delivering enough power, our rigs may also 
run on electricity during stacking. furthermore, our local offices 
and the danish headquarters use electricity and thereby generate 
scope 2 emissions.
exact figures on our scope 1 and 2 emissions can be found in our 
esg data-table on page 42. 
maersk drilling’s scope 3 emissions have not been comprehensively 
analysed yet, but would include elements such as business travel, 
re-location of our non-floating rigs, supply services, etc.
connecting to low-carbon  
power sources
the sharp market decline in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic 
sent several maersk drilling rigs into stacking mode. designed with 
an onboard shore power connection, the rigs are outfitted to be 
electrically powered. denmark is one of the few places in the world 
that offers sites that can deliver the required amount of electric 
power quayside. our rigs stacked in the ports of grenaa and 
frederikshavn worked on shore power, with diesel engines shut 
down, for the benefit of both the local and global environment.

new solutions
target to reach in 2030
as part of the new sustainability strategy 
launched in 2020, maersk drilling established 
a climate action plan comprising the drilling 
industry’s most ambitious emissions reduction 
target. by 2030, maersk drilling will have reduced 
its relative scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions by 50% 
compared to 2019, which is the baseline year. we 
are actively staying abreast of developments and 
technological advancements to ensure that our 
target can be met as effectively as possible. the 
target will be measured on ghg emissions relative 
to revenue, contracted days and drilled meters.
at the onset of the strategy implementation, 
maersk drilling expects that around half of 
the needed savings can be achieved via known 
solutions. the other half will be achieved 
by deploying new technologies or existing 
technologies that are not yet commercially viable.  
carbon offsets, e.g. via investments in carbon-
saving projects, may be applied to achieve any 
residual savings.

 preventing co2 from  
entering the atmosphere
in addition to decarbonising drilling activities, 
it will be important to apply carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (ccus) and hereby prevent 
co2 from entering the atmosphere.
the iea sustainable development scenario 
expects increased investment and rapid growth in 
ccus. the annual capacity is expected to increase 
from 33 million tonnes co2 per year today to  
850 million tonnes co2 in 2030 and 5,000 million 
tonnes co2 in 2050. for comparison, total global 
co2 emissions were around 30,000 million tonnes 
in 2020.
during 2020, maersk drilling joined ineos oil & 
gas denmark and wintershall dea in the project 
greensand consortium, which is maturing one of 
the most advanced carbon capture and storage 
(ccs) projects inside danish jurisdiction. project 
greensand targets the development of co2 storage 
capacity beneath the danish north sea by re-using 
discontinued oil and gas fields for permanent  
co2 storage. 
the project has received support from the  
energy technology development and demonstration 
program (eudp) via the danish energy agency 
and entered the validation phase in 2020, 
including successful feasibility studies for the 
chosen reservoir’s compatibility for co2 injection. 
laboratory experiments and results analysis were 
conducted by the project’s research partner, the 
geological survey of denmark and greenland 
(geus), and the external verifier dnv gl has issued 
a certificate of feasibility for the reservoir. 
the target is to have the first well ready for 
injection from the nini platform offshore denmark 
in 2025. longer-term, the goal is to develop the 
capacity to store approximately 3.5 million tonnes 
co2 per year by 2030. ccs is one of the four pillars 
of the green research strategy announced by the 
danish government in september 2020.
storage in depleted offshore reservoirs is a 
relatively new concept and involves challenges, 
particularly in terms of ensuring cost- and 
carbon-efficient transportation of the co2 from 
shore to the injection site. however, employing 
ccs in offshore reservoirs also has significant 
advantages since the geological structures are 
well understood, existing infrastructure can be 
utilised, and the injection sites are situated far 
away from populated areas.
supporting other carbon-negative technologies
in 2020, maersk drilling began cooperation with the california-based company clean energy 
systems to facilitate carbon-neutral drilling. the technology is based on using biomass waste as 
fuel to produce syngas, from which renewable natural gas and hydrogen are separated for sale. 
the net-negative carbon emissions are sold as credits, and maersk drilling will eventually be 
able to offer these as part of a carbon-neutral drilling proposal to customers.

2020 climate performance
efforts to introduce low-carbon solutions on 
the fleet continued in 2020 with activities in our 
main market, norway, leading the way. two of our 
biggest jack-up rigs, maersk intrepid and maersk 
integrator, are converted to low-emission rigs by 
installing energy efficiency software, hybrid power, 
and nox scrubbers. the first, fully upgraded rig 
went into operation in autumn in norwegian waters 
and data loggers tracked the carbon efficiency 
gains at around 25%. 
our total greenhouse gas emissions were impacted 
by the covid-19 pandemic. customers cancelled 
or postponed projects, resulting in a sharp decline 
in demand for drilling services and an increased 
number of stacked rigs. as a result, on-contract 
ghg emissions declined while off-contract ghg 
emissions increased significantly. total ghg 
emissions in 2020 were 399,200 tonnes of co2e 
compared to 442,000 tonnes in 2019. 
as part of our newly launched climate action plan, 
we have identified three kpis to measure our efforts 
towards halving the carbon intensity by 2030:
ghg emissions per contracted day improved for 
both of our rig classes respectively, with jack-ups 
lowering emissions from 37.7 to 35.4 tonnes per 
contracted day and floaters reducing emissions 
from 104.1 to 100.7 tonnes per contracted day. 
despite these improvements, the overall ghg 
emissions per contracted day grew from 57.8 to 
61.3 tonnes, impacted by a lower share of the 
more carbon-efficient jack-ups. the number of 
contracted days for jack-ups declined by 27% while 
floaters increased by 7% compared to 2019.  
this higher average fleet emission level per 
contracted day also impacted ghg emissions per 
drilled meter which increased by 18%. the number 
of meters drilled in 2019 was unusually high 
with 2020 returning to a more normal level. the 
drilled meters vary from campaign to campaign 
depending on the nature of the services performed 
with well-completion and plug and abandonment 
activities generating fewer drilled meters.
ghg emissions per revenue ended at 364.2 tonnes 
of co2e per usd million which was a 0.7% increase 
compared to 2019. a decline in revenue generating 
days due to the high number of stacked rigs in 
combination with the higher average emissions 
of the fleet were the main factors driving this 
development.
though the trends across the three selected kpis 
was not showing strong progress in 2020, the 
developments should to a large extent be viewed 
in the light of the extraordinary market situation 
following the covid-19 pandemic. we expect a 
reversal of these effects and in combination with 
our continued long-term actions and investments 
in low-emission solutions, we are confident we can 
achieve our 2030 target, even if the reductions are 
modest in the first part of the 10-year period.

driving impact  
through transparency
maersk drilling has established 
three kpis to track the carbon 
footprint of our activities 
comprehensively. we believe 
that enhanced transparency will 
drive the right behaviours in our 
organisation, and hopefully also 
inspire the entire drilling industry 
to establish comparable metrics. 
the three kpis are:
 focus on operations, 
measuring the  
emissions from our rigs 
per contracted day
 emissions from contracted 
rigs per drilled meter, 
focusing on our main 
deliverable of drilling wells
overall carbon intensity 
of our business, tracked 
through measurement  
of total emissions  
per revenue
strengthening our  
climate-related disclosure 
in 2020, maersk drilling decided 
to strengthen its climate-related 
disclosure by reporting according 
to tcfd and by submitting data to 
the carbon disclosure project.

safety as capacity – understanding  
the human factor in incidents
the health and safety approach of maersk 
drilling is founded on the belief that human 
errors are unavoidable. understanding the human 
dimension and properly integrating it into the 
systems, processes and policies will be key to the 
continuous improvement of our performance. 
human factors are the physical, psychological 
and social characteristics that affect human 
interactions with equipment, systems, processes 
and other individuals. strengthening our people 
capacity to avoid incidents or prevent incidents 
from escalating as well as managing controls 
and safeguards are at the core of our efforts to 
account for the human factor in any incident.
in 2020, we focused on three key initiatives to 
strengthen our people’s ability to maintain a high 
safety level:
our goal has for several years been to achieve 
zero serious incidents and we have met this goal 
since april 2019. to further strengthen our efforts, 
a new goal was introduced in 2020, targeting 
a continuous downward trend in the average 
severity of all incidents.
in 2020, we registered a positive development 
in our performance with safety figures showing 
the best results in years. the positive trend 
came despite the many obstacles induced by the 
covid-19 pandemic which made rig operations 
exceptionally difficult. still, due to relentless 
efforts from our offshore crews, we successfully 
met this challenge. we see it as a general indication 
that our new safety as capacity strategy – which 
is exploring new roads within safety – makes a 
difference. we are doing our utmost to share our 
findings with the rest of the industry because 
keeping people safe is everyone’s business.
1. 
simple to  
be safe
our simple to be safe initiative 
aims at making our systems less 
complex and time-consuming. 
in 2020, we completed a review 
of our management system 
to simplify and reduce the 
amount of content. the new 
user-friendly, digital platform 
control of work was rolled out 
to all rigs. it secures a robust 
work execution process with 
a focus on control, clarity 
and capability, and reduces 
bureaucracy to allow for more 
time to work with safety. in 
2020, the reduced time per task 
was about 30% or more than 
15,000 working hours.
2. 
situational  
awareness
a key element in safety as 
capacity is to avoid incidents 
escalating from minor issues 
to a chain reaction of bigger 
problems. the ability to 
rapidly and decisively handle 
unexpected events and spot 
unusual developments during 
operations is vital. our zone 
in on safety campaign was 
rolled out to all rigs with tools 
dedicated to train and maintain 
situational awareness. we 
improved the well-established 
toolbox talks where leaders 
and crew members meet to 
discuss what can go wrong. in 
this way, we increase situational 
awareness of risks and 
strengthen the feedback from 
the crews on what is required.  
 
a safer place 
to work
we registered the best safety performance in years, 
despite the many obstacles from the covid-19 
pandemic. our safety as capacity strategy explores 
new ways and makes a difference.
3. 
building a strong  
safety culture
our yearly safety day centered 
around building a strong safety 
culture. in line with the general 
focus of capturing frontline 
experience, all rig teams were 
engaged in providing solutions 
and ideas for increased safety. 
this bottom-up approach 
goes hand-in-hand with the 
quarterly ‘out of harm’s way’ 
awards which go to the best 
safety ideas. 62 ideas were 
received and approved from 
the frontline. the best ideas 
are subsequently pushed to all 
our rigs.

improving our core  
barrier management system
maersk drilling’s safety efforts are anchored in a 
strong barrier management system which is the 
foundation for delivering reliable and efficient 
operations to our customers. 
in 2019 an updated barrier management strategy 
was implemented on all rigs, focusing on 
identifying all safety-critical technical barriers, 
operational barriers, and organisational barriers.
to continuously drive improvement of the 
barrier management system, all major incidents 
or near-misses are thoroughly investigated. in 
2020, we continued the work to improve our 
investigation model with a particular focus on our 
high-potential incidents, with increased efforts 
devoted to capturing learnings from near-misses 
which never turned into real incidents. we also 
widened the scope of our investigations to include 
more than just accidents and near misses, but 
also successful, day to day work. this is to enable 
operational learning.
personal injuries and potential risk weight
in 2020, we launched a new indicator which captures not only actual injuries (coloured data bars) but also incidents that could have caused severe harm. 
this potential risk weight, shown as a blue trend line below, is based on evaluation and has shown a downward trend during 2020.

2020 performance
in 2020, we improved safety performance with 
all indicators showing a decline in incidents. the 
improvement was especially noticeable for the 
more serious incidents which are our main focus 
area. we had zero serious injuries and only two lost 
time injuries, corresponding to a lost time injury 
frequency of 0.44. this is a significant improvement 
compared to 0.75 in 2019, representing the lowest 
levels recorded in years. 
in 2020, we further developed our metrics and 
have launched a new severity grading index that 
incorporate the high potential incidents which 
could have turned into serious incidents. with this 
index as part of our safety scorecard, we have put 
additional focus on bringing down the serious 
near-misses which could have caused significant 
harm to our people.
the severity index declined during 2020, reflecting 
a lower level of near misses, especially in the 
second half of the year. we see this as an indicator 
that our new safety as capacity strategy is effective 
and will support us in continuing this trend.
keeping global operations 
afloat during the pandemic
as the global pandemic hit the world in the 
first quarter of the year, maersk drilling faced 
considerable challenges. with operations spanning 
most continents and a vivid exchange of personnel 
across frontiers, it quickly became necessary 
to establish a focused task force to handle the 
challenges. as protocols and procedures were 
developed during spring, the task force could be 
dismantled.
some of the most critical issues centered around 
offshore operations. it is a top priority to uphold 
the rigorous process for personnel coming 
on board rigs. all crew, customers, third-party 
partners and maintenance personnel must 
complete a covid-19 test, a pre-departure travel 
questionnaire and, when required by the client or 
local authority, take part in a two-week quarantine. 
all non-essential personnel continue to be 
prohibited from visiting rigs globally.
in order to further ensure a healthy working 
environment on board, maersk drilling rigs now 
have rapid covid-19 test kits on board all rigs. even 
if the test is only indicative, the crew now has the 
ability to test anyone that displays symptoms and 
can take further action when necessary. this is 
especially important for rigs in remote locations 
where access to testing is not always readily 
available.
in addition, mitigating travel restrictions and 
quarantine measures have become key to 
safeguarding everyday operations. a framework 
for back-up crew pools has become standard 
practice for operations. this includes sourcing of 
more local crew members within a given country 
or region in order to effectively conduct crew 
changes.

diversity 
 
and inclusion
our diversity & inclusion plan
in 2020 maersk drilling developed a dedicated d&i 
plan with targets and initiatives to make significant 
progress within a time-frame of three years. 
we believe in the value of diverse role models at 
the top, and are therefore tackling the industry-
specific challenge of gender diversity in leadership.  
we are pursuing a significant leap forward on 
gender diversity to increase female representation 
on all onshore leadership levels through a female 
leadership target of 30% across leadership levels, 
25% for senior leaders, and 20% for the executive 
leadership team by end-year 2023.
we want to uphold a supportive and productive 
working environment where all of our people 
are valued for their contributions, accepted for 
who they are, and can develop a meaningful 
career in a trusted environment that is free from 
discrimination – regardless of gender, nationality, 
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic 
background, or disability.
in an industry facing transformation, it is imperative 
to attract, develop, and retain the best talent 
effectively. maersk drilling is actively focusing on 
tapping into a broader, diverse talent pool to meet 
challenges and generate sustainable value.
maersk drilling is first and foremost a people business. 
therefore we have identified diversity & inclusion 
as one of two key focus areas of our sustainability 
strategy alongside climate action. 
“the world of energy is changing, and 
a successful transformation of our 
business requires that we mobilise 
multiple perspectives and skills. 
diversity is ultimately about equality 
for all: providing equal access to 
thriving, dreaming and contributing. 
as a company with strong values 
and operations globally, we have the 
obligation and privilege to make an 
impact. our business and the world 
depend on us.”

female representation in leadership
continued improvements needed  
in 2020, maersk drilling saw a slight improvement 
in diversity performance and with the new strategic 
focus, these developments will be accelerated. our 
share of female employees increased from 13% in 
2019 to 14% in 2020. onshore, women represent 
40% of our workforce. female leaders made up 
25% of our onshore leadership in 2020 compared 
to 23% in 2019. offshore, women only make up 2% 
of the workforce. in 2020, we appointed our second 
female rig manager in the history of the company.
additionally, in 2020 we have focused on pairing 
female talents with senior leadership sponsors 
to provide greater exposure to the organisation, 
facilitate network building and enable cross-
functional development opportunities. regarding 
the executive leadership team, it was announced 
in december that a new female cfo would start in 
january 2021, bringing the female representation 
to 25%.
our initial targets focus on female representation 
in leadership, as we expect this to produce cascade 
effects across all diversity parameters. at the 
same time, we are focusing on inclusion in the 
company to truly make diversity thrive.
in addition to the new leadership target, maersk 
drilling will be targeting four focus areas:
•  attracting and hiring female talent by 
removing bias from our recruitment process
•  promoting impactful leadership careers 
through a more inclusive approach to talent 
identification and development  
•  transitioning to greater flexibility in ways of 
working and making inclusive leadership part  
of our leadership development programs
•  showing senior leadership commitment and 
increasing awareness across the company
to further strengthen implementation, chief 
strategy and people officer nikolaj svane 
additionally took on the role of chief diversity 
officer in september 2020.
board diversity target
maersk drilling has an ambition of diverse 
representation in terms of gender, nationality, 
international experience and qualifications on 
the board of directors. in 2019, a board diversity 
target to elect two female board members no 
later than the annual general meeting in 2022, 
was set. in 2020, maersk drilling has directed 
attention towards reaching this and did so already 
in april 2020. additionally, maersk drilling’s target 
to have at least 1/3 of the board of directors 
comprise non-danish citizens is currently satisfied. 
the current composition of the board, including 
employee-elected members is four females and 
five males, as well as four non-danish citizens 
represented.
“given the nature of our industry, 
gender diversity in particular is 
difficult. i am proud that maersk 
drilling is stepping up to this 
challenge and is ready to fight 
for more equality and diversity 
by committing to a female 
leadership target.”

conversations  
for inclusion
our approach to making strides 
within d&i is to foster a safe 
culture where important 
conversations and the personal 
experiences of our employees can 
be shared and are heard.
in the first half of 2020, maersk 
drilling developed its d&i plan 
utilising a data-driven approach 
grounded in our employees’ 
experiences and perceptions. both 
qualitative and quantitative research 
was conducted internally to gain 
an understanding of how bias, 
differential treatment, and barriers 
to equal opportunities and inclusion 
are experienced in the company.
based on the voices of our people, 
intervention areas specifically 
tailored to barriers in the 
organisation have been designed.
we are committed to continuing 
the focus and conversation on d&i.
watch our conversations for 
inclusion video here.
committed to co-creating d&i solutions
partnering with other businesses to drive forward sustainability efforts 
is grounded in our corporate value of humbleness to listen to, learn from 
and share with others. we are pleased to have joined the above & beyond 
diversity council this year which comprises a strategic alliance of 20+ nordic 
companies collaborating on the acceleration of diversity and inclusion, with 
dedicated engagement from top management.
“i really appreciate that the

to maersk drilling, using 
real experiences from our 
colleagues. personally, being 
able to take part in confidential 
conversations where nothing 
is left off the table, has made

population moving from -15 to 3 and offshore 
increasing from -29 to -8. a large number of 
factors have contributed to these improvements, 
with the most frequently mentioned being: 
•  continuous communication – open discussions 
led by senior leadership about the future of 
maersk drilling.
•  strengthened sustainability strategy – 
providing long term strategic aspirations within 
d&i and climate change in uncertain times. 
•  improved team leadership – with a focus on 
employee wellbeing and increased flexible 
working.
•  solid response to covid-19 – the swift 
implementation of new social distancing and 
safety interventions both on our rigs and onshore, 
protecting the health of our employees. 
maersk drilling is focused on ensuring that senior 
leaders are updated regularly on key topics 
such as employee engagement, organisational 
effectiveness, diversity & inclusion and capability 
development.
in 2020, there has been uncertainty in many areas 
of our business due to covid-19 and it has been 
a constant challenge to secure a stimulating 
work environment that supports employee 
development.  
dialogue and employee engagement 
maersk drilling’s quarterly compass survey allows 
us to regularly track employee engagement levels 
and implement the necessary actions to maintain 
a positive employee experience. a new approach to 
engagement surveys was launched in 2018, and this 
lighter and more frequent survey model has helped 
drive better dialogue between managers and staff.
the compass system generates an employee net 
promoter score (enps). the enps ranges from -100 
maersk drilling is a people business. attracting and 
retaining competent and engaged people who are 
committed to maersk drilling’s successful future 
remains a top priority and a vital leadership task.

training
maersk drilling offers an array of training for our 
offshore and onshore employees via our learning 
management system and we apply personal 
development plans to detail the individual goals 
of our employees. our training covers a range of 
capabilities, from operational excellence and task-
oriented issues to leadership, culture and mindset 
development.
in 2020, a total of 6,481 training days were carried 
out across maersk drilling compared to 8,571 in 
2019. the lower number reflects the impact of the 
covid-19 pandemic. 
leadership and development
to develop transformational leadership skills, 
we created the leading in md programme which 
commenced for all leaders in the last quarter 
of 2019. the programme focuses on our 4cs 
leadership framework promoting curiosity, 
courage, collaboration and conversation. due 
to covid-19 restrictions, the programme had to 
be paused. nevertheless, 159 leaders have been 
through the programme so far with a further 270 
(95 onshore and 175 offshore) pending. 
to address a continued need for social distancing, 
maersk drilling has during 2020 developed virtual 
leadership development sessions, including both 
refresher modules for those who have completed 
the programme and onboarding modules for new 
participants.

handling redundancies  
in a responsible way
maersk drilling is used to operating in an industry 
which is cyclical by nature. the covid-19 disruption 
caused several customers to cancel operational 
contracts and postpone future contracts. as a 
consequence, it was necessary to reduce the 
number of employees. prior to the decision, 
multiple options were explored, including re-
deployment, early retirement and a hiring freeze 
but these measures were deemed insufficient 
given the scale of the crisis.
market disruptions and the resulting restructuring 
processes encompass significant negative 
consequences. maersk drilling has made 
considerable efforts to handle the processes 
responsibly and tailor compensation packages 
accordingly. the packages were the result of 
negotiations with employee representatives. due 
to the geographical spread of our employees, 
redundancy packages varied according to their 
country of employment. 
onshore and offshore redundancy processes are 
governed by legal processes and all impacted 
employees were provided notice according to their 
statutory entitlements. employees were consulted 
via an employee council and notifications to 
authorities were given according to the specific 
legal procedures. 
our acceleration programme, which invests in 
talent to secure a strong pipeline of employees 
with leadership capabilities for mid and senior 
level roles, was postponed due to logistical issues 
caused by covid-19. an alternative solution, which 
incorporates the key aspects of the original 
programme, e.g. on-the-job challenges and 
leadership development tasks, has been developed 
for rollout in 2021.
 
training to ensure operational excellence 
we follow industry, regulatory and client 
requirements to ensure employees in our offshore 
operations are fully trained and compliant. for 
compliance areas, our offshore employees are all 
trained. in addition we also have maersk drilling 
specific procedure requirements, where each rig 
has approx. 90 different qualifications mapped to 
multiple positions. 
to further support that all rigs can safely handle 
all requirements when changing crew, a new 
competency assessment system (cas) was fully 
implemented during 2020. the system ensures 
that key competencies provided during training 
courses and procedure requirements are validated 
on board the rig. with a single, unified digital 
system, we maintain the same high safety and 
efficiency standards across jurisdictions.

the percentage of local workforce, and sourcing from 
local suppliers. maersk drilling aims to go beyond 
specified targets where feasible and build on long-
term collaborations with customers and suppliers 
who value local contributions.
maersk drilling has a long-standing tradition of 
contributing to local societies, not least in developing 
countries. this has traditionally been done by building 
local competences and local procurement practices. 
local content requirements can for instance include 
building local skills 
local offshore competencies are vital to secure 
efficient and reliable operations in emerging oil 
and gas markets, such as parts of latin america, 
africa and south east asia. the presence of local 
colleagues with the necessary skills is crucial 
for maersk drilling to deliver safe and efficient 
services to our customers. we see local content 
as a central element securing our ability to 
operate at the highest standards and support 
this by contributing to building competencies and 
investing in the training and upskilling of the local 
workforce.
in 2020, we met or exceeded local staff 
requirements in 78% of the countries.
local procurement
maersk drilling strives to procure locally when 
possible to support the domestic economy and 
secure local supply for maersk drilling and the 
offshore sector. when we are cooperating with 
local suppliers, we also contribute to developing 
the necessary skills and know-how to meet the 
requirements of international customers in the oil 
and gas sector.  
in 2020, maersk drilling hosted local suppliers 
days in trinidad and suriname. the programme 
invited local suppliers to learn about maersk 
drilling’s responsible procurement policy and the 
standards required to work as a supplier in the oil 
and gas industry. by working with local suppliers, 
we play a part in developing emerging economies 
and, at the same time, benefit from increasing the 
range of products and services available to our 
industry in the local market.
in 2020, we reached or exceeded local procurement 
requirements in 67% of the countries.
as part of our sustainability approach and in line 
with our values, maersk drilling strives to positively 
impact the communities in which we operate. 
supplier day in  
trinidad and tobago
supplier days is an important element 
in our local contribution efforts. in 
february, maersk drilling hosted a 
supplier day in port of spain, trinidad, 
inviting potential local suppliers to 
learn more about maersk developer’s 
upcoming campaign and how maersk 
drilling works with suppliers. more 
than 100 people from more than 60 
companies signed up for the event, and 
many more wanted to join. the strong 
attendance provided maersk drilling 
with a good understanding of the local 
supplier landscape across a segment 
of different products and services, 
ranging from tool rental, workforce and 
logistics solutions to safety training and 
environmental services.

a barrier management philosophy with technical, 
operational and organisational barriers to secure 
environmentally safe operations. through these 
processes which are engrained in our management 
system, we ensure compliance with the iso 
14001:2015 environmental management standard.
rig recycling policy
maersk drilling has a tradition for ensuring that 
our rigs are handled sustainably, also when they 
reach end-of-life. while it is relatively infrequent 
that a rig leaves our fleet, we want to make sure 
that established procedures ensure responsible 
conduct both when a rig is recycled or sold for 
further use by another operator.
in february 2021, a new recycling policy was 
launched. the new policy stipulates that maersk 
drilling will follow the principles laid out in the 
hong kong convention when recycling a rig.
the main areas that we target relate to spills, 
recycling, waste handling and the safe use of 
chemicals on board our rigs. our staff functions 
work in close cooperation with our rigs to optimise 
our activities which are governed by a strong set 
of policies including our hsse policy our corporate 
major accident prevention policy as well as a 
newly launched rig recycling policy.
environmentally safe operations
maersk drilling has established provisions in 
its environmental management system that 
mitigates the risk of environmental harm. prior 
to campaign commencement, maersk drilling will 
conduct an environmental impact assessment 
(eia) which shall form part of the overall 
environmental management program. the eia 
assesses the impacts of our activities, identifies 
quantitatively the significance and describes 
mitigation and control measures. we implement 
a full version of the new policy is available on our 
website.
from 1 january 2021, all eu flagged rigs and all rigs 
operating in eu sea territory including norwegian 
waters are required to comply with the eu ship 
recycling regulations. as part of this regulation, 
the rigs are required to create and maintain an 
inventory of hazardous materials (ihm). the 
inventory is a register that provides an overview 
of the hazardous materials on board, its location 
and approximate quantity. the recycling yards use 
the register to plan for the safe and responsible 
recycling of the rig.
15 maersk drilling rigs were required to be 
compliant by the end of 2020, which has been 
achieved. an ihm for each rig has been prepared 
through investigations, onboard sampling surveys, 
lab analysis and documentation. furthermore, a 
system has been designed to create and maintain 
ihms for the rigs operating outside eu jurisdiction, 
once the recycling of a rig approaches. this will 
also be beneficial for rigs currently operating 
outside the eu, but which will move to the eu on a 
new contract. 
protecting 
 
our marine 
 
  
environment
life in the oceans represents a unique ecosystem. it is 
maersk drilling’s ambition to reduce the environmental 
impact of our operations. 
15 
maersk drilling rigs were required 
to be compliant with the eu ship 
recycling regulations by the end

chemical management
the management of our chemicals is important 
to ensure that risk towards people’s health 
and safety is reduced. it is imperative that any 
associated risk and usage is conveyed in its 
entirety to the user.
new operational chemicals undergo a product 
risk assessment before it is approved for use on 
board. use of high-risk chemicals is avoided when 
possible. alternatively, a lower risk substitute 
with the equivalent functionality is often sought. 
such instances also include the purchase of better 
biodegradable chemicals with low impact on the 
environment.
to ensure that chemicals on board are managed 
and handled safely, an onboard chemical and 
environmental inspection is carried out twice a 
year. observations made are evaluated by the 
management for appropriate follow-up actions. 
spills
environmental spills may have long-lasting 
adverse effects on both environment and the 
surrounding communities. our goal is to have zero 
spills during our operations.
at maersk drilling, we face four major spill risks:
• loss of well control
• loss of drilling fluid through formations
• spills from machinery on board the rig or subsea
•  fuel and bulk material bunkering from supply 
vessel to rig
rigorous procedures and systems are in place to 
reduce these risks. through close evaluations – via 
our incident and investigation processes – any 
lessons learned greatly improves our barrier 
management hence reducing the risk in the 
foreseeable future.
in 2020, maersk drilling recorded four spills above 
1 barrel to the environment in 2020. this is an 
unsatisfactory number and we have thoroughly 
analysed root causes and designed appropriate 
mitigation actions.
two of the cases were the product of equipment 
fatigue which caused leakage of oil-based  
drilling mud. one was due to failing crew attention 
during bunkering operations, causing a hose with 
diesel fuel to be disconnected from the supply 
vessel.
in the wake of these incidents, we have tightened 
our procedures, increased the frequency of 
equipment inspections and conducted awareness 
programs on optimal supply vessel coordination.
waste
in order to ensure sustainable drilling operations, 
waste generated on board must be effectively 
and responsibly handled. the maersk drilling 
management system incorporates procedures and 
processes to eliminate or reduce the amount of 
waste generated and enable optimal handling of 
waste. this includes:
• identifying waste streams
• handling and segregation of waste on board
• recording wastes
• minimising waste generation
• optimising recycling and disposal
the waste on board the rigs are broadly classified 
into hazardous, non-hazardous and recycled 
wastes. the main contributors to these are bore 
cuttings and chemicals used during drilling 
operations, domestic wastes like paper, plastic, 
metal cans etc. and waste generated from 
maintenance activities on board and while in 
shipyards. by having dedicated colour-coded bins 
or containers located at various locations on the 
rig, education of the crew on waste management 
and regular inspections, we ensure that wastes are 
correctly collected and segregated. 
we work towards waste minimisation through 
optimising the control and recovery of drilling 
fluid and handling of cuttings, giving careful 
consideration before purchasing of materials or 
services, proper planning of storage to name a few 
initiatives.
in 2020, our waste amounts were relatively stable at 
14,000 tonnes compared to 12,900 tonnes in 2019. 
decommissioning
maersk drilling has together with maersk supply 
service founded the joint venture maersk 
decom. the company and its activities target the 
rising need to provide efficient and sustainable 
decommissioning of oil and gas fields. its business 
model is centred around a circular economy, 
with recycling and waste management at the 
heart of operations. the company provides 
scalable solutions to responsibly handle end-
of-life installations, restore the seabed, extend 
the lifetime of materials and reduce risk in the 
process. 
in february 2020, the company signed a contract 
for plugging and abandonment of tullow oil’s 
banda and tiof fields in mauritania. this is the first 
project where maersk decom will provide an end-
to-end plugging and abandonment solution under 
one single contract. maersk decom has completed 
the first phase of the engineering and plans to 
begin the offshore p&a work in q2 2021.

new anti-fraud 
strategy
to better align maersk drilling’s fraud risk 
management, a new anti-fraud strategy was 
developed in 2020. the strategy was based on 
research conducted internally, in which insights on 
where risks for fraud in company processes and 
operations were gathered across functions. based 
on the committee of sponsoring organisations 
of the treadway commission (coso) framework, 
a course of action to solidify maersk drilling’s 
approach to effective internal control against 
fraud has been designed, including efforts 
within anti-fraud awareness, risk mitigation and 
follow-up. in alignment with the new strategy, 
an update to maersk drilling’s internal anti-fraud 
policy has also been made.
ensuring personal data protection  
amidst a global pandemic
comprehensive covid-19 testing and use of health questionnaires for our 
offshore personnel on a regular basis have been critical to controlling the 
spread of the virus and safeguarding operations in 2020. however, this massive 
collection of sensitive medical data poses risks to the protection of personal 
data if mismanaged. maersk drilling has from the beginning of the pandemic 
structured testing and data collection measures so that only third-party medical 
professionals handle health information, test results and other sensitive personal 
information. it is shared only when deemed essential to preserving our people’s 
lives and health, on a strict need-to-know basis.

responsible 
procurement
the social and environmental impact of maersk 
drilling goes beyond our own premises. working 
together with more than one thousand suppliers, 
we have an obligation to improve the entire value 
chain and influence behaviours on human rights, 
labour rights, environment, and anti-corruption. 
this is why our responsible procurement program 
has been designed to leverage our long-term 
business relationships and promote continuous 
improvement by partners in our supply chain. we 
aim to build commercial ties to suppliers with 
the lowest risk of adverse impacts on human 
rights, labour rights, the environment, and anti-
corruption.
our responsible procurement programme includes 
tools such as questionnaires, desktop supplier 
assessments, supplier audits, and corrective action 
plans. in 2020, 15 supplier assessments were carried 
out, focusing on human rights and labour conditions, 
environmental management, and health and safety. 
no major breaches were discovered, but several 
minor non-conformance issues were identified. to 
correct these, designated action plans have been 
established by the audited companies.
in 2020, our main improvement focus was to 
strengthen the responsible procurement program 
by fully integrating it digitally into our processes. 
furthermore, work has started to expand the 
supplier assessments questions into the relevant 
environmental, social and governance-related 
issues to a defined section of our supplier 
universe. this work is expected to be finalised and 
implemented in 2021.
15 
supplier assessments were

currently comprising the chairman and two 
other board members as well as members from 
management, meets at least twice a year and 
focuses on the identification, management 
and mitigation of risks and opportunities. this 
entails assessing strategies, policies, activities, 
management systems and strategic progress, as 
well as reviewing the annual sustainability report. 
in addition, a separate audit and risk committee 
has been established. the committee convenes 
at least 5 times per year to advice and make 
recommendations on risk management, 
including climate-related risks and other relevant 
sustainability risks. a key element in this work is 
our enterprise risk management system in which 
major risks are reviewed on a bi-annual basis. 
climate-related risks are tracked and categorised 
according to the recommendations of the task 
force for climate-related financial disclosure.
the executive leadership team holds the 
operational responsibility for our sustainability 
performance.  
day-to-day management of the sustainability 
efforts is anchored in the corporate department 
for communication and sustainability. the 
department is responsible for proposing strategic 
initiatives, following up on strategic progress, 
as well as reporting in accordance with the 
legal obligations. the department orchestrates

the heads of the relevant functions are 
responsible for securing execution of their part 
of the sustainability strategy and for reporting 
on risk and performance within these respective

all have vital roles in ensuring that sustainability 
standards are upheld offshore.  
policies and principles
maersk drilling’s sustainability policy is the 
overarching framework providing high-level 
guidance on how we operate.
the sustainability policy builds on the ten 
principles of the un global compact, the universal 
declaration of human rights, and the fundamental 
labour conventions of the international labour 
organization (ilo). the overall policy is further 
supported by several subject-specific policies that 
guide daily operations, such as:
• code of conduct
• third-party code of conduct
• hsse policy
• diversity and inclusion policy
• modern slavery policy
• rig recycling policy
• tax policy
performance assessment 
management of sustainability performance is 
integrated into our corporate strategy, business 
planning, risk management and decision-making 
processes. our performance scorecard assures 
an appropriate and effective link between 
strategic priorities, goals and actions. we measure 
progress and results through a combination of 
qualitative and quantitative measures, resulting in 
a corporate performance score. this performance 
score influences the collective bonus element of 
executive and staff remuneration.
in 2020, one of the six performance measures 
in the corporate scorecard was transformation, 
including the establishment of emission-based 
metrics to set targets and measure company 
performance in the area of climate action. in the 
future, carbon intensity metrics will be applied 
to link carbon reductions with remuneration. 
these new carbon metrics will, together with new 
diversity targets, complement the existing safety 
metrics which have been part of the corporate 
scorecard for several years.
the success of our management approach is 
regularly evaluated through performance reviews 
at several management levels, including the 
executive leadership team, the board of directors 
and the board committees. the nature and 
extent of performance reviews vary depending 
on materiality and management level. internal 
audits and self-assessments also constitute 
key assurance elements of our management 
approach.

decline in the severity of 
all incidents
• onshore female 
leadership target  
by 2023 (30%) 
• board diversity target 
by 2022
–
zero spills of hazardous
materials into the
environment

main 
initiatives
• establishment of 
an emissions task 
force to focus on 
decarbonisation of 
drilling activities.
• formalise a partnering 
strategy to leverage 
future green tech and 
start-up networks.
• inclusion of climate 
change and energy 
transition into our risk 
management system 
and consistency with 
the tcfd framework.
• leverage innovation 
capabilities to explore 
potential offerings that 
align with the energy 
transition.
• enhance global 
responsible 
consumption efforts.
• implementation of 
our safety as capacity 
strategy. this includes 
a focus on the simple 
to be safe project, 
increasing situational 
awareness, and building 
a strong safety culture.
• implementing our 
diversity & inclusion 
plan based on four 
focus areas.
• focus on attracting and 
retaining competent 
and engaged people.
• develop a centralised 
approach to 
contributions, to ensure 
long-lasting impact in 
local communities.
• ensure that well-control 
and spill prevention 
processes and training 
reflect industry best 
practices.
• progress to remove 
nox and sox from the 
atmosphere.
• increased focus 
on esg factors in 
supplier assessments 
and digitalisation 
of responsible 
procurement activities.
• increased focus on 
human and labour 
rights in country-entry 
risk assessments.
• increase transparency 
and formalise approach 
to responsible rig 
recycling in alignment 
with major conventions.
progress
• carbon emissions 
decreased by 10% from 
2019 to 2020. due 
to more stacked rigs 
and a relatively lower 
demand for our more 
carbon-efficient rigs, 
our relative emissions 
increased slightly.
• two low-emission rigs 
being upgraded in the 
second half of 2020.
• entered project 
greensand, the leading 
danish carbon capture 
and storage project, 
which targets carbon 
storage below the 
seabed in former oil and 
gas reservoirs.
• engaged with 
california-based clean 
energy systems using 
biomass waste as fuel 
to produce syngas 
and generate carbon-
negative emissions.
• increased focus on 
opportunities to improve 
capacity to consume 
responsibly through 
more coordinated 
efforts and increased 
employee involvement. 
• continued efforts to 
optimise the control, 
cleaning, and reuse of 
drilling fluids and cuttings. 
• waste amounts were 
relatively stable at 
14,000 tonnes compared 
to 12,900 tonnes in 2019.
• we registered the 
lowest level of safety 
incidents in years with 
an lti frequency of 0.44 
and trc frequency of 
2.48. our twin goals of 
zero serious injuries and 
a continued decline in 
severity of all incidents 
were also reached.
• improvements in gender 
diversity. percentage 
constant in executive 
team.
• 2022 board diversity 
target reached in 2020.
• 6,481 training days 
completed – 159 leaders 
through leading in md 
programme.
• improved enps from 
-23 in q4 2019 to -4 in 
q4 2020.
our efforts to contribute 
locally registered higher 
fullfilment for local staff 
but lower fulfilment 
for local procurement 
compared to 2019:
• 78% of requirements 
for local workforce 
achieved
• 67% of requirements 
for local procurement 
achieved
• 4 registered spills 
compared to 2 in 2019. 
improvement measures 
have been set in motion 
to bring down the 
number.
• we continued to develop 
our decommissioning 
activities in the joint 
venture maersk decom 
which secured the first 
end-to-end plug and 
abandonment solution 
contract.
• complied with 
applicable laws and 
regulations and 
conducted assurances 
and audit throughout 
our operations.
• launched a new anti-
fraud strategy.
• publication of a 
responsible rig recycling 
policy based on the 
principles of the hong 
kong convention.
• established conformity 
with the eu ship 
recycling regulation  
for 15 rigs.
