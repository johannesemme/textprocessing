the swedish parliament has decided on a long-term climate target that will require 
sweden to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. in denmark, the 
target date is 2050. society can achieve these important goals through concerted 
efforts. in 2019, the swedish fuel industry and fossil free sweden presented a 
roadmap showing our common route forward to achieve the goals in concert with 
society and the policy. a vital shared task lies ahead of us if we are to achieve our 
ambitious goals. this report describes okq8 scandinavia’s (okq8 in sweden and 
q8 in denmark, hereinafter okq8 in this report) strategy for achieving its objective 
‘toward a fossil-free future’. 
okq8 has two clear climate targets – our own operations must be climate neu-
tral by 2030 and we must be climate neutral (net zero emissions) throughout our 
value chain by 2045. the first target includes business travel, energy consumption, 
and distribution. the second includes all of our products and activities: from fuel, 
food and drink, shop goods to services. 
we have formulated three distinct focus areas for our work, covering our own 
operations and the impact on the communities in which we do business. to ensure 
maximum positive impact, each of the focus areas ‘act on climate change and 
reduce co2e emissions’, ‘consume and sell sustainable products’ and ‘enable peo-
ple and communities’ will be carefully planned and monitored. 
we are convinced that by following our established strategy together with 
members and customers, we will be able to achieve our goal of a more sustainable 
and fossil-free future.

i look back at a year unlike any other. the 
pandemic has placed great demands on 
everyone in society – companies, employ-
ees, and individuals alike. businesses had to 
adapt quickly to a new normal, and okq8 
was no exception. as a vital societal function, 
we’ve worked hard to ensure access to fuel 
and allow members, customers, suppliers, 
and employees to feel safe when visiting our 
service stations, stores and depots.
and in addition to adapting to new 
circumstances, we also held on to our 
convictions and stood by our sustainability 
strategy – a strategy that makes sure okq8 
will continue to be the reliable, innovative and 
entrepreneurial company founded back in 
1926. we aim to lead the transition with sus-
tainable alternatives and by investing wisely 
to meet new needs.
two major driving forces are leading the 
way ahead: sustainability and digitalisa-
tion. these forces are shaping the whole of 
society and developments are advancing 
rapidly, which while pleasing, also presents 
challenges. we have set clear goals for our 
business: okq8 must be climate neutral in 
its own operations by 2030, and throughout 
the value chain by 2045. this places great 
demands on the entire operation. resolution, 
innovation, investments, and a clear focus are 
essential components if we are to achieve our 
intended, indeed crucial, goals. you can read 
more in this report about how far we’ve come 
and the initiatives we envision ahead of us. 
i’m particularly proud of the partnerships 
we presented during the year with renewable 
fuel company neste and swedish energy sup-
plier skellefteå kraft. they make important 
contributions to climate neutrality. together 
with the world’s biggest producer of biofuels, 
we’ve so far enabled members and customers 
to fill up with fossil-free diesel at 170 service 
stations around sweden. our collaboration 
with skellefteå kraft will result in sweden 
and denmark’s biggest, fastest charging 
network, with high availability and outputs of 
minimum 150 kwh. 
digitalisation of the right parts of the 
business will benefit society and make it 
easier for members and customers to get 
their errands done, be it filling up fuel, 
banking or buying a cup of coffee. during 
the year, the company launched the okq8 
app and contactless payments, and it carried 
a word from the ceo
–
out extensive work on the it infrastructure. 
despite the challenges, these demanding 
projects were successful, thanks to hard work 
and good project management.
helping members and customers convert 
to fossil independence is our highest priority. 
each of us will have to do it in our own way, 
and okq8 wants to be the operator that 
helps make it possible. we’re proud of our 
long history, but our focus is on the future and 
getting to grips with the task in hand, which 
although complex is feasible. we aim to do 
everything we can to be the preferred enabler 
for sustainable motion, while going as easy 
on the environment as possible.
the transition is already here and the goal 
is clear: together with members and custom-
ers, we will make the necessary changes to 
continue living in a well-functioning society. 
we will continue the transition to achieve a 
sustainable business and a strong okq8.
i wish you a rewarding, inspiring read!

since the beginning okq8 has advanced, often leading the way, as society 
and the need for mobility services developed. okq8 does not have its own 
fuel production but rather deals with the supplier that best suits our purpose. 
we are proud of our ability to offer the best fuel on the market and also our 
ability to switch energy sources quickly if necessary. as an organisation, we 
are big enough to create good conditions, but we also have local roots thanks 
to our geographical distribution in denmark and sweden.  
okq8 at a glance
–
focusing on the future since 1926
for almost 100 years, okq8 has taken part in 
and helped shaping the staggering develop-
ment of motoring and fuel. ic, the swedish 
professional motorists’ purchasing associa-
tion, which later became ok, was founded in 
1926 to better influence prices and the avail-
ability of e.g. oil, petrol and tyres. the associa-
tion was the first of its kind in the world and in 
an age when just a few international players 
controlled the market, ic was on the side of 
its members. it was also the starting point for 
the formation of cooperative societies which, 
through today’s six ok associations, still 
work to boost competitiveness. they take an 
active part in industry developments covering 
everything from service stations as venues to 
today’s more sustainable fuels, and always 
with members and development in focus. in 
1999, ok joined forces with q8 to form okq8 
in a merger that gave us an even greater 
ability to provide our customers and members 
with the opportunity of better mobility, bank-
ing and business services.
over the decades, ic, ok and okq8/q8 
were the first to offer a range of new solutions 
in the industry, seeking to make it easier for 
members and customers to stay on the move, 
be it local trips or long distance. we were, for 
example, the first in europe to offer unleaded 
fuels in 1984. we intend to hold innovation 
and development high for the future, with an 
increasing focus on sustainable solutions. 
 
okq8 – a first choice facilitator  
for people on the move
we have our roots in a cooperative society, a 
member-owned alternative that always puts 
the interest of its members and customers first. 
this still characterises us today, in the joint 
venture between ok ekonomisk förening and 
kuwait petroleum international, that each hold 
50 per cent. the way ahead for us is clearly 
marked – we will make sustainable mobility 
possible for our members and customers. we 
must be a travelling companion on the road to 
fossil independence. we shall help our stake-
holders make wise, sustainable choices. 
digitalisation and sustainability – two 
external driving forces – are crucial to our suc-
cess and govern our priorities. they are also 
embedded in the organisation and it’s essen-
tial that all our employees understand how 
we will succeed today and into the future. a 
generous, unassuming and friendly business 
culture that has grown strong over the years 
is an excellent foundation on which to build 
okq8’s principles and clarify our approach 
and the way we work. the principles describe 
how each employee, department and division 
work together; staying close to the business, 
striving for simplicity and informed decisions, 
pushing through continuous improvement, 
and being accountable – it all starts with me.
today, as a matter of course, service 
stations provide a range of services and 
products in addition to fuel and accessories 
for cars and other vehicles – everything from 
truck rental to over-the-counter medications. 
operations extend far beyond fuel, with 
investments in sustainable energy, charging 
infrastructure and charging points, a bur-
geoning car wash offering, a steadily growing 
number of members, strong customer flow, 
and an in-house banking business.

financial performance 2020/21
johan sandberg, head of group accounting and tax, sheds more light on our 
financial performance and comments on the outcome. 
so how did we do?
the consolidated operating profit totalled sek 550 million (528) while the 
parent company’s operating profit totalled sek 271 million (489). 
 
how has okq8 been affected by covid-19?
the market was affected by the pandemic through a sharp decrease in vol-
umes during the spring and autumn in conjunction with increased restrictions 
on people’s mobility in society as a whole. the first month of the year was 
also characterised by a global fall in oil and fuel prices, which had a negative 
impact on earnings.
 
how did okq8 react?
to create conditions for endurance and flexibility moving forward in this 
period of uncertainty, we successfully introduced a cost-cutting programme 
and re-prioritised our investments. as a result, earnings and cash flow were 
strong despite the changes throughout the market.
 
why is profit and cash flow so important for okq8?
all in all, they are important for making our company well-equipped with the 
financial resources to continue investing in the ongoing transformation of the 
transport sector; to help make society less dependent on fossil fuels and also 
to provide returns to our owners and members.
 
how are the surpluses used and where is this apparent?
they are reinvested in our own operation, to the benefit of customers and 
society alike. we’re building more car washes and recondition existing ones. 
also, some funds are used to develop and adapt our it systems to provide a 
modern, secure interface to our customers, and to offer new digital services, 
such as this year’s launch of an okq8 app for car wash subscriptions. we’re 
also installing solar panels at our service stations to increase their self-suffi-
ciency in electricity and reduce the climate footprint.
also, we spend resources on remediation where we close operations. for 
example, we’re currently decommissioning a former fuel depot at loudden in 
stockholm. the entire oil harbour will be transformed into a residential area. 
several initiatives in line with our strategy have shown clear results during 
the year. we have increased market share in ids (heavy vehicles), we see 
growth in car washes thanks to our investments in new premises and sub-
scription solutions, car rentals have increased and there is a sustained flow of 
customers to our service stations. we also provide an overview in our annual 
financial report under “significant events”.
okq8 sustainability report 2020/21     11
business structure
 to successfully execute the okq8 strategy 
we are dependent on the engagement of 
all employees in the whole organisation. all 
divisions and departments each year define 
how to execute on our sustainability goals 
with measurable key performance indicators 
(kpis). this is followed up in quarterly and 
annual business reviews. 
in the executive management team, 
sustainability is represented by the director 
of sustainability & network. sustainability 
officers with responsibility for denmark 
and for sweden act as agents to accelerate 
our sustainability journey. as part of the 
implementation of sustainability activities in 
corporate operations, and to track progress, 
the sustainability officers lead a sustainabil-
ity group in the respective countries with 
representatives from the organisation.
responsibility for the wellbeing, health 
and safety of our employees is organised 
under hr, which also is under the respon-
sibility of the director of sustainability & 
network. 
okq8’s supply chain division is respon-
sible for the sourcing, management and 
distribution of fuels. therefore, okq8 has 
established an organisation to manage the 
environmental, quality, health and safety, and 
social risks specifically for fuels. 
okq8 also has a sustainability advisory 
board with external representatives acting as 
a sounding board for okq8 in sustainability 
matters.
management systems
okq8 has a management system centrally to 
manage health and safety risks in the organ-
isation with a fire and safety specialist, an 
appointed health and safety manager and 
a health and safety specialist in denmark 
and sweden respectively. the management 
system is built up in 18 elements which 
include handling the events of crises, audits, 
sshe walks, risk assessments, management 
of suppliers, environment, work environment 
and safety. in each process, there are also 
procedures, templates and instructions that 
are relevant for each area.
okq8’s supply chain division which man-
ages all storing, blending and distribution of 
fuel is certified to iso 14001 and iso 9001.
code of conduct 
our code of conduct is based on the un 
global compact’s principles on human rights, 
labour rights, the environment and anti-cor-
ruption and bribery. okq8 supports and 
respects international human rights within 
the sphere which we can influence; enforces 
regulations on labour rights; takes responsibil-
ity for our environmental impact throughout 
our organisation and does not accept any 
form of corruption and bribery. all employees 
- from staff at headquarters to our staff at the 
service stations and depots - undergo manda-
tory training of our code of conduct.
the board of directors is responsible for 
adopting the code of conduct. the ceo 
is responsible for the establishment and 
updating of the code of conduct and for 
making the code of conduct available to all 
employees. okq8’s corporate compliance 
officer has the overall responsibility for estab-
lishing, implementing and securing follow-up 
on internal rules that enable all employees to 
act in accordance with the code of conduct. 
the responsibility to act in accordance with 
the code of conduct comprises all levels 
within okq8 from the board of directors to 
operative functions.
anti-corruption is a central element of okq8’s 
code of conduct. corruption poses a chal-
lenge to society, and for its part, okq8 has a 
legal and ethical obligation to prevent it. it is 
also in okq8’s own interest to take a strong 
stand against corruption, as it can seriously 
damage our reputation. okq8 endeavours to 
follow the swedish anti-corruption institute’s 
code of business conduct. the code was 
revised in 2020, and in 2021 okq8 will priori-
tise the necessary amendments to meet the 
requirements of the code.
with respect to our fuels, we have a tool 
for identifying risks in the supply chain related 
to e.g. the control of corruption in the country 
of origin. the risks are those of the bsci/
amfori framework and its risk classification of 
countries. okq8 has a code of conduct that 
our suppliers and partners must follow, and 
which is included in our suppliers’ contractual 
obligations. our code of conduct for partners 
is based on the united nations global com-
pact’s ten principles in the areas of human 
rights, working conditions, the environment 
and anti-corruption.
okq8 bank has processes both to counter-
act corruption and to facilitate the exposure 
of money-laundering in accordance with the 
current requirements of the authorities. 
internal audit
okq8’s internal audit serves the audit 
committee of okq8 with regards to the 
obligations towards the board of directors 
in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities 
regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of 
systems of internal control, the audit process, 
and the company’s process for monitoring 
compliance with laws and regulations. the 
internal audit has access and mandate to 
review all of the activities of okq8 and the 
fundamental to our sustainability strategy is to ensure that we have guide-
lines and objectives governing our approach to social, environmental and 
corporate responsibility and ensuring that our staff are informed of and 
are familiar with these. okq8 code of conduct and our governing policies 
internally act as the foundation of everything we do.

operating units (ou) including all of the 
activities of joint ventures in which okq8 or 
the ous participate.
whistle-blowing 
it is important for okq8 that the business 
climate be open and honest, and that 
employees can easily report violations of 
our code of conduct. everyone at okq8 
can report suspicions of misconduct without 
risking any form of reprisal from the company. 
all misconduct can be reported anonymously 
through our external whistle-blower service. 
okq8 has an ethics council that deals with 
all reports of breaches of the code including 
suspicions of corruption. information on inci-
dents reported in our whistle-blower system is 
treated as confidential. we record all reported 
cases and make sure all cases are dealt with 
and concluded properly. 
sustainable procurement  
and supplier dialogue
as part of okq8’s sustainability ambition, 
we ‘consume and sell sustainable products’. 
this entails how we procure all products and 
services that we offer to customers. 
okq8 does not own any refineries and 
therefore comes into the process of fuel 
procurement at a relatively late stage in the 
value chain. we purchase finished products 
from refineries with whom we have long-term 
relationships, and which have well established 
environmental and sustainability policies. we 
buy both fossil and renewable commodities 
in the form of refined products and additives. 
okq8 has a mature process for buying fossil 
commodities such as crude oil. procurement 
of renewable commodities and fuels which 
contain vegetable or animal oils are strongly 
regulated with mandatory sustainability 
requirements. most of the oil products are 
distributed to our depots in denmark and 
sweden. okq8 has eleven nordic fuel suppli-
ers: six of these supplying fossil fuels and five 
supplying renewable fuels. 
okq8 also procures and sells food as well 
as maintenance products for the car and 
leisure activities. during the year we reviewed 
our procurement processes with regards to 
sustainability requirements and had dialogues 
with suppliers on how to reduce and improve 
environmental and social impacts with focus 
on top selling products. it is a step to further 
enhance sustainability, building on the foun-
dation that all suppliers must as a minimum 
fulfil our code of conduct for partners.  
suppliers of fossil fuels
our fossil commodities are procured from sev-
eral european suppliers. the companies which 
supply fossil fuels to us undergo particularly 
stringent inspections, since they constitute 
a high-risk factor for the environment. our 
suppliers purchase their crude oil primarily 
from russia and the north sea. through our 
third-party audits, we have identified our 
greatest risk in the fossil fuel supply chain to 
be traceability. our suppliers generally know 
which countries the oil comes from, but other 
materials are blended in the end-product, 
and these come from a number of different 
sources. for that reason, we require our 
suppliers to assess and evaluate their own 
suppliers in accordance with our code of 
conduct for partners. 
suppliers of renewable fuels 
the renewable fuels we offer our customers 
are made from agricultural products such 
as vegetable or animal oils and come from 
several different countries. to assess the sus-
tainability credentials of the renewable fuels, 
we use various assessment criteria. fuels must, 
for example, be produced in a way which does 
not breach human rights. with third-party 
certification, including iscc (international 
sustainability & carbon certification) as well 
as full traceability, we can have confidence in 
the handling of renewable fuels. we follow 
up compliance with suppliers and partners in 
accordance with requirements as stated in 
the act (2010:598) on sustainability criteria 
for biofuels and bioliquids, and our code of 
conducts for partners. the act (2010:598) 
on sustainability criteria for biofuels and 
bioliquids includes protecting land of high bio-
logical diversity and reducing co2 emissions 
compared with fossil products. the certificates 
from suppliers are audited and validated by 
third-party auditors, and annually reported to 
national authorities in denmark and sweden.
the swedish ghg reduction  
regulation and danish biofuel act 
the reduction directive in sweden and the 
quota directive in denmark presumes drop-in 
blending of renewables into the fuels. to 
meet regulatory standards, renewable fuels 
are blended into all of okq8’s goeasy petrol 
and goeasy diesel products. the national 
directives set the minimum levels for our 
blends in each country. in 2020, swedish 
law required a reduction in green house gas 
emissions from diesel by 21 % and from 
petrol by 4.2 %. the 2020 requirement in 
denmark was for at least 7.6 % of all energy 
in the form of liquid fuel to be made from 
renewable sources. in addition to the blend-
ing requirements in denmark, okq8 meets 
the 6 % co2 reduction under the eu fuel 
quality directive (fqd, article 7a).

on ceo commitments to adopt sustainability 
principles in the areas of human rights, labour 
law, the environment and anti-corruption. the 
ten principles of the united nations global 
compact are derived from the universal 
declaration of human rights, the interna-
tional labour organisation’s declaration on 
fundamental principles and rights at work, 
the rio declaration on environment and devel-
opment, and the united nations convention 
against corruption. 
the un’s sustainable  
development goals
the 2030 agenda and the 17 sustainable 
development goals (sdgs) were adopted by 
all united nations member states in 2015. 
it forms a common plan and sustainability 
agenda for nations and companies around 
the world. okq8 has adopted the goals and 
works actively to achieve them. we have 
identified certain development goals as 
being particularly relevant for our business, 
namely sdg 2 zero hunger, 3 good health 
and well-being, 5 gender equality, 6 clean 
water and sanitation, 7 affordable and clean 
energy, 10 reduced inequalities, 11 sustain-
able cities and communities, 12 responsible 
consumption and production, 13 climate 
action, and sdg 17: partnerships. 
science-based targets
okq8 is the first nordic oil and gas company 
to commit to the science-based targets 
initiative (sbti). sbti is a global standard 
against which companies set targets in 
accordance with what science says is neces-
sary to meet the paris agreement’s goal of 
keeping global warming well below 2° c and 
preferably below 1.5° c. by joining sbti, we 
make sure our rate of reduction complies with 
what is required of the oil and gas industry 
according to sbti methodology.

the advancements in global infrastructure, 
supply chains, digitalisation, and a growing 
population make up an interdependent finely 
knit system, that influences the wellbeing of 
the planet, the atmosphere and society at 
large. the negative effects are already show-
ing, in numbers as raising temperatures, and 
for the naked eye as changing landscapes 
around the world. even though the problems 
and challenges are clear, the solutions are 
often dependent on collaborative efforts. 
in order to ensure that we, as a company, 
most effectively support the global efforts 
to make a sustainable and just transition, 
we have conducted an assessment and 
evaluation of how okq8 activities impact the 
world. this includes our direct activities (own 
operations), as well as the indirect effects that 
are caused by our stakeholders producing and 
using our products and services. the aim is 
not only to re-assess previously established 
sustainability goals, key performance indica-
tors, and activities – but to create a holistic 
and updated framework, from which our com-
pany can steer its activities, and make the 
right investments, that support the necessary 
sustainable transition. 
as a company we impact our surroundings 
in two distinct ways: 
•   through our own operations as a corporate 
consumer 
•   through our value chain activities as a 
retailer of goods and services. 
thus, we have a role to play in what we 
purchase from our suppliers, to make our 
business run as effectively as possible – and a 
responsibility for what types of products we 
offer to our customers. 
how we impact and where we impact is 
an opportunity for us to leverage and to sup-
port a larger systemic change. thus, we have 
conducted this year’s materiality analysis 
with the aim of establishing which risks and 
challenges that we can influence and pos-
itively impact today, and in the years to come.

impact on the business
importance to stakeholders
18     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
okq8 works closely with our stakeholders on a 
regular basis, to get feedback and insights to 
guide our decisions. during the year, okq8 has 
hosted and participated in multiple customer 
meetings, sustainability seminars, develop-
ment projects, focus groups, and conducted 
member surveys. the aim is to constantly 
evaluate and be in sync with what our key 
stakeholders see as important, so that we can 
develop and provide the right services and 
solutions to our customers and society at large. 
in addition to our day-to-day dialogue 
with key stakeholders, we have in 2020 
conducted a larger sustainability survey 
as part of the materiality analysis and 
stakeholder dialogue, we have identified 
risks that are linked to okq8’s affairs and 
business model. the risk assessment includes 
three levels: global-, local-, and corporate 
risks. the segmentation aims to secure that 
local and corporate needs are being met, 
while keeping the overview of the aggregate 
impact that our corporate activities have 
across denmark and sweden, engaging a 
range of stakeholders who represent various 
sectors, competencies, and nationalities. the 
participants in the survey gave us feedback 
on vital sustainability areas for okq8. each 
stakeholder received a personal link to an 
online questionnaire. follow-up meetings and 
interviews have been made with selected 
stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, ngos, and experts 
were consulted to assess developments and 
risks within specific materiality domains).
in total we received input from approxi-
mately 5,500 representatives across sweden 
and denmark. 
globally. using these three levels as our 
point of departure, we have identified and 
prioritised the significant risks and potential 
negative consequences that are linked to our 
company’s operations, associations, products, 
and services. 
in order to successfully mitigate the envi-
ronmental-, social- and economic risks, asso-
ciated with our business conduct, each focus 
the results from the survey, together with the 
review of the legal and political frameworks, 
were summed up in three focus areas. the 
three focus areas will act as a key component 
for how okq8 will invest and work over the 
years to come:
•   act on climate change and reduce co2e 
emissions
•   consume and sell sustainable products
•   enable people and communities 
area works as a guideline for a sustainable 
modus operandi. in this report we elaborate 
on how the three focus areas not only reflect 
the identified risks, but act as a framework to; 
set targets, commit resources, act, and track 
progress.

okq8 sustainability report 2020/21     19
okq8 has formulated the following three 
strategic visions: 
•   act on climate change and reduce co2 
emissions
•   consume and sell sustainable products
•   enable people and communities
however, strategic visions are not enough. we 
also assign specific targets that lead to a set 
of actions that drive the essential sustainable 
transition forward. accordingly, we initiated 
the following steps in 2020 as the basis for 
continued work: 
•   step 1: concretise goals and targets 
within selected areas in close internal col-
laboration, build on appropriate data sets, 
and ensure employees engagement. 
•   step 2: establish the baseline for actions 
already initiated and align with other 
initiatives and operational considerations 
(maturity of technologies, policies and 
market conditions).
•   step 3: execution plan; implementation 
and upscaling of projects that help us 
achieve our sustainability goals; ongoing 
identification of new technologies and 
partners to continue expanding okq8’s 
sustainable portfolio.
as the maturity level of the three focus areas 
varies, we operate with different timelines 
and development stages within each area. 
we strive to set ambitious deadlines for each 
area, and enable sustainable adaptation in 
the markets we operate in. thus, the focus 
areas provide okq8 with a roadmap, and a 
common language with clear goals and key 
performance indicators across the organi-
sation. the framework helps us to prioritise 
efforts, make actions measurable and com-
municable to our stakeholders.
interdependent targets and actions
the actions described under each of the three 
focus areas are in many ways interdepen-
dent. for example, to reduce co2e emissions 
from fuel products we must consider the 
impact new fuel types (e.g. biofuels) may 
have on other sustainability aspects, such as 
biodiversity, land-use change and sustainable 
food systems. thus, actions described in one 
section can be cross referenced to other focus 
areas. however, for the sake of simplicity and 
transparency, we have tried to categorise 
the actions in a way that supports targets, 
relating to specific focus areas.
target area maturity
the pace at which we achieve different tar-
gets will vary depending on the scope and the 
level of involvement by external stakeholders. 
in general, we will be more agile, able to act 
faster and be able to see results more quickly 
in areas that are closely related to our own 
operations than in those where we are depen-
dent on suppliers and customers to change. 
furthermore, some target areas are new to 
okq8, whereas others since long have been 
strategic priorities and thus are supported by 
established systems and infrastructure. in the 
following pages, we delve deeper into each 
focus area to describe targets, actions and 
developments.

two of the most urgent threats today are 
climate change and the rise in global tem-
peratures. in the ipcc’s assessment and long-
term projections for climate change, “global 
mean temperatures will continue to rise over 
the 21st century if greenhouse gas (ghg) 
emissions continue unabated”1). and “as 
greenhouse gas (ghg) concentrations con-
tinue to rise, we expect to see future changes 
to the climate system that are greater than 
those already observed and attributed to 
human activities”.1) 
the transport sector is one of the few 
sectors that has not succeeded in lower-
ing co2e-emissions since 19902). instead, 
transport “accounts for a quarter of the 
eu’s greenhouse gas emissions, and [is] still 
growing.”3). a transition to renewable energy 
sources and a decarbonisation of the trans-
port sector are two main drivers in curbing 
global co2e-emissions. 
thus, clean energy and electrification 
play vital roles. in denmark, 2020 was a 
record year in terms of the proportion of 
renewable energy4). however, there is still a 
gap nationally and internationally between 
the renewable energy levels produced, and 
the energy needed in the near future as e.g. 
the number of electric vehicles is increasing in 
denmark and sweden. also, storage solutions 
for surplus power generation are still at an 
early stage. both public and private operators 
work to accelerate solutions in renewable 
energy production, smart energy storage, grid 
capacity, and power-to-x (ptx) to meet short 
and long-term energy demand.  
okq8’s biggest impact on the climate and 
greenhouse gas levels is through the products 
we offer. for decades, okq8’s core business 
evolved around fossil fuels. however, we are 
moving faster towards fossil-free alternatives 
and clean energy that enable us and our 
customers to transition. we expect future 
demand for fossil products and access to fos-
sil raw materials to decline, as new alternative 
fuels and energy solutions become increas-
ingly available. besides our fuel-related 
activities, we are also focusing on reducing 
co2e emissions from our other products 
and services (including food and beverages, 
merchandise, car washes and other related 
services). 
because okq8’s impact on climate 
change and global ghg emissions not only 
relates to our products but also to our own 
operations, we have set climate targets that 
involve all three scopes (1, 2, and 3) under the 
greenhouse gas protocol. 
okq8 has identified the following un 
sustainable development goals (sdgs) to be 
particularly relevant for the focus area “act on 
climate change and reduce co2 emissions”: 
sdg goal 7: affordable and clean energy; 12: 
sustainable production and consumption; 13: 
climate action, and goal 17: partnership.

an increasing number of companies world-
wide are formulating and setting climate 
targets. to make sure okq8’s climate targets 
and rate of reduction are in line with what the 
latest climate science findings deem neces-
sary to meet the paris agreement’s goals, we 
have committed to the science-based tar-
gets initiative (sbti). sbti is a global standard 
that evaluates whether a company’s climate 
goals and efforts are sufficient to keep the 
global temperature rise below 1.5° c to 2° c. 
sbti is a partnership between the carbon 
disclosure project (cdp), the united nations 
global compact, the world resources 
institute (wri) and the world wide fund for 
nature (wwf). 
sbti is currently developing a new 
methodology for companies in the oil and 
gas sector to set science-based targets. it is 
planned for launch in 2021. when the new 
methodology is ready, the sbti team of 
experts will review and validate okq8 climate 
targets against the established science-based 
criteria. 
to support global and national efforts to 
mitigate ghg-emissions and combat climate 
change, okq8 has set two climate targets, 
which will be aligned with sbti: 
•   climate-neutral in our own operation by 
2030 
•   climate-neutral throughout our value chain 
by 2045 
our 2030-target includes: 
•   scopes 1 and 2: 
    –   energy use at service stations, depots, 
and offices. 
    –   travel conducted in company-owned 
vehicles.
•   scope 3: 
    –   business travel conducted by employees 
by air, rail or in private car.
    –   distribution of okq8 products.
    –   waste generated at our facilities.*
*in 2020, we began mapping co2e emissions from waste 
management at our stations and depots in sweden and 
denmark. we expect to include co2e emissions in our 
reporting from 2021/22. 
our 2045-target includes: 
•   scope 3: 
    –   co2e emissions from our value chain 
activities and which stem from the prod-
ucts and services we offer. this includes 
our full product range from fuel, food 
and beverage products to various other 
services. okq8’s scope 3 boundaries will 
be further concretised in 2021/22 in col-
laboration with experts and in alignment 
with sbti and the ghg-protocol.
in 2020, we initiated co2e-mapping of our 
food and beverage range and will continue to 
add more products in the coming years. 
okq8’s approach to climate neutrality 
(net zero emissions) is the abatement of 
ghg emissions, i.e. the permanent removal 
of co2e emissions. our mitigation strategy 
is to reduce and remove co2e emissions by 
moving away from fossil-based products to 
clean energy and renewables. as a supple-
ment to investing in technologies, services, 
and products that will permanently reduce 
and remove co2e, we will consult experts 
and international standards on how best to 
handle the remaining emissions. 
in terms of upstream activities, okq8 
neither extracts oil nor owns refineries, but 
acts as a retailer in the market. we source 
both fossil and renewable fuel commodities 
in the form of refined products and additives. 
most of our oil products are distributed via 
our depots in denmark and sweden.

actions and initiatives to combat challenges
–
challenges relating to our own operations: 
the two main sources of ghg emissions from 
our own operations are the energy used at our 
1,000+ service stations (43%) and the distribu-
tion of products (52%). as the pie chart shows, 
emissions from business travel (scopes 1 and 3) 
total 4%. however, emissions from our depots 
and offices are correspondingly small, also as a 
contribution to achieving the 2030 goal.
solutions at hand: 
since 2014, okq8 has been tracking and 
reporting our co2e emissions and we continue 
to refine and expand the areas included in our 
co2e reporting. we adhere to the greenhouse 
gas protocol standards to make sure we com-
ply with internationally accredited reporting 
systems. for further information, see page 25. 
we have invested in a number of initiatives to 
actively reduce co2e emissions from our own 
operations, and this has resulted in a total 
co2e reduction of 3,282 tonnes since last year 
(a 15% decrease compared to last year, and a 
45% reduction since 2014). 
•   energy use: in 2020/21 we reduced our 
energy consumption by 6,810,000 kwh 
compared to last year, which led to a reduc-
tion in co2 emissions from our stations, 
depots, and offices of 6% compared to last 
year. examples of actions include switching 
to led lighting in buildings and replacing 
oil-fired heating with heat pumps.
•   distribution of products: in 2020/21, 
28% of our distribution was made fossil 
free. we are working closely with our sup-
pliers and carriers at the operational level 
to convert and scale up the number of 
fossil-free transports. 
•   employee travel: in 2020/21, we achieved 
a co2e reduction of 532 tonnes from business 
travel, equivalent to a decrease of 43% com-
pared to last year. to lower co2e-emissions 
from company-owned vehicles, our corporate 
policy requires employees with diesel vehicles 
to use hvo100 instead of conventional 
diesel. due to national corona restrictions, we 
noted a significant fall in co2e emissions from 
business travel in 2020/21- the amount of 
air travel in particular decreased. as societies 
start to reopen, we expect travel to increase 
again. however, we will focus especially on 
helping our employees to travel in the most 
sustainable way such as via public transport 
and other sustainable mobility solutions. 
we encourage all employees to hold a high 
proportion of virtual meetings to replace 
long-distance travel. 
•   petrolia: since the petrolia factory (the 
production of lubricating oils) was closed 
at the end of 2019, it is not included in this 
year’s report (nor in future reporting).

employees by air, rail or in private car. distribution of okq8 fuel products.
**)  ghg emissions intensity ratio: according the gri disclosure 305-4, the ghg emissions intensity expresses the amount of ghg emissions per unit of activity (organization-specific metric). 
okq8 uses volumes of fuel products sold (m3) as the organization-specific metric. despite an absolute decrease of ghg emissions in own operations compared to last year, we see a rise in 
ghg emissions intensity ratio (kg co2e per m3 product sold) from 6.50 to 8.37. the spike can be explained by the decrease in volumes sold in 2020/21, due to the covid19-pandemic.

value chain
challenges relating to  
value chain activities: 
most of the fuel products we offer customers 
today are fossil-based fuels. our customers 
include private vehicle owners who use our 
service stations to large corporate fleets 
(including hgvs), ships, and industrial 
machinery (e.g. farming equipment). a 
transition to fossil-free fuel types and energy 
sources is essential if we are to guide all of 
these different segments in a sustainable 
direction.
solutions at hand: 
we are constantly expanding our range of 
renewable fuels and alternatives such as 
electricity, biofuels, and gas to reduce co2e 
emissions throughout our value chain. okq8 
conducts extensive development work with 
partners and suppliers so we can offer our 
customers more sustainable mobility ser-
vices*. our work has resulted in new, more sus-
tainable products. one example is hvo100 
fossil-free diesel which we offer in collabora-
tion with neste at 170 stations throughout 
sweden (together with tanka) and at seven 
service and ids stations in denmark. the 
aim is to continue extending availability of 
hvo100 in both countries at service and ids 
stations, as well as to off-road segments.
•   biofuels are used in multiple ways – as 
blends in fossil fuel products under the 
danish biofuel act and the swedish ghg 
reduction regulation (see page 13 for 
details). during 2020 (jan-dec), okq8 sold 
303 million litres of biofuel. 
•   hvo100: in 2020, we introduced neste 
my renewable diesel (hvo100), a 100% 
fossil-free synthetic diesel that signifi-
cantly lowers co2e emissions compared to 
conventional fossil-based diesel. available 
today, hvo100 can be used in conventional 
diesel engines and is thus a means of 
lowering co2e-emissions today while other 
technologies are maturing. most diesel cars 
and trucks can use neste my renewable 
diesel (hvo100), and the number of 
vehicles approved by their manufacturers is 
constantly increasing. among others volvo, 
peugeot, citroën, bmw, and mercedes have 
approved hvo100 for most of their diesel 
car models.
•   electrification: a key element in lowering 
co2e emissions from road traffic is the 
electrification of cars. (see section “clean 
energy solutions” to learn more about 
okq8’s efforts and investments in extend-
ing the availability of charging points 
across scandinavia.)
•   gas: in 2021, okq8 will open denmark’s 
first service station for trucks running on liq-
uefied gas. initially, customers will be able 
to refuel with liquefied natural gas (lng), 
but the aim is to offer 100% fossil-free liq-
uefied biogas (lbg). okq8’s lng network 
will form part of the european international 
diesel service (ids). lng consists of natural 
gas that is cooled to -162° c, which liquefies 
it. this process reduces the volume of 
natural gas to 1/600, allowing it to be used 
as fuel for trucks and ships. compared to 
regular diesel, lng emits up to 22% less 
co2, eliminates sulphur emissions and sig-
nificantly reduces the amount of harmful 
soot particulates. liquefied biogas (lbg) is 
chemically identical to lng. a significant 
advantage of lbg is that it can be made 
from residual products and waste products 
from e.g. agriculture. in this way, parts of 
heavy trans-shipments can be performed 
using fossil-free alternatives, while reducing 
co2 emissions in the transport industry 
and the industries that supply biogas 
producers. because this is yet another step 
towards sustainable truck transport and 
better air quality, okq8 has chosen to be 
the first mover in denmark with this project 
and aims to make it easier for northern 
european haulage companies to invest in 
vehicles that run on cleaner technologies. 
     in sweden, we offer vehicle gas in two 
variants: biogas bas and biogas100. biogas 
bas contains at least 70% biogas with the 
remainder being natural gas. biogas 100 
consists of 100% renewable biogas on a 
mass balance principle, which means we 
add biogas to our vehicle gas for every kg 
of biogas 100 that our customers refuel. 
today, our customers can refuel vehicle gas 
using okq8 cards at 71 stations, of which 
20 are located on e.on sites. the biogas is 
made from renewable materials, with the 
majority originating from sewage sludge, 
food industry waste and food waste. 
•   power-to-x: together with other leading 
operators, okq8 has signed a memoran-
dum of understanding (mou), declaring 
our support for an ambition to accelerate 
the development of power-to-x technol-
ogies and products in denmark such as 
liquid fuels and other high-value products 
able to phase out the consumption of fossil 
fuels. the mou calls on the danish govern-
ment to support an ambitious phasing-in 
of power-to-x technologies in denmark.
•   non-fuel products: to reduce co2e emis-
sions from our non-fuel products, we also 
invested resources in 2020/21 in surveying 
and categorising, from a co2e perspec-
tive, the food, beverage, and retail store 
products we offer at our service stations. 
the aim is to determine which products 
have the biggest climate impact so that we 
can actively invest in better alternatives. 
as part of this segmentation, we held 
meetings with key suppliers and continued 
to identify those who use science-based 
targets and encouraged others to commit 
to climate targets in alignment with the 
paris agreement. over the coming year we 
will replace more and more food categories 
and products with high co2e footprints 
with better alternatives and continue work-
ing with suppliers to reduce co2e emissions 
in the value chain.

challenges relating to our  
own operations:
there are two main aspects to consider when 
it comes to supporting clean energy systems; 
the type of energy used (renewable sources) 
and the amount of energy used. the greatest 
energy usage, in relation to okq8 operations, 
happens at our manned and unmanned 
service stations. we expect energy demand 
to rise over the coming decade, as more and 
more digital services are created and the 
electrification of buildings and transport pro-
ceeds. thus, energy usage must be lowered in 
parallel with increasing energy demand. this 
further underlines the importance of making 
sure our facilities run on clean energy. 
solutions at hand: 
since 2014, okq8 has lowered energy usage by 
20% in our operations. to improve and make 
judicious use of the power available, we mon-
itor energy levels at our stations. this enables 
us to act quickly and make constant improve-
ments to components that lead to unwanted 
energy use. based on this energy monitoring, 
we identify ways to optimise energy usage 
(electricity, heating and cooling) each year. 
•   regarding in-store equipment such 
as coolers, freezers and ovens, we have 
initiated a detailed mapping to identify 
and replace low-performing hardware. 
energy-consuming product displays from 
suppliers at our service stations such as 
branded coolers and refrigerators, vary 
in terms of energy efficiency. we intend 
to optimise current energy use over the 
coming years through talks with suppliers, 
commercial zone planning and stricter 
energy performance requirements for 
product-displays. 
•   also, we train our staff to adopt practices 
that help save energy. for example, station 
managers are required to carry out sshe 
walks (security, safety, health, and environ-
ment) several times a year at their stations, 
to make sure they meet standards.
•   solar panels: to increase the proportion 
of renewable energy, we have installed 
solar panels at 37 stations, 20 of them were 
installed at the end of the financial year 
and will start producing electricity during 
2021/22. 
•   digitalisation is not only a strategic 
focus area for okq8, but also an area that 
impacts our energy consumption and co2e 
emissions. with regard to okq8’s back-end 
operations, we aim to minimise energy 
consumption arising from data flows and 
data storage. as more and more digital 
services enter our portfolio of services, we 
will consider the impact this has on energy 
demand, as well as co2e emissions. a big 
step for okq8 in 2020 was to move our 
data centre to norway to a facility that 
runs entirely on renewable energy (local 
hydropower plants). 
  clean energy solutions

value chain 
challenges relating to  
value chain activities: 
one of the biggest challenges in energy 
systems today is the periodical imbalance 
between supply and demand. as the 
proportion of renewable energy generation 
increases, so does the need for energy stor-
age in different forms. the increasing number 
of evs in denmark and sweden plays a part, 
as does battery storage and new ptx-tech-
nologies. okq8 is working with multiple initia-
tives to support the shift to 100% renewable 
energy systems and to help balance energy 
supply and demand.

solutions at hand: 
•   electricity supplier: as an electricity 
supplier, okq8 is able to provide electricity 
from renewable sources. we purchase 
guarantees of origin from energy sources 
that are classified as 100% renewable, 
which means the electricity is produced 
from wind, hydro or solar power. we have 
developed the okq8 hemma app to help 
customers learn more about their energy 
usage and thereby reduce energy consump-
tion, costs and environmental impact.
•   solar power is a growing global source 
of energy, and okq8 is committed to 
encouraging and accelerating this trend. to 
help our customers transition to renewable 
energy, okq8 acquired kraftpojkarna (in 
2019), sweden’s leading distributor in solar 
energy, ev charging infrastructure and 
energy storage. kraftpojkarna supports dis-
tributors with project planning, deliveries, 
installation and service. customers are both 
commercial and private and range from 
major property companies, agriculture and 
industry to homeowners. the company 
was founded in 2012 and owns the nordic 
region’s first 1mw solar tracker park, 
located between västerås and enköping 
in sweden. the park also functions as a 
test facility for new products and solutions 
before they are launched. 
•   storage: by facilitating storage solutions, 
okq8 provides grid support where batteries 
are used as a service and a supplement 
to the existing energy grid. this can take 
place at the industrial and household levels. 
paired with solar cells (or other renewable 
sources), it increases the level of renewable 
energy for self-consumption by charging 
batteries with solar energy for use when 
needed. what’s more, peak shaving can 
provide savings, and thereby cut costs. 
finally, investing in the installation of 
energy storage can act as an alternative or 
complement to increasing the main fuse 
and also work as a backup power source 
during power outages. 
•   ev charging at service stations: okq8 
provides fast chargers at around forty of 
our service stations. to further expand 
our service, we have joined forces with the 
swedish energy supplier skellefteå kraft to 
install high power charging (hpc) across 
sweden and denmark. today, most fast 
chargers have an output of 50 kilowatts. 
okq8’s new chargers will have an output 
of at least 150 kilowatts. this means that 
customers can charge their batteries up to 
a range of around 250 km in 20 minutes. 
skellefteå kraft will be responsible for 
supplying 100% renewable energy to the 
charging network. the plan is to install 
1,100 chargers at around 400 sites over a 
five-year period spanning 2021-26. “our 
goal is to make fueling just as easy for 
ev (electric vehicle) drivers as they are 
for petrol or diesel car drivers,” says helle 
dahlgren skov, director of retail and asso-
ciations. for technological reasons, today’s 
hybrid cars are unable to make use of the 
150 kwh fast chargers, and so okq8 will 
continue to provide 22-50k kw chargers. 
we provide more than 180 charging points 
today, the majority are 22 kwh chargers. 
during the financial year, nearly 60,000 
kwh were charged at our okq8-owned 
public charging stations. okq8-owned 
charging posts include the 22kw charging 
posts installed at our okq8 stations. the 
majority of our 50kw charging stations are 
owned by eon. 
•   charging at home or publicly: okq8 also 
offers charging solutions at home and the 
workplace. our charging service allows our 
customers to charge evs wherever they 
are – at home, at work, or at our service 
stations. our offer includes charging 
equipment, charging boxes, installation 
and operation as well as access to our 
charging network, on and off station. the 
okq8 electric car charging app provides 
users with access to more than 1,000 public 
charging points in sweden and more than 
30,000 in europe.

case study: q8 hvo100  
biodiesel
–
under our goal of helping our customers become climate neu-
tral, biofuels play a big, important role. especially in heavy traffic 
and transport, the availability of renewable liquid fuels able to 
replace fossil diesel will be crucial in reaching net-zero emissions 
by 2045. the collaboration with neste in sweden, which makes 
neste my renewable diesel (hvo100) available nationwide, 
enables both companies and private motorists to reduce their 
emissions. 
in denmark, the product is sold under the name q8 hvo100 
biodiesel and is available for delivery to customers with their 
own domestic tank and to consumers via f24 automatic stations 
and q8 stations. also, q8 entered into a framework agreement 
during the year with the danish national and local authorities 
procurement service (ski) to deliver 100% biodiesel to the dan-
ish state and 98 municipalities. several commercial customers 
also decided to switch to fossil-free diesel, one of which is db 
schenker. 
db schenker reduces its carbon footprint by 50%
with operations in more than 130 countries, db schenker is 
one of the world’s leading suppliers of global logistics services. 
the company provides transport by road, air and sea and is 
the leader in european land transport. part of the db schenker 
group’s overall strategy is to reduce the company’s carbon 
footprint by 50% by 2030. it regards testing various solutions 
to make its transports more sustainable as an investment in the 
future.
30     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
why did you choose hvo100 biodiesel?
we naturally follow the development of 
exciting new possibilities, and hvo100 
biodiesel is a fabulous solution which is 
available right now. we can put it straight 
into our existing fleet and begin transition-
ing immediately. hvo100 also gives us the 
ability to reduce our co2 emissions by up to 
90% on certain shipments.
how does hv0100 contribute to your 
business?
like the many other sustainable solutions 
that we’re constantly phasing in, hvo100 
primarily contributes to our goal of reducing 
our carbon footprint. at the same time, it also 
helps the company by allowing us to make 
use of the full service life of our existing fleet. 
as part of a vital societal industry, we also feel 
obliged to make decisions that are beneficial 
to the climate and the environment. choosing 
hvo100 helps us take social responsibility – 
something that benefits us all.
henrik dam larsen is ceo of db schenker denmark
facts about q8 hvo100 
biodiesel:
•   q8 hvo100 biodiesel is a 100% 
fossil-free alternative to regular 
diesel
•   q8 hvo100 biodiesel reduces 
co2 emissions by up to 90% 
compared to regular diesel
•   because hvo100 works just like 
regular diesel, it’s possible to 
switch between, or mix, hvo100 
and diesel
•   hvo100 biodiesel is made from 
offal primarily from animal 
waste

according to the un, the global population 
could grow to around 8.5 billion by 2030 and 
9.7 billion by 2050. to sustain high living stan-
dards for that many people would require the 
natural resources of almost three planets.1) 
the world economic forum’s 2020 global 
risk report ranks the loss of biodiversity 
as the second most impactful and third 
most likely risk for the next decade. the 
world economic forum further states that 
human activity has endangered biodiversity 
through agricultural and industrial expansion, 
exploitation of plants and animals through 
harvesting, logging, hunting and fishing, 
pollution, the introduction of non-indigenous 
species and climate change, thus exacerbat-
ing the loss of natural environment which in 
turn reduces nature’s resilience to climate 
change. the living planet report 2020, 
published by the wwf, showed an average 
drop of 68% in the monitored populations of 
mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish 
between 1970 and 2016.
less than 3% of the world’s water is fresh 
water i.e. drinkable, and 2.5% of this is frozen 
in antarctica, the arctic and glaciers. yet 
societies are polluting and using water faster 
than nature is able to circulate. 
resources are put into producing food, 
and the food sector accounts for around 30% 
of the world’s total energy consumption. still, 
every year about one third of all food pro-
duced for human consumption in the world is 
lost or wasted.1)
sustainable development requires us to 
reduce the global ecological footprint by 
changing our methods of production and the 
consumption of resources. we must eliminate 
waste and support circular systems to re-use, 
share, repair and recycle goods and create 
closed loop systems. because we are facing 
real global risks of climate change, the loss of 
biodiversity and reduced water availability, we 
have an obligation to act today.
okq8 has an opportunity to make a 
positive impact by enabling our customers to 
make sustainable choices through the prod-
ucts and services we offer. we must take into 
consideration both social and environmental 
aspects as well as how we sell, market and 
make products available to our customers 
across scandinavia. in creating a sustainable 
product range, okq8 strives to incorporate 
multiple sustainability factors to make the 
overall footprint of individual products as low 
as possible. accordingly, our efforts seek to 
create a holistic sustainability approach that 
not only includes co2e, but a range of sus-
tainability factors including water manage-
ment, land-use and farming, biodiversity and 
nature, materials and zero waste. 
okq8 has identified the following un 
sustainable development goals (sdgs) to 
be particularly relevant for the focus area 
“consume and sell sustainable products”: 
sdg 2: zero hunger; sdg 6: clean water and 
sanitation; sdg 12: responsible consumption 
and production, and sdg 17: partnerships.

actions and initiatives to combat challenges
–
challenges relating to our  
own operations: 
the majority of our water consumption 
takes place at our service stations across 
sweden and denmark. our car wash facilities 
use water, which generate wastewater. 
the wastewater contains oil, heavy metals, 
asphalt, tyre residue and chemicals from car 
care products. if they reach watercourses, 
these substances can harm people, animals 
and vegetation for a long time to come. 
solutions at hand: 
•   car washes: by investing in technologies 
that enable more efficient use, treatment 
and re-use of water at our facilities, we 
help to protect and secure clean water as 
a resource for humans and as a natural 
habitat for species. wastewater from our 
car washes goes through treatment units 
and oil separators, making car washes a 
better alternative for the environment than 
washing cars at home. we have twelve car 
wash facilities with biological wastewater 
treatment plants in sweden, ten at our 
automatic car washes and two of them are 
located at facilities where our customers 
can wash the car themselves. installing 
biological treatment plants is an advantage 
if we want to re-use the water and minimise 
use of chemicals. we cannot by law re-use 
the water at facilities where our customers 
can wash their car themselves in sweden. 
all automatic car washes and most of our 
car wash products at our wash yourself 
facilities in sweden have the nordic swan 
ecolabel. in denmark, we have twenty-five 
car wash facilities with biological treat-
ment plants and 64 stations with nordic 
ecolabelled chemicals. the goal is to have 
nordic ecolabelled chemicals incorporated 
at all 200 stations in denmark in 2021. 
our target for both denmark and sweden 
is to recycle the water in all automatic car 
washes by 2030.
•   steamrex: steamrex by okq8 offers a new 
kind of car wash service, where qualified 
operators steam clean cars at a time 
and place that suits the customer. steam 
cleaning technology involves the minimum 
use of chemicals and only 5 litres of water 
for each wash. there is no water run-off, 
since dirt and particles are captured in 
the washcloths, which are subsequently 
washed and reused.
•   water efficient taps: to reduce our water 
usage, we have installed new water efficient 
taps at our service stations in sweden. this 
can help us save up to 60,000 litres per 
tap per year, depending on the degree of 
utilisation.
  sustainable water management
own operations
value chain 
challenges relating to  
value chain activities: 
the products we sell impact the water 
resources in the country of origin and in 
the production country. depending on the 
water conditions at source, the impact of 
two similar products can differ greatly, also 
depending on how the supplier manages its 
water impact. agriculture is a major water 
consumer and we are aware that the food 
and beverages we offer come with the risk 
of affecting water resources in regions with 
scarce water resources. 
solutions at hand: 
as a retail business, we seek to source prod-
ucts and work with suppliers who manage 
their water footprint, thereby helping to 
protect water as a resource. this is a factor we 
will include in our sourcing processes. several 
of okq8’s suppliers already have measures 
in place to manage its water use, and in the 
years ahead we endeavour to systemise data 
and create the appropriate framework to 
manage the water footprint of our scope 3 
activities.
34     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
challenges relating to our  
own operations: 
as a retail company, we are not directly 
involved in upstream activities. thus, we have 
little direct impact on the land use and farm-
ing activities that are often associated with a 
large ecological footprint. the indirect impact 
that arises from the products we source 
and sell, is described in the section below, 
regarding our value chain activities. okq8’s 
direct impact on land use, soil contamination 
or degradation is something we take very 
seriously when we acquire, manage, or sell 
property and land. the property assets we 
manage and rent include different types of 
service stations, offices, and depots in sweden 
and denmark. we note how building and 
population density is rising in urban areas. 
because unoccupied land is scarce, many 
industrial areas are converted for housing 
to accommodate the influx of people and 
urbanisation. furthermore, city planners and 
municipalities place great emphasis on the 
liveability of cities, and factors such as access 
to transport, green space and shopping play 
a key role. 
solutions at hand: 
our locations and infrastructure allow us to 
act as a facilitator of sustainable mobility in 
cities and rural areas, thereby supporting a 
greater network of options such as access to 
public transport, car sharing services, bike and 
car rentals, ev charging, etc. as we develop our 
property and asset portfolio moving forward, 
we will consider how our locations can leverage 
and support local developments, liveability 
and connected infrastructure in cities and 
rural areas. for example, we look at how to 
include green space, the multifunctional use of 
spaces (such as playgrounds at service stations 
or solar cells on rooftops) as part of service 
station maintenance and upgrades. two of our 
service stations in denmark – kalbygaard skov 
north and south – have been designed to be 
interactive for both children and adults and 
have rooftop solar panels. 
at the end of 2019, the operations in 
okq8’s lubricants factory petrolia and the 
depot at loudden in stockholm ceased, 
following a political resolution made by the 
city of stockholm, in order to convert the area 
into a residential area. okq8 is in the process 
of dismantling the facility and remediating 
the contaminated land to enable new homes 
to be built. 
  sustainable land use and farming
own operations
value chain
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
as a retailer, we can support sustainable 
land use and farming methods by sourcing 
products that meet high standards within 
parameters such as ecology, local production, 
fair trade, animal welfare, residual waste use, 
plant-based products and aspects that cause 
indirect land-use changes (iluc). iluc is a 
particular issue when replacing fossil-based 
fuels with bioenergy and biofuels (liquid or 
gaseous transport fuels made from biomass). 
biofuels can be made from food crops such as 
sugar, starch, rapeseed, soy, beets or cereals 
(e.g., corn, wheat) – crops that potentially 
could be used for food and feed, depend-
ing on the source and classification. the 
methodology used to determine high and 
low-risk iluc factors and the classification of 
biofuel feedstock are under constant debate 
at the eu and national levels due to the risk 
of negating the greenhouse gas saved from 
using biofuels. in the case of okq8’s non-fuel 
products such as the food and beverage 
assortment, we also consider the ratio of ani-
mal-based to plant-based products, as well as 
where and how raw materials are produced. 
the monoculture farming of certain crops has 
proven harmful to the resilience of local land 
areas, while putting pressure on local water 
resources and causing harm to biodiversity.  
solutions at hand: 
the renewable energy directive (eu) governs 
which feedstocks may be used for biofuels 
and sets a limit on high iluc-risk fuels. okq8 
complies with the directive’s legal provisions. 
(see page 13 for further information).
regarding our food and beverage we have 
initiated a review of our product range to 
categorise the products that can be replaced 
and/or complemented by a plant-based 
alternative, and target products where we 
can, together with our suppliers, work towards 
a lower ecological and climate footprint. 
we also look at how best to support and 
source animal-based products that meet 
animal welfare standards and other require-
ments such as taste and origin. since 2019, 
q8 in denmark has offered happy chicken 
products e.g., nuggets made from chickens 
raised in good conditions without antibiotics; 
they enjoy a longer, better life with more 
space per bird. we also engaged in talks 
with chicken suppliers in sweden on animal 
welfare. 
okq8 continues to expand the variety of 
organic and local products to our customers. 
we work closely with innovative companies 
able to present new takes on well-known 
commodities. one example is our collabo-
ration with il fornaio, a danish slow-food 
and organic craft bakery that has created a 
new sourdough bun made from ipa brewing 
residues. by introducing new concepts and 
products that build on circular economy  
principles, we can support the transition to  
a more sustainable food system. 
okq8 sustainability report 2020/21     35
challenges relating to our own operations: 
locally, we see how an increasing urbanisa-
tion, increased paved areas and monocul-
tures in parks and gardens, result in the loss of 
natural habitat and sources of food to various 
species. 
solutions at hand: 
okq8 want to help alleviate this issue by 
engaging in biodiversity projects that protect 
the local flora, fauna and ecosystems on the 
properties we manage and the surrounding 
areas. in 2021, we are identifying places that 
can be converted into more biodiverse areas. 
in the year ahead, we plan to initiate pilot proj-
ects at selected stations to explore how we can 
support local biodiversity and species. we are 
teaming up with biologists, who can help make 
sure the right plants and solutions are used. 
  support biodiversity and nature
own operations 
value chain 
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
the biggest challenges and potential impact 
on biodiversity, nature and habitats occur in 
the upstream part of our supply chain. for 
example, palm oil and its use in food and 
biofuels is linked to deforestation, an issue 
that affects valuable natural environments 
and areas of high conservation value. 
solutions at hand: 
okq8 seeks to ensure that all the raw mate-
rials we use are produced responsibly with 
regard to biodiversity. okq8 uses products 
with pfad, which is a residual product and 
classified as a co-product in sweden from the 
processing of palm oil for the food and other 
industries. about 5% of palm oil processed 
is removed for pfad production. we comply 
with the strict legal requirements for biofuels. 
under the eu renewable energy directive 
(red) renewable raw materials in biofuels in 
europe must be traceable back to the point 
of origin. okq8’s sustainability require-
ments for renewable fuels include ilo core 
conventions, greenhouse gas savings, chain 
of custody, and no sourcing from areas with 
high carbon stocks or high biodiversity values 
as defined by the red. in 2020, we entered 
into a partnership with neste in sweden to 
offer neste my renewable diesel (hvo100). 
neste is committed to no deforestation with 
full traceability back to the plantation by 
2020 for all pfad. all pfad used in sweden 
from neste is certified in accordance with 
iscc criteria and neste’s own sustainability 
criteria on biodiversity and human rights. 
neste has published its supply chain for pfad 
with data on rspo, iscc, and ispo certifi-
cations on its website. neste my renewable 
diesel (hvo100) contained no pfad in 2020; 
instead, we used residual products such as 
animal fat waste from the food industry and 
recycled cooking oil, etc. 
36     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
challenges relating to our own operations: 
the increasing volume and complexity of 
waste has an impact on society, ecosys-
tems and human health. the challenge of 
material recycling, for example related to 
plastic, is contaminated waste streams, use 
of unwanted chemicals, the lack of techno-
logical solutions to recycle all types of plastic, 
and lack of a market that demands recycled 
plastic material. 
solutions at hand: 
okq8 can help make a difference, by segre-
gating waste at stations thus aiding material 
recycling, and by demanding recycled mate-
rial in the products we procure, use and sell 
at our service stations. by avoiding harmful 
materials, supporting recycling and a circular 
loop of materials in our own operations, we 
can help save natural resources and minimise 
the use of virgin materials. an example is our 
uniforms, where we together with our sup-
plier, look at how to minimise textile waste, 
increase the use of sustainable textiles, and 
take back used garments. facilitating a closed 
loop system in our own waste management 
process can also help our customers at our 
service stations to recycle waste, and as such 
we can also avoid littering along the roads. at 
the end of the year okq8 adopted a number 
of waste targets we will focus on implement-
ing in the coming year. fulfilling the targets 
will require everything from evaluating what 
type of material goes into the products 
we sell and whether it can be recycled, to 
optimising containers and packaging, and 
implementing better recycling facilities at our 
stations. 
•   waste segregation: during the year we 
planned for standardising the waste seg-
regation at our service stations in sweden 
and continue to increase the segregation 
of waste fractions in denmark. during 
2020/21, we have run test trials at certain 
stations in denmark to sort plastics, in 
order to send certain plastic-waste fractions 
to handlers that can upcycle the material 
to new plastic use. 
•   food waste programmes: in both sweden 
and denmark we launched a food waste 
reduction programme at our stations 
divided into three parts: 1) preparing the 
right amount of food 2) recording food 
waste, and 3) making better use of the 
consumer-apps karma and too good to go 
to sell left over food. 
  sustainable materials and zero waste
own operations 
value chain 
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
a circular economy is based on the princi-
ples of moving from a linear model, where 
finite resources are wasted at end of use, to 
designing out waste and keeping materials 
and products in loop and in use. 
solutions at hand: 
during 2021/22, we will start reviewing the 
requirements on suppliers regarding the prod-
ucts we use at the stations and the service 
our suppliers provide. 
•   biofuels and biogas: during the year, we 
initiated a partnership with neste to be 
able to offer neste my renewable diesel 
(hvo100). neste my renewable diesel 
(hvo100) is based on raw materials from 
waste and residue raw materials such as 
animal fat waste, used cooking oil and vari-
ous wastes and residues from vegetable oils 
processing. the biogas we offer originates 
predominantly from sewage sludge, waste 
from the food industry, and food waste.
•   biowaste: in denmark, we cooperate with 
daka refood to recycle organic waste into 
biogas. the nutrients from the biowaste 
are used as fertilizer for agriculture. during 
the year, 20 stations were connected to the 
initiative saving 57,850 kg co2, producing 
enough nutrients to grow 132,415 kg of 
carrots.
•   karma and too good to go: okq8 has 
been using the consumer-apps karma in 
sweden since 2019 and too good to go 
(tgtg) in denmark since 2018 to reduce 
food waste. in 2020/21, 11,565 kg of 
food was saved, equivalent to 41,101 kg 
of carbon dioxide, via karma and 93,458 
meals (233,645 kg of carbon dioxide) was 
saved via tgtg. in 2020/21 we passed 
a great milestone; since we started our 
collaboration with too good to go, we 
have managed to save more than 200,000 
meals in denmark (203,977 meals, which is 
509,942 kg of co2 saved). 303 stations are 
connected to karma in sweden.

case study: saving meals to 
reduce food waste
–
manned stations in sweden and denmark offer much more than 
just fuel, products and services for vehicles belonging to our 
members and customers. food and drink play a major, increas-
ingly important role, as we develop a more varied offering. today 
we offer freshly prepared sandwiches and pastries, breakfast 
and coffee, and a variety of hot food served at different times of 
the day. we prioritise the constant pursuit of more sustainable 
alternatives while ensuring the highest possible quality and 
range of food products. this year, swedish chicken bacon with a 
significantly lower climate impact, replaced the pork version. this 
saves 27 tonnes of co2 emissions per year. close collaboration 
between okq8 and the supplier resulted in a tasty product that 
also reduces emissions in line with the okq8 target of climate 
neutral operations by 2030. 
more and more people are discovering the high quality at our 
service stations and decide to take a break and get a bite to eat. 
this also means increased responsibilities at each station and 
store. the counter must look clean and fresh and offer a wide 
selection of freshly prepared sandwiches, sausages, and pastries. 
at the same time, the amount of food prepared and presented 
needs to match the demand, to keep the amount of waste as 
small as possible. one of the largest climate problems is the fact 
that no less than one third of the world’s food is thrown away. 
thanks to our size and many service stations, okq8 can play a 
role in the fight against food waste. part of the solution is the 
collaboration with the apps too good to go in denmark and 
karma in sweden. 
how service stations in sweden and denmark  
reduce food waste to a minimum
okq8 in gävle has, alongside okq8’s over 300 manned service 
stations in sweden, connected to karma, an app that sells food 
that would otherwise be thrown out. during 2020/21, the service 
station has, with the help of its members and customers, saved 
273 kilos of food from the bin. this is equivalent to almost 3,000 
kg in reduced co2 emissions. 
38     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
bo westerberg is the sales manager at okq8 in gävle.
bo, you are one of the service stations in sweden that has 
saved the most food through the karma app. why do you 
think that is?
we actively work to quickly put karma goods on the app, and 
ensure that we set good, attractive prices. 
what do the customers who use the app say? what is 
their reaction?
our customers are satisfied with how simple it is to shop and the 
environmental aspect of the approach.
is there anything that sells especially well?
sandwiches sell well, but so do various bars, chocolate and 
certain drinks.
in denmark, the stations have passed the 200,000 milestone of 
rescued meals since the start, and saved over 2,000 kg of food 
from the bin with too good to go. that’s equivalent to 5,000 kg 
of co2. christian mads winther is responsible for one of the most 
successful stations, q8 varde, and is happy to be part of the 
initiative and help reduce food waste. 
christian, why do you think you’ve been so successful?
we put together really good bags for customers with varied 
content. they are ready to be picked up when customers come in 
and are now also delivered by nice employees who are happy to 
pass on food instead of throwing it away. 
what do the customers who use the app say?  
what is their reaction?
something they appreciate a lot is that there’s almost always 
something for every member of the family in one bag, whether 
you’re craving a sandwich or something sweet. we offer a wide 
variety of food, coffee and bread at q8, and we really try to put 
together a good mix when we pack the bags. 
what’s the best part about too good to go?
without a doubt it’s being able to help reduce food waste. the 
fact that the food gets eaten instead of being thrown away. 
that’s absolutely the most important aspect for myself and my 
colleagues. it would probably have been doable in some other 
way, but this works really well. 
facts about karma and too good to go:
•   apps that help customers save food that would 
otherwise end up as waste
•   karma was founded in sweden in 2016, too good to 
go was founded in denmark in 2016
•   in 2020/21, okq8 saved 11,565 kg (41,101 kg of 
co2) of food in sweden through karma and 93,458 
meals (233,645 kg of co2) through to good to go in 
denmark
•   together they have 51.4 million users, with 1,000,000 
in sweden and 2,100,000 in denmark

nordic countries have a history of being con-
sidered proactive and leaders in terms of high 
living standards, the protection of consumer 
rights and high levels of equality. over the 
years, nordic countries have ranked among 
the happiest nations in the world1). neverthe-
less, there is always room for improvement. 
lifestyle diseases, mental health problems 
and working conditions all have a major 
impact on people’s lives and society at large, 
even in the world’s happiest countries. 
we see how mental workload can cause 
a decrease in average life expectancy of 6-7 
months. and every year in denmark alone, 
this results in half a million consultations with 
general practitioners, one million days off 
from work due to illness, and almost 3,000 
health-related early retirement pensions2). 
in the case of noncommunicable diseases, 
the european region is the most affected by 
noncommunicable diseases in who regions. 
conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases 
and mental disorders account for an esti-
mated 86% of the deaths and 77% of the 
disease burden in the region3). many of these 
conditions can be improved by appropriate 
interventions in areas such as tobacco use, 
the harmful use of alcohol, high blood cho-
lesterol, obesity, unhealthy diet and physical 
inactivity3). 
as a company with 3,800 employees, we 
can provide good, safe working environments, 
help alleviate the levels of work-related stress, 
ensure equality in the workplace and help our 
people grow and prosper in their roles. and as 
one of scandinavia’s largest fuel companies, 
we interact with numerous people from 
suppliers to customers and we are able to 
market a range of products and services that 
can prevent lifestyle diseases and improve air 
quality levels over the long term. 
we endeavour to empower sustainable 
communities and people. we do so by sup-
porting social and economic development in 
local and global communities wherever our 
value chain has a presence.

actions and initiatives to combat challenges
–
challenges relating to our own operations: 
good working conditions entail many aspects 
of working life; from safety and conditions of 
the physical environment to how workers feel 
about their work and working environment. 
it includes aspects such as work-life balance, 
workload, prevention of occupational inju-
ries, freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, remuneration, and employee 
benefits. during the year, the prevailing covid-
19 pandemic meant a major change, both 
in terms of the psychosocial- and physical 
work environment, and had an impact on our 
employee’s wellbeing, for example through 
stress, anxiety and sickness.
solutions at hand: 
because 2020/21 was a year highly 
influenced by covid-19, several additional 
employee surveys were conducted, in order 
to follow the mental- and physical wellbeing 
among our employees going through a time 
with changed working conditions. for our 
office-based employees the change mainly 
meant working from home with distance 
leadership and lack of colleagues. for our 
employees at the service stations, the new 
situation meant many new restrictions and 
a change in behaviour from customers. 
working from home required focus on several 
new issues. in sweden we secured a supple-
mentary insurance to cover employees who 
work from home. our employees were able to 
borrow office equipment from the office, and 
we had recurring digital meetings, of various 
sizes, to inform employees about devel-
opments in the company. managers were 
encouraged to pay extra attention to the 
wellbeing of their employees through more 
frequent 1:1s and other meeting forums. with 
these initiatives, we hope to create a safe and 
good work environment also in 2021.
•   employee surveys: for many years, 
an internal employee survey has been 
conducted annually at our offices, depots 
and stations. the result at the offices and 
depots has risen from 3.21 in 2019/20 to 
3.30 in 2020/21, on a scale of four, with 
a response frequency as high as 95 per 
cent. at our stations in sweden the result 
has risen from 81.4 to 82.5 on a scale to 
100 and in denmark it has risen from last 
year’s result of 79.4 to this year’s result of 
82.8, with a response frequency of 84% in 
sweden and 93% in denmark.
•   incidents and near misses. okq8 has a 
management system to manage health 
and safety risks in the organisation which 
include handling of incidents and crises, 
audits, sshe walks, risk assessment, man-
agement of suppliers, environment, work 
environment and safety. in 2020/21, there 
was a fall in the number of reported inci-
dents compared with 2019/20 (from 1,047 
to 855). furthermore, the number of ‘near 
misses’ decreased from 530 in 2019/20 
to 329 during 2020/21. the number of 
reported incidents involving personal injury 
raised by 7.6 per cent on the preceding 
year’s figure (from 158 to 170). the number 
of days of absence connected to personal 
injury decreased by 21 per cent compared 
to last year (from 365 to 290 days), which 
explains the decrease in lwc severity rate 
(see summary on page 43). the reduced 
number of reported incidents is not in itself 
a positive, since we want all such incidents 
to be reported. on the other hand, the 
decrease in the number of near misses is 
a focus area in the coming years in order 
for us to be able to take preventive action 
before a serious incident occurs which 
might involve personal injury. we monitor 
absence due to illness and look specifically 
at how we can reduce work-related absence 
due to illness. during 2020/21, absence due 
to illness was 4.7 per cent.
•   sshe walks (safety walks): sshe walks 
are carried out at every service station 
several times a year. the purpose is to 
identify and eliminate possible causes of 
unsafe situations. during 2020/21, 2,077 
walks were carried out (own staff and 
contractors). we carry out audits every year 
in accordance with our audit plan. audits 
can be carried out in-house by us or by an 
external expert such as a certified auditor. 
the purpose of these audits is to evaluate 
whether the management system is being 
complied with and whether it provides us 
with value and effectiveness.

value chain
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
okq8 sources goods and services from 
suppliers that may have complex supply 
chains spanning over multiple countries with 
different legal, regulatory and human rights 
practices. while this can offer opportunities 
for economic development in regions, it can 
also present human rights risks. we have 
identified risks linked to human rights accord-
ing to the bsci / amphoria categorisation in 
the supply chain of fuels. although we source 
finished products from low-risk countries, our 
fuels suppliers buy raw materials from risk 
countries. 
solutions at hand: 
we can have a positive effect in the com-
munities we source our products from by 
supporting the human rights and wellbeing 
of the people in our value chain. okq8 does 
not accept child or forced labour, corruption 
or bribery. all of our suppliers must comply 
with our code of conduct. during the year 
we evaluated various tools to be incorpo-
rated in our procurement process to further 
strengthen transparency and traceability in 
our value chains.

challenges relating to our own operations: 
for okq8 to succeed and stay relevant in the 
future, it is crucial we invest in our employees. 
we seek to attract employees and retain exist-
ing staff by offering leadership and professional 
training, skill upgrades and professional devel-
opment. other aspects are sharing information 
with our employees to keep them informed 
about strategic changes and to follow corpo-
rate progress. thus, we create transparency 
and openness in the organisation and give our 
employees an opportunity to engage. covid-19 
made it difficult to meet in person in larger 
groups e.g. at weekly office meetings or corpo-
rate conferences. digital information sharing 
became a cornerstone in the dissemination 
of vital information during rapidly changing 
societal conditions. 
solutions at hand: 
during the year, we regularly updated our 
employees on how we, as a company, must 
adhere to restrictions and new regulations aris-
ing from covid-19. many activities moved from 
personal meetings to virtual. for example, our 
mandatory health & safety course (sam) that 
all our managers must attend, was made digi-
tal. this resulted in more attendees, saved time 
for our managers and reduced co2e emissions 
from travelling. to further leverage our collec-
tive sustainability efforts, we invested in raising 
internal knowledge about our sustainability 
goals and targets, progress and the renewable 
products we offer. in some cases, we did this in 
collaboration with external partners, e.g. when 
launching the new neste my renewable diesel 
(hvo100) in partnership with neste.
•   training: to equip people with the skills 
to succeed and grow in their roles, okq8 
uses individual development plans, training 
sessions, e-learning and leadership training. 
in 2020, we launched a new training 
portal, providing online courses and training 
modules on health & safety, security and 
the environment (sshe), gdpr, the code 
of conduct, sustainable fuels, and more. 
certain courses are mandatory, while others 
are optional. training sessions are registered 
and form the basis for our training index, 
which is calculated on the number of training 
hours per employee. this year, we achieved 
a training index specifically for sshe courses 
of 2.24, which is below our target of 3.7. we 
did not achieve the target because many 
courses were cancelled due to the ongoing 
pandemic. 
•   individual development programmes: 
okq8 managers and supervisors undergo 
a tailored development programme with a 
focus on leadership. in 20/21, special atten-
tion was given to distance-leadership and 
motivating employees and teams.   
•   trainee and talents programmes: okq8 
also offer trainee and talent programmes. 
these were paused during 2020/21 but will 
resume sometime in 2021/22. 
  learning, development and information sharing
own operations
value chain 
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
to help our customers and members make 
more sustainable choices, we must make sure 
there is clear, easily accessible information 
about the alternatives we offer, and the 
difference they make.
solutions at hand: 
we want to share information and knowl-
edge to make it easier for our target groups 
to make judicious choices for their health, 
the environment and the planet. because 
communication plays such an important role, 
we use a variety of channels to share infor-
mation. in 2020, the focus was on building 
awareness to make more sustainable choices. 
accordingly, we arranged seminars during the 
year targeting a broad audience to reach as 
many people as possible. on 26 november 
2020, we held a webinar entitled ‘towards a 
fossil-free society’, which attracted around 
170 participants. in addition to b2b sales 
director helen axelson and sustainability 
and network director andréa haag, speakers 
included charlotta szczepanowski, head of 
sustainability and quality coop, per eman-
uelson, head of branded sales neste and 
maria grahn, senior researcher at chalmers 
university. more than 400 signed up, and 
those who were unable to attend the event 
could see the recorded version later. okq8 
donated sek 100 to vi-skogen for each 
participant, resulting in 930 planted trees in 
uganda. another webinar was arranged on 
23 february together with skellefteå kraft on 
the topic of the electrification of the swedish 
vehicle fleet. the response was immense, with 
approximately 300 attending the one-hour 
event. guest speakers included representa-
tives from trafikverket, bil sweden, charge 
amps and elbil sverige. it was also possible 
for people to watch the one-hour webinar 
afterwards. information about both webinars 
were sent out to customers and members, as 
well as posted in social media.

challenges relating to our own operations: 
when people are excluded from the labour 
market, it is not only a problem for the 
individual, but also a potential loss for com-
panies, as they might well be missing out on 
valuable future employees. to fully embrace a 
potentially diverse workforce, an organisation 
must create the conditions necessary for a 
diversity-oriented culture and system that 
is open to differences and which focuses on 
skills. in the recruitment, people may harbour 
an unconscious bias that influences our 
decisions or actions negatively. a dynamic 
workforce fosters conditions for creativity, 
sees situations and problems from different 
perspectives and assimilates the knowledge 
necessary to best meet our customers’ dif-
ferent needs and wishes. a diverse workforce 
can help bring different ideas to the table in 
a broad spectrum of viewpoints, and in doing 
so better equip okq8 with the skills it needs 
for the future.
solutions at hand: 
okq8 strives to be an organisation with 
a dynamic workforce and to offer equal 
opportunities for all, be they employees, 
future employees, customers, or partners. 
okq8 wants every employee to feel welcome, 
included, respected, and valued no matter who 
they are or where they come from. to help our 
employees act in ways that promote equal 
opportunities for all, okq8 has established 
policies such as our code of conduct and 
our diversity policy. our ambition is for such 
policies to make work easier and clarify okq8’s 
view and way to promote a workplace with 
equal opportunities. our diversity policy states 
that through information, open debate and 
the training of managers and employees, we 
create a diversity-oriented organisation that 
is open to differences and which focuses on 
skills. we want diversity to be a natural, integral 
part of the organisation’s internal systems and 
processes, such as recruitment, career develop-
ment, skills development and reward systems. 
•   gender equality: gender equality is 
another aspect of assuring equal oppor-
tunities for all. of the total number of 
employees, 53 % are women and 47 % 
are men. looking at the okq8 executive 
management team, 60 % are women and 
40% men. thus, in many ways, okq8 has a 
balanced gender ratio. 
•   internship programmes: we have an 
internship programme, that welcomes 
people with a history of unemployment 
(e.g. due to physical injuries or mental 
illness). the programme mainly runs at our 
customer service office in avesta. during 
20/21 we had 17 people at this internship. 
we will continue the programme in 21/22.
  equal opportunities for all
own operations 
value chain 
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
as accounted for in the section ‘good work-
ing conditions’, we source goods and services 
from suppliers that can have complex supply 
chains, spanning multiple countries with 
different legal, regulatory, and human rights 
practices.  
solutions at hand: 
all suppliers and partners must comply with 
our code of conduct. no people may be 
treated differently or discriminated against 
due to their race, colour, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, etc.

challenges relating to our own operations: 
we believe that having a healthy balance 
between work and leisure is crucial for peo-
ple’s well-being and makes us more efficient 
at work. during the year, we experienced 
many restrictions due to covid-19 which 
reduced our ability to do the things we believe 
contribute to healthy living.
solutions at hand: 
we want to provide a good and safe working 
environment, and we aim to enable and 
encourage life in which we can combine 
and balance family, and an active leisure 
time with work and career. we have work 
environment committees in denmark and 
sweden, in which employees are represented. 
the committees meet twice per year to 
follow up and discuss work-related issues and 
events, as well as to decide on measures to be 
carried out during the year. during 2020/21, 
we encouraged walk-and-talk sessions and 
reminded our employees to take breaks when 
working in front of the computer. a new 
initiative was launched in the beginning of 
2021 to help office staff to take active breaks 
from work. short workout sessions and dance 
classes were offered three times a week. we 
also have a benefit programme for all staff, 
which includes an allowance for keep-fit activ-
ities that all employees are entitled to take 
advantage of. a new health strategy is being 
drawn up for launch in 2021/22. average 
employment time in 2020/21 at okq8 was 
5.6 years based on 3,772 employees.
•   sick leave: sick leave went up slightly in 
sweden and denmark from the previous 
year. this was mainly due to people having 
to stay off work with any cold symptoms as 
a result of the ongoing pandemic. 
  healthy living 
own operations
value chain 
challenges relating to our  
value chain activities: 
at okq8, we are aware that part of our prod-
uct range can cause harm to the environment 
and health. the combustion of fossil fuels 
generates particulates and emissions that 
can be harmful to health. we also sell sugary 
drinks and sweets, alcohol and lottery tickets 
that can have a negative impact on health. 
solutions at hand: 
we can reduce the environmental impact 
of the fuels we sell by making sure the fuel 
is of a higher quality, leading to better air 
quality and fewer emissions. we add caring 
and cleaning additives in all diesel to ensure 
that the efficiency is good during the lifespan 
of the vehicle, which thus is better for the 
engine and reduces the fuel consumption 
and emissions. we can also make a difference 
by providing more sustainable transport, 
mobility and clean energy solutions by sup-
porting a resilient mobility infrastructure in 
the communities in which we operate. what’s 
more, we help our customers and members 
make more sustainable choices by offering 
products and services that promote physical 
health and reduce lifestyle diseases such as 
diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcoholism or 
gambling addiction.
•   rental fleet with electric vehicles: we 
are in the process of introducing more 
options in our rental fleet to meet our 
long-term ambition of becoming fossil 
free. for example, we aim to introduce 
more electric vehicles. of the 1,330 vehicles 
ordered for 2021, 35 are electric cars and 
250 are hybrids. all new diesel cars can be 
fuelled with hvo100. these zero or low 
emission vehicles will help decrease particle 
emissions, especially in city areas with lots 
of traffic.

case study: joined forces  
to fight covid-19
–
as a major industry operator in sweden and denmark, the com-
pany has an important part to play in society. okq8 conducts 
vital societal operations by ensuring access to fuel around the 
clock all year-round. our service stations also act as meeting 
places and package delivery centres and provide the opportunity 
for a much-needed break, something to eat and drink and the 
chance to make important purchases when all the other stores 
are closed. in the event of a short or long-term crisis, the impor-
tance of continuing operations becomes especially evident. with 
a tried-and-tested infrastructure of just over 1,020 (749 in swe-
den, 271 in denmark) service stations and around ten depots, 
okq8 is well equipped for the transition to fossil independence 
currently taking place, or for a crisis such as the pandemic hitting 
the world in 2020.   
covid-19 quickly changed prerequisites for the whole of 
society, resulting in entirely new challenges and demands. a 
great proportion of the population, the most vulnerable groups, 
were no longer able to move freely or make everyday purchases 
as before. 
because especially exposed health care workers needed 
protection from infection on the way to and from work, okq8, 
hertz and volvo car mobility among others, decided to aid the 
we fight covid initiative. these companies contributed with 
200 cars to health care professionals who lacked access to a car, 
to enable them to travel to and from their workplaces without 
risking exposure to covid-19 on public transport. 
the church of sweden was also heavily involved in fighting 
covid-19 and okq8 contributed with a number of cars to make 
sure elderly people and people in risk groups could receive visits 
and deliveries of supplies, food and medicines. 
as the disease spread and more and more people required 
hospital care, the lack of medical supplies became widespread, 
and the need for hand sanitizer grew dramatically. infrastructure 
and the ability to adapt quickly became crucial when the okq8 
depot in Århus made one of its tanks available for ethanol to 
safeguard the supply of hand sanitizer to the healthcare. 
48     okq8 sustainability report 2020/21
every year, 8,000 vessels deliver 10 mil-
lion tonnes of cargo to the port of Århus, 
denmark’s biggest container port. some of 
this cargo is pure ethanol, which is used as a 
renewable additive in the petrol sold as e10 
in denmark. because the extraordinary situ-
ation created by covid-19 led to a significant 
lack of hand sanitizer, okq8 and the industry 
joined forces to see if we could do something 
together. 
higher purity standards apply when 
ethanol is used as hand sanitizer instead of 
a petrol additive. accordingly, every one of 
the fuel companies investigated which of 
their ethanol shipments were on their way to 
denmark and what quality each respective 
delivery could guarantee, so that it also met 
the requirements for use as hand sanitizer.
the solution was a collaboration between 
circle k, which had a ship on its way to Århus 
with ethanol that met the requirements, 
and q8, which could convert and adapt the 
depot in the port of Århus to receive ethanol. 
the result was 300,000 litres of pure ethanol 
that could be handed over to the healthcare 
system to produce hand sanitizer.
the collaboration between the industry 
operators and their ability to quickly adapt 
was a solution to a critical problem that could 
have had major consequences for danish 
healthcare.

compliance and reporting
–
quality assurance of  
sustainability reporting 
this sustainability report covers the financial 
year 1 march 2020 to 28 february 2021, and 
is the okq8 ab group’s eight joint sustain-
ability report. 
the report has been drawn up in accor-
dance with the standards of the global 
reporting initiative (gri) at ‘core’ level. 
the report has been audited by an external 
auditor who expressed the view that the 
report complied with the identified gri 
areas. to determine the scope of the report, 
we started with our value chain and included 
the areas which we consider to be relevant for 
us. accordingly, we evaluated which gri indi-
cators we intended to highlight in the report. 
a fundamental materiality analysis has also 
been carried out, in which the views of both 
internal experts and selected stakeholders 
have been included with the aim of ensuring 
that our sustainability efforts are relevant and 
effective. all the data included in the report 
comes from various internal and external 
computer systems. 
the sustainability report has been written 
in compliance with the danish and swedish 
annual accounts acts. the okq8 group 
trades on its own account as well as through 
subsidiaries in denmark and sweden. the 
group also, through a partnership agreement, 
has retail operations in ok detaljhandel ab, 
which is, in turn, owned by ok ekonomisk 
förening. these jointly constitute, and are 
referred to as, okq8 scandinavia. where 
ok detaljhandel ab is not included in the 
sustainability report, this is explained either 
in the text or in a footnote. 
environmental data 
reported data in respect of the environ-
ment covers all of okq8 scandinavia’s own 
activities. environmental data also includes 
our distributors, who transport our products 
to our customers and service stations. on the 
other hand, our reporting does not include 
stations which are operated on a franchise 
basis. the environmental data includes our 
energy consumption and our emissions of 
greenhouse gases (co2e), which have a 
substantial impact on the environment. our 
energy consumption is based primarily on 
data from our energy suppliers. our environ-
mental work also supports our iso 14001 
certified environmental management system 
in identifying and planning environmental 
improvements.
system support for  
environmental reporting 
for reporting co2e, a web-based system, 
cemasys, was used, which is based on the 
greenhouse gas protocol standard. the 
system is based on conversion factors which 
are recognised in both denmark and sweden. 
this means that we can ensure a high level of 
confidence in our data, since the conversion 
factors are automatically updated by the 
system owner. 
reporting on the work environment 
the data reported in respect of the work 
environment covers all of okq8 scandinavia’s 
own activities and staff. the data reported 
also includes staff at service stations oper-
ated on a franchise basis under our brand. 
our distributors, who transport our products 
to customers and service stations are also 
included in this report. 
social and financial data 
the data reported in respect of social and 
financial aspects cover all of okq8 scandina-
via’s own activities and staff.

auditor’s limited assurance 
report on okq8 scandina-
via sustainability report 
–
introduction
we have been engaged by the board of 
directors and the chief executive officer of 
ok-q8 ab to undertake a limited assurance 
engagement of okq8 scandinavia’s (as the 
organization is defined of page 10) sustain-
ability report for the year 2020/2021.
responsibilities of the board of directors 
and the chief executive officer for okq8 
scandinavia’s sustainability report
the board of directors and the chief execu-
tive officer are responsible for the preparation 
of the sustainability report in accordance 
with applicable criteria, as explained on page 
50 in the sustainability report, that are part 
of the sustainability reporting guidelines 
published by gri (the global reporting 
initiative), that are applicable to the sustain-
ability report, as well as the accounting and 
calculation principles that the company has 
developed. this responsibility also includes 
the internal control relevant to the prepa-
ration of a sustainability report that is free 
from material misstatements, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
the sustainability report based on the limited 
assurance procedures we have performed. 
our assignment is limited to the historical 
information that is presented and does not 
cover future-oriented information.
we conducted our limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with isae 3000 
assurance engagements other than audits 
or reviews of historical financial information. 
a limited assurance engagement consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of persons respon-
sible for the preparation of the sustainability 
report, and applying analytical and other 
limited assurance procedures. a limited assur-
ance engagement is different and substan-
tially less in scope than an audit conducted 
in accordance with international standards 
on auditing and generally accepted auditing 
standards in sweden. 
the firm applies isqc 1 (international 
standard on quality control) and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
we are independent of okq8 scandinavia 
in accordance with professional ethics for 
accountants in sweden and have otherwise 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accor-
dance with these requirements.
the limited assurance procedures per-
formed do not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. 
the conclusion based on a limited assurance 
engagement does not provide the same level 
of assurance as a conclusion based on an 
audit.
our procedures are based on the criteria 
defined by the board of directors and the 
chief executive officer as described above. 
we consider these criteria suitable for the 
preparation of the sustainability report. 
we believe that the evidence obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our conclusions below. 
conclusions
based on the limited assurance proce-
dures performed, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the 
sustainability report is not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the cri-
teria defined by the executive management 
and chief executive officer.
