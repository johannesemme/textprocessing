introduction 
5 
 
coloplast is a purpose-driven company. 
for more than six decades, we have 
worked to make life easier for people 
with intimate healthcare needs. today, 
we help more than two million – and 
aspire to help even more in the years to 
come. last year, we launched our 
strive25 strategy with a clear priority to 
run our company in a more sustainable 
way. we want to improve our products 
and packaging and reduce emissions 
while improving how we operate 
responsibly. although there is still more 
work to do, i believe we are showing 
good progress across all three areas. 
here are a few highlights. 
 
improving products and 
packaging 
plastic waste is a challenge in our 
society and coloplast is committed to 
being part of finding sustainable 
solutions. our priority is to bring more 
renewable materials into our products 
and packaging and increase 
recyclability, as well as working on our 
product design to minimise our impact. 
 
as there are strict limitations on our 
products, there are more possibilities 
when it comes to packaging. in 
2020/21, we have focused on primary 
packaging and initiated a project to 
convert virgin pet plastic trays to 
recycled pet plastic trays in ostomy 
baseplates and protective seals within 
our supporting products portfolio.  
 
during 2020/21, we exceeded our 
waste recycling target of 50% by 2025 
due to a new partnership in hungary, 
enabling us to recycle our production 
waste into materials used for flooring in 
playgrounds and sports fields. 
consequently, we now recycle 58% of 
our production waste. the partnership 
shows the potential in seeking new and 
different ways of operating, and we will 
continue to pursue options like these to 
accelerate the agenda even further. 
therefore, we have set a new waste 
recycling target of 75% by 2025. 
 
reducing emissions 
reducing emissions is another priority to 
coloplast. the latest ippc report 
underlined the need for action to fight 
climate change and limit the global 
temperature increase to 1.5°c as listed 
in the paris agreement. our ambition is 
to become net-zero in scope 1 & 2 and 
use 100% renewable energy by 2025. 
in 2020/21, we have been in dialogue 
with renewable energy suppliers and 
initiated a project to install solar panels 
on the roof of our site in the us. our 
new site in costa rica already uses 
100% renewable electricity. this year, 
we submitted our net-zero scope 1 & 2 
target and scope 3 target of 50% 
emissions reduced per product by 2030 
to the science-based targets initiative 
for validation. these are ambitious 
targets, and we can only succeed if we 
work together with our suppliers and 
partners. i am optimistic and look 
forward to the challenge. 
 
ensuring responsible 
operations  
ensuring responsible operations is key to 
running a successful company. we strive 
to improve how we operate, and this is 
tied to our company values, respect and 
responsibility. this year, we signed the 
confederation of danish industry’s 
 
 
gender diversity pledge, committing 
our global company to increase diversity 
in our senior leadership, as we believe 
that diversity leads to different 
perspectives, more nuanced discussions, 
and ultimately better results.  
i encourage you to read on and learn 
more about our sustainability efforts in 
2020/21 – and i hereby confirm our 
commitment to the ten principles of the 
un global compact as well as our 
support to the un sustainable 
development goals.

business model 
coloplast develops and markets 
products and services that make life 
easier for people with private and 
personal medical conditions within 
ostomy care, continence care, wound 
& skin care and interventional urology.  
 
coloplast employs more than 12,500 
people and operates globally with sales 
subsidiaries in more than 40 countries. 
the company has production sites in 
denmark, hungary, the united states, 
china, costa rica and france.  
 
risks 
coloplast is mindful of the risks posed 
towards society such as, but not limited 
to, labour and human rights in our direct 
operations and in our supply chain, 
fraud among distributors and 
environmental & climate change strains 
from our production. coloplast has 
policies in place for relevant risks on 
these four topics, which are addressed 
throughout this report. the policies are 
published along with this report on 
coloplast.com.  
 
tcfd commitment 
in 2020/21, coloplast committed to 
report step-by-step according to the 
recommendations of the task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures 
(tcfd). the governance of the climate-
related risks and opportunities is 
evaluated by the executive leadership 
team and the board of directors. 
 
coloplast signed the business ambition 
for 1.5˚c pledging to ensure alignment 
with the paris agreement and setting 
targets for 1.5˚c science-based 
emission reduction for scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions. our aim is to become net- 
zero in scope 1 & 2 by 2025 and reduce 
scope 3 emissions per product with 50% 
by 2030. these targets have been 
submitted to the science-based targets 
initiative (sbti) for validation.  
 
going forward, climate-related risks and 
opportunities will be aligned with the 
business, strategy, and financial 
planning based on scenario analysis 
which will be included in the reporting 
and climate-related criteria in 
remuneration for executive 
management will be implemented from 
2021/22. 
 
climate change risks 
and opportunities  
as an outcome of the corporate 
strategy, strive25, coloplast established 
an internal working group to implement 
the recommendations of the tcfd and 
integrated it within the existing 
enterprise risk management 
framework. 
 
as formulated by the tcfd, the industry 
which coloplast is in, is not considered 
to have high exposure to climate 
change risks. however, the preliminary 
risk assessment performed by the 
working group revealed potential long-
term exposures to both physical and 
transitional risks within our supply chain 
and manufacturing.  
 
based on the preliminary climate risk 
assessment, physical risks such as rising 
sea water levels at coloplast facilities 
and extreme weather patterns affecting 
supply chains were identified. 
the transition from a linear economy to 
a circular economy business model 
represents a range of risks to coloplast. 
transitional risks such as the demand 
for more sustainable products and 
packaging and further legal 
requirements with focus on 
environmental, social and governance 
(esg) for supply chain were also 
identified.  
 
one of the main transitional risks is the 
potential development in climate-
related policy and regulation. future 
policy actions, both at a national and eu 
level, may seek to either constrain 
actions which contribute to the adverse 
effects of climate change or promote 
adaptation. examples include the 
implementation of a carbon tax, 
tightening of energy efficiency 
standards or extended producer 
responsibility. the implementation of 
such initiatives represents a risk to 
coloplast, which calls for adaptation. 
also, regulatory developments that 
include new disclosure or reporting 
requirements to address climate-related 
issues represent a transitional risk, to 
which coloplast must stay compliant as 
well as competitive.  
 
however, the transition to a circular 
economy-based business model also 
represents several opportunities for 
coloplast. the strive25 strategy and 
sustainability ambitions enable us to 
focus on investing in and utilising new 
technology to transition our innovation 
and enabling us to continue making lives 
easier for people with intimate health 
care needs. improving products and 
packaging as well as reducing emissions 
are two areas in which coloplast can 
contribute to a circular economy.

business model and risks 
 
coloplast’s mission is to make life easier 
for people with intimate healthcare 
needs. with our ambitious commitment 
to sustainability, we want to make 
sustainability easier for our users - they 
do not choose their conditions and they 
should never be concerned about using 
coloplast products in any way. coloplast 
has been signatory to the un global 
compact since 2002, and the ten 
principles in the global compact is part 
of our foundation and way of doing 
business. coloplast also contributes to 
sustainable development and the 17 un 
sustainable development goals (sdg’s).  
 
sustainability is 
anchored at the top  
 
to ensure that we deliver on our 
sustainability ambitions, we have 
ensured the right organisational 
anchoring. the sustainability steering 
committee is governed by the executive 
leadership team, to ensure progress on 
the strategy. the sustainability steering 
committee cover aspects such as 
sustainability risks, opportunities, as well 
as recommendations for further 
improvements. the steering committee 
convenes four times a year.  
 
the sustainability department is 
responsible for embedding the strategy 
in the organisation as well as identifying 
further strategic opportunities. the 
sustainability department is placed 
within global quality and regulatory 
affairs; a department that is involved 
with the decision-making around 
coloplast products throughout the 
value-chain.  
 
within the strive25 period, coloplast is

improving products and packaging 
as a manufacturer of medical products 
made primarily of plastic, coloplast 
embraces the responsibility to 
contribute to solving the problems with 
plastic waste and wants to support the 
un sustainable development goals 
(sdgs) 12 on responsible production 
and consumption. however, within 
healthcare there are distinct clinical and 
regulatory limitations to reducing plastic 
waste. 
 
coloplast users are increasingly 
concerned about environmental 
impacts. coloplast incorporates 
environmental performance when 
developing new products, focusing on 
designing our products and packaging 
to be recyclable and made of renewable 
materials (such as recycled or bio-
based) with less environmental impact. 
renewable and 
recyclable packaging 
while there are strict limitations to our 
products and within the medical device 
sector, it takes time to implement 
material changes, thus we see more 
possibilities when it comes to improving 
our packaging. for our products 
currently on the market, we have 
initiated packaging projects with the 
ambition of providing our users with 
90% recyclable packaging and 80% 
packaging consisting of renewable 
materials by 2025. we will report on the 
progress of our change in packaging 
projects once we have launched a 
successful pilot ready to for full scale 
production.  
our secondary and tertiary packaging 
material, such as retail and shipper 
boxes, already consist of renewable 
materials and are recyclable. most of 
these come from sustainable forestry. 
 
in 2020/21, we have focused our efforts 
on primary packaging, which is part of 
the product. we have carried out 
internal investigations to find recyclable 
solutions for converting multilayer foil 
packaging which helps to hold the saline 
solution in intermittent catheters. we 
also initiated a project to convert virgin 
pet plastic trays to recycled pet plastic 
trays used in ostomy baseplates and 
protective seals within our supporting 
products portfolio.  
 
we will never compromise on product 
safety and clinical performance as well 
as being mindful of the impact any 
change in primary packaging might 
have on user perception. therefore, the 
investigations required a cross-
functional team approach for several 
products and invested in increasing 
internal competencies on renewable 
materials and recyclability.  
 
the medical device sector is heavily 
regulated and developing new relevant 
plastic materials is an industry-wide 
challenge that we cannot solve by 
ourselves. we have investigated 
potential partnerships with suppliers to 
understand the availability of renewable 
materials and other industry actors to 
find solutions and needed infrastructure 
to handle plastic waste and recycling.  
furthermore, we have outlined our 
position on hazardous substances which 
enables us to identify opportunities and 
risks at an early stage and proactively to 
substitute relevant substances if 
needed. 
2025 sustainability strategy 
improving products and packaging  
improving products and packaging  
our position on plastic  
 
as a manufacturer of medical products made of plastic, coloplast has a 
responsibility. we embrace that responsibility and we have clear priorities:  
 
• 
product safety and clinical performance cannot be compromised 
 
• 
single use products are the easiest and safest option for our users  
 
• 
sustainability should be easy for our users   
 
• 
we need to identify new materials and support the development of 
new technologies  
 
• 
partnerships across the industry are essential

improving products and packaging 
sustainability in product 
development 
the primary method used by coloplast 
to address environmental challenges is 
to incorporate eco-design principles 
when developing products. this means:  
 
• 
using less materials per product 
and reducing the amount of waste 
per product  
 
• 
using raw materials with lower 
environmental impact such as 
renewables 
 
• 
avoid hazardous substances 
 
• 
improve product and packaging 
recyclability 
 
• 
minimising the total carbon 
footprint from production and 
distribution 
 
life cycle assessments therefore guide 
coloplast’s environmental efforts, 
covering everything from raw materials 
to waste management, energy 
consumption, disposal and 
transportation of goods.  
 
coloplast has further strengthened the 
governance of eco-design to accelerate 
sustainability in innovation and eco-
design in products and packaging.  
 
coloplast expects to see the effect in 
packaging soon, but the impact on new 
sustainable products on the market will 
not materialise before 3-4 years’ time.  
 
single use is easiest and 
safest  
because most of coloplast’s products 
are contaminated after use, they must 
be disposed of properly due to risk of 
infection. this means that coloplast’s 
products are incinerated or sent to a 
landfill after disposal. however, 
coloplast designs product packaging to 
be recyclable when possible and will run 
campaigns through the coloplast care 
program in local countries to help users 
recycle more and appropriately.  
 
reducing packaging 
coloplast has initiated projects to 
minimise unnecessary packaging to 
switch to renewable materials with less 
environmental impact.  
 
in 2020/21, coloplast piloted a digital 
ostomy notification tool called heylo to 
minimise worry and reduce leakage 
among stoma users. the heylo 
packaging is an example of eliminating 
plastics with a one-material packaging 
concept with fsc™ certified cardboard 
to enable recyclability, effectively 
making it easier for our users to dispose 
of in the same recycling system.  
 
another example of increasing recycled 
materials is the heylo starterkit that has 
a recycled pet plastic tray.

improving products and packaging 
coloplast products are 
safe  
coloplast is mindful when selecting 
materials and substances used in 
products and complies with 
international and local regulations and 
standards, including eu’s chemicals 
legislation, also known as reach, the 
california proposition 65 list and more. 
for many years, coloplast has worked 
on reducing phthalates in our products 
and has ongoing projects to reduce. all 
coloplast products are biocompatible 
and safe for the intended purpose, and 
coloplast adopts a proactive approach 
to ensure that coloplast follows its 
position on substances. coloplast has 
set up a structured monitoring process 
to detect and identify changes in 
regulations, science and technology 
early on. this enables us to identify 
opportunities and risks at an early stage 
and proactively substitute respective 
substances if needed. the results and 
risks are reported biannually to 
coloplast’s substance substitution 
group and feeds into our product 
development and innovation processes.  
 
our substance position  
during 2020/21, coloplast developed a 
position on substances to make our 
commitments clear, set an industry 
example and show transparency. 
coloplast evaluates substances which 
are harmful to users and those harmful 
to the environment. we actively strive to 
reduce the health- and environmental 
impact of our products.  
 
coloplast’s position demands that we 
adhere to the strictest global chemical 
regulatory requirements for substances 
used in our products, which is based on 
stringent laws and scientifically 
established threshold limit values – and 
without compromising safety and 
clinical performance. additionally, 
coloplast proactively seeks to phase out 
or ban particular substances of concern 
before they are subject to legal 
enforcement. coloplast’s substance 
position may therefore go beyond 
legislative compliance and stakeholder 
consultation. decisions to seek 
substitution on substances are based on 
considerations of the level of concern, 
commercial availability, and technical 
feasibility of potential alternatives.  
 
coloplast’s product requirements 
regarding the use of hazardous 
substances are captured in “coloplast’s 
substance requirement list” (csrl). 
the list combines all legal, industry and 
voluntary requirements regarding 
chemical substances used in products 
and primary packaging material. if a 
hazardous substance according to the 
csrl list is identified in coloplast 
products, the substance substitution 
group will review the substance and 
initiate a plan to investigate potential 
alternatives or eliminate the substance. 
 
next year, we will increase focus on 
hazardous substances in production 
processes and packaging. 
phasing out hazardous substances 
coloplast’s substance position  
 
coloplast is mindful when selecting materials and substances used in 
our products. we commit to and ensure that; 
 
• 
coloplast products are biocompatible and safe for the intended 
purpose 
 
• 
we follow and comply with international and local regulations and 
standards – including reach, the california proposition 65 list, eu 
mdr, fda, the en iso 10993-1:2020 and more  
 
• 
we monitor and track changes in regulations to identify and 
mitigate risks early on. the risks are reported to management on a 
quarterly basis, including escalating to coloplast’s substance 
substitution group which convenes biannually

2025 sustainability strategy 
improving products and packaging 
reducing waste  
coloplast has the ambition to 
continuously reduce the amount of 
production waste generated per 
product. for the fourth year in a row, 
coloplast has reduced waste generated 
per product. the improvements this 
year can be explained by the progress 
from the implementation of new 
production technologies within ostomy 
care and improvements in product 
design. 
 
waste recycling 
during 2020/21, a new pilot project in 
hungary led to a breakthrough in 
coloplast’s waste recycling resulting in 
an impressive 58% of production waste 
being recycled – and exceeding our 
target of 50% in 2025.  
 
the recycled waste is used by a local 
waste handling company in producing 
rubber flooring for sports fields, railway 
systems, riding halls, building insulation, 
and kindergartens. read more about 
the partnership on page 13.  
 
additionally, this year coloplast has 
established a waste recycling 
competence center in hungary in order 
to share best practices and knowledge 
on waste recycling across the sites 
globally. 
 
as coloplast is further committed to 
make improvements, and, as we have 
already achieved our current 2025 goal, 
we have set a new target of increasing 
our recycling rate to 75% by 2025.  
 
in order to achieve the new target of 
75% waste recycling, coloplast is in the 
coming years looking into new recycling 
technologies such as chemcycling and 
dry agglomeration, as well as new 
recycling partnerships.  
 
in 2020/21, we have initiated dialogue 
for applied research partnerships on 
advancing recycling technologies for 
mixed plastic waste in denmark and 
hungary. 
 
water management 
coloplast uses very limited amounts of 
water for production. water is primarily 
used for sanitation purposes and 
gardening.  
 
in 2020/21, we saw a slight increase in 
water consumption due to return of 
employees after covid-19 compared 
to last year. whenever water is used, 
our focus is to reduce.

improving products and packaging 
 
approximately 80% of coloplast’s 
production waste stems from the largest 
production sites in tatabanya and 
nyírbátor in hungary.  
 
therefore, this was a good place to start 
looking for alternative solutions to waste 
management to deliver on our waste 
ambitions in strive25 and to find a 
partner suitable to use our production 
waste as a resource. 
 
this year, coloplast had a breakthrough 
in waste recycling due to a local

recycling manufacturer.  
 
 
the recycled coloplast waste ends up 
as rubber flooring for sports fields, 
railway systems, riding halls, building 
insulation, and kindergartens. the photo 
below shows the process of coloplast’s 
waste and how it ends up as rubber 
flooring. 
 
from incineration to 
new use 
the search for a suitable partner was 
not an easy process. using an 
innovative waste recycling technology, it 
is possible to use the waste as a molded  
 
component in rubber-based composite 
products.  
 
prior to the partnership, the majority of 
coloplast’s production waste was sent  
to incineration due to the difficulty of 
handling the complex multi-component 
waste in a more sustainable way.  
 
with this partnership, coloplast simplifies 
waste handling at our facilities, avoids 
incineration of valuable materials and 
applies a circularity principle to our 
production.

in the world economic forum’s global 
risks report 2021, the three risks most 
likely to happen are all related to 
climate change: extreme weather, 
climate action failure, and human 
environmental damage. as we look to 
the recent ipcc report, the alarming 
message is clear: climate change is 
accelerating at an unprecedented pace. 
acting now is urgent. 
 
environmental and climate-related 
issues such as climate change and 
natural disasters are material issues for 
coloplast and for our stakeholders. the 
changing climate is a cause of concern 
for our customers and society. there is 
an increasing demand from our 
customers to provide products with a 
lower carbon footprint. additionally, we 
have well informed users dedicated 
towards climate action.  
 
coloplast is committed to running our 
company in a more sustainable way and 
the strong voices from our stakeholders 
only adds to our momentum. therefore, 
as a way of listening and responding, in 
2020/21, we committed ourselves to 
the business ambition for 1.5˚c to 
ensure alignment with the paris 
agreement and have submitted our 
emission reduction targets to the 
science-based targets initiative (sbti) 
for validation.  
 
as a growing company, we are 
challenged with making absolute 
reductions of our emissions. however, 
the situation also represents several 
opportunities.  
 
our ambition is to become net-zero in 
scope 1 & 2 and use 100% renewable 
energy by 2025. we will also challenge 
our behaviour to reduce our emissions 
related to how we travel and ship our 
products. we will reduce business travel 
by 10% compared to 2018/19 levels 
and convert 50% of our company car 
fleet to electric vehicles within the 
strive25 strategy period. we have also 
set targets to reduce our value chain 
emissions and by 2030, coloplast aims 
to have a 50% scope 3 emission 
reduction per product compared to 
base year 2018/19. 
 
during 2020/21, coloplast submitted its 
scope 1, 2 and 3 targets to the science-
based targets initiative for validation.  
in 2020/21, coloplast performed a 
detailed screening of its entire emissions 
across the value chain and updated 
emissions from our base year 2018/19 
onwards. as part of the process, 
coloplast will be including more 
categories in its scope 3 reporting. 
 
coloplast continues to take our 
ambitions beyond our own operations 
and work with our suppliers. both in 
terms of identifying new materials with 
lower environmental impact and by 
collaborating with our suppliers to 
ensure environmentally friendly and 
socially responsible operations. with the 
2025 ambitions, coloplast is committed 
to contribute to climate action as 
expressed by the un sustainable 
development goal 13.

using energy from 
renewable sources 
with the strive25 strategy, coloplast is 
advancing its efforts on renewables. it is 
our ambition that our sites will be 
running on 100% renewable energy by 
2025. our plan is to procure electricity 
from renewable sources and phase out 
the use of natural gas by converting to 
electric heat pumps or by using biogas. 
coloplast has committed to investing 
approximately dkk 100 million in 
capex during the strive25 period to 
achieve this target and going forward, 
climate-related criteria will be part of 
remuneration for executive 
management. this will be implemented 
from 2021/22. 
 
for some years, coloplast has been 
purchasing renewable energy 
certificates for electricity consumption 
at all production sites. electricity 
accounts for more than 60% of total 
energy consumption in production. 
coloplast currently covers 100% of 
electricity use with renewable energy, 
effectively reducing our emissions with 
more than 29,000 tonnes co2e. during 
2020/21, we have investigated 
scenarios for phasing out natural gas at 
our global sites focusing on denmark, 
hungary and us. we are currently 
working with engineering consultants to 
have the technical plans finalised and 
ready for implementation during 
2021/22. based on the technical plans, 
the additional need for electricity at 
each site and/or the option of using 
biogas for heating will be established 
along with the conversion of the heat 
pumps. recently, we initiated the 
installation of an electric heat pump at 
one of our largest sites in nyírbátor in 
hungary. in addition, coloplast will 
replace our renewable energy 
certificates covering electricity use with 
power-purchasing agreements (ppa’s) 
at all global sites that ensures 
additionality by establishing new 
renewable power sources on coloplast’s 
request. in 2020/21, we have been in 
dialogue with renewable energy 
suppliers globally and have initiated a 
project to install solar panels on the roof 
of our minneapolis site in us. our new 
site in costa rica is already using 100% 
renewable electricity from the grid and 
there is a plan to plant trees at the site 
to preserve biodiversity. 
 
improving energy 
efficiency 
coloplast has an ambition to 
continuously reduce energy used per 
product produced. in combination with 
using energy from renewable sources, 
this is an efficient way coloplast can 
reduce climate related impacts from 
production. during 2020/21, coloplast 
has maintained last year’s level of 
energy per product at 0.13 kwh. 
despite opening a new factory this year, 
the energy level is on par due to higher 
efficiency.  
 
electric company cars  
coloplast operates a car fleet consisting 
of around 2,000 cars, which emitted 
11,500 tonnes co2e in 2020/21. to 
reduce its impact, coloplast will shift to 
electric company cars with a target of 
100% by 2030 and 50% by 2025. in 
2020/21, we converted 41 cars to 
electric mainly in israel, denmark and 
uk. we are continuously monitoring the 
maturity of the technology and 
infrastructure to support the use of 
electric cars globally.

business ambition for 
1.5˚c  
in 2020/21, coloplast committed to the 
business ambition for 1.5°c, aligning 
with the paris agreement and have 
submitted our emission reduction 
targets to the science-based targets 
initiative. committing to aligning our 
targets with what is necessary by 
science to meet the paris agreement 
enables coloplast to build an even more 
resilient business and strengthens the 
collaborations with our suppliers. there 
is also an increasing demand from our 
customers to provide products with a 
lower carbon footprint. the impact of 
our products was considered important 
by approximately 70% of our users in a 
survey recently conducted in the uk. 
 
during 2020/21, coloplast performed a 
detailed emission screening to map all 
coloplast activities across the value 
chain as part of our target submission 
process to the science-based targets 
initiative. by 2030, coloplast aims to 
have a 50% scope 3 emission reduction 
per product compared to base year 
2018/19. in 2020/21, coloplast reduced 
scope 3 emissions by 10% per product. 
this was because we used less air 
freight for transportation of goods and 
due to covid-19, our business travel 
was reduced significantly. 
 
to improve transparency and build on 
our reporting, in addition to the 
previously reported scope 3 categories, 
coloplast has this year included 
sterilisation, energy-related emissions 
and distribution of our products in the 
reporting. coloplast has focused on the 
most significant sources of emissions 
with high data quality and will report 
additional sources of emissions as the 
data quality improves. to ensure better 
controls of the data reported in scope 3, 
coloplast has developed strict control 
procedures for emissions being 
externally reported. we expect to 
expand the scope of the limited 
assurance of our data going forward. 
 
reducing scope 3 
emissions  
out of the total scope 3 emissions, 67% 
of coloplast’s scope 3 emissions are 
from raw materials. therefore, in 
2020/21, coloplast initiated an 
engagement with 50 of its raw material 
suppliers responsible for 70% of the raw 
material emissions to start a dialogue 
about identifying materials with a lower 
environmental footprint and to get more 
detailed emission data from the 
suppliers. 
 
the engagement with our raw material 
suppliers is among the first activities we 
have commenced as part of coloplast’s 
supplier sustainability program. we 
launched this program in 2020/21 and 
will continue to increase our 
engagement with direct and indirect 
suppliers across the value chain to 
reduce our scope 3 emissions. we have 
identified key areas of improvement 
with specific actions within raw 
materials, production, transportation of 
goods and business travel to drive our 
emissions reduction. along with this, a 
data improvement plan has been 
developed to continuously increase the 
data collected from our value chain 
partners, refine the calculations and 
update the methodologies used.  
 
furthermore, coloplast’s supplier 
sustainability program will launch a pilot  
next year, including 150 suppliers with 
scope 3 – reducing product footprint

the highest environmental or social risk 
exposure for further assessment, to 
establish a baseline for future criteria 
and a 2025 target. there is a need for 
improving our emissions data from our 
raw materials, and a close collaboration 
with our suppliers is needed to reach 
our target of reducing our scope 3 
emissions. 
 
all employees at coloplast are also 
committed to making their contribution 
to climate action, considering we are all 
consumers. for example, we have 
started to use paper infills and paper 
tape for our recyclable shipper boxes at 
some of our sites. we have also 
launched a car pooling and bike to work 
concept in denmark as well as bus 
services for our employees across 
different sites. in 2021/22, our plan is to 
build on this internal engagement and 
share best practices to contribute to our 
emission reduction targets. 
 
transportation of goods  
transportation of goods, both upstream 
and downstream, accounted for 
approximately 14% of coloplast’s total 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2020/21. 
with coloplast’s growth rates, 
transportation needs will increase going 
forward and, consequently, total 
greenhouse gas emissions from 
transportation of goods will also 
increase. coloplast mitigates emissions 
from transportation of goods by 
substituting air with sea and ground 
transportation, as air transportation 
emits up to 100 times more co2e 
compared to sea freight. 
 
in 2020/21, items were shipped from 
our production site in hungary to china 
using rail transport. transportation and 
distribution were optimised further, 
keeping emission reduction in mind by 
focusing on container height 
optimisation in china. furthermore, a 
pilot for distribution by road between 
denmark to germany was initiated and 
additional rules have been put in place 
for larger deliveries by air freight. all 
these actions have contributed 
significantly to reducing goods 
transported by air.  
 
coloplast users are often very 
dependent on receiving a stable and 
adequate supply of products. in case of 
any extraordinary events in the supply 
chain, coloplast will prioritise users’ 
needs for products and, if needed, ship 
products by air to ensure that products 
reach users in time.  
 
in accordance with the strive25 
ambitions, coloplast will limit the use of 
air freight to 5% of total shipped miles.  
 
reducing business 
travels 
despite growing across all geographies, 
coloplast wants to reduce emissions 
from company air travels by 10% 
compared to 2018/19-levels and then 
freeze. coloplast will limit the number of 
business trips, while promoting emission 
efficient choices when travelling. 
coloplast will also strengthen digital 
meeting possibilities and working from 
home capacities in the organisation. 
 
as covid-19 continued during 
2020/21, the emissions from air travel 
have been reduced by 81% compared 
to 2018/19 levels. however, once the 
situation normalises, coloplast remains 
committed to reducing business travel.

responsible supply 
chain management 
coloplast is committed to drive a 
responsible social and environmental 
development, respecting human rights 
and driving a positive impact in the 
countries we operate in. to run an 
ethical and transparent business, we 
want to cooperate with our more than 
12,000 direct and indirect suppliers and 
business partners.  
 
screening new suppliers 
through standardised auditing in the 
approval process for new raw material 
suppliers, coloplast ensures that the ten 
principles of the un global compact are 
integrated into procurement decisions. 
for all new raw material suppliers, 
coloplast explains its standards on 
human rights, labour, environment and 
anti-corruption outlined in the supplier 
code of conduct. in high-risk countries, 
all raw material suppliers are audited by 
an external partner according to local 
regulations, coloplast’s supplier code of 
conduct and the un global compact. 
 
if an issue is identified, coloplast and the 
supplier must agree on necessary 
improvements in a corrective action 
plan. coloplast prefers to work with 
suppliers to improve standards rather 
than eliminating the contract.  
through the approval process, 
coloplast maps relevant risks and 
ensures to engage with suppliers to 
improve local conditions if necessary. 
coloplast has audited all new suppliers 
based in high-risk countries.  
monitoring suppliers 
coloplast annually monitors social and 
environmental risks on approved 
suppliers. all high-risk suppliers must be 
evaluated at least every third year by an 
external partner. the evaluation is 
based on the severity of findings, the 
supplier’s response to the corrective-
action plan and when the initial 
assessment was performed. here, 
coloplast will select suppliers to be re-
approved. this year, coloplast 
conducted two audits but was not able 
to visit all suppliers within scope due to 
covid-19.  
 
supplier sustainability 
program  
during 2020/21, coloplast developed a 
new supplier sustainability program to 
map its supply chain impact within direct 
and indirect suppliers and prepare for 
the eu due diligence act. the act will 
require companies to understand 
human rights-, environmental- and 
ethical risks throughout the value chain. 
the program will include an evaluation 
of suppliers’ sustainability practices, and 
supplier prioritisation will depend on the 
supplier’s nature of business.  
 
this year, coloplast developed a 
materiality assessment to identify which 
suppliers are exposed to sustainability 
risks, e.g. violating human rights, 
environmental risks and more. in 
2021/22, we will initiate a pilot to verify 
the assessment and evaluation process 
to establish a baseline for our supplier 
requirements and set a 2025 target.  
by 2025, coloplast aims to address 
100% of our direct and indirect 
suppliers in tier one through the supplier 
sustainability program. 
supplier sustainability program

being responsible is our 
core value 
coloplast is committed to run an ethical, 
transparent and responsible business. 
this is tied to our company values, 
respect and responsibility.  
 
within the strive25 corporate strategy, 
we have listed ongoing commitments, 
which we upheld ourselves to deliver on. 
this is simply something, we never 
compromise on. 
 
this section covers all the commitments 
we have made to ourselves within 
raising the standards of care; product 
quality; employee health and safety; 
business ethics and compliance; people 
and culture and inclusion and diversity. 
 
raising the standards of care describes 
coloplast’s efforts to help more people 
with intimate healthcare needs globally. 
since the beginning in 2007, the 
program has supported more than 70 
projects worldwide.  
 
as a company making medical devices 
for users it is key that product quality is 
upheld. we never compromise on 
clinical performance or user safety.  
 
ensuring a safety culture among our 
employees is vital for keeping our 
employees safe on the job. therefore, 
we track and monitor the development 
and have ambitions to ensure we 
reduce injuries.  
 
being a global business and operating in 
multiple legal environments, we ensure 
to train our employees in our code of 
conduct, to have policies and processes 
in place to run an ethical business and 
that we have the right channels to 
report any potential misconduct. 
 
lastly, our employees make out the 
special coloplast spirit, culture and 
without them, coloplast would not be 
coloplast. this is also reflected in our 
leadership promise which builds on our 
existing strong purpose-driven company 
culture: we aim high, we simplify, we 
empower, and we are inclusive. 
 
we ensure that our employees are 
being treated fairly, equally and ensure 
that we have a motivated workforce 
which reflects the society we are part of.

the majority of patients which coloplast 
serves have chronic conditions that, in 
most cases, need to be managed 
permanently. 
 
coloplast is focused on raising the 
standards of care through advocating 
for establishing reimbursement, which 
will ensure patients have access to the 
products they need, for as long as they 
need them.  
 
as market leader, coloplast is fully 
committed to drive and improve 
sustainable access to better treatments, 
technologies, product categories and 
training that are benefiting user needs – 
which goes beyond choice of brand. 
 
coloplast additionally runs training 
seminars to ensure the best care for our 
users through the coloplast care 
program. through this, we have 
supported more than two million users 
in more than 30 countries. to ensure 
safe and proper application, the patients 
are trained in how to use the product by 
a healthcare professional. 
 
therefore, coloplast provides education 
and training for healthcare professionals 
through our educational collaboration 
platform, coloplast professional. here, 
we provide input from local clinicians, 
insights obtained from coloplast care to 
improve local support and support 
through coloplast care advisors to find 
the optimal user solution.  
 
clinical performance 
program  
our user’s face many challenges such as 
leakage, skin irritation and urinary tract 
infections. to respond to our user’s care 
needs, coloplast has developed a 
clinical performance program to tackle 
the biggest issues users face making  
progress on key technologies and 
running clinical trials to document the 
outcomes and benefits to users, society 
and payers. 
 
access to healthcare  
through coloplast’s corporate 
partnership programme, access to 
healthcare, coloplast is committed to 
improving conditions for people who 
need care in the areas of ostomy, 
continence and wound care. established 
in 2007, the programme has so far 
supported more than 70 projects in 
approximately 20 countries. the 
programme is part of coloplast’s 
continued efforts to raise the standard 
of care.  
during 2020/21, coloplast has provided

  case study - raising the standard of care for people in japan living with incontinence  
 
for the past four years, the japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare (mhlw) has made significant steps to raise the 
standard of continence care. in 2016, as a result of a project with the mhlw, health care professionals and local patients’ 
associations, the mhlw improved conditions for incontinence (ic) patients. data from the project demonstrated high health 
economic efficiency, which paved the way for the introduction of a reimbursed category for hydrophilic coated intermittent 
catheters, enabling more people with urinary retention problems and bladder management needs to live a full, dignified life. 
thus, the standard of care was raised in japan. japan generally has an advanced and modern healthcare system, but the 
development introduced a more modern treatment. 
 
building on the initial project, in 2018 the mhlw additionally introduced a new trans-anal irrigation category (tai), providing 
bowel management users access to receive better treatment as well. in 2020, the japanese authorities made further 
improvements. previously, users have had to visit their prescribing doctor every month to renew and get products, which – 
taking some of the patients' conditions into consideration – has been demanding. now they can opt to visit every three 
months, which improves quality of life. the mhlw also further increased funding for both intermittent catheters and tai. 
this allows health care professionals to prescribe the best possible continence treatment. the higher standard of care and 
improved reimbursement program for ic and bowel management in japan took effect on april 1st, 2020.

assessing the impact of our products on 
our users. quality of life is measured 
using standard quality of life tools in 
our clinical studies, which enables 
coloplast to get important feedback and 
improve our products. 
 
raising the standards of care 
 case study - breakthrough in improving the standard of care for many children and adults in poland 
 
as global market leader, coloplast has through the access to healthcare program supported awareness in poland 
around the advantages that patients experience when hydrophilic intermittent catheters are the proper standard of 
treatment for people with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. up until today, the standard of care has been uncoated 
catheters, a treatment standard that is associated with increased urinary tract infections and other medical 
complications compared to hydrophilic catheters, which eventually translate into a lower quality of life for users. 
although many urologists and patients were aware of the benefits of hydrophilic catheters, the lack of appropriate 
reimbursement was the key hurdle to improving the standard of care. 
 
coloplast has advocated for improved reimbursement alongside other stakeholders including pediatric urologists, 
healthcare system experts, patient groups, and other stakeholders. as a result of solid clinical evidence and a series of 
public consultations the ministry of health recently decided to introduce significantly improved reimbursement for 
hydrophilic catheters for children and adults in need of bladder management – a significant improvement that will 
enable more people to live a full, dignified life. the improved reimbursement scheme takes effect as of december 1st, 
2021. to support a successful transition to the new standard of care, coloplast will focus on training healthcare 
professionals on the correct use of hydrophilic catheters. coloplast will also place great emphasis on educating and 
supporting users through the coloplast care program. we are confident that the enhanced reimbursement will lead to 
improved patient outcomes to the benefit of users and the polish healthcare system.

quality standards 
it is essential to coloplast’s mission to 
deliver safe and reliable products. that 
is why coloplast has a unified global 
quality management system with 
established uniform global processes to 
manage quality and risks throughout 
product development, production, and 
distribution as well as extensive post-
market surveillance. 
 
all customer feedback, complaints and 
adverse events are handled on an 
individual basis, identifying the root 
cause, and generating input for 
mitigations, product improvements as 
well as future product development. 
 
as part of a regulated industry, 
coloplast’s products and quality 
management system live up to strict 
regulatory standards established by 
authorities worldwide such as the fda, 
japanese ministry of health, the 
international standardization 
organization, and the european 
commission. compliance to these 
standards is verified on site through 
external audits by independent auditors 
and notified bodies. 
 
all coloplast sites involved in design, 
production, packaging and central 
distribution are certified according to 
one or more of the following standards 
and regulations: iso9001, iso13485, 
mdsap, eu mdd. in 2020/21, coloplast 
had 110 full day audits on quality and 
system conformity.  
 
medical device regulation 
the european commission has issued 
completely new and highly increased  
requirements to the medical device  
 
industry as laid down in the medical 
device regulation (mdr). since this new 
regulation was published, coloplast has 
revised and updated every aspect of the 
quality management system and is in 
process of revising all relevant product 
documentation. the quality 
management system and all class i non-
sterile products had to be compliant by 
26 may 2021. products with higher risk 
classes need to be mdr-certified before 
26 may 2024 and coloplast has 
obtained mdr-certificate for the first 
products. 
 
product recalls 
if customer feedback or internal 
controls reveal that already distributed 
products have quality defects with a 
potential risk of safety, coloplast will 
initiate a voluntary product recall to 
remove the products from the supply 
chain as well as the market. coloplast 
had 4 voluntary product recalls during 
the financial year 2020/21:

the mdl was formally closed on 
december 18, 2020, and an estimated 
98% of the mdl cases have been 
settled. the regulatory landscape for 
surgical mesh products has transformed 
consequently. in 2016, the u.s. fda 
reclassified transvaginal pelvic organ 
prolapse mesh products from class ii to 
class iii. the class ii classification of 
stress urinary incontinence meshes did 
not change.  
 
in 2019, the fda determined that all 
transvaginal synthetic mesh devices can 
no longer be commercialized in the us. 
coloplast markets alternative solutions 
for the same type of products including 
tissue  
products as well as alternative 
procedures for pelvic organ prolapse 
coloplast has been committed to work 
closely with the fda and physician 
investigators on 522 clinical studies. we 
also have an increased focus on 
physician education, centers of 
excellence and collaboration with 
implanters, and spent more than 3000 
hours every year on educational events 
for over 300 surgeons who participated 
in coloplast interventional urology 
educational seminars since 2019.  
 
coloplast remains committed to the 
women’s health business. we are 
confident that our medical devices are 
safe and effective when used by a 
qualified surgeon with the appropriate, 
fully consented patient. it is our 
conviction that women and their 
doctors should have a choice often 
referred to ‘gold standard’ therapies to 
successfully treat pelvic organ prolapse 
and stress urinary incontinence. our 
clinical studies continue to reinforce 
clinical decisions and drive adoption of 
the coloplast women’s health portfolio.  
animal testing 
animal testing is a standard method for 
documenting the safety of medical 
devices. by having a precise account of 
the composition of coloplast products, 
animal testing can be avoided. 
however, in some cases animal testing 
is necessary due to legal requirements 
and safety assessments. all animal 
testing used by coloplast are performed 
by good laboratory practice certified 
laboratories. this year, coloplast used 
1,576 animals for testing in relation to 
pre-clinical safety documentation. there 
has been an increase in use of animals 
for testing compared to last year due to 
tests for mdr submission on old devices 
to comply with mdr requirements. 
coloplast does not use transgenic 
animals in testing. read our animal 
testing policy available on

providing a safe and healthy work 
environment for employees is a core 
value for coloplast. safety is 
everybody’s responsibility in coloplast - 
both managers and employees.  
 
reducing occupational 
injury 
the most common injury for both white- 
and blue-collar employees are 
behaviour-based, for instance stumbling 
and falling. coloplast recently 
completed a three-year safe plan to 
strengthen safety culture across all 
production sites, larger distribution 
centres, headquarters as well as 
selected sales subsidiaries.  
 
in 2020/21 a new safeplan (2.0) was 
launched to continue the focus on 
safety behaviours globally along with a 
new five-year target to reduce lti 
frequency to 2.0 ppm by 2025. the 
purpose of safeplan 2.0 is to continue 
changing the mindset by enforcing four 
safety behaviours globally across 
coloplast and at all management layers; 
 
• 
you see it, you own it 
• 
think twice 
• 
dare to care 
• 
stay focused 
 
in addition to reducing injuries, the 
safety culture campaigns have since the 
last five years contributed to more than 
a fourfold increase in the reported near-
miss accidents and safety observations.  
this year, coloplast’s lost-time injury 
frequency was 2.2 ppm, which accounts 
for 51 accidents. this mainly covers 
accidental trips and falls or heavy lifting. 
coloplast has thereby achieved the 
2021 target to reduce the lti frequency 
to 2.8 ppm. this corresponds to more 
than a 50% reduction of the lti-
frequency compared to 2017/18 level. 
the result is based on continued focus 
on safety behaviour at sites and 
distribution centres. the sales 
organisation, who have been working 
from home due to covid-19 reducing 
the risk of injuries, will have increased 
focus on safety from 2021/22.  
 
furthermore, a proactive kpi for 
production sites and larger distribution 
centres has been defined, and local 
targets for this will be set for 2021/22. 
to support the proactive kpi, a new 
reporting tool, coloplast safe app, was 
developed. the implementation has 
started in denmark and hungary, and 
further implementation is planned. in 
2021/22, a safety campaign including 
the new safety behaviour stay focused 
will be launched.  
 
ensuring safety under 
covid-19 
during covid-19, a top priority for 
coloplast has been to keep our 
employees safe while keeping 
production running to serve our 
customers with the products they need. 
global contingency plans and guidelines 
for how to react if an employee has 
been infected, was shared with the 
leaders across all sites. furthermore, 
multiple safety measures have been 
implemented at distribution centres and 
production sites to ensure that 
production and distribution can continue 
in a safe and stable way.  
 
coloplast is proud that leaders as well 
as employees have shown a true safety 
mindset in the state of emergency.

reducing repetitive 
work 
coloplast emphasises an ergonomically 
correct workplace setup whenever 
manual labour is required in production. 
therefore, coloplast systematically 
works to reduce repetitive work and 
reduce the strain from unavoidable 
repetitive work by rotating workstations. 
 
coloplast has developed a system for 
measuring this type of work, which 
enables improvements and track 
progress. since 2008, coloplast has 
more than halved the amount of 
stations considered to require ‘high’ and 
‘very high’ repetitive work. 
iso 45001 
coloplast’s health and safety 
management system is certified 
according to occupational health and 
safety standard, iso 45001. the iso-
certification is a management system 
used to ensure that sites adhere to the 
same rules globally and continuously 
improve their performance.  
 
all produciton sites and selected 
distribution sites are iso 45001-certified 
which means a coverage of 95% of 
coloplast employees in production, 
distribution centres, postponement 
center and coloplast headquarters in 
denmark. our new production site in 
costa rica is expected to be certified 
during 2021/22. 
offering healthy choices 
coloplast performs workplace 
assessments globally, and through the 
coloplast life programme, coloplast 
provides options to make healthy 
choices for employees. for example, 
local activities as trying an electric bike 
or encouraging more movement during 
the workday in a “stand more sit less”-
campaign. to maintain well-being for 
employees during covid-19, local 
activities like daily online exercises were 
arranged. other initiatives include free 
medical screenings and health checks at 
coloplast’s nyírbátor site and free flu 
vaccinations at coloplast uk. in 
denmark, coloplast has a stress policy 
with stress-counselling.

guidance, but it cannot cover all 
circumstances or anticipate every 
situation. when facing a dilemma not 
addressed by a law, industry code, 
coloplast best, or internal policies, 
employees are expected to apply the 
overall principle of integrity presented in 
coloplast best, use their critical 
thinking, and reach out to their 
managers and/or compliance officers to 
seek further guidance. 
 
coloplast is committed to having high 
standards for working with users and 
organisations both in terms of 
respecting the boundary between 
clinical expertise and our own product 
knowledge and when handling personal 
data. in addition to coloplast best, 
employees are expected to live up to all 
applicable legal requirements (e.g. 
national law, federal law or other) and 
the industry codes that coloplast is 
signatory to. all coloplast employees 
are expected to: read and comply with 
coloplast best, ask questions when 
unsure, and report any suspected 
misconduct or violation of coloplast 
best.

regular training on the coloplast best 
is mandatory for all employees and the 
content, format and training plans are 
reviewed on an annual basis. all white-
collar employees must complete the 
coloplast best e-learning within 45 
days of hire and on an annually basis 
thereafter. 
 
in addition to the coloplast best 
training, coloplast continues to expand 
its training activities and develop new 
training to support employees’ 
engagement and understanding, 
especially those in high-risk parts of the 
organisation. examples of other 
education provided throughout the year 
include conflict of interest, raising 
concerns, and data breach reporting. 
additionally, regional and department 
specific in-person training is conducted 
based on the specific and unique needs 
of the region, country, or department. 
 
transparency reporting 
as part of the business ethics & 
compliance program, coloplast has 
controls in place to track transfers of 
value (e.g., consulting payments) to

evolving how we lead 
if you can’t see it, you can’t be it. at the 
heart of delivering on strive25 is our 
people and culture. as a growing 
company, coloplast has expanded the 
total workforce by around 300 during 
2020/21, primarily in the commercial 
organisation. throughout strive25, 
coloplast will continue to expand the 
number of leaders and employees as we 
grow.  
 
the people & culture strategy for 
strive25 revolves around three key 
pillars: evolving how we lead, talent for 
future and inclusion & diversity. 
 
this year, our focus has been on making 
our leadership promise come alive 
through our leaders. all people leaders 
have been introduced to the leadership 
promise and have implemented it 
across the organisation. our leadership 
promise applies to all employees as we 
all take on leadership tasks every day 
within our own areas. therefore, we 
work with leadership across our 
organisation and continue to invest in 
leadership training programs. all our 
senior leaders (vp+), including our 
executive leadership team, are going 
through an extensive leadership 
journey. additionally, we continue to run 
our business leadership program for 
our director level leaders to build 
leadership competencies to create a 
stronger succession and leadership 
pipeline.  
 
to secure strong leadership focus, we 
track progress on two key metrics: 
voluntary employee turnover and 
employee engagement.  
 
employee turnover 
voluntary turnover level in 2020/21 
reached 10.1%, compared to 8.2% in 
2019/20. coloplast has seen a positive 
effect on voluntary turnover rates 
during covid-19 and is still below the 
pre-covid-19 level. 
 
employee engagement

twice a year. results are shared with 
local management who then act on key 
areas to maintain high engagement 
levels. despite covid-19, coloplast still 
sees a highly engaged workforce. 
during 2020/21, the engagement score 
was 8.2 compared to 7.9 in 2019/20, 
with a response rate of 90%. this score 
is above the healthcare industry 
benchmark and places coloplast in the 
top 25th percentile. 
 
flexible working 
covid-19 has had far reaching 
consequences for our daily lives and 
ways of working together. coloplast 
quickly adapted ways of working, 
processes, and digital platforms to a 
home office set-up in the very early 
phases of the pandemic.  
 
we have taken great learning to future 
ways of working, our use of digital 
platforms, and our approach to 
flexibility. as a result, coloplast recently 
launched an updated global position on 
flexible working to stay an attractive, 
inclusive, modern workplace in the 
markets we operate in. 
 
 
 
talent for the future 
attracting and developing talent is a 
core element of ensuring coloplast has 
the best people for the future. we hire 
for careers, which means that we 
mobilise and develop talent to secure 
strong succession for critical managerial 
positions. we develop our employees 
and leaders through strong individual 
development plans and run targeted 
development programs on different 
levels securing a strong leadership 
pipeline. this year, 59% of critical 
managerial positions were filled by 
internal candidates. this is below our 
67% aspiration as we have taken in 
external talent in key leadership 
positions.

it is part of coloplast’s dna to respect 
the individual and secure equal 
opportunities for all. coloplast is 
committed to build an inclusive culture 
that leverages diversity at all levels. we 
therefore have integrated inclusion and 
diversity in all of our people processes 
such as in our global recruitment 
process, head-hunter policy, 
performance evaluation, succession 
planning or people survey. 
 
additionally, this year, we launched our 
new leadership promise where 
inclusion is one element out of four that 
constitutes our promise. all leaders are 
expected to master this as we evolve 
how we lead. 
 
during 2020/21, coloplast signed the 
confederation of danish industry’s 
gender diversity pledge, committing to 
a target of 40/60 gender distribution in 
management and our board of directors 
by 2030. 
 
inclusive workplace 
environment 
coloplast wants every employee to feel 
that they belong in the company, to 
bring their differences to work daily and 
to fulfil their potential because of and 
not despite of their differences. 
coloplast prohibits any kind of 
discrimination or harassment of 
employees due to their gender identity, 
age, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual 
orientation, religious belief, social and 
economic background, physical or 
mental ability etc.  
 
this is formalised in our inclusion & 
diversity policy, anti-harassment and 
anti-discrimination policy as well as the 
anti-retaliation policy which is available 
at coloplast.com. 
 
diverse teams 
we believe that diversity in teams leads 
to better innovation, performance and 
decisions. therefore, we have chosen to 
lead and drive diversity through teams 
and strive to ensure a healthy balance 
of gender, generation and nationality in 
each team. 
 
we track and monitor the mix of 
diversity in all teams from director level 
and above. our ambition is to reach a 
share of 75% diverse teams before 
2025 through natural turnover. in 
2020/21, the share of diverse teams 
was 50%, compared to 51% in 
2019/20. 
 
over the past two years, vps and above 
have made five-year action plans for 
how to create diverse teams within their 
area of responsibility. this year, our 
director level leaders will create plans. 
successful diverse teams only flourish if 
we lead inclusively – we therefore offer 
unconscious bias e-learning to all and 
inclusive leadership training to our 
leaders. 
 
along with this, to ensure racial and 
ethnic equity in its workforce, we 
leverage global training on unconscious 
bias, our job descriptions and adds are 
made neutral followed by standard 
interview guides. in north america, 
apart from hiring a manager of supplier 
diversity, we have launched two 
employee resource groups (erg's) led 
by employees: women’s resource group 
and people of color resource group.

gender representation 
in management 
coloplast continues to track and 
monitor progress on gender 
representation at all levels. during 
2020/21, coloplast signed the 
confederation of danish industry’s 
gender diversity pledge, committing to 
a target of 40/60 gender distribution in 
management and our board of directors 
by 2030. in 2020/21, coloplast had 
46% female managers at or above 
manager level from 43% last year. 
however, looking at senior leadership* 
alone, there is an underrepresentation 
of females. this year, the share of 
female senior leaders is 24%, which is 
the same as last year. 
 
to ensure progress on gender 
representation, as well as diversity, 
coloplast has implemented different 
initiatives including monitoring the 
diversity in our succession pipelines and 
talent pools, a new global recruitment 
process that mitigates biases and 
ensures diversity in all our recruitments 
and engagement in multiple diversity 
related events, boards, and partnerships 
globally. 
 
gender pay gap 
coloplast is committed to equal 
remuneration for equal work. therefore, 
coloplast lets skills and experience 
determine matters related to 
compensation.  
 
in 2020/21, coloplast performed an 
analysis on the gender pay gap across 
senior management levels in the 
organisation. the analysis showed that 
there is equal remuneration between 
female and male leaders with no 
significant pay difference. 
 
gender representation 
among board of 
directors 
coloplast aims for its board of directors 
to consist of the best qualified 
individuals. with 3 out of 6 shareholder-
elected board members being female at 
the end of the financial year, coloplast 
maintains equal gender representation 
among board of directors, in 
compliance with the danish financial 
statements act, section 99b. 
 
employing people with 
disability 
coloplast works to employ people with 
disability globally. this includes ensuring 
reasonable accommodations at sites as 
well as proactively hiring people with 
disability.

ghg emissions  
(part of pwc’s limited assurance report 2020/21) 
 accounting policy 
 
scope 1 and 2: emissions reported cover all coloplast production sites (denmark, hungary, france, us, china and costa 
rica), selected offices (denmark and us) and global distribution centres (germany, hungary and us).  leased company 
cars covers emissions from all leased company cars submitted by local affiliates. emissions are calculated using average 
co2 emission factors timed the average distance travelled per car. to accommodate actual driving patterns, a 
correction factor is used. data on volatile organic compounds (vocs) is based on consumption handled in air cleaning 
systems. data on hydrofluorocarbon (hfc) gasses is obtained from local registrations or invoices. emissions from 
electricity consumption are based on international energy agency (iea) country-specific ghg emission factors. 
emissions from the other consumption categories are based on emission factors from ipcc (hfcs), iea (district heating) 
and the danish energy agency (natural gas). per product and per revenue emission are measured as total emissions 
(scope 1 & 2) in tonnes co2e divided by the total number of coloplast products or revenue in million dkk, respectively.  
 
scope 3: ghg emissions reported are aligned with the green house gas protocol accounting and reporting standard 
and include categories considered material to coloplast. quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of 
different gases.  
 
1. 
purchased goods and services: 
- raw materials: covers all ingoing raw materials registered in coloplast’s primary erp production data 
management system. does not include goods contract manufactured for coloplast, production equipment and 
other capital goods, processing aids and other supporting materials. 
- contract manufacturing: covers ghg emissions from outsourced production, e.g. finished goods produced by 
external suppliers under the coloplast brand. emissions from outsourced production are calculated using 
coloplast's average co2 scope 1 & 2, and emissions resulting from raw materials used. 
2. 
transportation of goods:  
- upstream transportation: based on supplier-provided data which cover all transportation between coloplast sites, 
sterilization sites and distributors in emerging markets. main suppliers with spend above 2%, in total accounting for 
96% of upstream transportation spend, were included in 2020/21.  
3. 
business travels:  
- based on data from coloplast's global travel agents and calculated by using the vdr standard for corporate 
travel. data from global travel agents accounted for 53% of total business air travel costs in 2020/21 and the 
remaining 47% were extrapolated based on the average amount of co2e per spend to ensure completeness of 
data. 
4. 
leased assets (upstream):  
- energy consumption in sales offices, subsidiaries and local/regional warehouses: covers all sales offices, 
subsidiaries and regional warehouses, which primarily are leased. emissions are based on the number of fte's 
working there and is calculated using a conversion factor from the danish energy agency. 
 
all emission data are rounded to the nearest 100.

stakeholder 
engagement 
coloplast’s main stakeholders include 
shareholders, users, clinicians, 
employees, business partners and 
society in general. coloplast has 
ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders 
through different channels and used 
these for the purpose of the materiality 
assessment:  
 
users 
coloplast conducts annual satisfaction 
surveys, which target users in over ten 
countries. furthermore, coloplast 
engages with users when developing 
products and through our support 
programme, coloplast® care, which 
aims to help users by providing needed 
guidance and support.  
 
clinicians 
coloplast works with clinicians on 
advisory boards by engaging in semi-
annual focus group meetings as well as 
facilitating education of healthcare 
professionals.   
 
employees 
coloplast communicates to employees 
daily through the coloplast intranet 
“connect” and holds information 
meetings 4 to 6 times a year that are 
broadcasted globally reaching more 
than 3,000 employees in 2020/21. in 
addition, coloplast conducts global 
engagement surveys bi-annually. 
 
 
 
society 
coloplast has incorporated the un 
sustainable development goals into the 
materiality assessment to reflect the 
world community’s priorities. 
additionally, coloplast works with 
relevant societal organisations through 
the access to healthcare partnership 
programme and maintains a sustained 
dialogue through regular updates on 
healthcare progress and challenges in 
local communities. coloplast also 
engages external stakeholders through 
our public affairs work, where coloplast 
seeks to maintain high standards of 
professionalism and transparency.  
 
shareholders 
the ceo and cfo together with our 
investor relations and sustainability 
departments facilitate dialogue with 
shareholders on a regular basis and host 
capital markets days. for more

materiality  
coloplast’s materiality assessment is 
based on own assessments of topics as 
well external input. for example, more 
than 1,400 users were surveyed.  
 
the material issues chosen are areas 
where coloplast pose a potential risk or 
positive impact towards stakeholders 
and the un sustainable development 
goals.  
 
in 2019/20, the materiality assessment 
was updated with the insights generated 
from the impact assessment conducted 
as the baseline for the strive25 
sustainability strategy as well as the 
work with tcfd. the most significant  
change is the increased importance of 
climate change and sustainable 
materials to coloplast users as well as 
regulators. both were changed from 
‘medium’ to ‘high’ importance.

independent limited assurance report 
 
to the stakeholders of 
coloplast a/s  
we have been engaged by coloplast 
a/s (‘coloplast’) to provide limited 
assurance on selected social and 
environmental data stated on pages 
37-40 and page 42 in the coloplast 
sustainability report for the period 1 
october 2020 to 30 september 2021 
prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies stated on pages 36-
40 and page 42 in the coloplast 
sustainability report 2020/21. 
 
our conclusion 
based on the procedures we performed 
and the evidence we obtained, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the selected social 
and environmental data on pages 37-
40 and page 42 in the coloplast 
sustainability report 2020/21 have not 
been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the accounting 
policies stated on pages 36-40 and 
page 42 in the coloplast sustainability 
report 2020/21. 
 
this conclusion is to be read in the 
context of what we say in the remainder 
of our report.
what we are assuring 
the scope of our work was limited to 
assurance over the selected social and 
environmental data as stated on pages 
37-40 and page 42 in the coloplast 
sustainability report 2020/21, which 
includes: 
 
• 
energy consumption  
• 
water consumption 
• 
waste consumption 
• 
ghg emissions, scope 1, 2 and 
selected scope 3 categories 
• 
share of renewable energy 
• 
lost time incident frequency 
• 
code of conduct training 
• 
ethics hotline cases 
professional standards 
applied and level of 
assurance 
we performed a limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with 
international standard on assurance 
engagements 3000 (revised) 
‘assurance engagements other than 
audits and reviews of historical 
financial information and, in respect of 
the greenhouse gas emissions stated on 
pages 39-40, in accordance with 
international standard on assurance 
engagements 3410 ‘assurance 
engagements on greenhouse gas 
statements’, issued by the international 
auditing and assurance standards 
board’. greenhouse gas quantification 
is subject to inherent uncertainty 
because of incomplete scientific 
knowledge used to determine emissions 
factors and the values needed to 
combine emissions of different gases.  
 
a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment 
procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed 
risks; consequently, the level of 
assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would 
have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been 
performed.

we have complied with the

ethical requirements in the international 
ethics standards board for 
accountants’ international code of

(iesba code), which is founded on 
fundamental principles of integrity,

standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. our work was 
carried out by an independent 
multidisciplinary team with experience in 
sustainability reporting and assurance.
understanding 
reporting and 
measurement 
methodologies 
 
the selected social and environmental 
data needs to be read and understood 
together with the accounting policies on 
pages 36-40 and page 42, which 
management is solely responsible for 
selecting and applying. the absence of 
a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, 
measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between entities and over 
time. 
 
work performed 
we are required to plan and perform 
our work in order to consider the risk of 
material misstatement of the selected 
social and environmental data. in doing 
so and based on our professional 
judgement, we: 
 
• 
conducted interviews with data 
owners to understand the key 
processes and controls for 
measuring, recording, and 
reporting the selected social and 
environmental data; 
• 
performed limited substantive 
testing on a selective basis of the 
selected social and environmental 
data at corporate head office and 
in relation to coloplast’s production 
sites to check whether data has 
been appropriately measured, 
recorded and reported; 
• 
performed analysis of data from 
reporting sites, selected based on 
risk and materiality to coloplast; 
• 
made inquiries to significant 
development in reported data; 
• 
considered the disclosure and 
presentation of the selected social 
and environmental data; 
• 
assessed whether coloplast in 
relation to the reported 
greenhouse gas emissions data has 
complied with the principles of 
relevance, completeness, 
consistency, transparency, and 
accuracy outlined in the 
greenhouse gas protocol; and 
• 
evaluated the evidence obtained.

the coloplast story begins back in 1954. elise 
sørensen is a nurse. her sister thora has just had 
an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out in 
public, fearing that her stoma might leak. listening 
to her sister’s problems, elise conceives the idea of 
the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag. 
 
based on elise’s idea, aage louis-hansen, a civil 
engineer and plastics manufacturer, and his wife 
johanne louis-hansen, a trained nurse, created 
the ostomy bag. a bag that does not leak, giving 
thora – and thousands of people like her – the 
chance to live the life they want.
 
a simple solution that makes a difference.
 
today, our business includes ostomy care, 
continence care, wound & skin care and 
interventional urology. we operate globally  
and employ about 12,500 employees.
