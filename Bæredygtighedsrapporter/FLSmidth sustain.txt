sustainable future for us all 
will require more and better 
infrastructure, better housing, 
increased electrification and more renewable 
energy. due to the increase in urbanisation 
and economic development, we will see 
higher demand for cooling of food, electronics, 
datacentres and buildings. none of which can 
happen without cement and mining. yet, the 
environmental impact from the cement and 
mining industries is substantial and urgently 
needs to move towards zero emissions.
 
missionzero builds on flsmidth’s legacy of 
discovering technology and solutions that 
help our customers produce more with less. 
the vocabulary might have been different, but 
productivity, energy efficiency and operational 
excellence were terms which our business was 
founded on almost 140 years ago. today, we 
have the technology and the competences to 
accelerate the process and drive the mining and 
cement industries towards a more sustainable 
future. in the next 10 years, we need to deliver 
more productivity improvements than in the 
previous 140 years. this is both an ambitious 
target and a huge business opportunity.
we launched flsmidth missionzero in november 
2019, and in 2020 we have seen leading mining 
and cement companies announce their zero- 
emission targets. with many of these targets 
focused around carbon neutrality and minimised 
emissions and footprint by 2050, solutions need 
to be ready by 2030 to facilitate the technology 
shift needed to deliver on these ambitions.
collaboration across the value chain
the launch of missionzero was therefore well 
timed. now we need to increase our dialogue 
with customers, deliver and sell more of our 
flagship offerings and at the same time continue 
to develop new and better technology. we will 
do so by accelerating our r&d efforts towards 
more sustainable solutions and by utilising the 
power of digitalisation to constantly improve 
energy efficiency and enhance best practice. 
we will continue to co-develop technology with 
customers, suppliers, universities and other 
partners. 
reaching the goals of missionzero requires 
collaboration among all stakeholders within our 
industries. and looking back at the first year of 
the programme, we have seen strong interest 
in co-creating solutions from several parties. an 
example of this is our cooperation with vicem, 
the leader in cement production in vietnam, 
to work jointly towards sustainable cement 
production in vietnam.
sustainability is not new to us. it has been 
12 years since we became a signatory to 
the united nations global compact, and we 
continue to support its principles. since the 
introduction of the sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) in 2015, we have taken them into 
account when planning and reporting on our 
work. we are now taking the next step in our 
sustainability efforts by announcing a new set of 
targets for 2030. perhaps the most prominent of 
those will be our forthcoming decarbonisation 
targets which are being developed under the 
science based targets initiative to ensure that 
our activities to reduce emissions meet the 
goals of the paris agreement. ensuring progress 
on these targets and on missionzero will be 
part of the management’s long-term incentive 
programme from 2021 onwards.
maintaining our focus
covid-19 caused economic slowdown, 
particularly in the cement sector. despite all the 
complications, sustainability and missionzero 
remained at the top of the agenda throughout 
the year.
covid-19 has made health and safety an even 
stronger focus point than before. the safety of 
our employees and their families remains our 
top priority, and we made significant efforts 
during the year to safeguard them during the 
pandemic. our safety performance is among the 
very best in our industries, and we continue our 
efforts to maintain the highest standards. 
looking ahead, we are eager to continue 
unfolding missionzero. we already have the 
technology to deliver significant sustainability 
improvements, and we are pushing hard to 
develop the next gamechanger solutions. our 
employees know that we are at the heart of a 
sustainable and low-carbon future, where one 
small discovery leading to a new or modified 
product or solution can have a positive impact 
on the lives of billions. we might be 140 years 
old, but we have never been more relevant.

strategy 
flsmidth continuously strives 
to be the leading supplier of 
sustainable productivity to 
the global mining and cement 
industries. we help our 
customers increase production, 
decrease operating costs and 
reduce their environmental 
footprint. 
to further strengthen our position as sustainable 
productivity provider #1, we have identified five 
key strategic focus areas.
customers 
flsmidth works with customers around the 
world. our customers consist of global majors 
and mid-sized regional players. the latter 
account for a large proportion of our project 
sales, whereas the global majors account for a 
considerable share of our service business. 
sustainability 
our relatively asset-light business model means 
that our in-house environmental footprint is very 
modest compared to that of our customers. a 
large cement producer has a carbon footprint 
about 2,000 times that of flsmidth, and our 
annual water consumption equates to roughly 
two weeks of water consumed by a copper mine 
(100,000 tpy). while we work to minimise our 
in-house footprint, we have a greater impact 
helping our customers reduce their footprints. for 
this reason, we launched missionzero in 2019, 
which is an integral part of our business strategy. 
innovation and digitalisation
our efforts in innovation and digitalisation are 
an important sustainability enabler. greater 
scarcity of resources such as energy, water and 
raw materials leads to more complex and costly 
operations that challenge the performance of 
mining and cement companies. this calls for 
innovation, digitalisation and high-end technical 
solutions, which is where flsmidth has a leading 
position and a competitive edge. 
life cycle approach 
to achieve a sustainable productivity 
improvement, companies need to adopt an end-
to-end process and integrate the whole value 
chain. forces must be activated simultaneously 
from multiple directions to create the kind of 
momentum that leads to sustainable change. 
through a life cycle approach, we enable our 
customers to lower their total cost of ownership.
standardisation 
through value engineering and modularisation, 
we rethink the designs of our products to 
increase reliability and reduce costs and 
complexity without compromising on quality and 
functionality. 
our standardisation programme has yielded 
substantial results. we have, in recent years, 
standardised products such as our vertical 
roller mills, coolers, burners, feeders and 
concentrators, allowing for a higher degree of 
configuration and less customisation.

enabling zero emissions in key industries 
missionzero-related related sdgs 
in early 2021, flsmidth joined the inaugural united nations global compact’s young sdg innovators 
programme, ysipp. two of our up-and-coming talents joined their counterparts from other leading 
companies to develop new sustainable business ideas and strengthen our movement towards reaching the 
un sustainable development goals: www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/young-sdg-innovators
our 2030 
goals and 
targets support 
the sdgs
ccelerated development and 
adoption of these solutions are 
urgently needed as both sectors 
are also playing a crucial role in the transition 
towards a low-carbon society. many solutions 
are already available but more work, often 
in partnership, is needed to ensure the right 
pathway for decarbonisation. our missionzero 
programme is aimed at delivering and 
implementing these solutions in partnership with 
our customers and others inside and outside our 
industry.
 
the goals that underpin the missionzero 
programme are inspired by and contribute 
directly to some of the sdgs, including 
those related to water, affordable and clean 
energy, industry and innovation, responsible 
consumption and climate action.
furthermore, we have set targets specifically 
for our own operations and for our suppliers, 
including targets on gender equality, that are in 
support of specific sdgs.
 
recognising the importance of all 17 sdgs, we 
have prioritised three levels, reflecting:
 
■ the sdgs and specific sdg targets where we 
can play a major role as enabler – and where 
we have main value chain impacts – the 
missionzero-related sdgs and targets
 
■ the sdgs and specific sdg targets where 
we have a high internal and/or supply chain 
focus, through operational sustainability
 
■ the rest of the sdgs where we have less 
impact, with a focus on compliance and 
mitigating negative impacts
as a leading supplier to the mining and cement 
industries, we are in a position to significantly 
contribute to achieving the sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) by delivering sustainability solutions in 
two environmentally intensive industries.

our impact across 
the value chain
as a leading supplier of production facilities, equipment and 
service solutions to the cement and mining industries, we 
have a substantial influence on our value chain. 
we calculate our ghg emissions based on the 
standards of the greenhouse gas protocol, which 
provides a standardised framework to measure 
greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, both for direct 
emissions from our own company and from our entire 
value chain.
 
the ghg protocol includes impacts for a number of 
ghgs, expressed as co2-equivalents (co2e). this 
means they are expressed as the amount of co2 that 
would give the same ghg impact.
 
in short, the ghg protocol divides a company’s value 
chain ghg emissions into three scopes: 
 
1. direct ghg emissions from own facilities and 
vehicles
2. indirect ghg emissions from purchased electricity, 
steam, heating and cooling
3. indirect ghg emissions from the value chain, 
including both upstream emissions (e.g. purchased 
goods and services, upstream transportation and 
distribution, and business travel) and downstream 
emissions (e.g. downstream transportation and 
distribution, use of sold products and end-of-life 
treatment of sold products)
 
the figure below shows all of the scope 3 categories 
that are individually responsible for more than 0.1% of 
our value chain impact, as well as categories chosen for 
illustrative purposes*.
*  generally, calculating ghg impacts from scope 3 depends on a number of estimates and 
assumptions. examples include the expected utilisation and lifetime of sold products, and as 
such scope 3 emissions are subject to more uncertainty than scope 1 and 2 impacts. in 2020, 
we completed a first iteration of our scope 3 ghg impact mapping. in accordance with the 
greenhouse gas protocol, we intend to validate our data as an iterative process ongoingly.

science-based 
targets and how 
they will lead us 
towards zero
n early 2021, we committed to and 
submitted science-based global 
carbon reduction targets which are 
now pending validation by the science based 
targets initiative. having an independent body 
validate our targets reinforces our long-term 
commitment and our determination to reach our 
targets. the systematic approach helps us break 
the main target into tangible, yet ambitious 
steps. 
targets across the value chain
downstream is where we have our largest 
impact. that is why with missionzero, our target 
is to enable our customers to produce cement 
and minerals with zero emissions. 
however, we are including science-based 
targets for the entire value chain.
i
with missionzero, we have a clear ambition to do our part 
in limiting global warming to 1.5°c. fulfilling this ambition 
requires a systematic approach to reducing greenhouse 
gases. we are now setting science-based targets. 
what are science-based targets
science-based targets provide a clearly defined pathway for companies to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. targets are considered science-based if 
they are in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet 
the goals of the 2015 paris agreement. the science based targets initiative 
is a partnership between cdp, the united nations global compact, the world 
resources institute and world wildlife fund (wwf).
at the time of reporting, our targets have been submitted for validation and are 
pending approval from the science based targets initiative.
upstream
we work with our suppliers to move towards 
greenhouse gas emission reductions by 
2030. by 2025, 30% of our suppliers, based 
on spend, need to have set their own targets 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
downstream
our downstream target is a 7% year-on-year 
reduction in carbon emissions per unit of 
revenue from a 2019 baseline until 2030. it 
is calculated as tonnes of co2-equivalents
divided by revenue in dkk. 
by far our largest environmental impact stems 
from the use of our products by our customers. 
own operations
from our own direct emissions, 
we have set a target to reduce our 
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 
to 0 and be carbon-neutral by 2030. those 
emissions stem from our manufacturing 
and transportation, and the energy we 
use in our offices and production.

rfc™ – reflux™ 
flotation cell
the rfc™ is a solution in the flotation area of 
the mining flowsheet that has good potential 
for reducing energy and water use. preliminary 
results from pilot-scale studies indicate that rfc 
technology can help mines use ~20% less energy.
flotation is a key, water-intensive area where 
valuable minerals are separated from other 
materials. rfc has a higher throughput and 
improved separation efficiency compared to 
traditional methods. 
rfc grants:
eit rawmaterials, which is funded by an eu 
body, awarded eur 5.4 million (eur 2.8m to 
flsmidth) to help upscale and commercialise 
the rfc technology.
rfc was part of the project that received a 
2020 horizon grant, enhancing knowledge of 
flotation technology.

advanced optimisation
the new version of our 
process control solution, 
ecs/processexpert® v8.5, 
was launched in 2020. the 
solution aims to cut energy 
use by ~6%, while boosting 
productivity by a similar 
amount.
newly integrated ai cognitive 
technologies provide an understanding of a 
mining process by finding patterns in the raw 
process data. this combined with operator 
knowledge is then used to solve problems that 
help improve performance and sustainability. 
another new feature of pxp v8.5 is a 
range of sustainability dashboards that 
report the system’s performance in terms 
of environmental kpis (key performance 
indicators). with these dashboards, operators 
can see how process improvements, such as 
more efficient use of energy, translate into lower 
co2 emissions.

cement 
enabling low- 
impact cement 
production
our target is to enable cement 
production with close to zero emissions. 
we will achieve this by accelerating 
our sustainability-focused r&d and in 
partnerships with others.
with 7% of global co2 emissions coming 
from cement production, and no substitution 
at scale in sight for concrete that has the 
same versatility and functionality, the world 
is faced with a significant challenge.
at the centre of building our societies, cement plays an 
important social and economic role. continuous urbanisation 
and economic growth only increase the demand for cement. 
our 2030 goal
the emission challenge
a zero-emissions cement plant
7% global co2 emissions
ement is one of the most consumed 
products globally – second only 
to water. and the demand will only 
increase in the future as a consequence of rapid 
urbanisation and growing populations. under 
the international energy agency (iea) reference 
technology scenario (rts2), the industry would 
increase its direct emissions by 4% globally, 
with a corresponding increase of 12% in global 
cement production by 2050.
since 1990, the cement sector has continuously 
improved its efficiency but now needs to 
accelerate its efforts. this need to accelerate 
is reflected in the ambition from the global 
cement and concrete association (gcca) to 
deliver carbon-neutral concrete by 2050.
producing approximately 7% of the world’s co2 
emissions, the sector can significantly contribute 
to the ambition of the paris agreement to limit 
global warming to well below 2°c. 
with limited alternatives to cement that currently 
can reach significant scale, a key focus is to 
accelerate the ongoing sustainable transition 
of the cement industry through innovation in 
low-emission technologies.
as a technology leader, we have always been 
in the business of helping our customers 
produce cement more productively 
and sustainably. and with the launch of 
missionzero, we are accelerating solutions 
to help our cement customers towards the 
zero-emission cement plant.

roducing cement with zero emissions will be possible 
by 2030. that is the promise we are making with 
missionzero. with solutions we already offer today 
and the innovations that we are working on in our r&d centres, 
we have identified ways to reduce net emissions per tonne of 
cement produced by approximately 70% by 2030. furthermore, 
we are establishing partnerships to develop solutions to close 
the remaining 30%. for the 70% reduction to happen, we need 
to increase the rate of adoption of the best available technology. 
this is, however, a complicated matter for cement producers as it 
requires a mix of many different technologies.
what generates the co2 and what are the levers to address 
the issues?
in general, the co2 is generated by three different processes: 
high-temperature calcination (55%), burning of fossil fuels for heat 
generation (32%) and power supply (13%).
optimised processes, increased energy efficiency, alternative 
raw materials, use of renewable energy and alternative fuels, 
greenhouse gas emission-reducing solutions and carbon capture 
are levers to address this. today, we deliver key technology and 
solutions for alternative fuels, as well as high-efficiency and low-
emission products that save energy and produce more cement 
with the lowest possible environmental impact. 
much of our immediate efforts are focused on replacing 
limestone in cement production with clay. at flsmidth, we 
foresee that the limestome-based cement industry will develop 
into a multi-commodity industry where besides limestone and 
clay, other minerals have an essential role in producing cement. 
based on our multi-commodity mining and long-standing 
cement expertise, flsmidth is in a core position to cross-utilise 
competences towards zero emissions in cement.

packing and
dispatch
the cement process
finding ways to reduce the amount of clinker, 
introduce more energy-effective equipment 
and enable 100% alternative fuels are among 
our actions to make cement production more 
sustainable.
5. dispatching
the cement is then ready to be 
dispatched. it can be packed in 
various bag sizes and loaded onto 
trucks, or it can be shipped by bulk 
tankers, rail or ship. ultimately it is 
mixed with water, sand and gravel to 
form concrete, which is used to build 
the infrastructure around us. 
1. quarrying and crushing 
the main raw material utilised in the 
production of cement is limestone. 
limestone is calcium carbonate, 
caco3, and is 44% co2 by weight. 
deposits are drilled, blasted or 
ripped using heavy machinery, and 
the materials are then transported 
to the crusher to reduce the size of 
the rocks. this is the first step where 
flsmidth equipment is involved. 
2. drying and raw grinding
the materials are fed into the raw mill, 
ground to the right particle size and 
dried to the right moisture content. 
the outcome, raw meal, is stored 
in a silo and further homogenised 
to ensure a consistent chemical 
composition. this is a main driver for 
better performance of the kiln system 
and final clinker quality. the process 
requires a lot of power.
3. pyroprocessing
when the raw meal reaches the 
calciner at the bottom of the pre-
heater tower, it has a temperature of 
890°c. heating the materials releases 
the co2 contained in the limestone. 
these are inevitable calcination 
emissions. the material then enters 
the rotary kiln and is heated to 
1450°c. the heating melts the rocks 
to form clinker, the main component 
of cement. 
4. clinker and cement grinding
the clinker is ground in a mill to 
reduce its particle size. clinker 
has a high carbon footprint, and a 
focus area is to reduce the amount 
of clinker in the final product. this 
can be achieved by blending in 
additives. different cements are used 
for different applications, so clinker 
and additives are mixed in the right 
quantities to get the right type and 
quality.
pyroprocessing is by far the most impactful cement 
production process stage in terms of climate change 
impact. in an lca study conducted in 2020 for 
flsmidth by quantis, the climate change impact of 
pyroprocessing contributed approximately 90% of the 
total co2e emissions in a speciﬁc cement plant.

in order to achieve our co2 emissions goal as part of our missionzero 
programme, we developed a roadmap to accelerate our r&d focus 
in this area. the roadmap consists of three phases that address the 
main co2 emission sources from cement production. this will guide 
our work in the coming decade – both in terms of where we will focus 
our innovation efforts and in terms of creating partnerships with our 
customers, academia and others who can ensure we achieve our goal.
roadmap towards zero 
co2 emissions in cement
phase one
in phase one, we will deliver solutions to achieve 100% 
alternative fuel firing and complete fuel flexibility. fuel flexibility 
describes the ability to fire a variety of fuel types to avoid relying 
on a single source. refuse-derived fuel (rdf) is an example of an 
alternative fuel.
phase two 
phase two focuses on lowering the volume of carbon-intensive 
clinker by accelerating the deployment of clay calcination and 
other mineral resources. by combining the calcined clay solution 
with alternative fuel-firing technologies we can achieve ever 
larger emission savings.
phase three
in phase three, we work with different pathways, including 
deployment of geopolymers, creating circular models by using 
recycled concrete cement and carbon capture, utilisation and 
storage (ccus). 
these technologies and solutions will often need to be 
developed in partnership with others.

ater is a major theme when it comes 
to mining. about 70% of mines 
operated by the major mining 
companies are located in countries where water 
stress is considered a major risk. and with ore 
grades declining, more water is needed just to 
keep up with production rates. 
the three biggest risks associated with water 
and mining are scarcity, contamination of  
groundwater and tailings dam failures. that is 
why we are working towards a mining process 
that creates zero water waste by 2030. 
water is not the only environmental challenge 
in mining. scope 1 and scope 2 co2 emissions 
from mining amount to 1% of global co2 
emissions. and if we include fugitive methane 
emissions from coal mining, mining is estimated 
to be responsible for 4-7% of total global 
greenhouse gas emissions. we have set targets 
that will enable miners to move towards zero 
greenhouse gas emissions within 10 years.
as a leading solutions provider to the mining 
industry, we are now accelerating the 
development and implementation of new 
technologies to allow our customers to navigate 
the challenges in the industry to enable them 
to operate both responsibly and productively. 
because doing so is the key to mining 
companies’ long-term success.

ining is an energy-intensive industry 
that requires a lot of water and 
emits a significant amount of 
greenhouse gases. solutions are needed to 
address these issues in order to make mining 
more sustainable, and in order for the industry 
to obtain and maintain licences to operate. 
obtaining a licence to operate has been a 
main risk for mining companies for years, as 
authorities, local communities and investors 
alike are all demanding more sustainable 
solutions.
mineral processing often involves a lot of water 
– often in areas where water is scarce. that has 
consequences for production costs and for the 
licence to operate.
in tailings dams, water management meets 
health and safety issues. tailings dams are built 
to hold back water-based waste from mineral 
processing, often for decades. but for varying 
reasons, dams have a risk of failures which 
cause terrible destruction to surroundings and 
potentially the loss of human life. improved 
water management solutions are needed to 
eliminate the risk of dams collapsing in the 
future.

in 2020, we received an order to deliver an 
integrated paste-fill and filtered tailings solution to 
a lead-zinc mine operated by hindustan zinc ltd. 
in rajasthan, india. our technology will remove 
water from the mine's waste tailings, enabling the 
recovery and reuse of up to 85% of process water. 
this will not only cut the tailings footprint but also 
lower the mine's freshwater needs, meaning lower 
costs and lower environmental impact.
1. extraction 
ore, the rock that contains one or 
more valuable metals or minerals, is 
generally mined using two methods: 
underground or open-pit mining. 
open-pit mining is a faster and less 
expensive extraction method and 
often involves drilling, blasting, 
loading and hauling – often with 
diesel-powered mobile equipment. 
primary crushing of the ore in the 
pit and transporting it to the mill via 
electrically-driven conveyors, rather 
than haul trucks, can greatly reduce a 
mine’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
2. comminution
to separate the valuable components 
of an ore from the waste rock, the 
minerals must be physically liberated 
from their interlocked state by crushing 
and then grinding. 
size reduction begins with crushing the 
rock, normally a dry process, through 
a series of crushers and sizers. fine 
grinding is traditionally a wet process 
involving energy-intensive mills. 
comminution accounts for about half 
the energy used on a mine site and is 
estimated to consume up to 3% of all 
electric power globally. 
increasing energy-efficiency and dry 
milling are key sustainability focus 
areas.
3. concentration
there are many methods to increase 
the concentration of the valuable 
minerals in the milled ore. these 
depend on many different physical 
and chemical properties of the 
minerals to be separated. 
flotation, performed in large tanks 
containing milled slurry, is a widely 
used separation method for the 
concentration of fine-grained minerals. 
today, many mining companies are 
faced with more difficult ores to 
process. we are developing novel 
mineral processing techniques that aid 
in the recovery of these challenging 
minerals as well as helping reduce 
pollution and lower chemical use. 
4. dewatering
concentrates must be dewatered to 
allow them to be transported easily 
and to allow for further processing. 
the waste material, known as 
tailings, needs to be disposed of in a 
manner that is safe and has the least 
environmental impact.
dewatering is generally carried out 
in a stepwise process using screens, 
thickeners, clarifiers and filter presses. 
the final product, that has up to 85% 
of the water removed, is known as a 
filter cake. 
recovering and recycling water from 
the process streams are particularly 
valuable to mining operations, 
especially in water-scarce regions 
where the cost of freshwater is high. 
5. tailings management
mines have unique considerations 
when choosing the best and safest 
tailings disposal method. filtered (or 
dry stack) tailings is one of the most 
sustainable options. it eliminates 
tailings dam risk, allows high water 
recovery/reuse and creates a smaller 
tailings facility. it can also enable 
faster land reuse post-closure.
co-mingling waste rock with filtered 
tailings creates an even more stable 
solution. we call this ecotails®. this 
has the advantages of filtered tailings 
but creates a still smaller footprint, 
reduces drainage risk (which can 
affect local water quality) and can be 
used at large mines, even in areas of 
high seismic activity.
the mining process
to make mining more sustainable, our focus is on the 
development of energy-efficient processes and the reduced 
need for diesel-powered mobile equipment. the industry must 
also find new ways to allow for increased water recirculation 
and an overall reduction in freshwater intake.

and actions
internal operational impact 
ensuring the safety of our employees and 
their families has always been our most 
important priority. following the outbreak and 
spread of the pandemic, we established crisis 
management teams at group and regional levels 
and undertook continuous risk assessments 
in order to ensure that actions taken were 
proving effective in minimising infection rates. 
these measures included providing personal 
protective equipment, ensuring safe employee 
transportation and implementing travel bans, 
contact tracing programs, temperature screenings 
and entrance testing, depending on location. 
as of end-2020, almost 100% of our 
blue-collar employees where on-site at our 
manufacturing, assembly and warehouse 
sites, while around 50% of our global office 
employees were working from home. we have 
unfortunately had to reduce our workforce 
significantly during the year. in light of the 
pandemic, the increased degree of flexible 
working arrangements and an expected slow 
recovery within cement, we have decided to 
revisit our plans for building a new campus in 
copenhagen, valby. 
travel restrictions continue to impact the 
capacity utilisation for our global service 
technicians, and the lockdowns and travel 
restrictions put in place as a result of the latest 
wave of covid-19 cases will continue to impact 
our business during the first half of 2021. our 
regional offices, which are responsible for 
compliance to local regulations, are monitoring 
the situation and reporting weekly to group 
management on changes to local restrictions. 
customer impact 
most of our customers have maintained 
business continuity during the pandemic. 
however, in order to reduce the risk of 
covid-19 transmission within their workforces, 
many of them have chosen to run their 
operations with minimal staff onsite, and several 
have closed site access to suppliers. roughly 
97% of mine sites and 95% of cement plants are 
currently back in operation, but many cement 
plants run at reduced capacity utilisation and 
access to sites remains difficult for suppliers. 
the pandemic has accelerated customer 
demand for digital optimisation, with the number 
of hours spent on digital troubleshooting for 
customers doubling since the beginning of the 
year. a growing number of customers are now 
enjoying the benefits of our remote condition 
monitoring tools and services and are in regular 
contact with our 24/7 remote technical support 
staff. our on-site solutions have also proved 
their value to customers during the pandemic. 
for example, with our siteconnect mobile 
app, customers are able to monitor asset 
performance and health data without having 
to be on site or in the control room. though 
restricted site access has made it challenging 
to install new digital solutions on-site, we have 
successfully implemented remote software 
upgrades and plant improvements. 
supply chain impact 
as a global business, the timing and extent of 
the pandemic’s impact on our operations has 
varied across our locations. in response, we 
have endeavoured to maintain resilience and 
flexibility within our global supply chain and 
the ability to source from suppliers across all 
regions. as a result, while we have incurred 
some additional costs, there has been very 
little disruption within our global supply chain 
during the pandemic. where sub-suppliers 
have struggled to deliver, we have been able to 
successfully switch to suppliers in other parts of 
the world. 
to simplify and focus the supply base, we have 
been steadily reducing the number of suppliers 
we work with. fewer than 1,500 suppliers 
now collectively account for 90% of the global 
supplies. these suppliers are evenly split among 
geographies to reduce transportation, lead-time 
and improve agility with stronger delivery 
capability. two thirds of the suppliers are based 
in low-middle income countries. along with 
the partnership approach, this allows for better 
screening of suppliers and improved customer 
experience. in total flsmidth uses 7,500 
suppliers, which is a reduction from more than 
15,000 a few years ago. 
the covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on 
our industries, customers, company and employees. we 
continue to monitor the situation and take swift action 
where necessary to ensure the safety of our employees and 
their families, protect the interests of our customers and 
secure our supply chain.

governance overall
the board of directors establishes the 
mandate for the sustainability programme and 
receives quarterly updates. it also approves 
the sustainability report, ensuring that it is 
aligned with the long-term strategy of the 
company. the board of directors also has an 
annual strategy session to validate the long-
term strategic direction of the sustainability 
work. 
at executive level, our group executive 
management (gem) is responsible for setting 
the strategic direction for our missionzero 
programme and our operational sustainability 
approach. kpis are established on a year-on-
year basis in addition to our long-term targets. in 
2020, we set new targets to guide the long-term 
strategic direction of our sustainability efforts. 
on average, the gem receives an update on our 
sustainability work six times a year. 
responsibility for our operational sustainability is 
assigned to relevant corporate functions, which 
are responsible for continual improvements with 
a special focus on policy implementation. we 
update our policy framework annually to ensure 
that our policies are always relevant and to 
avoid conflicts between functions.
our sustainability policy is the umbrella for 
each of the functions’ clear commitments. this 
enables us to align the corporate sustainability 
strategy, goals and incentive structures 
between the functions. we can ensure clearer 
communication between functions and identify 
where they complement each other, and where 
there may be trade-offs. and we can effectively 
communicate our policies to relevant business 
partners. 
in 2021, we will establish a more robust data 
management and kpi system aligned with our 
new 2030 targets. kpis are cascaded across the 
organisation to individual functions. 
materiality
to map the social and environmental topics 
with the largest impact throughout our value 
chain, we conducted an extensive internal 
materiality assessment in 2017. our findings 
were supported by a desk review of customers’, 
peers’ and suppliers’ sustainability disclosures. 
in 2020, we reviewed these material topics and 
developed long-term targets to guide our efforts 
to improve our impact. in 2021, we intend to 
perform our next materiality assessment with a 
specific focus on our missionzero programme. 
missionzero implementation
in 2019, we introduced our new missionzero 
programme with the objective of enabling 
customers in cement and mining to operate with 
zero emissions by 2030. in order to deliver on 
this ambition, we are establishing a company-
wide measurement system. at group level, 
progress will be measured against our scope 
3 science-based target to reduce emissions 
downstream at our customers’ sites. this is 
further described below. 
organisationally, the progress of the programme 
will be tracked against specific kpis we are 
setting for the technical ability side of the 
programme – which focuses on the r&d 
projects and engineering work across our 
portfolio and for the commercial delivery. this 
work focuses on delivering solutions to our 
customers and the savings that are achieved 
through these solutions. during 2021, we will 
start measuring against these kpis for the first 
time – with a view to obtaining some learnings 
governance and 
sustainability 
risk management
understanding sustainability risks and opportunities as well 
as the expectations from our stakeholders is key to the way 
we work with sustainability in our company. combined with 
growing sustainability challenges across the sectors in which 
we operate, this requires a robust governance structure 
to ensure we are understanding, assessing and ultimately 
managing the risks and opportunities across our value chain. 
in 2020, we strengthened our governance and risk 
management in relation to sustainability. in this section, we 
outline the key elements of our governance structure and 
risk management approach to sustainability in general and 
climate change in particular. this is all central to being able to 
continually improve our sustainability impacts.

setting science-based targets
it is our ambition to enable the decarbonisation 
of the cement and mining sector and establish 
flsmidth as a future carbon-neutral company. 
to reflect this, in early january 2021, we 
committed ourselves to setting science-based 
targets according to the science based targets 
initiative (sbti) to reduce emissions in line with 
climate science. at the same time, we have 
submitted our category impact assessment for 
our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for validation by 
sbti. our main findings demonstrated that more 
than 99% of our footprint occurs downstream 
with the use of products at our customers’ sites. 
to address this, our missionzero programme 
was established. the focus is to decouple 
our emissions from the growth in revenue 
by selling increasingly more energy-efficient 
equipment. our intended target for our scope 
3 emissions will therefore be to reduce the 
economic intensity of our emissions. we intend 
to communicate our targets during 2021. 
task force on climate-related financial 
disclosures (tcfd)
we are constantly aiming to better understand, 
manage and disclose the impacts of climate 
change – both in terms of risks to our own 
business and to our customers. to do this, as 
well as identify potential opportunities due to 
stronger demand for climate-related solutions, 
we are aligning our practices and reporting 
using the tcfd recommendations. to that end, 
in late 2020 we performed a climate risk and 
opportunities analysis together with a selected 
focus group in our organisation. this process 
was facilitated by e&y. in addition, we performed 
a gap analysis to see any gaps in our disclosure 
with the tcfd. the findings of these two 
exercises can be found on page 32. we have 
integrated some of the initial findings into our 
2020 report and will further align our disclosure 
with the tcfd recommendations during 2021.

takeholder management has always 
been a clear element of our strategy 
and way of doing business, whetherat 
local level or global level. today, we already 
have many strong relations and collaborations 
with relevant organisation including relations 
with universities, industry collaborations and 
structured dialogue with financial institutions 
and governments. 
during 2020, as we started to implement our 
missionzero programme, engagement with 
stakeholders took on a new dimension. it 
became evident that a holistic societal approach 
was required in order to accelerate and adopt 
sustainable solutions in the cement and mining 
sectors. we are therefore intensifying our 
engagement with key stakeholders and aim 
to form partnerships to deliver against our 
ambition. 
customers
understanding the challenges of our 
customers is paramount to solving the greatest 
sustainability challenges in the industry and 
living up to our missionzero commitment 
of enabling zero emissions in both of our 
industries. increasingly, our customers are 
setting long-term sustainability targets, and 
we are engaging with them to understand 
how missionzero can best support them. 
this includes technological developments, 
financing and regulatory frameworks. we are 
also engaging with our customers in relation to 
operational sustainability areas, including safety. 
financial institutions
we work alongside our customers on a 
continuous basis to secure financing for 
projects around the world. numerous 
financial institutions require customers to 
adopt world-class standards related to the 
environment, society and the economy, such 
as the international finance corporation’s (ifc) 
performance standards for environmental 
and social sustainability. along with both 
customers and financial institutions, we work 
to ensure that projects adhere to the standards 
required. increasingly, we are discussing with 
financial institutions which finance solutions are 
needed to increase investment in innovative 
sustainability technologies as well as enable 
customers in developing countries to improve 
their environmental footprint.
outsourcing partners
our suppliers provide 80% of our 
manufacturing. reliable partners are central 
to our ability to deliver products, projects and 
services to our customers. we rely on trusted 
partners to achieve our goals. by having close 
contact with our suppliers, in all categories, 
our supplier relationship management is a real 
driver for results. 
universities
knowledge is central to our existence. 
collaborating and interacting with academia is 
important for ensuring consistent knowledge 
flows and innovation in the company. close 
collaboration with universities, specifically 
engineering programmes and projects and 
doctoral studies, helps attract top talent, 
acquire new knowledge and develop innovative 
ideas within the company. it is a crucial 
investment in the future of the business. as an 
organisation with a strong focus on research 
and development, we have many university 
partnerships on specific topics. in 2020, these 
included:
 
■ probu: process technology with production 
of sustainable building materials, with 
the technical university of denmark and 
rockwool.
 
■ cadel: co2 capture by electrolysis, with the 
technical university of denmark and aalborg 
portland cement.
 
■ iit chennai: projects including cement 
blending and material science.
 
■ in the mining industry, we are sponsors of 
14 university collaborations across eight 
countries. one example is the arc centre 
of excellence for enabling eco-efficient 
beneficiation of minerals, where flsmidth 
joins the university of newcastle (aus) and 
others as a founding member. the centre 
aims to reduce the environmental footprint 
of minerals processing technologies and 
improve resource recovery, by supporting key 
technologies such as coarse particle flotation.
 
■ flsmidth is also proud to join helmholtz-
zentrum dresden rossendorf and the 
norwegian university of science and 
technology in supporting the european 
innovation trust’s rawmaterials kava 
upscaling projects in commercialising the 
reflux™ flotation cell technology that 
replaces traditional flotation and decreases 
operational energy consumption by 50%.

stakeholder 
engagement
our dedication to sustainability requires us to identify and 
understand all major sustainability impacts, opportunities 
and risks throughout our value chain. doing so relies 
on engagement with all relevant stakeholders through 
transparency, open communication channels and meaningful 
dialogue. insights into stakeholders’ expectations enable us 
to continuously improve. our commitment to this is clearly laid 
out in our sustainability policy.

stakeholder engagement
organisations and charities, as well as trade 
unions and staff associations. one of our main 
interactions this year on sustainability was 
through the confederation of danish industry 
programme – from philanthropy to business. 
the purpose of this partnership is to integrate 
the sustainable development goals into our 
business model and to develop a long-term plan 
for how to solve global challenges. 
during the year, we received a number of 
inquiries about our potential involvement with 
(planned) coal related mining projects from civil 
society organisations. we maintain an open 
dialogue with these organisations.
industry associations
as the mining industry has compliance risks that 
span its value chain, we are a founding member 
of the compliance in mining network. 
this is a cooperation between mining companies, 
mining equipment producers and epc providers 
in the mining industry, working to improve 
compliance standards in the global industry. 
please see the compliance section to learn more.
we are a member of the innovandi global 
cement and concrete research network through 
the global cement and concrete association 
(gcca).
we are a member of the women in mining 
initiative, which aims to promote diversity within 
the industry. we are also a member of other 
selected industry associations.
international organisations
within our industries, stakeholders look to us for 
state-of-the-art technology and services. 
our world-class expertise in mining and cement 
production means that stakeholders rely on us 
to help set the standards for sustainability in 
our industries. it is important to us that we use 
our knowledge to shape how all stakeholders 
are considered and what the total effect of 
production is on the environment, society and 
the economy.
public sector 
transparency is a driver of everything we 
do, including tax, employment and business 
activities. flsmidth values open and 
collaborative dialogue with tax authorities in 
each of our countries of operation to ensure 
compliance with national laws.
community development and charity 
it is essential to us that the added value we 
create is provided to the local communities in 
which our operations are based. we accomplish 
this by listening to local expectations on matters 
such as local employment and paying our taxes. 
dialogues are a main driver in overcoming 
potential resistance, and they create a 
trustworthy relationship with local communities.
the flsmidth donation fund in denmark 
donates up to dkk 600,000 to worthy 
causes annually, including humanitarian work, 
environmental projects and education and 
training. in 2020, donations were made to 
educational organisations and engineering 
associations, amongst others. 
our indian offices supported a wide-array 
of local programmes. these included 
upgrading of a government primary school 
at ambarishipuram, arakkonam, tamil nadu; 
setting up library facilities at the government 
girls senior secondary school at bawal, 
haryana that will benefit 1500 girl students; 
and a contributions to paniit alumni reach 
for india foundation (parfi) focused on skill 
upgradation training for underprivileged youth 
in kancheepuram district of tamil nadu and 
bokaro, dhanbad and jamshedpur districts of 
jharkhand. 
in the united states, our teams organised 
several charity events, including food bank 
drives, clean-ups of the environment, science 
fairs, toy drives and tree planting under 
covid-19 compliant conditions.
investors
in 2020, flsmidth & co. a/s received a rating 
of aa (on a scale of aaa-ccc) in the msci esg 
ratings assessment, putting us in the top 17% in our 
industry. our performance is strong on issues such 
as safety and compliance, and we have a very robust 
governance structure in place. we also improved 
our cdp score to level c. we are witnessing an 
increased focus on environmental, social and 
governance-related (esg) topics among investors 
and are having regular dialogues with our investors 
on how we manage esg at flsmidth.

as part of our commitment to help achieve the 
goals of the paris agreement, flsmidth is a 
member of leadit, the membership group for 
industry transition. 
launched by the governments of sweden 
and india at the un climate action summit in 
september 2019, leadit is a forum that brings 
together countries and companies committed 
to taking action to achieve the goals of the paris 
agreement.
the goals are ambitious, especially for energy-
intensive industries such as mining and cement. 
we know that we have a responsibility to act. 
one way in which we do so is by being on the 
leadit technical and expert committee. 
along with 15 other companies on the 
committee, flsmidth advises the management 
board, which is made up of representatives 
from sweden, india and the world economic 
forum. leadit is grounded in the conviction that 
collaboration between the public and private 
sectors is central to achieving industry transition. 
the goal is to achieve lower emissions in 
energy-intensive industries. a difficult, but 
attainable task. 
the flsmidth ecs/processexpert® software solution is a platform for improved and 
energy-efficient performance.  
it enables customers to reduce energy usage by up to 6% while improving 
productivity by a similar amount. ecs/processexpert makes a notable difference in 
the cement and mining industries for which it is specifically designed.
 
ecs/processexpert connects instruments in a plant and collects data. it uses the 
data to regulate and optimise key parameters, giving our customers substantial 
productivity and sustainability benefits. 
with ecs/processexpert, our customers experience less downtime, fewer 
unplanned stops, and can switch to alternative fuels without compromising on 
quality. in addition, they receive a final product of a higher quality and with less 
deviation.

delivering on our commitment
we see safe working conditions as a precondition 
for sustainable productivity. central to our 
approach is creating constant awareness around 
safety and continuous improvement. at flsmidth, 
every meeting starts with a “safety share” – a 
reminder or suggestion about how to improve 
safety conditions at sites and in offices. 
for many years, we have focused on continuous 
improvements. top leadership commitments, 
strong systems and procedures, including for 
contractors, and targeted initiatives have led to 
significant improvements. our total recordable 
injury rate (trir) has improved for nine 
consecutive years. 
in 2019, we introduced our incident & injury 
reduction programme for all our manufacturing, 
assembly, warehousing and construction sites. 
the programme already showed a significant 
effect in 2019, and in 2020 we continued
the effort of embedding the programme into our 
culture. the result is a trir reduction of 34% 
compared to last year.
building a common culture
we also strengthened cooperation across the 
seven regions through the regional heads of 
health, safety and environment (hse), who were 
heavily engaged in building a common safety 
culture.
all employees of flsmidth play a key role in 
actively taking individual responsibility to prevent 
and address unsafe behaviours or conditions. 
for our leaders, this includes demonstrating 
visible leadership by speaking openly and 
honestly with colleagues and engaging in 
conversations about areas for improvement in 
our safety standards. 
we followed up on our commitments from 2018 
and safety culture programmes in 2019, where 
we dug deeper into understanding why we are 
motivated to work safer, but occasionally lose 
focus or engage in unsafe behaviour despite 
experience and training.
the safety campaign was rolled out at the end 
of 2020, including a new safety culture survey 
translated into 15 languages. this was linked 
to our four culture statements: open dialogue, 
visible leadership, employee engagement and 
individual responsibility.
overall satisfaction with our safety standards has 
increased by 12% over the last two years, which 
is also reflected in a significant reduction in our 
total recorded injury frequency rate (trir) of 
66.6%, down from 3.0 to 1.0. 
hse campaigns in 2019 and 2020 were mainly 
focused on employee engagement activities 
and open dialogue, resulting in an improvement 
of 24% for engagement and of 18% for open 
dialogue. our employees’ perception of our 
management’s visibility increased by 10%.
the 2020 safety campaign also included a 
drawing competition for children of employees, 
resulting in more than 160 entries being 
submitted, a safety lunch dialogue initiated by the 
immediate manager and an incident prevention 
competition for our safety award 2020, which 
was won by our team in south america. 
to keep safety top of mind, we have safety 
information screens across more than 57 
locations, totalling more than 10,000 in 24 
countries. the screens communicate safety 
messages to drive awareness and results. 
safety
ensuring the safety of our people is our top priority. 
for many years, we have been investing in creating a 
strong safety culture and robust systems. these investments 
translate into one of the strongest safety records in the industry 
today. our 2030 ambition is zero harm – and this means we 
need to continue to improve even more to create safe working 
conditions for our employees and anyone working under our 
supervision. during 2020, we achieved our targets and set new,
more ambitious ones to ensure we realise our ambition. 
improving our operational sustainability

we have established our internal sustainability 
commitment for 2030, which will replace our 
hse roadmap for 2020-2023, supporting the 
implementation of our new it platform. the 
quality-non- conformance report (q-ncr) and 
hse incident applications were rolled out in 2020.
with collaboration being one of our corporate 
values, we increased efforts to develop cross-
functional working groups across regions. their 
tasks included aligning policies and procedures, 
upgrading iso certifications and digitalisation, 
and we mapped all core competences across 
the hse community. individual development 
is measured through our annual performance 
development review.
during 2020, we outsourced our group travel 
security function to isos and merged group 
qa and group hse. responsibility for our iso 
standards (iso 9001 – quality, iso 45001 – ohs, 
and iso 14001 – environmental) now rests with 
group hse&qa.
during the covid-19 lockdown, many of our sites 
deemed essential, i.e. manufacturing, assembly 
and warehouses, remained in operation, but 
under strict protocols to avoid infection. the 
pandemic added another dimension to health 
and safety and, like other corporations around the 
world, we quickly established new procedures 
and protocols to keep our business going without 
compromising the health and safety of our 
employees.
all basic risks associated with covid-19 were 
evaluated, and actions were taken to mitigate 
these risks. a global response plan was 
established based on these risk analyses and 
became flsmidth’s minimum requirements for its 
covid-19 response around the globe.
our actions included:
 
■ strong daily communication during the first 
three months of the pandemic, ensuring 
commitment from employees and encouraging 
a spirit of “we will get through this together”.
 
■ focusing on employees’ mental well-being and 
health through leadership training and surveys.
 
■ group crisis management and local crisis 
management teams were established, and the 
situation continues to be closely monitored.
 
■ the development of kpi and covid-19 
dashboards to ensure close monitoring to 
ensure fast reactions and mitigation of risk.
 
■ ensuring a strong programme was in place 
when the travel ban was lifted. approximately 
65% of employees had completed our “travel 
security” e-learning course within two months, 
giving it a high satisfaction score of 4.5 out of 
5. communications related to travel security 
training were read by more than 7,500 
employees.
at the same time, a new risk assessment tool for 
travel, the travel risk approval form, was rolled 
out to ensure employees who travel assess the 
risks before booking trips.
the covid survey, measuring employees’ 
perception of our covid precautions, shows 
that 80% of employees are satisfied with the 
precautions we have taken. 
occupational safety risks
our risk management systems are in place to 
identify main hazards which include falling from 
heights and traffic accidents, working with power 
tools, ergonomic overexertion and collisions. 
related injuries are bone fractures, cuts and/or 
open wounds, and lacerations. robust registration 
and action planning following incidents plays an 
important part in our systems to correct unsafe 
conditions.
assessment of results
our ltifr and trir numbers shows a significant 
improvement. a strong focus on preventing 
and mitigating risk through our incident and 
injury reduction programmes, 24-hour calls 
and quarterly campaigns as well as due to the 
pandemic. 86% of our 2020 incident and injury 
reduction initiatives have been completed, 7% are 
still in progress, and the rest (7%) are postponed 
until 2021, due to covid-19.
what to expect in 2021
we will continue our efforts to achieve zero harm 
and build on our performance over the last couple 
of years. 
our main focus areas for improvements are:
 
■ strengthening awareness and building a safety 
culture
 
■ incident reduction and reporting
 
■ iso 45001 certification
 
■ upgrading our product and functional safety

compliance
2020 was our first full year of working according to our new 
compliance policy framework that guides our four core areas of 
operations: code of conduct, trade compliance, human rights 
and competition law. the framework also includes a number 
of sub-policies and procedures related, for instance, to gifts, 
hospitality, bribery, embargo countries and donations. a new 
long-term target is for all third parties to undergo due diligence.
delivering on our commitment
our key compliance-related activities are 
organised roughly according to the six elements 
of the uk bribery act’s guidance document: 
risk assessment, policies and organisation 
(proportionate procedures), top-level 
commitment, due diligence, communication 
and training as well as monitoring and review. 
we employ an approach that is very much 
risk-based, meaning that we regularly conduct 
assessments of the compliance-related risks, 
adjusting our focus and resources accordingly. 
this is supported by a highly committed 
executive management team and board of 
directors.
the group compliance department is 
responsible for setting the direction and 
providing the business with appropriate 
tools. our lawyers, who function as regional 
compliance representatives, implement actions 
across the group. we also have a trained group 
of finance and human resources managers 
who are responsible for investigating certain 
whistleblower cases.
training continues to be a top priority. we have 
worked on cascading the policy framework 
throughout the organisation by launching 
e-learning courses. we continue to provide 
in-person training for new employees, although 
covid-19 had a negative effect on the number 
of employees receiving in-person training in 
2020. in december 2020, we launched eight 
e-learning courses covering the most important 
compliance policies, available in six languages. 
all white-collar employees globally will be 
required to complete the eight courses.
third-party due diligence processes are another 
major focus area. at flsmidth, all customers and 
third parties are screened against more than 100 
sanction lists through a software package called 
integration point. 
this includes all applicable us, eu and un 
sanction lists. ownership research is conducted 
for all entities located in sanctioned countries. 
all eu-sanctioned individuals or entities are 
restricted from doing business with flsmidth. if 
improving our operational sustainability 
flsmidth ■ sustainability report 2020

other sanction regimes apply, any business will be decided on a 
case-by-case basis and carried out in compliance with applicable 
regimes.
the sanction and embargo procedures are supported by the 
trade compliance policy, the embargo and sanctions sub-policy 
and the prevention of violating transactions caused by sanctions 
or embargoes sub-policy.
close to 100% of our sales agents have undergone a rigorous 
due diligence screening and approval procedure. we have 
expanded the scope of third parties undergoing due diligence 
to now include all sales agents, all important customers above 
certain thresholds, which vary according to country risk, and all 
major contractors. prior to this, only sales agents and selected 
customers underwent due diligence.
our whistleblower hotline is a tool for reporting concerns in 
confidence. the hotline is regularly promoted to ensure that 
everyone knows of its existence. we conducted 97 internal 
investigations in 2020, which is higher than in any previous year. 
this increase prompted us to strengthen the organisation and 
process for internal investigations, including increasing human 
resources and training of delegate investigators in 2020. a 
result of this is that we are able to conclude a larger number of 
investigations quicker. in addition, we are working proactively 
with various group functions and country offices to address gaps 
in processes and the control environment identified through 
cases of internal investigations. finally, we are looking into further 
possibilities of using data analytics to look for abnormalities as a 
proactive way of identifying and avoiding incidents of fraud.
the whistleblower sub-policy protects those reporting against 
retaliation. investigations are guided by a procedure for internal 
investigations, and we provide a summary of the process as part 
of our policies. group compliance reports on a regular basis to 
the audit committee, the board of directors, the group ceo and 
group executive management.
compliance
responding to a case of 
non-compliance 
 
in 2010, we entered into a turnkey contract with a turkish 
partner for the construction of a cement plant in tunisia. we 
delivered plant equipment and subsequently operated the plant.
 
in 2010, we entered into a turnkey contract with a turkish 
partner for the construction of a cement plant in tunisia. 
we delivered plant equipment and subsequently operated 
the plant. in connection with entering into the contract, an 
flsmidth employee, in clear violation of internal rules and 
regulations, succumbed to a demand from the then owners 
to increase the sales price by eur 2 million. the intention of 
the then owners would appear to have been to transfer the 
excess amount to the owners’ own account. once flsmidth 
management became aware of the situation, the interaction 
was stopped and the remaining amount, which accounted 
for the vast majority of the eur 2 million, was put in escrow 
awaiting clarification regarding the rightful owner of the 
amount and was then returned in 2020.
since then, the transaction has been the subject of a tunisian 
court case regarding financial irregularities. as a result, a 
number of people have been sentenced, including one 
flsmidth employee. the verdict is subject to appeal. as a 
company, we were never charged or indicted in this case. 
it goes without saying that we do not condone economic 
crime of any kind. the irregularities of this case came to 
light in 2014. since then, we have taken strong measures to 
further ensure that all employees operate under our code 
of conduct and continue to re-enforce our zero-tolerance 
policy on bribery, as well as to ensure we operate in full 
compliance with all regulations and requirements.
from the top down, our commitment to compliance remains 
a top priority, as demonstrated by the actions of our group 
ceo, thomas schulz, who, upon joining flsmidth, intensified 
our efforts in a number of ways, including: 
 
■ initiating a company-wide compliance risk assessment 
 
■ appointing and training regional compliance 
representatives 
 
■ introducing a whistleblower hotline 
 
■ carrying out due diligence screening of sales agents and 
customers 
 
■ implementing mandatory compliance training for all 
white-collar employees, including new hires 
 
■ launching e-learning courses on compliance 
 
■ introducing a new policy framework for compliance, 
including the code of conduct, the trade compliance 
policy, human rights and competition law 
 
■ clearly stating that flsmidth has a zero-tolerance policy 
on bribery
taking it a step further, we have extended our commitment 
and taken steps to create a positive influence among our 
industry peers. the compliance in mining network, co-
founded by flsmidth’s compliance manager in 2017, now 
includes global mining majors, mining equipment producers 
and epc providers, and focuses on finding shared solutions 
to raise the general standard of compliance within the mining 
industry.

assessment of results
mainly due to the impact of covid-19, we did 
not conduct as many in-person training sessions 
with our employees as anticipated. analysis 
of the number of our white-collar employees 
who have been trained in compliance will not 
be reported this year as we are currently in 
the process of transferring training data to 
flsmidth’s hr system and in this process, it is 
unfortunately not possible to provide an exact 
figure for this indicator this year. we exceeded 
our goals in terms of the number of in-depth due 
diligence reports on third parties. 
in a survey conducted in november 2020, 82% 
of respondents stated that they would feel 
comfortable reporting through our whistleblower 
hotline. as a result of our efforts to encourage 
whistleblowing, we are receiving a significant 
number of whistleblower reports. group 
compliance has focused resources on internal 
investigations, improved the percentage of 
cases closed and reduced the duration of 
investigations.
what to expect in 2021
training in our policy framework will be our key 
priority in 2021. an important element is our 
updated in-person training concept, which was 
planned to be rolled out globally in 2020 but 
suffered a delay due to covid-19. during the 
year, we conducted extensive trainings with 
both our supervisory board of directors and 
our group executive management (gem) in 
compliance and anti-corruption. furthermore, 
we continue to monitor employees’ completion 
of the library of e-learning courses, and we 
plan to launch four new courses. our in-person 
training concept puts the emphasis on engaging 
participants, while increasing the breadth of 
content. particular attention will be given to 
new employees of flsmidth. the e-learning 
courses are short courses focusing on specific 
topics such as gifts, bribery, trade compliance, 
human rights and much more. the aim of the 
updated training and e-learning concepts is to 
increase the awareness of emerging topics such 
as fraud and harassment as well as the general 
awareness of the new policies.
in addition, we will be reviewing our approach 
to and organisation of internal investigations 
to accommodate the increasing number of 
whistleblower reports. we will also continue 
our commitment to the compliance in mining 
network, which is a cooperation between 
mining companies, mining equipment producers 
and epc providers in the mining industry, 
working to improve compliance standards in the 
global industry.
in 2021, we will work on defining the roadmap 
towards our new long-term target of having 
all third parties undergo some form of due 
diligence. the due diligence programme will be 
expanded in 2021 to include new types of third 
party, such as suppliers.
risks
working in the cement and mining industries 
implies operating in countries with compliance-
related risks. in particular, avoiding fraud, 
bribery, corruption, violation of trade sanctions 
and conflict of interests is high on the agenda. 
consequently, the business is constantly 
monitored and mitigating actions to reduce such 
risks are implemented.
compliance
* we are currently in the process of transferring training data to flsmidth’s hr system and in 
this process, it is not possible to provide an exact figure for this indicator this in 2020 and 
thus we will not we will not be reporting on this indicator this year.

people
our aim to be an employer of choice continues to drive 
our people strategy and agenda and is at the centre of 
our human resources policy. attracting, retaining and 
developing our workforce remains a priority. we seek 
to accomplish this by ensuring a healthy and engaging 
work environment that encompasses comprehensive total 
rewards along with development and growth opportunities. 
we also remain committed to equal opportunity, 
while improving diversity and inclusion in all areas of 
operations as per our diversity and equality policy. we 
have set a new long-term target for gender diversity. 
delivering on our commitment
in 2020, we introduced our employee value 
proposition, which focuses on our sustainability 
ambitions in safety, well-being, diversity and 
inclusion.
at the end of the year, we set a new long-term 
target for gender equality in our workforce. by 
2030, we want 25% of our entire workforce 
and 25% of our people managers to be women. 
today, those numbers are 15.9% and 13.1% 
respectively.
to meet these targets in a scenario with an 
8% employee turnover, we need to achieve a 
30% replacement rate. this means that almost 
one-third of all new hires in the next decade 
must be women, which is ambitious considering 
the demographics in the industries in which we 
operate.
monitoring progress towards this target will 
be done in the human resource information 
system (hris) implemented in 2018. the 
system gives us transparency about our people 
management across all regions. we have 
data and analytics available to support better 
decision-making, and the system is driving 
higher performance within the organisation.
in this common hris, we can monitor how 
each region is progressing against its diversity 
targets. this sheds light on the effectiveness 
of filling open positions with candidates from 
diverse backgrounds and age groups. to attract 
a more diverse workforce, we have already

created gender-neutral job advertisements in

we want to attract and retain those interested in 
reducing environmental impacts in cement and 
mining. for this reason, we have included text 
related to missionzero in job advertisements. 
engaged employees are our key to success. 
with a strategic focus on engagement, a pilot 
was conducted to test an engagement pulse 
survey platform that will provide us with a 
real-time employee engagement score. 
assessment of results
overall, our people performance and 
achievements in 2020 were hindered by 
the covid-19 pandemic, and most of our 
initial initiatives were delayed, postponed or 
restructured as virtual events. specifically, our 
recruiting efforts decreased substantially, and 
we had to reduce our workforce and furlough 
colleagues. 
some of the impacted positions were areas 
where we employ more women and, much like 
other companies, we see the disparate impact 
of the pandemic on our women colleagues 
resulting in a higher voluntary turnover.
we initiated new initiatives that focused on 
managing employees' physical and mental 
health throughout the pandemic. these 
included mainly virtual workshops and 
discussions.
to support the development of our employees, 
we launched 161 training modules in our digital 
learning management platform in 2020. 
training hours are below target as a 
consequence of cancelled classroom training 
due to the pandemic.

what to expect in 2021
we will continue our diversity and inclusion 
efforts and work on a roadmap to meet our new 
long-term target of 25% women colleagues and 
people leaders. and we will continue to use 
our reward strategy where total rewards must 
contribute to the attraction and retention of a 
diverse talent pool. a key indicator to monitor 
is equal pay for equal work in the organisation. 
initial analysis shows a gender pay gap of 
2.45%, and this gap will be addressed with a 
review of rewards practices and processes, 
driving more equal pay. in general, the reward 
strategy is the foundation for initiatives to ensure 
and promote sustainable pay practices.
as a key element of our employer value 
proposition, a global working group has 
been developing flexible work arrangement 
guidelines, and we expect those to be rolled out 
in 2021.
after completing the pilot, we also expect our 
engagement survey tool to be rolled out to all 
employees during the first half of 2021.
risks
to reach our overall medium-term and long-
term financial targets, it is crucial we have the 
technology and the competences in place at the 
right time. this is challenging in a market where 
the supply of some of these competences can 
be low.
given today’s macroeconomic pressures 
and societal risks, we are seeing fluctuating 
business results. therefore, it is important to 
have a flexible cost base to be able to adapt 
quickly and ensure we can invest in areas that 
drive sustainable growth. for that, we need an 
engaged workforce performing against aligned 
kpis to drive collaboration and performance.
workforce demographics
since 2018, we are realigning our organisation 
to strengthen customer relations, digitalisation, 
productivity and sustainability offerings, and to 
capture growth. we now have two industries – 
cement and mining – spread globally across six 
regions.
since then, we have seen the following changes 
in our workforce demographics:
 
■ our headcount decreased by 1707
 
■ share of women employed increased by 0.4%
 
■ share of women managers increased by 1.9%
 
■ blue-collar employees decreased by 14%
 
■ white-collar employees decreased by 11.1%
 
■ regional split: very little change
 
■ length of service:
 
■ -7% employees with <2 years’ experience
 
■ +4% employees with 2-4 years’ experience
 
■ +3% employees with 5-10 years’ experience
 
■ age: very little change
at the end of 2020, women accounted for 33% 
of the shareholder-elected board members, 
fulfilling the target that minimum 25% of the 
members elected at the annual general meeting 
should be female.

environment
with missionzero, we are committed to minimising all 
environmental impacts from our customers’, our suppliers’ and 
our own sites. for missionzero to be a success, we need all 
our stakeholders in the cement and mining industries to take 
responsibility for the impacts on the environment. change 
starts from within, and so in our own operations, our health, 
safety and environment policy commits us to preventing 
pollution, utilising resources such as water and fuel in a 
sustainable manner and mitigating climate change. by adopting 
the principles of science-based targets, we have further 
committed to reducing emissions across the value chain.
delivering on our commitment
the aim of missionzero is to enable cement 
and minerals production with zero emissions. 
after assessing the principles of the science 
based targets initiative, we have defined 
and submitted our targets for approval by the 
governing body. by setting science-based 
targets, we are showing our long-term 
commitment to reducing emissions, not only 
from our own production, but also from that of 
our suppliers and customers. this is also stated 
in our 2030 internal sustainability commitment.
in our own operations, we track our monthly 
performance in reducing co2 emissions and 
freshwater consumption to ensure transparency 
and data quality. all locations have a trained 
person responsible for measuring and reporting 
local performance. on a monthly basis, we 
compare performance between regions to 
assess overall group performance.
our accounting practices are aligned with the 
greenhouse gas protocol. the accounting 
practices include reporting of emissions from 
stationary combustion, mobile combustion, 
purchased electricity, fugitive emissions and 
water withdrawal. we collect data from all 
individual locations and compile them.
we have conducted pilot projects to reduce 
waste in or from our locations. we now have 
a system in place to start reporting on waste 
involving different waste categories relevant to 
the different locations.
we recognise that our impact extends 
beyond the boundaries of our direct control. 
that is why we have refined our accounting 
methodology for measuring co2 emissions from 
global downstream transportation and global 
procurement of steel.
assessment of results
the global lockdown of facilities and offices due 
to covid-19 is reflected in our carbon footprint. 
compared to last year, our carbon intensity 
(scope 1 & 2/revenue) decreased from 2.58 to 
2.24 and our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions decreased from 53,200 tonnes to 
36,830 tonnes. 
during 2020, we also saw a reduction in 
our water usage. we saw mixed reporting 
associated with the effects of covid-19. 
obviously, large reductions were seen where 
we temporarily closed down facilities, whereas 
other locations actually used more water due 
to increased hand washing. we have designed 
various initiatives to reduce water usage. 
while some locations have implemented 
these initiatives, most were postponed due to 
covid-19.
the reductions in water usage and carbon 
footprint were ahead of the target for 2020, 
yet this too was partly related to the effects of 
covid-19. 
water withdrawal in water-stressed areas is a 
topic that requires specific attention. in 2020, 
we started implementing our initiative to install 
flsmidth employees at port punta chungo, chile cleaned the coastline during our 2020 global “cleanup activity”, 
and collected 120 kg of plastic waste.

the seven regions have all identified and 
implemented reduction initiatives aimed at 
further improving their impacts. some of the 
activities include the shift to more energy-
efficient equipment, replacing conventional 
lighting with led lighting, purchasing renewable 
electricity, improved efficiency of compressor 
systems and several awareness campaigns.
what to expect in 2021
in 2021, we will begin our work towards meeting 
our science-based targets. on the supplier 
side, we need to develop a framework for 
ensuring that our suppliers have committed 
or are committing to reductions in emissions. 
downstream, our r&d will be centred around 
developing products and solutions that 
help customers honour our 7% year-on-year 
reduction target.
for our own operations, we need to further 
engage the organisation to execute on saving 
initiatives for water and co2 emissions. we will 
follow up on the assessment of water withdrawal 
from water-stressed areas. we will work to 
build awareness of the use of water at relevant 
locations and focus on water-saving initiatives in 
these locations. 
our system to report on waste management will 
be rolled out to the entire organisation.
a global system for reporting and managing 
environmental incidents is being implemented 
to improve incident response and mitigate the 
risks caused by environmental incidents. to 
further determine our impact from a life-cycle 
perspective, we continuously explore the 
opportunities to track more of our scope 3 
emissions.
also in 2021, we will continue to run specific 
culture campaigns with a special quarterly focus 
on hse.
risks
risk-based thinking is embedded in the 
organisation, and environmental risk management 
is in place through our environmental certification 
programme. it covers our major business centres 
in which we have established the process of 
identifying and managing environmental aspects 
in our business practice. the likelihood of a major 
environmental incident in our own operations 
is low, and implementation of a global system 
to manage environmental incidents will help us 
minimise the risk of it occurring. we apply the 
precautionary principle where applicable when 
assessing risks.

human rights
respect for international human rights is enshrined in our 
human rights policy, as well as our human rights grievance 
mechanism, the supplier code of conduct and anti-
harassment policy. in addition, several other flsmidth 
policies cover important topics in this regard. this includes 
the policies on diversity and inclusion, on health, safety 
and environment as well as on human resources.
ur human rights policy incorporates 
the views and concerns of rights-
holders through both internal and, 
to a lesser extent, external consultations. it 
respects all rights enshrined in the united 
nations universal declaration of human 
rights, the international covenant on civil and 
political rights, the international covenant on 
economic, social and cultural rights and the 
international labour organization’s declaration 
on fundamental principles and rights at work.
our supplier code of conduct addresses 
human rights concerns as they relate to actors 
in the supply chain. the policy places specific 
emphasis on remediation and requires suppliers 
involved in human or labour rights violations 
to work in collaboration with the group 
procurement and group compliance teams 
to offer redress to victims. in serious cases, 
we reserve the contractual right to terminate 
business relations in the event of unacceptable 
operating practices, including forced or child 
labour. finally, the grievance mechanism sub-
policy outlines the process involved if individuals

the un framework on business and human 
rights, and the un guiding principles for 
implementation. since 2018, we have reported 
publicly on progress in accordance with the 
uk modern slavery act. from 2021, we will 
also report according to the australian modern 
slavery act.
where adverse human rights violations are 
found, they are addressed according to 
irremediability, severity, scope and scale. in 
2020, we carried out a number of online human 
rights assessments. these assessments have 
provided an overview of the current state of 
flsmidth's human rights impact around the 
globe. 
the process of conducting human rights 
due diligence has also established greater 
clarity around implementing responsibility for 
human rights within the business. in 2020, we 
continued on this work through the investigation 
and remediation of human rights grievances and 
complaints submitted through our human rights 
grievance mechanism.
human rights due diligence has in the past 
been centred mainly around own operations 
and customers. it is our aim to include more 
suppliers in these screenings, and we are 
working on ambitious long-term targets and 
defining a roadmap to meet them. the roadmap 
includes a human rights assessment index 
based on six different human rights indices 
such as the freedom of the press index and 
human rights and rule of law index. flsmidth 
will focus the due diligence screenings and 
on-site assessment based on the severity of 
stakeholders' human rights score as well as their 
economic importance to flsmidth. 
finally, the human rights department of 
flsmidth works closely with group procurement 
in order to identify supplier risk. starting in 2021, 
every supplier will be measured based on six 
human rights-related criteria, alongside other 
sustainability factors.  
assessment of results
due to covid-19, we did not perform any 
on-site human rights impact assessments.
however, data from previous conducted 
assessment and our off-site reviews provide
valuable data and a platform for preventing 
possible future violations. 
we did not conduct human rights training during 
2020 but are currently revising our training 
approach and will accelerate our  training effort 
in this area during 2021.
what to expect in 2021
in 2021, we expect to complete 10 thorough 
online (off-site) human rights assessments and 
two on-site human rights impact assessments 
of flsmidth suppliers and/or customers. the 
scope of these assessments will be determined 
based on a risk to rightsholders in compliance 
with the un guiding principles for business and 
human rights and our human rights policy.
another key focus in 2021 will be the 
development and delivery of targeted training 
on basic human rights principles for a broad 
group of employees. as we believe that 
targeted, more in-depth training will help 
us mitigate risks more effectively, detailed 
training for selected managers at sites or in 
functional areas specifically relevant to human 
rights issues will be conducted. in 2021, we 
will also launch a human rights e-learning 
module targeted at all managers and affected 
employees. 
risks
we recognise that the industries to which 
we provide engineering, technology and 
services constitute high-risk sectors. the 
mining and cement industries both have large 
environmental footprints and may cause 
displacement where available mineral reserves 
are situated near populated areas. we evaluate 
these and other social, environmental and 
governance factors of the projects to which we 
supply primary equipment, services, spare parts 
and manpower.

supply chain
we operate an asset-light business model where 
we outsource 70-80% of all manufacturing and 
assembly. our supplier base is spread globally, and 
we spend approximately dkk 10bn on procurement 
each year. over half of our purchases are steel-
based, including fabrications, casting and forgings. 
we systematically screen our suppliers to ensure 
that they adhere to our supplier code of conduct.
s we want to build strong business 
ties and longstanding relationships, 
we expect our suppliers to share our 
standards of responsible business conduct. 
crucial to this is our supplier code of conduct, 
which clarifies what we expect of our suppliers. 
group procurement is responsible for the policy, 
which has been in place since 2012 and was 
updated in 2018.
the main points of the flsmidth supplier code 
of conduct oblige our suppliers to:
 
■ comply with all applicable laws in all 
jurisdictions in which they operate
 
■ provide a safe and healthy working 
environment for all employees
 
■ comply with basic human rights
 
■ meet all applicable environmental laws, 
industry standards and norms
delivering on our commitment
all suppliers, defined as organisations that 
we source from, are now required to sign the 
flsmidth supplier code of conduct, which 
is aligned with the four focus areas of the un 
global compact. furthermore, it follows the 
cement sustainability initiative’s “sustainable 
supply chain principles for the cement sector”, 
delivering tier 2 visibility into the supply chains 
of our customers. flsmidth will not cooperate 
with suppliers who fail to comply with and sign 
the supplier code of conduct.
in addition to our supplier auditing programme, 
we launched a supplier sustainability 
screening programme in 2018. any employee 
in flsmidth’s supply chain or procurement 
departments who visits a supplier must perform 
a mandatory on-site audit. 
the supplier sustainability programme aims 
to uncover potential risks in the supply chain

and supports the development of our suppliers 
within the area of sustainability. furthermore, 
the programme has proved to increase internal 
awareness of sustainability and is driving a 
behavioural change in our procurement and 
supply chain organisation.
using an online feedback tool, our staff screen 
suppliers on 21 checkpoints focused on the 
health and safety system and policies:
 
■ work-related accidents
 
■ ppe and machine guards
 
■ electrical hazards
 
■ general emergency preparedness
 
■ ethical equality
 
■ minimum age
 
■ environmental system and policies
 
■ environmental hazards and countermeasures
the screening feedback is fed into a database, 
and suppliers are given an overall score 
based on response and criticality. if a potential 
non-compliance is revealed during a screening, 
immediate action is taken with the supplier. in 
severe cases, this may cause an immediate stop 
to all activities with the supplier. in most cases, 
the supplier will be asked to provide a mitigation 
plan and initiate action within one week.
a number of our suppliers have been identified 
as high-risk suppliers. this is based on 
operational category, location and historic 
performance. these suppliers undergo 
a systematic screening process ensuring 
necessary actions are taken. thus, we can 
support our suppliers in their efforts to meet our 
high standards.
 
assessment of results
in 2020, travel restrictions due to covid-19 
reduced our ability to visit suppliers and conduct 
sustainability screenings. this resulted in a 
significantly lower number of supplier visits and 
screenings than planned. in addition, limited 
available capacity at suppliers’ sites resulted in 
longer response times to address findings at 
suppliers’ sites.
despite covid-19, over 650 screenings were 
completed in 2020, screening 390 individual 
suppliers.
all critical findings were addressed in a timely 
manner by the suppliers. 
what to expect in 2021
we will continue the development of the 
flsmidth supplier sustainable programme in 
the coming years, and as soon as covid-19 
travel restrictions allow, we will relaunch the 
programme.
to complement the programme, we will 
introduce a self-screening tool for all suppliers. 
this will be a questionnaire that all suppliers 
need to complete in order to begin or maintain 
their relationship with us. 
the supplier auditing/assessment programme 
will be revised to ensure the best fit with the 
sustainability screening programme and the new 
self-screening tool.
furthermore, we will continue our efforts to 
consolidate suppliers and reduce the supplier 
base. this will result in reduced risk and 
enable us to increase focus and allocate more 
resources to high-priority suppliers.
risks 
supply chain sustainability risks include losing 
a stable market position due to effects on 
our customers, loss of reputation, damaged 
public image, legal action and compromising 
compliance, business ethics and values. 
they especially include risks that would result in 
harm to human health, increased environmental 
impact and violation of human or labour rights. 
these risks are addressed through the supplier 
sustainability screening programme, managed 
by group procurement. any critical findings with 
suppliers are immediately acted upon. in most 
cases, the risk is mitigated in dialogue with the 
supplier. flsmidth assists the supplier in the 
development. in some cases, flsmidth decides 
to terminate the relationship with the supplier 
to avoid the risk and send a clear signal of 
non-acceptance to the supplier.

environment 
(description of some indicators have been adjusted, 
however they are comparable to previous years)
flsmidth is using the financial control approach following the ghg protocol and therefore, reporting for scope 1, scope 2, business travel, and water will only include 
activities under our financial control.
scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (in tonnes co₂- 
equivalents)
scope 1 emissions are direct emissions of greenhouse gases and are measured as co₂-equivalents. scope 1 emissions for flsmidth comprise fuel and gas use for 
various operational activities. scope 1 involves three different categories: stationary combustion, mobile combustion and fugitive/process emissions. in 2020, emission 
factors from defra were updated, according to the most recent list pubished, to calculate activity data to co₂ equivalents. updates in 2020 also involved to change other 
emission factor sources than defra used in 2019 i.e., ghg protocol tool 2015 for natural gas and ipcc second assessment for refrigerants. 
stationary combustion. measuring usage of fuel for power generation is based on invoices, meter readings and supplier reports, and is collected monthly for all entities. 
when information is unavailable, entities estimate values based on previous months. as the default emission factor for purchased fuels and gases, we use ghg cross-
sector calculation tools according to the list of defra factors, and such a list is updated on a yearly basis once updated factors are released publicly.
mobile combustion. measuring usage of fuel for internal transportation movements at our locations and company-owned modes of transportation is based on invoices, 
supplier reports and mileage balances, and is collected monthly for all entities. leased cars are included only when within the financial control of flsmidth. when 
information is unavailable, entities estimate values based on previous months. as the default emission factor for purchased fuels, we use ghg transportation calculation 
tools according to the list of defra factors, and such a list is updated on a yearly basis once updated factors are released publicly. 
fugitive and process emissions. usage of refrigerant and other greenhouse gas consumption is based on invoices or information provided by the supplier and is collected 
monthly for all entities within our financial control. where information is not available, we make use of estimates based on consumption. as the default emission factor for 
purchased refrigerants, we use the list of defra factors, and such a list is updated on a yearly basis once updated factors are released publicly.
biogenic co₂ emissions are not relevant in our business operations.
customer sites during project-related activities are not included since we do not have financial control over those sites.
offices with fewer than 10 people are not included since most employees work from home and emissions are insignificant.
scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (in tonnes co₂- 
equivalents)
scope 2 emissions include the indirect emissions from electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased and consumed by flsmidth. we use location-based and  
market-based methods for calculations of scope 2 emissions. for location-based, emission factors are derived from the international energy agency (iea). for  
market-based, residual emission factors for europe and north america are derived from the european residual mixes 2019 association of issuing bodies and the green-e 
energy residual mix emissions rates (2018). if market-based residual emissions factors for certain sites are not available, i.e. outside europe and north america, we use 
location-based emission factors, cf. recommendations from the cdp web page. for market-based, if entities have purchased renewable energy as well as having 
certificates and/or building renewable energy on-site projects, we calculate them as having an emission factor of 0.
electricity, purchased heat, steam or cooling consumption is based on invoices or meter readings, and is collected monthly for all entities within our financial control. for 
entities with shared office spaces and where consumption data are not accessible, the electricity use is estimated as 144 kwh/m2/year in temperate areas and 270 kwh/
m2/year in subtropical areas.
for location-based, we use iea emissions factors, and for market-based, we use emission factors from iea when residual factors were not avialable.
customer sites during project-related activities are not included since we do not have financial control over those sites. 
offices with fewer than 10 people are not included since most employees work from home and emissions are insignificant.
business travel (part of scope 3) (in tonnes co₂)
the business travel reported only includes business travel by air. emission factors are derived from defra.
business travel. co₂ emissions from business travel are included in our scope 3 reporting. the emissions are based on the booking system of the main flight ticket 
provider and are collected on a quarterly basis. the coverage is 95-98% of our travel. the emissions have been extrapolated to 100%, assuming a coverage of 95%.

number of suppliers with improvement plans in place divided by total number of suppliers screened with a finding. improvement plans are made for all suppliers with 
critical findings/non-conformities. a non-conformity is identified if the supplier does not comply with any of the critical parameters in the supplier code of conduct. 
% of "new" high-risk suppliers screened for sustainability
a supplier is considered "new" when no previous purchase has been placed with the supplier within the two previous years. suppliers are categorized as high-risk if 
located in a geographical high-risk area and if yearly spend by flsmidth is above 1 mdkk
a screening includes review of the suppliers health and safety, environmental and social performance.
human rights
human rights review (off-site)
number of human rights compliance reviews or impact assessments conducted in the reporting year. human rights compliance reviews are based on written desktop 
reports and might lead to an on-site impact assessment. 
human rights impact assessment (on-site)
impact assessments are always conducted on site. both human rights compliance reviews and impact assessments can, in some cases, be part of compliance due 
diligence reports.  
flsmidth conducts human rights compliance reviews and impact assessments on offices, production sites and customer sites where flsmidth has employees stationed. 
compliance reviews and impact assessments concerning offices are mostly policy-focused, while operations are more process-focused.

water withdrawal (m3)
water withdrawal includes all resources flsmidth withdraws from groundwater or consumes from waterworks. the latest assessment was carried out in december 2020.
for entities with shared office spaces and where consumption data are not accessible, the water use is estimated as follows: office/warehouse – 20 litres/pp/day, 
manufacturing facility – 35 litres/pp/day, facility with boilers in use – 50 litres/pp/day.
offices with fewer than 10 people are not included. moreover, customer sites during project-related activities are not included since we do not have financial control over 
those sites.

analysis on water withdrawal in water-stressed areas: identification of entities in low, medium, high or extreme high water-stressed areas, using the aqueduct water risk 
atlas tool suggested in the gri 303: water and effluents standards 2018. the total water withdrawal amount from extreme high and high water-stressed areas was 
fractionated from the total water withdrawal from all entities globally and the percentage was calculated by region and globally.

1     in the 2020 reporting, we have decided to focus on four main indicators for supply chain management. it is our best 
estimate that these three indicators are the most comprehensible, the most meaningful in terms of target setting and 
that they provide a fulfilling picture of the performance of the supplier sustainability screening program. the descoped 
indicators for reporting are still used internally to ensure progress.

disclosures (tcfd)
to better understand, manage and disclose the 
impacts of climate changes – both in terms of 
risks to our own business and to our customers 
as well as potential opportunities due to 
stronger demand for climate-related solutions, 
we are aligning our practices and reporting with 
the tcfd recommendations. 
to that end, in late 2020 we performed a 
climate risk and opportunities analysis with a 
selected focus group in our organisation. this 
process was facilitated by e&y. in addition, we 
performed a gap analysis to see any gaps in 
our disclosure with the tcfd. the findings of 
these two exercises can be found on page 32. 
we have integrated some of the initial findings 
in our 2020 report and will further align our 
disclosure with the tcfd recommendations 
during 2021.

to the stakeholders of flsmidth
as agreed, we have examined flsmidth’s 
sustainability report 2020 (the sustainability 
report) for the period 1 january 2020 to 31 
december 2020. flsmidth’s sustainability 
report 2020 has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies described on p. 
53-55.
we are to conclude on whether the 
sustainability report has been prepared in 
accordance with the reporting approach and 
criteria described on p. 53-55. the degree 
of assurance expressed in the conclusion is 
limited.
management’s responsibility
flsmidth’s management is responsible for 
the preparation of the sustainability report in 
accordance with the global reporting initiative 
(gri) standards and flsmidth’s reporting 
approach and criteria (hereafter the reporting 
approach and criteria) described on p. 53-55. 
flsmidth’s management is also responsible 
for such internal control, as the management 
considers necessary to enable the preparation 
of the sustainability report free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
flsmidth’s sustainability report on the basis of 
our procedures. we performed our procedures 
in accordance with isae 3000, “assurance 
engagements other than audits or reviews of 
historical financial information” and additional 
requirements under danish audit legislation to 
obtain lim-ited assurance for our conclusion.
ey godkendt revisionspartnerselskab is 
subject to the international standard on quality 
control (isqc) 1 and thus uses a comprehensive 
quality control system, documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards, 
applicable requirements in danish law and other 
regulations.
we complied with independence requirements 
and other ethical standards under fsr - danish 
auditors’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants, which rely on general principles 
regarding integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality and 
professional conduct. 
as part of our examination, we performed the 
below procedures:
 
■ interviews of relevant company professional 
responsible for sustainability strategy, 
management and reporting, located at 
flsmidth’s headquarters in valby.
 
■ a site-visit to flsmidth in pekin, united states, 
to review the environmental and safety data 
on a regional level
 
■ based on inquiries, ey has assessed whether 
data have been collected, assessed and 
quality-reviewed as prescribed in flsmidth’s 
manual for data collection 
 
■ analytical review procedures, including trend 
analyses of sustainability data supplied by 
flsmidth compared to prior period 
 
■ ·review of the appropriateness of accounting 
policies applied by management
we believe that our procedures provide a 
reasonable basis for our conclusion. the 
procedures performed in connection with our 
examination are less than those performed 
in connection with a reasonable assurance 
engage-ment. consequently, the degree of 
assurance for our conclusion is substantially less 
than the assurance, which would be obtained, 
had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement.
conclusion
based on the procedures performed and 
the evidence obtained, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that 
flsmidth’s sustainability report for the period 
1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 have 
not been prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the reporting approach and 
criteria described on p. 53-55.
