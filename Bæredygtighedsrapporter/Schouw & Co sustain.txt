since schouw & co. was founded in 1878, the com-
pany has evolved by being trustworthy and taking a 
long-term perspective. we firmly believe that a re-
sponsible approach and profitability go hand in hand 
in developing the company and creating value for the 
shareholders of schouw & co. 
long-term 
responsibility
a word from the ceo
a sustainable journey
at schouw & co., we’ve always endeavoured 
to act responsibly and to create value in a 
decent and trustworthy manner. it’s been 
deeply embedded in our dna and a funda-
mental part of developing the business, also 
long before governance, the un sdgs and the 
climate debate became top of the agenda. 
during the past many years, we’ve consistently 
taken steps to reduce our energy consump-
tion, we’ve improved working conditions for 
our employees around the globe, and we’ve 
had a good and responsible management 
culture. we’ve always prioritised doing things 
right. 
we improve our esg reporting on an ongoing 
basis. last year, we issued our first group-wide 
esg report, and this year we’ve compiled 
more and better data. we plan to follow it up 
by steadily developing, professionalising and 
systematising our reporting, and we’ll increas-
ingly provide an actual structure to the efforts 
we’ve made and initiatives we’ve pursued over 
the past several years in order to anchor our 
approach even more firmly in our portfolio 
businesses. 
a joint responsibility 
we’ll work tirelessly to improve on our climate 
and environmental impact, labour conditions 
and governance. this commitment is a crucial 
part of the everyday routines of our managers 
and employees, who all contribute and shoul-
der their part of the responsibility.  
at schouw & co., we are committed to con-
ducting ourselves in a proper and trustworthy 
manner. we believe that results are created 
by people who by conducting themselves 
responsibly contribute to securing our com-
mon future.

esg – a stronger agenda
over the years, the work on corporate respon-
sibility has become increasingly formalised as 
society’s demands have increased in relation 
to the standards of reporting on various focal 
areas. at schouw & co., we have long had 
corporate responsibility as an important part 
of our strategy, with efforts and targets being 
developed and applied across the group.
during 2020, we have compiled better data, 
which provides us with a broader basis for 
managing and targeting our esg efforts. in 
other words, we support esg as a stronger 
agenda, but this is nothing new to us:
the founder of schouw & co. and his two 
immediate successors, hans and svend 
hornsyld, were closely connected on a per-
sonal level and together they developed the 
business over a period of 83 years. although 
schouw & co. has been a limited liability 
company since 1911, these long-standing 
personal relationships gave the company the 
characteristics of a family business with a 
long-term perspective and responsibility as 
the dominant features. 
the charitable foundation direktør svend 
hornsylds legat is still an influential share-
holder in schouw & co., and we strive consist-
ently to be among the best to create value in a 
decent and trustworthy manner.

our business model
schouw & co. is a diversified industrial 
conglomerate consisting of the parent com-
pany and six wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
the portfolio companies are run as focused 
sub-groups each with their own organisa-
tion, management and subsidiaries, and all 
enjoy extensive operational autonomy with 
operational responsibilities allocated to local 
managements.
more than half of the group’s operations are 
located in europe, but it also has extensive 
operations in other parts of the world. high 
quality standards are a hallmark throughout 
the group, and the ambition is to apply uni-
form standards to all production activities no 
matter where a production unit is located.
from raw materials to b2b products
the group generates most of its revenue from 
automated or advanced production pro-
cesses, in which the group’s businesses turn 
sourced raw materials into products that are 
resold to customers who then manufacture 
end products.
sale of value-added components
the remaining part of the consolidated 
revenue primarily derives from technical 
trading and processing operations, in which 
the group’s businesses handle or process 
sourced components before reselling them to 
oem customers.
the management of schouw & co.: pictured from left to right:  
erik weimar rasmussen, cfo, jens bjerg sørensen, ceo, peter kjær (vice president) 
and kasper okkels (vice president business development, strategy & ir).
procurement of raw materials  
and components
the group sources a limited number of differ-
ent raw materials that mainly include marine 
and vegetable raw materials and oil-based 
products generally supplied in large quantities 
from internationally recognised suppliers.
on the other hand, the group buys com-
ponents in very large volumes from many 
different suppliers worldwide. generally, these 
products are manufactured by recognised 
technical manufacturers that meet high qual-
ity standards.
sales
the group sells its products to professional 
customers which either use the products or 
incorporate them in end products. most of the 
process production is sold in large volumes 
to a limited number of customers. the group 
does not sell directly to consumers and only 
sells to public sector customers to a very 
limited extent. 
schouw & co. creates 
long-term value  
by exercising active and   
inspiring ownership   
of leading danish 
industrial businesses.

we shall never forget 2020. reality exceeded 
even our worst nightmares, and no one could 
have foreseen the global coronavirus pandem-
ic and the impact it would have. 
 it is in times like these that setting the right 
priorities and making the right choices 
become absolutely crucial – and when head-
ing a company, you must ask yourself what the 
number one priority is for your business. 
at biomar, we had decided on the answer to 
that question long before covid-19 forced its 
way into our lives. our response is that ‘results 
are created by people’, because we rely on our 
people for our results. in other words, ‘people 
first’ is the guideline that charts our course, 
and i feel privileged to be part of an organisa-
tion that truly lives by that mantra.  
a link in the food value chain
as one of the world’s largest producers of fish 
and shrimp feed, we are part of the essential 
value chain to ensure reliable supplies of food. 
this means our factories have been subject to 
fewer restrictions than other manufacturing 
businesses. while this has a positive side, it 
also means that we must honour the respon-
sibility to exert additional caution and protect 
our staff, suppliers and customers. 
early in the year, therefore, we decided to 
close our factories to external visitors, restrict 
internal access, train our employees and, of 
course, tighten our hygiene precautions. in 
this context, it turned out to be a huge advan-
tage that most of our production facilities are 
highly automated, but all our employees have 
also proved capable of shouldering additional 
responsibility, and i am impressed by how well 
we have performed. 
local responsibility
biomar operates sixteen factories across 
twelve countries, and it is remarkable how 
different the various national authorities have 
tackled the pandemic. in northern europe, 
the resources available to support society 
through the crisis have been extensive, but for 
countries in other continents, conditions have 
been very different. 
in response, we came up with the ‘neighbour-
ing communities – covid-19 support’ pro-
ject, which involved making healthcare, food 
and educational resources available to local 
communities. chile and ecuador are among 
the countries hardest hit, and we supplied 
healthcare equipment to local authorities, 
food supplies to local organisations as well as 
educational and training materials. 
our contributions were but small, but together 
with other companies, organisations, and 
governmental organisations, we hope to make 
a difference. if we all take responsibility and 
show public spirit, i am sure we can over-
come this challenge together, creating value 
and possitive change from the crisis that has 
blighted 2020.

the oceans offer vast resources that are 
essential to mankind, but these resources will 
only last if we are careful not to disrupt the 
fragile ecosystems of our seas. biomar is con-
tributing to solving this complex challenge. 
‘fish’ may well be one of the most important 
and most sustainable answers to the ques-
tion on what we will need to feed the grow-
ing global population. while the oceans are 
still teeming with vast quantities of fish, wild 
fish can no longer adequately cover our food 
requirements. this situation raises a need for 
industrial fish farming, also known as aqua-
culture: 
“very few people are aware that we already 
eat more farmed than wild fish. this is both a 
positive and value-creating trend, provided it 
is done in a sustainable manner. contributing 
to a sustainable global aquaculture industry is 
therefore one of the most important objectives 
of our business,” explains vidar gundersen, 
global sustainability director at biomar. 
tions, positioning biomar as a market leader 
in sustainable aquaculture. we must take care 
when harvesting marine resources, and it’s 
important that we’re constantly taking new 
steps in the right direction,” he concludes. 
biomar is also working on a large number of 
other research projects that aim to enhance 
the properties of feed products. targets 
include sustainability profile, improved growth 
rates and lower feed conversion ratio, mean-
ing decreasing the amount of feed needed to 
produce a kilo of fish. 
harvesting  
marine resources  
sustainably
call for battle against phosphorus
in other words, biomar devotes a large 
proportion of its time on researching and 
developing sustainable solutions. one of the 
company’s most promising research projects 
aims to reduce the emissions of phosphorus 
generated by fish farming, and the first prod-
ucts developed as a result of this process are 
now ready to be rolled out to customers: 
“phosphorus is a nutrient that both plants and 
fish depend on. however, too much phos-
phorus can lead to algal blooms, which in 
turn reduces the oxygen content in the water, 
damaging the living conditions of fish and 
other marine life,” explains gundersen, and he 
continues: 
“we’re working tirelessly to develop new feed 
concepts that will keep the environmental 
impact on the aquatic environment to a mini-
mum. we’re currently ready to launch blue 
impact™, a product with a reduced phospho-
rus content compared to traditional fish feed. 
this will enable increased fish production 
without increasing phosphorus emissions.” 
the first feed series, blue impact™ aqua, 
was developed in close cooperation with a 
number of fish farming companies. this feed 
contains 20 percent less phosphorus and ena-
bles increased protein digestibility in fish: 
“we expect a lot from this new product series, 
initially for customers in the baltic sea region 
and eventually in other parts of the world. blue 
impact™ aqua is one of the latest innova-

industrial accidents, we’re combatting corrup-
tion and we’re consistently reducing energy 
consumption at our production sites. in 2020, 
we even became the world’s first nonwovens 
manufacturer to be certified to iscc plus, one 
of the most ambitious supply chain certifica-
tions for the use of circular and bio-based 
materials.
however, all that does not alter the fact that 
as a nonwovens manufacturer, we have very 
high energy consumption and that we use oil-
based plastics. we have asked ourselves many 
times if we can end our reliance on oil-based 
products. like many others, we have tested 
various alternatives over the years, but so far 
unsuccessfully. 
that is why we decided several years ago to 
embrace plastics rather than being ashamed 
of using such types of materials, because we 
also know that the diapers and incontinence 
products we produce have huge benefits for 
so many people. for example, the improved 
hygiene resulting from the use of our diapers 
has a hugely positive effect in less developed 
countries. quite simply, the materials we 
produce are best suited for the purpose, even 
if they are oil-based. 
we aim to lead the industry
plastics and microplastics in our oceans along 
with global co2 emissions have come high on 
the agenda all over the world. recent trends 
in this area have been quite remarkable. the 
increased awareness has an extremely posi-
tive effect, in part because it affects the entire 
value chain within our industry. in fact, it is 
helping to legitimise our efforts to push the 
limits of sustainability. 
all production processes affect the environ-
ment to some degree, but we must all do our 
best to reduce the impact as much as possible. 
at our end, we currently have more active 
initiatives than ever before, both on our own 
accord and through edana, our european 
industry organisation. sustainability is at the 
top of our agenda, and we’re not afraid to be 
a frontrunner in our industry with the motto 
‘sustainable is possible’. in fact, we see it as an 
obligation.

fibertex personal care continued to work on 
the ‘sustainable is possible’ mindset during 
2020. the company made substantial invest-
ments, ranging from r&d into new products 
and production methods to employee devel-
opment and social issues. 
a sustainable value chain
one of the biggest milestones achieved is 
the iscc plus certification, which fibertex 
personal care is the first nonwovens manu-
facturer in the world to achieve. iscc is short 
for international sustainability and carbon 
certification, and iscc plus is an ambitious 
supply chain certification in the use of circular 
and bio-based materials. the certification 
is based on a system that enables tracking 
the consumption of resources through the 
value chain and, not least, their sustainability 
characteristics. 
“we’re very proud that we’ve been iscc plus 
certified. we have a clear objective to be a 
frontrunner, and we are absolutely confident 
operation clean sweep makes a lot of sense 
to us,” says søgaard. 
valuable effort to combat the 
coronavirus
the world was struck by a serious pandemic 
in 2020. after being discovered in china, 
the coronavirus spread to all other countries 
worldwide, triggering immense demand for 
face masks and ppes in general. nonwovens 
is one of the best materials for absorbing and 
filtrating bacteria, so the entire nonwovens 
industry converted much of its production 
capacity for this purpose during the year. 
“we see it as our public duty to support the 
production of essential ppes during the 
coronavirus crisis. previously, producing 
nonwovens for ppes was merely a minor niche 
area, but its importance increased enormously 
in 2020. nonwovens are used for everything 
from face masks to one-piece body suits,” 
explains søgaard, and she expects the con-
sumption of ppes will remain high in 2021. 
she adds that fibertex personal care will step 
up the work on six selected sdgs, and that 
it’s the huge efforts and commitment of the 
company’s employees that drive forward the 
initiatives. 
esg gives 
a competitive 
edge
that others will follow. a certification like this 
gives us a distinct competitive edge, and it 
enables us to influence the development of 
our industry,” says mette due søgaard, qa & 
sustainability director with fibertex personal 
care, and she continues: 
“our certification reflects our continual focus 
on seeking new and sustainable solutions. 
our mindset is “sustainable is possible”, and 
in this case our focus on rethinking our supply 
chain of raw materials really paid off. 
how we prevent plastic waste
in 2020, fibertex personal care also played an 
active part in operation clean sweep, a global 
voluntary initiative to avoid plastics waste. 
initially, the company’s two largest production 
sites, in denmark and malaysia, participated. 
“at fibertex personal care, we handle more 
than 100,000 tonnes of plastic granulate every 
year. it is extremely important that we mini-
mise our use of plastic granulate so it doesn’t 
end up in the natural environment. supporting

fibertex nonwovens
i have had the pleasure of working in non-
wovens since the late 1980s when i got my 
first job with fibertex. over a period of more 
than 50 years, it has evolved into a high-tech 
performance material, and nonwovens made 
yet another breakthrough during 2020. at 
least, that is what it felt like for our company 
when the coronavirus pandemic triggered a 
dramatic increase in demand for ppes and 
disinfectants for the healthcare sector. 
many people know nonwovens as geotex-
tiles or as a component used in cars. today, 
however, nonwovens can also be used for 
many other purposes, such as filtrating micro 
or nanoparticles. for example, nonwovens 
may be designed for various types of face 
mask, such as to protect doctors or patients in 
critical situations, but everyday face masks will 
typically also contain nonwovens. 
transitioning production
demand surged already early in the year. 
healthcare authorities all over the world 
became aware that they had insufficient 
stocks of face masks, protective suits and 
other ppes, and a large number of companies 
were ordered to convert their productions. at 
fibertex nonwovens, we have been develop-
ing advanced products for the healthcare 
sector for several years, so we were able to 
convert production at our factories relatively 
quickly to help remedy the situation. we also 
began to work across our global organisa-
tion on developing new products. in 2020, 
we became a supplier to one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of respiratory protective 
devices, which actually makes me quite proud. 
manufacturing nonwovens for healthcare 
purposes is part of the value chain that is 
helping to mitigate the crisis, and for that 
reason, we were not subject to the restrictions 
that were imposed on other manufacturing 
businesses. in return, we were obliged to take 
extra precautions to protect our employees, 
and i am impressed by the efforts and the 
commitment that our employees have shown 
all over the world. i believe that everybody at 
fibertex nonwovens have felt that they made a 
difference and that we helped save lives. 
the world has become a better place
the coronavirus crisis has shown us that the 
world can unite when we are challenged by a 
common enemy. that makes me believe that 
one of the positive effects of the pandemic will 
be a greater focus on integrity and public spirit. 
integrity, responsibility and credibility are 
some of the key values that have always been 
at the heart of fibertex nonwovens. today, we 
can see that our values are being increasingly 
appreciated by our customers and stakehold-
ers. it has become a prerequisite for running a 
business, and that trend will benefit the neces-
sary sustainable transition.

green transition  
of global  
production
the green transition of the global production 
apparatus is well under way, and fibertex 
nonwovens’ products play a key role in many 
different industries, because nonwovens can 
replace a large number of environmentally 
damaging products. 
global emissions, for example of co2, have 
come to play an important role on the agenda 
at the united nations and in large parts of 
the world in recent years. at cop21 held in 
paris in 2015, 196 countries agreed to a new 
climate convention intended to limit the emis-
sions of greenhouse gases, partly through 
a green transition. several other important 
initiatives have been launched in the years that 
followed, including the eu’s green deal, which 
charts the course for making europe climate-
neutral by 2050:
“it’s difficult to point to one specific reason as 
to why climate has now become a joint, omni-
present item on the global agenda. rather, it’s 
likely a combination of factors all pointing in 
the same direction, but either way it is some-
thing we welcome and support wholeheart-
edly,” says lars bertelsen, coo at fibertex 
nonwovens. 
more eco-friendly materials
in different ways, fibertex nonwovens has 
taken part in the green transition for decades. 
the company’s products have played a part in 
passenger cars becoming lighter, in making 
the production of wind turbine blades efficient, 
and in achieving significantly better perfor-
mance in air filtration for industry and for 
personal comfort through the use of the latest 
in nanotechnology. 
“nonwovens is a fantastic product that can be 
designed for a large number of different prop-
erties. it can replace other, less eco-friendly 
materials; that is, materials that may have a 
greater environmental footprint, require the 
use of more raw materials or their properties 
are generally less beneficial. nonwovens can 
be used for a variety of purposes, and we see 
huge potential in the ongoing green transi-
tion,” he continues. 
our products are not just part of the green 
transition in other industries. for example, 
we’re currently working on a project that 
can make some of our products biodegrad-
able. we’ve had a good working relationship 
with the danish carpetmaker egetæpper on 
developing cradle-to-grave products,” he 
continues. 
in 2020, fibertex nonwovens completed the 
roll-out of an in-house code of conduct and 
a supplier code of conduct that will chart 
the course for the further development of 
the company and its supply chain towards 
becoming even more sustainable. 
green transition in-house
fibertex nonwovens has also commenced a 
green transition, because the production of 
nonwovens also has an environmental impact. 
the production process is very energy-inten-
sive, so the company is consistently working 
on new initiatives to reduce energy consump-
tion. in addition, fibertex nonwovens is 
working to find a way for biodegradable fibres 
to replace the oil-based plastic products that 
have traditionally formed part of nonwovens 
production: 
“climate change has always been high on our 
agenda and an important aspect of our dna.

we can probably agree it’s no exaggeration 
that 2020 turned out very differently to what 
we or anybody else had expected. the global 
coronavirus pandemic changed the founda-
tion for running a business, and our ability to 
implement a transition was put to the test. 
the most important test we faced was striking 
a balance between giving top priority to the 
safety of our employees while still keeping the 
wheels turning, if at all possible. the potential 
closure of one of our factories due to an infec-
tion outbreak would not just be detrimental 
to gpv. it would also impact our employees, 
their families, the local community as well as 
our customers and suppliers. i’m sure that 
everybody was fully aware of how serious that 
would have been. everyone behaved with 
appropriate caution, wanting to live up to our 
joint responsibility. if just one single unfor-
tunate employee was infected, it would have 
forced us to send 1,200 colleagues home for 
two weeks. 
part of a critical value chain
at gpv, we are usually not part of a value chain 
critical to keeping society running. so when in 
the second quarter, we received a giant order 
from a us-based manufacturer of ventila-
tors, we were suddenly faced with a task that 
was critical for covid-19 patients all over the 
world. quite simply, we felt that suddenly we 
would be helping to save lives. 
we won the order due to our strong reputation 
in the industry, and everyone teamed up to 
deliver it as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
we produced and delivered the order in record 
time, and i think this is one of the things we will 
all remember when we look back on 2020. 
giant strides
at gpv, 2020 was not just the year of the 
coronavirus. it was also the year when we took 
several important steps to operating more 
sustainably, both internally at gpv and exter-
nally in cooperation with our customers. an 
increasing number of the projects we design 
and the products we deliver solve challenges 
involving sustainability. 
internally, we have held a global competition 
among our employees to identify projects that 
can boost energy savings and automation. 
we received 31 proposals and no less than 
17 of these have been implemented, either at 
specific plants or at all our 13 sites. 
our wide range of activities means that we 
are involved in a large number of industries, 
but we have particular exposure to medtech, 
transport, industry and cleantech. many of our 
customers in these sectors have set ambitious 
esg targets, and we play a key role in helping 
them to achieve those targets. i am very proud 
of that, and it bears witness to the brand we 
have built across countries and continents.

sustainability is 
part of  
our dna
viktoriia shandyba, assembly worker, denmark
sustainability is nothing new to gpv. it is a 
fundamental aspect of our corporate culture 
which has evolved over many years, and it is 
absolutely crucial to the way gpv operates. 
integrity was key to how we operate at gpv 
long before sustainability became all the rage, 
says thomas bæk, the company’s director of 
strategy and business development and he 
continues:
“we have customers all over the world, and 
our people work on three different continents. 
that means it’s a challenge to guarantee all 
our customers the same excellent experience, 
top-level service and consistent high quality. 
however, we achieve that at gpv by having 
common rules, values and a firm position on 
integrity. implementing this approach, we all 
share the same responsibility.”
green transition also digital
gpv works with several major international 
players to promote the green transition by pro-
ducing electric modules or complete solutions 
it is absolutely fundamental for gpv that all 
employees are treated with decency and 
employed on equal terms. accordingly, two 
episodes of offensive behaviour reported by 
employees in 2020 were thoroughly investi-
gated. management decided to supplement 
the existing code of conduct with additional 
communication distributed to all levels of gpv 
which emphasised that gpv condemns all 
kinds of discrimination and offensive conduct. 
new ambitious targets 
gpv defined a number of ambitious targets in 
2016, including to bring down the number of 
industrial accidents and to reduce energy con-
sumption. at the time, the company had 6.9 
lost-time injuries (lti) per one million working 
hours, and a target was set to reduce that by 
50 percent by 2020. we achieved this target 
already in 2019 when the figure had dropped 
to 2.4. 
therefore, gpv is now defining new targets: 
“our experience shows that if we all work 
towards common goals, we’ll succeed beyond 
all expectations. this is true of our sustain-
ability targets and most recently during the 
coronavirus crisis, we can take pride in how 
we collaborated to solve the many challenges. 
that means we’re not afraid to set new ambi-
tious targets for the coming years. we’re look-
ing at a broad range of esg-related targets,” 
he concludes. 
for their products. sometimes, green transi-
tion and digital transformation are claimed to 
be opposites, but in our perspective at gpv, it 
is more a matter of mutual dependence.
“the green transition was created on an ideo-
logical foundation by people and businesses 
that recognised the need for change early on. 
the technology that will support the transition 
has seen fantastic developments, and manu-
facturers are better able to support the need 
than ever before, in part because several of its 
elements have been digitalised. for example, 
development, production and maintenance 
are based on much larger data volumes today, 
compiled through electronic solutions. at 
gpv, we’re proud of being part of this trend,” 
bæk explains.
proper conditions for employees
with sales, procurement and production units 
in nine countries and employees from many 
more cultures, diversity is a key characteristic 
of gpv’s employees who through their dif-
ferent views and ideas help to create the best 
solutions for the customers.

there have been some remarkable changes 
to the world we operate in during the eight 
years i have been with hydraspecma. par-
ticularly the last few years, the attitude to 
esg-related issues has changed a great deal, 
and we’re seeing positive effects from that at 
hydraspecma. 
financial performance remains top of the 
agenda for many businesses, but esg and 
integrity are becoming ever more important. 
it’s become much less acceptable to turn a 
profit at the expense of others or to the detri-
ment of the natural environment. you might 
think that it’s been like that for many years, 
but there are still many examples where heads 
of procurement get their bonuses based on 
whether stocks and materials are bought at 
the lowest possible prices with no considera-
tion for esg. 
from an immature to a  
mature global industry
at hydraspecma, we’ve benefitted more than 
most from recent years’ developments. a big 
part of our growth in the noughties and the 
tens was driven by denmark’s wind turbine 
adventure. our company has evolved within 
the sphere of world-leading wind turbine 
know-how, and we’ve been subcontractors to 
the largest danish wind turbine manufacturers 
for many years. initially, this was an immature 
industry, but it has become a multi-billion 
euro industry, and danish companies are still 
among the frontrunners globally. 
we would not be where we are today without 
the danish wind turbine industry. we have 
helped pioneer hydraulic solutions for wind 
turbines, and our global expansion was driven 
by the globalisation of the danish wind turbine 
industry. that has enabled us to build new 
relationships and develop new skills in a wide 
range of industries, and today we have opera-
tions in the nordic region, poland, the uk, 
china, india, brazil and the usa. 
honouring our nordic heritage
having a nordic background is gradually 
becoming an ever-greater advantage when 
companies around the world are looking for 
new suppliers. in the future, procurement 
managers will increasingly be measured 
on compliance and on the esg efforts of 
appointed suppliers. we’re already seeing this 
trend with several of our customers, as many 
of them have drawn up guidelines for compli-
ance with esg requirements in their overall 
evaluation of our bids for their orders. 
however, we cannot rely on our reputation and 
just rest on our laurels. we must consistently 
aim for ever higher standards and to achieve 
these, we need the will and commitment of 
everyone across the organisation. we face 
these important decisions on a daily basis. for 
example, we may sometimes get an “offer” to 
have our goods move faster through customs 
in distant markets, but there can be no doubt 
that we must consistently and firmly decline 
such offers. 
i have every confidence that these positive 
developments will continue, and the 2020s 
look to become the most sustainable decade 
in recent memory. that will benefit danish 
businesses and, not least, hydraspecma.

sustainable 
development
sustainable production may be likened to 
a huge wheel that’s been set in motion and 
needs to gather momentum in the years 
ahead. according to hydraspecma, it’s impor-
tant to keep in mind that perfect solutions may 
not be available yet. instead, the winners of 
the green transition will be those who manage 
to take many small steps in collaboration with 
their customers rather than expecting one 
giant stride to solve all issues in one fell swoop. 
“we’re all aware of the importance of the 
green transition, and that we must work 
together to develop industrial production 
that will minimise our impact on the natural 
environment and climate. however, it’s also 
important to accept that we don’t yet know 
all the phases we’ll have to go through to get 
there. the technology simply doesn’t exist 
yet,” explains daniel andreasen, head of 
group strategy & csr at hydraspecma. 
hybrids are low-hanging fruit
according to andreasen, electrification is one 
example of a final goal that’s not yet possible 
to achieve when it comes to heavy-duty and 
challenging assignments. electric power can-
not replace the extreme power that hydraulics 
can provide for heavy-duty industrial produc-
tion, for example, or for large contractor equip-
ment. instead, there’ll be some intermediate 
phases with hybrid machinery that’ll combine 
electric and hydraulic power. 
“undoubtedly, hybrids will be an important 
intermediate stage for the next ten or fifteen 
years.. an example of a hybrid might be the 
electrification of a machine’s propulsion, while 
the heavy-duty work functions would still rely 
on hydraulics. this is low-hanging fruit, and 
it’s the most efficient way to include green 
transition in our industry over the coming 
years,” andreasen continues. 
he adds that hydraspecma is currently run-
ning several projects for customers where 
parts of the product are electrified, while the 
hydraulics necessary for the rest of its func-
tions are optimised: 
“we’re currently compiling data, so we can get 
a more precise understanding of our climate 
footprint. the result is a whole new baseline 
for our efforts going forward, but it’s also given 
us a better overview of what we need to do 
over the next ten years in order to reach our 
goal. this exercise has the commitment and 
active participation of all our employees. at 
the same time, it’ll help us build knowledge 
that we can use when advising our custom-
ers,” he concludes. 
“we want to be frontrunners and to have the 
latest know-how when our customers seek 
our advice in this field. we must be able to 
apply electrification in a meaningful way, and 
we need to know the importance of energy 
optimisation, not least if energy becomes 
battery-driven,” he points out. 
ambitious goals to reduce  
co2 emissions by 2030
for hydraspecma, 2020 was the year of a new 
baseline value for the company’s co2 emis-
sions. the main emphasis in recent years has 
been on reducing energy consumption.

borg automotive
for many years, the automotive industry has 
been one of europe’s most important sectors. 
but the industry is challenged and like many 
other sectors, it’s in the midst of a green tran-
sition. this is where borg automotive plays a 
key role. 
it’s now forty-five years ago that our company 
was started at a small auto repair shop in den-
mark. i often wonder if they realised back then 
how visionary they were. reconditioning spare 
parts for cars isn’t something we invented, 
but we’ve played a part in making remanu-
factured spare parts a full-fledged alternative 
to factory-fresh parts. we’ve industrialised 
remanufacturing, and we’ve implemented 
quality assurance to such an extent that a 
remanufactured core is considered to be at 
least as good as a new part. 
you might say that the greater the business 
volume we get at borg automotive, the more 
circular the european car fleet becomes. 
europe has about 280 million cars on the road 
today, and a large proportion of them has one 
or more parts replaced every year. a crucial 
point here is whether those spare parts are 
factory fresh and shipped to europe from 
china, or if they are remanufactured from 
defective spare parts from europe and reused. 
at borg automotive, we remanufacture two 
million cores per year, and for each of them, 
we use up to 85% less energy than it takes to 
produce a new part. in addition, remanufac-
turing saves raw materials, reduces freight 
and eliminates the environmental impact of 
scrapping cars.
intending to grow to twice  
our size by 2025
we’d like to contribute even more to the green 
transition, so we’re currently in the process of 
expanding the scope of our business. in fact, 
our ambition is to grow it fivefold by 2025. 
we took the first big step in september 2020 
when we signed a deal to acquire turbo motor 
inyección, a spanish company specialising 
in the remanufacture of turbochargers. the 
transaction has given us a seventh leg as well 
as access to a large customer base in south-
ern europe, where we can also market our 
other products, i.e. brake callipers, starters, 
alternators, etc. 
it’s important to note that we expect to grow 
the business of our product range by 10% to 
15% over each of the next five years. in other 
words, we intend to outperform the overall 
market for turbocharger replacements, and 
we have a clear ambition to take market share 
from factory-fresh turbochargers for the ben-
efit of the green transition. 
i’m proud to be playing a part in driving the 
green transition in one of europe’s most 
important industry sectors, and i feel privi-
leged to contribute to expanding it on a daily 
basis.

growing  
the circular 
economy
marcin parada, electromechanic, poland
borg automotive is trending for growth, and 
in recent years, the company has focused on 
getting ready for both organic growth and 
integration of acquisitions in an effort to help 
grow europe’s circular economy. 
large parts of the business sector are under-
way with the green transition. some have been 
working on it for several years, while others 
are just beginning. not so at borg automotive. 
the business model has been based on the 
circular economy even since the company was 
founded in 1975, and there’s no exaggera-
tion in saying that the company’s values and 
culture favour the circular mindset. 
employees the top priority
borg automotive remanufactures about two 
million cores every year and is europe’s largest 
independent automotive remanufacturing 
company. the plan is to build on that position 
in the coming years, and preparations for that 
move have long been underway. 
improved quality standards. obviously, you 
don’t get results from day one, but at borg 
automotive we dare take a long-term view. 
a fundamental value of our strong corporate 
culture is that we’re more ‘farmers’ than ‘hunt-
ers’.” 
gentle method gives competitive edge
concurrently with the organisational improve-
ments, borg automotive is consistently work-
ing to optimise work processes in production. 
the more competitive the remanufactured 
cores are, the more sustainable the european 
car fleet becomes. borg automotive is cur-
rently implementing a new and more gentle 
method in the remanufacturing of aluminium 
cores: 
“many brake callipers are made of aluminium, 
which is a soft metal that’s easily damaged 
when cleaned. many of our competitors 
choose to replace parts of brake callipers with 
new components, but that means they forfeit 
part of the benefit,” explains højland, and he 
continues: 
“together with a danish company, we’ve 
developed a new and gentler cleaning method 
that allows us to reuse more of the brake 
callipers we take in. at the same time, our cus-
tomers get a much cleaner product, so there’s 
no question about the quality of the remanu-
factured core, and that’s extremely important 
to us,” he concludes.
“we’ve implemented a large number of initia-
tives to professionalise our organisation and 
our manufacturing processes. for example, 
we’ve spent the past two or three years docu-
menting all the processes and procedures of 
our erp system and our catalogue platform in 
order to be able to quickly and easily imple-
ment our best practise across all factory 
sites. that also goes for the latest addition to 
our family, turbo motor inyección,” explains 
sten højland, director of compliance at borg 
automotive. 
højland is in charge of a full range of esg ini-
tiatives, and employee satisfaction is one area 
that both he and the company consider to be 
very important: 
“employee satisfaction is at the heart of 
everything we do, because it benefits our 
employees, our company and our customers. 
through various proactive initiatives, we’ve 
successfully lifted employee satisfaction, 
reduced sickness absence and staff turnover, 
while also achieving greater efficiency and

actions and results in 2020
at schouw & co., our core ambition is to run a 
sound and responsible business with a long-
term perspective. the group’s businesses 
have traditionally worked on the aspects of 
corporate responsibility that have been most 
relevant to the individual company, and their 
reporting has been based on their specific 
core stakeholders, typically big customers or 
community or public-authority stakeholders.
in 2016, the group’s businesses drafted a 
joint set of general policies on corporate 
responsibility. the next step was to set up a 
cr strategy house that provided the founda-
tion for the group’s cr efforts, and each of the 
six businesses selected individual perfor-
mance indicators with defined targets for 
2020. the individual performance indicators 
were particularly focused on reducing energy 
consumption and waste volumes, increasing 
recycling and, not least, improving work safety. 
during the intervening years, the businesses 
have regularly reported on their individual 
performance indicators, and this year, we can 
report on the results of these efforts.
the table on page 39 provides a simple pres-
entation of each company’s results, mainly 
consisting of indexed values showing relative 
developments over time. in most cases, the 
businesses have succeeded in meeting their 
individual targets, while in others, they failed 
for various reasons, such as major changes to 
their business activities. whether or not the 
targets were met in absolute figures, there’s 
little doubt that the ongoing measurements 
and the efforts derived have provided valuable 
awareness of the important esg journey that 
our group, and society at large, will have to 
make in the coming years.
recent years’ esg efforts across the group 
have provided a solid base from which to 
define a more comprehensive field of perfor-
mance indicators for our future efforts. on 
page 40, we introduce the new data structure 
that will be the baseline for future years’ meas-
urements. on pages 35 to 38, we review the 
specific actions and results for 2020 of each of 
the businesses in the four general cr areas of 
human rights, social issues and labour condi-
tions, anti-corruption and business ethics, and 
climate and the environment.

human rights
a c t i o n s  a n d  r e s u l t s  i n  2 0 2 0
schouw & co. operates businesses in many 
different countries around the world, but 
regardless of which country we operate in, we 
endeavour to observe human rights and to 
treat our employees with dignity and respect. 
with the aid of a major cross-organisation 
project, we implemented a new structure for 
our work on human rights in 2017–2018, in 
which our individual companies identified 
and described in detail the potential negative 
impacts they might have on human rights, 
both in relation to our own employees and also 
in their relationships with suppliers, customers 
and the surrounding community. the busi-
nesses considered how they could monitor 
and reduce potentially negative impacts. 
this project gave the group’s businesses 
a good platform from which to evaluate 
subsequent developments and identify new 
potential risks. in 2020, the group expanded 
these activities, but did so within existing 
areas of activity, so the general risk exposure 
for the group is considered to be unchanged. 
as a result, the work on human rights in 2020 
mainly continued previous efforts. below are 
selected examples of the specific actions and 
the results achieved by the individual busi-
nesses.
the coronavirus pandemic has had implica-
tions on a global scale that may have affected 
the general human rights situation in cer-
tain countries. some of the group’s busi-
nesses responded by launching initiatives in 
local communities, but those initiatives are 
described in the section on social issues and 
labour conditions. 
biomar is a global business committed to 
operating in a manner that may inspire oth-
ers. emphasis is on safeguarding human 
rights and taking advantage of a diversified 
workforce. aiming to step up its focus on 
human rights even further, biomar decided 
in 2020 to become an active member of the 
nordic business network for human rights, 
which is facilitated by the danish institute 
for human rights and whose membership 
base includes a large number of prominent 
nordic companies. through this membership, 
biomar expects to share experiences on best 
practices and shared ambitions.  
 
biomar doesn’t accept discrimination or 
harassment and always strives to be impar-
tial in its decision-making. gender diversity 
in management is a particular area of focus 
at biomar, and the proportion of women in 
management positions was increased for the 
fourth consecutive year. in 2020, the propor-
tion of women in management exceeded the 
general proportion of women in the company 
overall. however, female representation in 
the uppermost tiers of management is still 
relatively low, though diversity is quite high on 
the executive team in the sense that thirteen 
different nationalities are represented. 
fibertex personal care thoroughly reviewed 
and tightened its supplier management 
processes in 2019, including by implement-
ing a new and expanded supplier code of 
conduct. in addition to the code of conduct, 
the improved supplier management includes 
procedures for evaluating existing suppliers 
and for approving new suppliers. the new 
supplier management concept was imple-
mented in denmark and malaysia in 2020, and 
implementation will continue in 2021 at the 
sites in germany and the united states.
fibertex personal care has consistently 
worked to apply good procedures for pro-
tecting personal data since the general 
data processing regulation (gdpr) took 
effect. in 2020, the internal procedures were 
reviewed to clarify the ongoing work on gdpr. 
fibertex personal care aims to treat data on 
all employees, whether or not they are eu 
citizens, in a way that takes into account the 
right of the individual to a secure and respect-
ful treatment of their personal data. work has 
begun to align procedures at all locations in 
order to ensure that personal data is pro-
cessed in a uniform manner. 
fibertex nonwovens aims to promote a 
diverse organisation where the employees 
are able to apply and develop their skills in the 
best possible way free from discrimination of 
any kind. the company continued its efforts 
to promote human rights during 2020 and 
focused particularly on launching initiatives 
that can ensure uniform global treatment in 
prioritised areas even though the scope for 
running a business varies from country to 
country. all employees have the opportunity 
to call attention to potential issues, without 
necessarily having to take it up with their 
immediate superiors. employees may contact 
a well-defined hse unit or use the more for-
malised whistle-blower system. 
the other businesses have continued their 
work from previous years of applying the 
group’s policy on human rights, mainly in their 
own business units, but also upstream in the 
supplier chain.

at schouw & co., we believe that results are 
created by people. we aim to be a responsible 
employer and to provide proper employment 
conditions, healthy and safe working condi-
tions and a motivational working environment 
for our employees.
in 2020, however, the coronavirus pandemic 
gave a whole new perspective on our work on 
social issues and labour conditions. several 
of the group’s businesses were classified 
as critical industry which implied a special 
obligation to ensure employee health and 
safety so operations could continue. in several 
countries, the pandemic had such a severe 
impact on society that businesses had to take 
on special obligations in their local communi-
ties. the cases referred to below are selected 
examples on actual actions taken and results 
achieved by the individual schouw & co. busi-
nesses.
biomar was categorised as critical industry of 
importance to food production. the com-
pany’s production units were exempt from 
restrictions, but in return biomar had to take 
on the heavy responsibility of protecting its 
employees’ health and safety. thorough risk 
assessments were made and extensive safety 
precautions were taken in close dialogue 
with trade organisations and employees. the 
measures taken were extremely successful, 
and biomar managed to maintain near-normal 
operations throughout the year. the added 
focus on health and safety has also had a 
positive impact on lost-time injuries, which is 
currently at its lowest in a decade.
biomar is acutely aware that its responsibility 
extends beyond its own workforce. in the bat-
tle against the coronavirus pandemic, biomar 
has supported local communities at several of 
its factory locations around the world, mainly 
in chile, ecuador, costa rica and russia 
where support included food, medical equip-
ment and educational activities.
fibertex personal care was exempt from 
restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, 
being a supplier to the hygiene industry. this 
prompted the company to pay extra atten-
tion to employee health and safety, especially 
for employees manning critical functions 
requiring a physical presence, leading to the 
implementation of a number of practical safety 
measures. the company has also developed 
alternative solutions to promote well-being 
and social cohesion during the period, as 
ordinary social activities were restricted due to 
the pandemic. 
recent years’ downward trend in lost-time 
injuries (lti) continued in 2020. in order to 
further reduce lti, focus in 2020 was on 
promoting a sound safety culture and making 
technical improvements at the factory sites.
fibertex nonwovens had a particular focus 
on maintaining safe working conditions 
during the coronavirus pandemic with the 
ambition that all employees in all production 
units should feel safe when doing their jobs. 
it was important to keep production running 
at a high level, as a large proportion is used 
in products for the healthcare sector. strict 
internal procedures have been implemented 
since the pandemic broke out. for example, 
external visits are now kept to a minimum, and 
fibertex nonwovens has drawn up a preven-
tion guide setting out guidelines for employ-
ees and visitors.
at the factories in the czech republic, the 
usa, turkey, brazil and south africa, the com-
pany has implemented dedicated safety cam-
paigns in recent years with a view to reducing 
the number of occupational injuries, and in 
2020, it introduced new security measures for 
visitors at all factory sites. in addition, fibertex 
nonwovens began work on a global health 
& safety policy, which will be implemented in 
early 2021.
gpv added to its focus on working condi-
tions in 2020, starting the implementation of 
uniform follow-up procedures on health and 
safety across all production sites, including 
reporting procedures in order to implement 
preventive actions and secure learning. obvi-
ously, the coronavirus pandemic had a very 
noticeable impact on 2020, and gpv took 
extensive steps to safeguard health and safety 
while also supporting local communities near 
its factories in vulnerable countries. 
hydraspecma began implementing a new 
central hr system in 2020 to support the 
ongoing development of its hr processes. 
naturally, focus in 2020 was also on taking the 
necessary precautions to ensure safe opera-
tions during the coronavirus pandemic and 
on the well-being of the many employees who 
were forced to work from home during these 
unprecedented times.
production at borg automotive is character-
ised by many manual processes that are not 
easily automated. as a result, there is an inher-
ent risk of industrial injuries, and even though 
all lost-time injuries in 2020 were of a less seri-
ous nature, the company performs a thorough 
investigation and root cause analysis for every 
incident in order to take action to prevent simi-
lar incidents in the future. the company also 
implemented a number of initiatives to protect 
its employees from covid-19 infection, 
including by reorganising work stations and 
office space to facilitate physical distancing.

anti-corruption and business ethics
over the years, schouw & co. has built a 
reputation as a company maintaining a high 
degree of integrity and ethical conduct. we 
combat all forms of corruption, including 
bribery and facilitation payments.
schouw & co.’s vision is to be among the best 
to create value in a proper and decent manner, 
and this vision is firmly anchored in the way 
schouw & co. does business.
codes of conduct
anti-corruption and business ethics are 
considered fundamental requirements, and 
all group businesses are expected to meet 
the same high standards. each company has 
drawn up and implemented detailed codes of 
conduct and the day-to-day work on anti-
corruption and business ethics is largely to 
maintain the high standards. 
all group businesses work to ensure that their 
employees stay updated on their company’s 
code of conduct. gpv used e-learning to 
update its employees in 2020, while other 
companies updated their people by other 
means. the schouw & co. group has expo-
sure to many countries and different cultures 
where views on how to run a business may 
differ widely. obviously, our businesses are 
fully aware of this, and they all make concerted 
efforts to ensure that we act in a trustworthy 
manner and with integrity at all our units any-
where in the world.
some of our businesses have revised and 
tightened their internal guidelines to prevent 
sexual harassment. in 2020, fibertex nonwo-
vens and gpv both added new policies on this 
issue to their existing codes of conduct. 
supplier codes of conduct
our businesses’ internal codes of conduct are 
an important prerequisite for our operations, 
but the companies also have a duty to inspire 
suppliers and business partners to apply 
similar high standards. fortunately, the nature 
of the group’s operations means that most of 
its suppliers are professional businesses that 
have implemented good standards them-
selves.
nevertheless, our businesses operate with 
specific supplier codes of conduct which are 
updated regularly to reflect developments in 
their business and other matters. they go to 
great lengths to ensure that all suppliers and 
business partners conduct their businesses 
correctly in compliance with legislation and 
generally accepted standards.
all the group’s businesses worked on this 
issue during 2020, including not least on fol-
lowing up on the development of procedures 
and compliance by suppliers and business 
partners. for example, biomar evaluates all 
suppliers on working conditions and potential 
violations of human rights, although most 
evaluations in 2020 were made virtually. 
biomar also prepared an update of its supplier 
code of conduct to new standards with greater 
emphasis on esg in 2021. as a second con-
crete example, fibertex personal care imple-
mented a new supplier management concept 
in 2020, including a new and expanded 
supplier code of conduct at the factories in 
denmark and malaysia, and implementation 
will continue in 2021 at the sites in germany 
and the united states.
whistleblower system
at schouw & co., we want to promote open-
ness and responsibility in everything we do, 
and we want to foster an open culture based 
on dialogue in which everyone is free to speak 
up without any risk of reprisals. this means 
that employees at the group’s businesses 
should feel safe in contacting management if 
they wish to bring up an issue. 
however, we will always respect an employee’s 
feelings, if anyone would prefer to raise an 
issue anonymously. consequently, schouw 
& co. established a whistle-blower system in 
2019, enabling all employees and other stake-
holders to submit anonymous reports based 
on knowledge of – or a reasonable suspicion 
of – serious and unacceptable conditions or 
unlawful acts related to the schouw & co. 
group. the whistleblower system is managed 
by the group’s parent company. it is accessible 
in all relevant languages and can be used to 
report on all units of the group in all countries. 
obviously, getting the benefits of a whistle-
blower system requires broad awareness 
of the scheme. as a result, we endeavoured 
to increase awareness of the whistleblower 
system across the group during 2020, hoping 
it may become a valuable addition to the direct 
access to management.

schouw & co.’s portfolio companies are to a 
wide extent involved in large-scale process-
ing of commodities, and we recognise the 
environmental impact of our production pro-
cesses. our policy on climate and the environ-
ment goes hand in hand with good business 
acumen. we work to protect the environment 
and to reduce gradually our consumption and 
emissions relative to our production output.
all the group’s companies focus on minimis-
ing their climate and environmental footprint, 
typically by reducing consumption and 
emissions or by increasing recycling. below 
are selected examples of the specific actions 
taken and the results achieved by the indi-
vidual businesses. 
biomar reused existing infrastructure (roads, 
drainage, foundations, etc.) when construct-
ing its new production facilities in a disused 
industrial park in wesley vale, tasmania, 
thereby requiring fewer resources to build the 
plant. 
biomar continued to focus on enhancing 
its energy efficiency in 2020. however, the 
company’s performance was impacted by 
volume changes during the initial phase of the 
coronavirus pandemic in combination with 
reduced start-up volumes on the new produc-
tion lines in australia and ecuador, and the 
improvements achieved did not translate into 
improved efficiency for the year. in august, the 
facility in scotland converted from conven-
tional sources of energy to certified power 
from wind turbines, which is expected to 
reduce the site’s future annual co2 emissions 
by more than 30%. in addition, biomar set up a 
working group of key personnel charged with 
developing a long-term strategy for the efforts 
to reduce emissions.
in 2019, fibertex personal care implement-
ed a more sustainable logistics solution with a 
major plastics supplier that will see transports 
by sea rather than by road. the company has 
looked into the potential for more sustainable 
logistics solutions with other suppliers and 
in 2021 expects to replace additional road 
transports with rail. 
in denmark and germany, fibertex per-
sonal care is certified to the iso 50001 
energy management standard, and is strongly 
focused on reducing its energy consumption 
in both countries. specific steps taken in 2020 
included insulation of processing equipment 
and replacement of motors and pumps. in 
addition, a potential project involving waste 
heat is taking shape, as the company is inves-
tigating the possibility of working together 
with aalborg forsyning, a local utility. also, 
in 2020, fibertex personal care became the 
first nonwovens manufacturer to be certi-
fied to the iscc plus standard, enabling it to 
manufacture and sell products with a lower 
co2 footprint.
in 2020, fibertex personal care began the 
installation of more than 4,000 solar panels 
on the roof of its factory in nilai, malaysia. the 
solar panels cover an area of about 10,000 
m2 and are expected to produce about 2,600 
mwh of green power to be consumed by the 
factory.
reducing its resource consumption and the 
environmental impact of its products and 
processes at all production units is an ongo-
ing task at fibertex nonwovens. specific 
results in 2020 include the reduction of idle 
consumption of its ventilation system in the 
production, adjusting the flue of a thermo-
setting kiln and the continued replacement 
of conventional fluorescent lighting with led 
lighting. in addition, the factory in denmark 
was recertified to the iso 50001 standard on 
energy management in 2020.
fibertex nonwovens’ danish operations have 
been certified to the iso 14001 environ-
mental management standard for nearly two 
decades. its factories in france, the czech 
republic, turkey and brazil are also certi-
fied to the iso 14001 standard. in the usa, 
preparations for iso 14001 certification of the 
ingleside factory began in 2020, but for practi-
cal reasons, the certification is not expected to 
be implemented until in 2022. 
gpv continued to work on reducing its 
consumption of water and energy in 2020, 
achieving the expected savings in both areas. 
like other of the group’s businesses, gpv 
is certified to the iso 14001 environmental 
management standard, and the company 
takes a systematic approach to improving its 
performance in this area, including by increas-
ing the recycling of waste materials. 
hydraspecma worked to establish a new 
model for recording and reporting on its 
consumption and emissions that can provide 
a foundation for future action plans for 
improvements in this areas. in addition, hydra-
specma has converted its largest facility from 
gas heating to district heating. it is currently 
building new regional headquarters in sweden 
based on the latest climate standards, which 
will also help to improve its climate footprint, 
once the new site replaces the existing facility.
borg automotive’s business model is based 
on the circular economy. borg automotive 
remanufactures used automotive spare parts, 
which has an extremely positive effect on the 
environment by requiring fewer resources. the 
notion of recycling and reduced consumption 
is also reflected in borg automotive’s day-to-
day operations. current efforts in this context 
include reusing pallets in the uk rather than

strategy for our cr efforts
when the companies of the schouw & co. 
group adopted a general set of corporate 
responsibility policies in 2016, schouw & co. 
set up a cr strategy house to provide the 
basis for the group’s long-term cr efforts.
the cr strategy house has a traditional design 
with the group’s policies and systems as its 
base and with two cr areas – human rights 
and anti-corruption and business ethics – as 
fundamental requirements for the group.
the columns of the cr house comprise the 
cr areas of social issues and labour condi-
tions along with climate and the environment, 
areas in which the portfolio companies are 
given considerable autonomy in determin-
ing what is most relevant for their particular 
business. 
lastly, the roof of the cr strategy house 
represents the general vision for responsi-
bility, for which schouw & co. wants to be 
among the best to create value in a proper and 
decent manner by committing itself and its 
businesses to taking responsibility and acting 
sustainably, while also creating a motivational 
working environment.

meaningful data
for a focused business, it makes very good 
sense to assess specific data for consump-
tion of materials, energy, water, etc. a precise 
measurement of consumption can be made 
relative to production output, for example in 
tonnes, square metres, units or other relevant 
reference. sometimes good references from 
similar production outputs may even be avail-
able for comparison purposes.
it may be difficult for a diversified conglomer-
ate like schouw & co. to assess consolidated 
consumption values, and often revenue will be 
the only common value to express produc-
tion outputs across diverse companies. nor 
will there typically be meaningful references 
available with which to compare consolidated 
figures.
if, for example, an energy-intensive process 
production were measured in combination 
with a pure trading company, a potential 
shift in weighting between the two opera-
tions would affect the resulting consolidated 
consumption values. a situation could well 
arise where all businesses of the conglomer-
ate reduce their relative energy consumption, 
while the consolidated consumption would 
still increase due to a shift in the relative 
weighting of the businesses.
nevertheless, the only feasible method is to 
show the figures as they are. this provides a 
performance indication for each business, and 
over time, it shows the relative performance of 
the businesses. the consolidated figures will 
then merely reflect the sum of the parts.
a new frame of reference
the companies of the group joined forces in 
2020 to define a new frame of reference for 
their continued efforts on esg. they found 
inspiration for the project in nasdaq’s esg 
reporting guide 2.0, which proposes ten 
performance indicators for each of the three 
general esg areas: environmental (e), social 
(s) and corporate governance (g). 
using this as our starting point, we defined 
a number of performance indicators for the 
three esg areas, which are presented in the 
following pages. for most of the indicators, 
detailed figures and information are provided 
for each of the six portfolio businesses, while 
a few performance indicators are relevant only 
at group level.
in particular, the environmental area con-
tains a lot of data, which we have aimed to 
present as fairly as possible. we have done 
that by compiling actual consumption data 
from production units and offices worldwide, 
meaning that this reporting reflects the same 
consolidation values as shown in the consoli-
dated annual report. for certain smaller units 
with limited consumption, the data provided 
may be estimates. on account of the large 
number of units and their different geographi-
cal locations, the figures will initially be subject 
to some degree of uncertainty, but with 
practical experience and improved calculation 
conventions, the data precision is expected to 
improve over time. 
reporting on consumption and emissions in 
the environment area are currently limited to 
scope 1 (process emissions and combus-
tion on own fixed installations) and scope 2 
(procurement of electric power and district 
heating). based on a materiality assessment 
and for comparison purposes, consumption 
and emissions from own means of transport 
are not included because most of the group’s 
transports are performed by third parties. in 
preparing the reporting, we sought inspiration 
from the greenhouse gas protocol, and in the 
calculation of emissions, we used emission 
factors from the iea (international energy 
agency).
dynamic reporting
the reporting provided in the following pages 
makes up the data we are able to calculate for 
2020, and which can be used as a baseline 
for assessing potential improvements in the 
coming years. the data are presented without 
historical data and initially without defined tar-
gets, but obviously with the implied expecta-
tion that all our businesses will report substan-
tial improvements over the coming years.
esg reporting is still in its infancy, unlike 
traditional financial reporting for which well-
established practices based on internationally 
recognised principles have evolved over many 
years. many different organisations and other 
stakeholders have their own views on how 
esg reporting should ideally be made. many 
of their preferences involve high complexity 
and are often better suited for a focused busi-
ness rather than a diversified conglomerate. 
we anticipate that generally recognised 
practices on esg reporting will evolve gradu-
ally over the coming years, and we expect to 
adapt our reporting accordingly over a period 
of time. in the meantime, we will first and fore-
most endeavour to measure and report on the 
data we believe will have the most value for our 
businesses in their efforts to ensure long-term 
sustainability in their operations.

responsibility policies, schouw &

assessment of these corporate 
responsibility areas. the group 
expanded its business operations 
in 2020, but did so within existing 
areas of activity, so the general 
risk exposure is unchanged. the 
principal risks are described below

our values and our objective of ensuring sustainable and responsible con-
duct. the policies describe a number of guidelines and general expecta-
tions we have to each other, and it summarises how we should conduct 
ourselves in our respective roles as employees and as an employer. the

climate and the environment
schouw & co.’s portfolio companies are to a 
wide extent involved in large-scale processing 
of commodities, and we recognise the envi-
ronmental impact of our production process-
es. our policy on climate and the environment 
goes hand in hand with good business acu-
men. we work to protect the environment and 
to reduce our emissions continuously relative 
to our production output.
schouw & co. has performed a general risk 
assessment in relation to climate and the 
environment. due to the extensive use of oil-
based products and marine raw materials and 
the considerable consumption of energy for 
processing purposes, this area is considered 
to make up a significant risk for the majority of 
the group’s businesses.
it is inherent to and an integral part of the 
group’s business model that we seek to opti-
mise consumption of raw materials and mini-
mise the volume of waste in an effort to reduce 
the relative volume of energy consumed, 
reducing the impact on climate and the 
environment and lowering the relative volume 
of greenhouse gas emissions. going forward, 
our individual companies will maintain their 
focus on improving their performance in terms 
of climate and the environment.
pursuant to section 99a of the danish 
financial statements act
social issues and labour conditions 
at schouw & co., we believe that results are 
created by people. we aim to be a responsible 
employer and to provide proper employment 
conditions, healthy and safe working condi-
tions and a motivational working environment 
for our employees.
schouw & co. has performed a general risk 
assessment in relation to social issues and 
labour conditions. at schouw & co., we 
believe our employees constitute our most 
important asset. as a result, we consider risks 
relating to social issues and labour condi-
tions to be of material importance. the large 
proportion of automated production and the 
handling of many different technical products 
make heavy demands on our employees’ 
qualifications and skills. in europe as well as 
in all of our other countries of operation, we 
generally employ skilled labour and well-
trained employees who acquire the necessary 
skills by undergoing teaching and training, 
thereby enabling our portfolio companies to 
comply with their quality and safety standards. 
this contributes to ensuring and maintaining 
a high level of health and safety, and constant 
efforts are made to minimise risks in this field.
anti-corruption and business ethics 
over the years, schouw & co. has built a 
reputation as a company maintaining a high 
degree of integrity and ethical conduct. we 
combat all forms of corruption, including 
bribery and facilitation payments. 
schouw & co. has performed a general risk 
assessment in relation to corruption and 
business ethics. schouw & co.’s vision is to 
be among the best to create value in a proper 
and reliable manner by committing ourselves 
and our businesses to taking responsibility 
and acting sustainably in all the countries we 
operate in.
based on the group’s general business model 
and its long-standing tradition for responsible 
business operations, this area is not assessed 
to constitute a significant risk, with the excep-
tion of the inherent risk that not all employees 
– and especially not new employees – may be 
aware of the group’s policy. hence, appro-
priate provision of information is required to 
ensure that schouw & co.’s high standards 
are maintained.
corporate responsibility policies and risk assessments
human rights
schouw & co. operates in a number of dif-
ferent countries worldwide. regardless of 
which country we operate in, we endeavour to 
observe human rights and to treat our employ-
ees with dignity and respect. we support 
and respect the protection of internationally 
proclaimed human rights as set out in the un 
universal declaration of human rights and 
in the declarations and recommendations of 
the ilo. 
schouw & co. has performed a general 
risk assessment in relation to human rights. 
the group has operations in many different 
countries, including some that may be defined 
as high-risk countries. the production units 
of our portfolio companies generally operate 
on a very similar basis, and we strive to uphold 
the same high standards at all production 
units, regardless of geographical affiliation. 
the latter is believed to contribute to reducing 
the risk of adverse human rights impacts.

report on the company’s diversity policy
diversity at schouw & co. 
in january 2019, the board of directors of 
schouw & co. adopted a policy for ensuring 
relevant diversity at the company’s manage-
ment levels as published on the company’s 
website: www.schouw.dk/cg2020. the policy 
explicitly applies to schouw & co., and given 
the moderate size of the company’s organisa-
tion and the resulting simple management 
structure, the use of the term “management 
levels” refers only to the board of directors 
and the executive management.
the purpose of this policy is to increase 
and safeguard value creation in schouw & 
co. through a responsible focus on relevant 
diversity at the company’s management levels 
as a supporting factor for diversity, breadth 
of competencies and for enhancing dialogue, 
knowledge sharing and risk management.
schouw & co. strives to have diversity in the 
company’s management levels that will ensure 
a broad range of competencies, views and 
experiences. broad representation of educa-
tional and business backgrounds, age and 
gender as well as both national and interna-
tional experience at the management levels 
is a big priority. the company aims to ensure, 
among other things, that its members possess 
adequate collective knowledge, professional 
skills and experience to be able to understand 
the company’s activities and the risks associ-
ated with them.
 
the policy is supplemented by “competency 
profile for the board of directors of schouw & 
moreover, in any appointment, whether made 
in-house or externally, the emphasis should 
be on diversity, including gender distribution, 
to the widest possible extent. in its targets 
and efforts on diversity, schouw & co. aims 
to attract a diversified group of applicants 
for management positions in the group and 
to avoid barriers of opinion and assumptions 
(whether or not deliberate) that would restrict 
diversity or counteract equal employment or 
career opportunities, regardless of age, sen-
iority, gender, ethnicity or other factors.
 
historically, the efforts to increase diversity in 
the group have centred on improving the gen-
der distribution, as was also the case in 2020. 
the detailed report on actions and results can 
be found in the following report prepared in 
accordance with section 99b of the danish 
financial statements act. 
co.” which is also available from the com-
pany’s website and which sets out the general 
qualifications and competencies that are 
taken into account when members are elected 
to the company’s board of directors.
the policy is reviewed and reassessed by the 
board of directors once a year, most recently 
in november 2020 when the review did not 
give rise to any changes.
no changes were made in 2020 to the com-
pany’s board of directors or its executive 
management.
diversity across the group 
the intentions of the policy inherently apply to 
the entire group, and the main points of the 
policy have therefore been communicated 
to the group companies by way of internal 
guidelines that specify the following, among 
other things:
the company will always want to have the 
group’s management positions filled by the 
most qualified candidates. the fundamen-
tal component in any job appointment is a 
competence assessment that is based on 
the assignments and the context in which 
the new manager will perform his/her role. 
pursuant to section 107d of the danish 
financial statements act
this stately historic mansion 
located at chr. filtenborgs plads 
1 in aarhus, denmark serves as 
schouw & co.’s corporate head-
quarters. in addition to being the 
workplace of the parent company’s 
14 employees, the location is very 
often used for meetings by all of the 
group’s portfolio companies.

report on management’s gender composition
targets for management’s  
gender composition
in 2017, the board of directors of schouw & 
co. set the following targets for the gender 
composition of its management: for the 
measurement period from 1 april 2017 to 
31 march 2021, the target is to increase the 
number of female board members of the par-
ent company schouw & co. from one member 
currently, equal to at least 14%, to at least two 
members, equal to at least 28%. a target has 
also been set for the group that all of its dan-
ish reporting class c companies should have 
at least one female board member, equal to 
at least 20%. at the start of the measurement 
period, none of these companies had female 
board members. no changes were made in 
2020 to the composition of the board of direc-
tors of schouw & co. the board still has six 
members, one of whom is female.
the group has seven danish companies in 
the relevant reporting class: they are biomar 
group a/s, biomar a/s, fibertex personal 
care a/s, fibertex nonwovens a/s, gpv 
international a/s, hydraspecma a/s and borg 
automotive holding a/s, each of which have 
traditionally had from three to five sharehold-
er-elected board members. at the beginning 
of 2020, these boards of directors had no 
female board members. as part of manage-
ment succession in hydraspecma in 2020, 
the resigning ceo, who is male, was elected 
to the board of directors. in addition, a male 
board member with special competencies and 
insights considered to be relevant for the busi-
ness area was elected to the board of directors 
the group’s portfolio companies are aware of 
and aim to comply with the intentions of the 
general policy to the extent that this is possible 
without violating their own specific internal 
policies, serving the purpose of demonstrat-
ing that the companies do not discriminate. 
the group has previously had an international 
talent development programme, which had 
a large proportion of female participants, but 
due to the coronavirus situation, the pro-
gramme could not be run in 2020. 
the parent company schouw & co. is of a 
modest size. the organisation consists of sev-
eral experts in senior management positions, 
some of which are female. however, they are 
not included in the table, as the definition of 
management is based on a formal direct man-
agement responsibility for other employees. 
of hydraspecma at the end of 2020. no other 
new board appointments were made in the 
portfolio companies in 2020.
in january 2021, the board of directors of 
schouw & co. decided to retain the targets for 
the gender composition of its management for 
the measurement period running from 1 april 
2021 to 31 march 2025.
policy for increasing the proportion  
of the underrepresented gender
the policy to ensure relevant diversity at the 
company’s management levels sets out the 
objective criteria for job appointments. the 
purpose of the policy is also to promote a 
desired development in cases where the com-
position of senior managers is not aligned with 
the company’s general employee mix, and it 
specifies as follows:
schouw & co. is aware that the ratio of 
women at senior management levels in the 
group is proportionately lower than the 
gender composition of the group’s employ-
ees in general. as a result, the schouw & co. 
group’s portfolio companies will make a spe-
cial effort to create a framework to support 
the career development of individual female 
employees, for example through networks, 
mentoring schemes or other specific initia-
tives that may help individual employees gain 
management experience. the schouw & co. 
group’s portfolio companies must also make 
a dedicated effort to ensure the best possible 
female representation among candidates 
being considered for management positions.
at the beginning of the current measurement 
period, there were no women among the 
registered executives of the group’s danish 
reporting class c subsidiaries, and no new 
appointments were made in 2020 other than 
the in-house recruitment of a male ceo in 
connection with management succession in 
hydraspecma. the situation is different at 
the broader management levels of the group, 
as the proportion of women among senior 
managers is much more reflective of the gen-
eral employee mix. in several of the portfolio 
companies, the proportion of female senior 
managers was higher than or in line with the 
company’s general employee composition. 
in recent years, the group has measured the 
proportion of women among senior manag-
ers and all employees of the group in a more 
structured manner as can be seen from the 
table below.
