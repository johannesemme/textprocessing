our 
vaccines
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is an unfortunate reminder of 
the vulnerability of our population, despite major scientific and 
medical advances over the past century. while new treatments 
have significantly improved our lives, the prevention of infectious 
diseases remains a complex matter in an ever more globalized 
society, particularly as the reservoir for these diseases are often 
animals, which we are poorly able to control, and mutations 
of the viruses present continuous challenges in our efforts to 
minimize the impact of emerging diseases.

our vaccines are yet a small contribution to improving public health 
around the globe, but our commitment to saving and improving lives 
by unlocking the power of the immune system is strong, and our 
accomplishments in 2020 clearly demonstrate our ability to transform 
our knowledge, expertise and capabilities into life-saving vaccines.
rabies 
left untreated, rabies is almost invariably fatal and causes nearly 
60,000 deaths worldwide every year. while most of these incidents 
occur in developing countries, rabies remains a threat in the wildlife 
in western countries and may be transmitted to humans via bites or 
scratches mainly from bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. rabies is 
100% preventable with post-exposure prophylaxis, i.e. wound care 
and vaccination as soon as possible after being bitten and before the 
onset of symptoms. it is estimated that every 10 minutes, a person 
in the us is vaccinated after potential exposure to rabies. pre-ex-
posure prophylaxis are often recommended for travelers visiting 
countries and regions with high incidence of rabies and to animal 
handlers in some western countries.
tick-borne encephalitis 
tick-borne encephalitis (tbe) is a viral infectious disease transmitted 
to humans by the bite of an infected tick. although rare, tbe is a 
serious condition affecting the central nervous system that can lead 
to death or long-term neurological sequelae after recovery from 
infection. tbe is prevalent in central, eastern and northern europe 
and the geographic range of the virus appears to have expanded 
to new areas, likely due to a complex combination of changes in 
diagnosis and surveillance, human activities and socioeconomic 
factors, and ecology and climate. tbe is a preventable disease and 
vaccination is recommended for people who live in tbe risk areas or 
who frequently visit forests and grasslands in tbe risk areas.

smallpox / monkeypox
while smallpox was eradicated worldwide by 1980 as a result of 
an unprecedented global immunization campaign, it remains one 
of most dangerous infectious diseases in the history of mankind, 
having killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th centu-
ry. smallpox has been investigated as a biological weapon and in 
combination with fears over the risk of reoccurrence of the disease, 
either via synthesis or natural mutations, the us, as well as other 
countries have prioritized countermeasures against the virus and 
maintain a stockpile of smallpox vaccines. our vaccine has been de-
veloped to mitigate the risks associated with the traditional, replicat-
ing vaccines that were used during the eradication of smallpox, and 
which are not recommended for people with compromised immune 
systems.
monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from 
animals) occurring in central and west africa with symptoms similar 
to those seen in the past in smallpox patients, although it is clini-
cally less severe. with the eradication of smallpox and subsequent 
cessation of smallpox vaccination, it has emerged as the most 
important orthopoxvirus and is considered the deadliest existing 
orthopoxvirus in humans with a mortality rate estimated at up to 
10%. the fda approval of our smallpox vaccine in 2019 also in-
cluded approval for monkeypox and offers a new opportunity for 
the protection of those at high risk for exposure to this emerging 
infectious disease.
ebola 
ebola virus disease causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans, 
often leading to death. in average, the mortality rate is around 50%, 
although mortality rates in historical outbreaks have ranged from 
25% to 90%. the virus is transmitted to people from wild animals 
and then spreads in the human population through direct contact 
with the bodily fluids of infected people. sporadic outbreaks have 
occurred in west africa since the virus was discovered in the 1970’s, 
but it was not until the large outbreak in 2014-2016, which killed 
more than 11,000 people, that the development of an effective 
vaccine was expedited, leading to an unprecedented global effort 
by governments and the pharmaceutical industry. bavarian nor-
dic’s mva-bn-based ebola vaccine candidate, which was originally 
developed in collaboration with the us government, was licensed by 
janssen in 2014 for use in a prime-boost vaccine regimen together 
with their adenovirus–based vaccine candidate. following an exten-
sive development program, the vaccine regimen was approved by 
the european commission in 2020.

achievements
2020 marked year 
one in the commercial 
transformation of 
bavarian nordic and the 
accomplishment of several 
important milestones 
during the year were 
pivotal in the continued 
journey to become one of 
the world’s largest pure 
play vaccine companies. 
commercial 
integration  
moving forward
following the acquisition of rabipur/rabavert and encepur from gsk,  
a full global commercial organization has been established to support 
the integration of the products. 
local core sales and marketing teams have been organized in europe 
and the us, ensuring comprehensive commercial presence and infra-
structure. the transfer of marketing and distribution of the acquired 
products were completed in several countries, including key markets 
such as germany and the us. building on these important advances 
in the commercial transformation of bavarian nordic, the remaining 
markets will be taken over during 2021.

expansion 
of smallpox 
vaccine contract 
with the us 
government
our longstanding partnership with the us government was again 
confirmed with the award of a new smallpox vaccine contract. the 
usd 202 million contract not only covers the supply of up to 1.4 
million doses of the fda-approved liquid-frozen jynneos, which 
will ensure the availability of the vaccine in the u.s. strategic 
national stockpile for potential use by first-line responders, but also 
the manufacturing of additional bulk vaccine for future supply of an 
improved, freeze-dried version of the vaccine.

second  
mva-bn-based 
vaccine to obtain 
regulatory 
approval
after successful completion of the construction of our new fill 
and finish facility, the comprehensive work with validation and 
qualification of the equipment has proceeded with the aim to 
commence commercial manufacturing later in 2021. in parallel, the 
expansion of our bulk manufacturing has been initiated to increase 
the capacity and flexibility of the facility to support the technology 
transfer of the acquired vaccines and other future products. this 
expansion will create a center of excellence for manufacturing of 
live virus vaccines.
in july, the european commission granted 
marketing authorization for mvabea® for the 
prevention of ebola. the approval, which was 
the second eu approval of a product based 
on our mva-bn platform technology, marks 
a significant advance in the fight against 
ebola and an important milestone in our 
partnership with janssen, who has licensed 
the commercial rights to the vaccine. in 
connection with the approval, bavarian nordic 
received a milestone payment of usd 10 
million from janssen.

while we have both seen some remarkable achievements during our 
tenures at bavarian nordic, 2020 was an exceptional year with many 
firsts and achievements that will set new standards for our company.  
at the beginning of the year we embarked on a commercial transition 
to generate a new portfolio of products, including two vaccines 
acquired from gsk. while this transition for a company with no 
historical commercial presence was seen as a challenge by some, we 
remained confident in our employees who also shared our vision to 
create one of the largest pure play vaccine companies by 2025. 
this transition has so far been a great success with the establishment 
of a highly experienced and talented international commercial 
organization. the transfer of marketing and distribution of rabipur®/
rabavert® and encepur® from gsk has already been completed in 
several countries, including establishing our own sales force in key 
markets such as germany and the us. at the time of publication of this

conducted a 
rights issue 
during the 
worldwide 
pandemic
report, we have already transferred 18 markets representing at least 
90% of the revenues and the remaining markets will be completed 
during 2021. 
despite the worldwide challenges for the travel vaccine sector during 
last year we have maintained or increased our market shares during 
our first year as a fully integrated commercial company. this sign of 
strong execution also supports our business model that a higher focus 
on supply and marketing will provide a better service for healthcare 
professionals and improve annual growth for both rabipur/rabavert 
and encepur beyond historical levels while providing more life-saving 
vaccines to patients.
to support our strategy, we successfully closed a share rights offering – 
the largest in bavarian nordic history. despite difficult markets created 
by the first covid-19 lockdown, investors bought into the new business 
case of an innovative, profitable vaccine company, with a more 
predictable revenue stream. therefore a special thanks is extended to 
all new and existing shareholders for their support, which has created 
a new platform for future growth.
we have also seen a solid progression of our pipeline assets with 
the second mva-based vaccine approval in the eu, as part of our 
partnership with janssen to develop a vaccine to protect against ebola 
– a deadly disease that kills between 25-90% of infected people. 
positive clinical readouts for both jynneos® and mva-bn® wev, a 
vaccine against an emerging deadly disease spread by mosquitos, has 
seen these programs progress and again support the safety and broad 
potential application of our mva vaccine platform. while we postponed

if there was ever a need to change the dynamics, it would be now 
during a worldwide pandemic that has caught the world unprepared.
our own private-public partnership on jynneos continues to grow from 
a position of strength with new orders securing millions of doses to 
protect the us population against smallpox. we continue to invest in 
one of our key capabilities for vaccine manufacturing and completed 
the construction of a state-of-the-art fill and finish facility, designed for 
the production of life-saving vaccines. we have also initiated a further 
expansion of our existing vaccine bulk facility that will together create 
a center of excellence for the simultaneous manufacturing of multiple 
vaccines. our capabilities now go beyond our own products and could 
be used for the production of other life-saving vaccines, or as part of 
a larger manufacturing infrastructure preparing nations against future 
pandemics or bioterrorism events.
these are extremely exciting times for the company, and we have 
created a platform for future growth and opportunities to supply 
vaccines to protect millions of people each year against some of the 
deadliest diseases. however, none of this would be possible without 
our amazing employees and key stakeholders who have joined us in 
this endeavor. so, a great thanks to all of you that have supported the 
remarkable achievements during 2020.

the initiation of the planned phase 3 for our leading vaccine against 
rsv due to covid-19, we have initiated a human challenge study with 
pivotal results expected later this year.
the year however will probably always be remembered for covid-19 
and the devastating impact this worldwide pandemic has had on 
our lives. however, due to the resilience and high dedication of our 
employees the business impact was managed, and we were able 
to maintain our financial guidance and report improved ebitda and 
cash position by year-end. to help in the fight against covid-19 we 
licensed a vaccine candidate from adaptvac, based on an exciting 
vaccine platform technology that holds the potential to create a durable 
and highly protective response against this disease, and which can 
rapidly be adapted to new potentially more deadly variants. with 
strong preclinical efficacy data, the program has entered phase 1 in 
march 2021, supported under a horizon 2020 eu grant. based upon 
promising data and the belief that there will be a market for covid-19 
vaccines post the pandemic we have decided to kick-start the further 
development of the program by funding a larger regulatory phase 1/2 
study and scale-up of manufacturing to accommodate potential future 
clinical development to support licensure of the vaccine.  
preparing a nation against the unthinkable requires vision, strength 
and sustained investments, all at a time before an emergency, such 
as a pandemic or bioterrorism event, has occurred. while the us 
government has led the way for years in establishing private-public 
partnerships in developing and stockpiling biological countermeasures, 
this model is lacking in other parts of the world. we hope that other 
governments will have learned from this pandemic and think that

mid- to long-term financial goals
while the commercial market for jynneos 
is still in the establishing phase, rabipur/
rabavert and encepur are mature 
products with established markets, 
which, post the covid-19 pandemic, are 
expected to deliver at least low- to mid-
single-digit annual sales growth and mid- 
to high-single-digit annual sales growth, 
respectively.
from 2025, bavarian nordic targets, on a 
normalized basis, to deliver strong cash 
generation and profitability in line with 
the relevant vaccine peer group average.
outlook 2021 – key assumptions
revenue
the low end of the revenue range reflects a scenario where a 
lockdown due to covid-19 continues beyond q1 in key markets like 
the us and germany. the higher end of the revenue range reflects a 
scenario where a gradual reopening will happen in key markets during 
q2 and where travel starts picking up again in q3 and q4 of 2021. 
the smallpox and ebola business are not expected to be impacted by 
covid-19.
research and development costs
research and development costs of approximately dkk 750 million 
are expected for 2021 with the largest single project being rsv. 
manufacturing of phase 3 material as well as cost for the announced 
human challenge trial are included. for the covid-19 program, up to 
approximately dkk 200 million are expected for a phase 2 trial and 
scale-up of manufacturing in preparation for a phase 3 trial. these costs 
are being capitalized and hence the research and development costs 
expensed through the p&l is expected to be approximately dkk 550 
million.
cash position
expected payment of approximately dkk 375 million in milestones 
to gsk relating to the tech-transfer process for rabipur/rabavert and 
encepur. working capital changes of approximately dkk 300 million, 
primarily driven by increased inventory levels of encepur and rabipur/
rabavert products.investments of approximately dkk 650 million with 
the vast majority of the investment linked directly to the acquired 
vaccines rabipur/rabavert and encepur and relates to the upgrade 
of the bulk facility and capitalized tech transfer costs. draw-down of 
existing dkk 244 million loan facility with the european investment 
bank. investments in covid-19 program of up to approximately dkk 
200 million (capitalized r&d costs). net proceeds of approximately  
dkk 1,100 million from private placement included.
investments
approximately half of the total 2021 investments relate to the new 
facility. the design of the facility has been revised to achieve a higher 
degree of flexibility enabling parallel manufacturing of bavarian nordic 
developed products and allowing space for specific encepur and 
rabipur/rabavert equipment. the re-designed facility will require a 
total expected investment of approximately dkk 650 million and the 
re-build is expected to be finalized in 2022. capitalization of tech-
transfer costs in 2021 is expected to reach approximately dkk 150-200 
million. beyond 2022 and with current plans,, annual investments are 
expected to decline to a level of dkk 50 - 100 million.
the outlook is based on the following assumptions on currency 
exchange rates of dkk 6.10 per 1 usd and dkk 7.45 per 1 eur.

  rabipur/rabavert
rabipur/rabavert revenue amounted to dkk 628 million (dkk 960 million) for 
the full year. the 35% decrease versus prior year was caused by covid-19 and an 
extraordinarily strong q4 2019. 
the us rabies market declined by approximately 25% in 2020, however rabavert 
compensated for a significant portion of the market decline by a significant mar-
ket share gain. for the full year, the us market share was 77%, significantly above 
the level prior to covid-19 and the competitive stockout situation. in germany, the 
travel segment continued to be hit hard by covid-19 during the quarter leading to 
a decline of nearly 95% in the rabies market vs prior year. 
for the fourth quarter revenue amounted to dkk 80 million (dkk 269 million), i.e. 
a 70% decline explained by covid-19, return of competition and an extraordinarily 
strong q4 2019.

encepur revenue amounted to dkk 455 million (dkk 527 million) for the full year, 
i.e. a decrease of 14% versus prior year. 
for the full year, the encepur market share in key markets were largely 
unchanged and the year-over-year decline in sales was caused by inventory 
movements explained in the q1 interim report and by covid-19. this trend is  
in contrast to the historical market share loss that encepur has suffered.
for the fourth quarter, revenue amounted to dkk 49 million (dkk 44 million) 
corresponding to an increase of 12%. this quarterly growth is primarily driven

10-year
contract 
10-year contract framework  
with the us government
as part of bavarian nordic’s contract framework with the us 
government, a freeze-dried version of the vaccine is under 
development. due to an anticipated longer shelf life than 
the current liquid-frozen version, bavarian nordic believes 
that its freeze-dried formulation is well positioned to fulfil 
the us government's long-term stockpiling requirements 
for a smallpox vaccine to cover 66 million u.s. citizens.
the initial contract for development of the freeze-dried 
version was awarded in 2009, and in 2017 bavarian nordic 
was awarded a usd 539 million order for the supply of 
freeze-dried mva-bn to the sns to replace the current 
stockpile of liquid-frozen vaccines, which has expired. 
the base contract of usd 100 million relates to the 
manufacturing of bulk vaccine, which was revenue 
recognized in 2018 and 2019, in addition to bulk vaccine 
worth usd 233 million manufactured under previous 
contracts. the contract further includes options of up to usd 
140 million related to the clinical development, regulatory 
commitments and validation and subsequent approval of 
the fill and finish facilities. the remaining usd 299 million 
under the contract relates to the future supply of freeze-
dried vaccine doses. the 10-year contract also contains 
agreed pricing for additional bulk and final doses of both 
liquid-frozen and freeze-dried formulation of the vaccine.

containing construct within immunotherapy.
the mid- to long term goals are to: (i) secure approval of two 
vaccines: the freeze-dried version of the smallpox vaccine and 
the rsv vaccine, to be launched together with a partner, (ii) se-
cure proof-of-concept of new immunotherapy approaches, (iii) 
introduction of at least one more infectious disease pipeline 
project, and (iv) preserve and grow the value of abncov2 by 
building on the positive momentum in clinical development, 
despite not yet having secured third-party funding.
during 2020, bavarian nordic established a full commercial 
infrastructure responsible for the commercialization of rabipur/
rabavert, encepur and jynneos. the work now continues to 
grow our sales and to establish bavarian nordic as the pre-
ferred partner to health care professionals operating within our 
field.
key strategic activities and milestones in 2021
• drive profitable growth for rabipur/rabavert and encepur
•  take over physical distribution for rabipur/rabavert and 
encepur in remaining markets
•  improve awareness and image of bavarian nordic with key 
stakeholders
the mid- to long term goals are to: (i) drive profitable growth 
of the commercial business, (ii) establish jynneos/imvanex/
imvamune as the global leader for the prevention of smallpox 
and for jynneos also with respect to monkeypox, (iii) become 
a preferred partner to healthcare professionals for the pre-
vention and treatment of rabies and prevention of tick-borne 
encephalitis, smallpox and monkeypox and (iv) further expand 
the portfolio of commercial stage products either organically or 
through acquisitions.
bavarian nordic wants to further leverage its expertise within 
manufacturing of live virus vaccines. this involves completing 
the manufacturing footprint to encompass the full value chain 
from bulk manufacturing to fill and finish, as well as increasing 
bulk capacity and introducing the flexibility to manufacture 
different bulk vaccines in parallel. all of this with the strategic 
aim to be a best-in-class vaccine manufacturer.
key strategic activities and milestones in 2021
•  filling of first commercial vaccine doses in the newly built  
fill and finish facility
•  completion of construction of new/amended drug  
substance facility
•  progress the manufacturing technology transfer of rabipur/
rabavert and encepur according to plan, including completing 
qualification of packaging performed at a selected contract 
manufacturer
the mid- to long term goals are to: (i) establish bavarian 
nordic capabilities to fill and finish liquid and freeze-dried 
products, (ii) expand bulk manufacturing to introduce new 
technologies and manufacture multiple products in parallel, and 
(iii) to successfully complete the transfer of the manufacturing 
of rabipur/rabavert and encepur from gsk, in order to deliver 
on the anticipated synergies of the transaction.

anu helena kerns joined bavarian nordic as chief people officer in no-
vember 2020. anu brings more than 15 years of leadership experience 
driving human resource and communication strategies. in the newly 
established role and as a part of the executive management team she 
will drive the organizational development through the ongoing com-
mercial transformation of bavarian nordic. 
anu: i am incredibly excited to be joining bavarian nordic at 
this transformative stage of its development. throughout the 
organization, a strong purpose of delivering life-saving vaccines 
is present and i am thrilled to take part in this by shaping 
a people and organization agenda that will unfold bavarian 
nordic’s vision for the future.
since the acquisition of encepur and rabipur, bavarian nordic has had 
a laser-like focus on establishing a commercial structure with presence 
in new markets and expanding manufacturing capacity in anticipation 
of new vaccines. the organization has seen significant growth with a 
large number of new employees offering their competencies to the 
organization.
anu: we have transformed into a full-blown vaccine company 
in a very short time growing in size and scope. now we must 
do the legwork and align people, processes and platforms to 
the new reality. this involves making our workflows simple 
and scalable, but more importantly to bring everyone along on 
the journey fostering collaboration and communication across 
functions and locations.
this task has, naturally, been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. with 
around 300 new people in the organization, many have never had the 
chance to meet close colleagues face to face. ultimately, these unprec-
edented times have taught us that being out of sight does not mean 
being out of touch. even under new and unanticipated pressures, we 
have succeeded, and important milestones have been achieved. we 
owe a big thanks to the bavarian nordic people who yet again demon-
strated their flexibility and adaptability.
anu: since joining bavarian nordic, the capability of our 
organization has repeatedly amazed me. i regard the strong 
knowledge base coupled with human factors like a widespread 
can-do attitude, willingness to go the extra mile and the 
ability to quickly adjust to changes and challenges as the true 
foundation of our success and something we should continue to 
nurture.

a future of flexible work and sustainable engagement
based on the learning we have from the covid-19 lockdown period, 
bavarian nordic wants to offer more flexibility to our employees as we 
define our future way of working. this initiative is part of an overall 
objective to offer a healthy, safe and engaging working environment. 
over the years, bavarian nordic has been able to achieve a steady re-
duction in accidents, sick leave and turnover. the ambition is to monitor 
and keep these key figures at their current low levels. in the coming 
year, pulse surveys will be done to check the temperature of the moti-
vation and commitment in the organization.
anu:  i want to keep a good reading on the pulse of 
the organization to understand, how we fuel sustainable 
engagement going forward. i can only imagine that under 
the current circumstances there can be some fatigue in the 
organization, and if that is the case, i want all leaders to get 
involved in addressing it. so far, i have only experienced a very 
open, friendly and energetic workforce. as leaders we need to 
stay close and in tune with the people in the organization and 
make sure they feel seen, heard and developed.
innovation catalyzed by diversity and mobility
diversity and equal opportunity have entered the agenda of top 
management in bavarian nordic. more than half of all leader positions 
in the company are female and there is female representation at all 
levels in the organization, including on the board of directors. howev-
er, diversity relates to more than gender - it also involves inclusion of 
different age groups and backgrounds. driven out of a need to attract 
people with various backgrounds and specialty for manifold functions 
in different locations, the workforce in bavarian nordic quite naturally 
becomes diverse. 
as new cpo, anu sees especially diversity as a catalyst for innovation:
anu: from my experience, having a diverse workforce works in 
our favor as a dynamic company dependent on innovation. we 
need people that bring along a fresh perspective and challenge 
the status quo. while we have a decent level of diversity in 
terms of gender, educational backgrounds and nationality, i 
personally believe we can benefit from engaging students, 
interns and fresh graduates who can offer new theory and 
different perspectives on technology and media.
anu: we all learn most from interacting with different people 
and getting out of our comfort zone. bavarian nordic has a 
unique opportunity to offer personal growth and development 
just by virtue of our continuous expansion. in my career, i have 
been fortunate to experience great jumps in my learning curve 
by changing role and location and working with people from 
different functions and cultures. i would like to see, how we can 
facilitate more internal mobility in bavarian nordic in the future

focus 
areas
while bavarian nordic’s focus in 2020 has predominantly been on the 
commercial transformation, innovation remains a cornerstone for the 
company. the development of a strong pipeline is an integral part of 
our growth ambitions, and not least our desire to deliver lifesaving 
promises to patients where there is a medical need. 
on the back of two recent product approvals; the liquid-frozen small-
pox vaccine and the ebola vaccine, we are working diligently towards 
securing additional approvals in the coming years. a key asset in the 
pipeline is mva-bn rsv, an advanced, broad-spectrum vaccine can-
didate for respiratory syncytial virus, which represents a blockbuster 
potential. while the planned phase 3 program of the vaccine has been 
postponed until 2022, a human challenge trial will be conducted in 
2021, providing important efficacy data later this year. 
we have also prioritized the development of abncov2, our covid-19 
vaccine candidate in-licensed from adaptvac, which we believe has 
potential as a next-generation vaccine that has potential to provide a 
broad and durable response, while also mitigating the challenges from 
new, and potentially more deadly variants of the virus. 
another expected near-term approval is the freeze-dried smallpox 
vaccine, which has concluded phase 3 development, and will be an 
important trigger for our future vaccine sales to the us government.
we also remain committed to the development of novel therapies 
to fight cancer with a refocused strategy, involving more advanced 
vaccine constructs and new administration routes.

laurence de moerlooze
joined bavarian nordic in april 2020 from takeda vaccines, 
where she served as vice president and global program 
lead for vaccines against zika virus and norovirus. prior 
to takeda she worked at gsk for 17 years, holding vari-
ous leading roles in regulatory affairs, medical affairs and 
vaccine development working with numerous life-saving 
vaccines including rabipur/rabavert and encepur.
two regulatory approvals over the past two years have demonstrated 
the success of bavarian nordic’s research and development team and 
its efforts to transform science into new, life-saving vaccines. how-
ever, the successful completion of several pipeline projects combined 
with a shift in the immune-oncology focus has left room in the clinical 
pipeline for new projects. to refuel the growth, bavarian nordic ap-
pointed laurence de moerlooze as chief medical officer in 2020. with a 
strong background in the vaccine industry, laurence brings a wealth of 
knowledge and will add important and valuable r&d and commercial 
experience to the company. 
while an important focus for her is to expand and advance the clinical 
pipeline, she is equally mindful about the increased responsibilities that 
comes along having expanded the portfolio of marketed vaccines. 
laurence: my objective as chief medical officer is twofold: 
first to expand and advance a portfolio of pipeline projects 
and second to build a medical affairs, pharmacovigilance and 
regulatory organization fit to support our commercial vaccines 
within a governance framework aligned with industry standards. 
these three functions are key for bavarian nordic’s commercial 
transformation journey and success.

new technologies, new opportunities
bavarian nordic is recognized for its work on the mva technology, and 
the company’s endeavors in the field has led to regulatory approvals 
of vaccines against smallpox and ebola, highlighting the strength and 
versatility of proprietary mva-bn technology on which both vaccines 
are based.
in addition, to the wealth of experience with mva-bn, bavarian nordic 
has a strong expertise with several other platforms being tested with 
model antigens in non-clinical studies. furthermore, the company has 
licensed a covid-19 vaccine candidate based on a unique virus-like 
particle display technology that offers alternative features to be added 
to the list of potential platforms for future vaccines. 
laurence: based on the data obtained with these various 
platforms in pre-clinical and clinical studies, we are committed 
to select the right platform to advance at least one vaccine 
candidate with a high medical need in our future development 
pipeline of infectious diseases.
immuno-oncology remains a priority
while the successes made in infectious diseases have yet to be demon-
strated in the immuno-oncology space, bavarian nordic has continued 
to make advances in its research, which not only is a matter of picking 
the right candidate, but also how it is being administered to the pa-
tients. intravenous administration of the cancer vaccines is a promising 
approach designed to utilize broader aspects of the immune response, 
which is being further explored in 2021.

laurence: we have recently initiated a clinical study with 
taek-vac, a fully in-house developed candidate generated from 
the mva-bn platform to target her2- and brachyury expressing 
cancers. this improved vaccine candidate leverages our extensive 
experience in immuno-oncology and as a new feature, utilizes 
intravenous administration which may enhance its efficacy.
at the forefront of rsv development
on a global scale, covid-19 has become a top priority for vaccine 
development, also for bavarian nordic. however, rsv remains an 
equally important target, as no vaccines are available against the virus, 
which causes equally as many deaths worldwide, as influenza. rsv is 
a key focus for bavarian nordic and the company has one of the most 
advanced vaccine candidates. 
laurence: rsv remains a high priority in our vaccine devel-
opment and we are confident that our multivalent candidate is 
a serious player in the competitive rsv vaccine development 
landscape. therefore, in order not to lose momentum, we are 
planning to conduct a human rsv challenge trial in 2021. data 
from this trial is expected already during the second half of 2021 
and will provide the first insights into the protective efficacy of 
the vaccine candidate and further de-risk the phase 3 efficacy 
trial that should commence in 2022.
annual report 2020

respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)
bavarian nordic remains at the forefront of the development 
of a vaccine against rsv, and has generated highly promising 
phase 2 results with its candidate, mva-bn rsv, confirming a 
broad immune response that persists at least 6 months and 
can be boosted, without significant safety findings, in the 
older-adult target population. the broad immune response 
elicited by the vaccine suggests that it may activate various 
adaptive immune responses against rsv, which are expected 
to contribute to different pathways of protection.
a phase 3 program for the vaccine has been developed and 
was originally planned to start in 2021. due to the impact of 
covid-19 measures taken globally, the prevalence of other res-
piratory viruses, including rsv, has been reduced. the planned 
efficacy study could be adversely affected by the uncertainties 
associated with potentially low rates of rsv incidence in the 
2021/22 season. to maintain the momentum of the program 
despite the challenges faced by covid-19, bavarian nordic 
plans to conduct a phase 2 human challenge trial in 2021, 
while also postponing the recruitment into the phase 3 study 
until 2022. the human challenge trial will generate the first 
efficacy data against rsv during 2021 and potentially further 
de-risk the phase 3 efficacy trial.
our r&d programs
covid-19
in july 2020, bavarian nordic licensed a capsid virus like 
particle (cvlp) covid-19 vaccine candidate from adaptvac. 
the vaccine candidate, abncov2 has shown to be highly 
immunogenic in relevant pre-clinical models inducing durable 
responses equivalent to high convalescent sera from patients 
that have recovered from covid-19. these responses have 
led to the demonstration of a durable and highly protective 
response from a covid-19 challenge. coupled with the ease of 
production and the ability to rapidly adapt the vaccine platform 
to new potentially more deadly variants, abncov2 looks like a 
highly promising candidate. 
supported by a horizon 2020 eu grant, adaptvac has initiated 
the first-in-human study of the vaccine candidate in march 
2021, and bavarian nordic has decided to move the abncov2 
project forward by investing in a phase 1/2 clinical trial 
and to scale up manufacturing to phase 3 volume levels in 
preparation for further clinical development towards licensure. 
the phase 1/2 study will investigate the ability of abncov2 to 
boost existing immunity through prior infection or vaccination, 
to create a more durable immune response that could protect 
against the current circulating variants of covid-19. in parallel 
the company will continue to seek funding to further progress 
the candidate towards licensure.
smallpox
as part of bavarian nordic’s contract framework with the u.s. 
government on the development and supply of a non-replicating 
smallpox vaccine, an improved, freeze-dried formulation of the 
mva-bn® smallpox vaccine is being developed.
during 2020, positive topline results from a phase 3 lot-consist-
ency trial of the freeze-dried formulation of mva-bn were re-
ported. a prior phase 2 study showed equivalence between the 
freeze-dried and liquid-frozen formulations of mva-bn, and the 
lot-consistency trial was agreed with the fda as the only phase 
3 study required to support licensure of the freeze-dried formu-
lation. the phase 3 study evaluated the immunogenicity and 
safety of three consecutive vaccine lots in 1,129 vaccinia-naïve 
persons. the three lots induced equivalent antibody responses, 
meeting the primary endpoint of the study, while the favorable 
safety profile was in line with the cumulative safety experience 
of the approved liquid-frozen formulation. upon successful com-
pletion of the current study, expected in 2021, the company 
plans to submit a supplement to the bla to extend the approv-
al for both formulations of mva-bn, anticipated in 2022. 
equine encephalitis
under a contract with the u.s. government, awarded in 2018, 
bavarian nordic has developed mva-bn wev, a vaccine against 
equine encephalitis virus, an emerging mosquito-borne virus 
which can result in the rare condition of encephalitis and death. 
in june 2020, topline results from the first-in-human trial of 
mva-bn wev were reported. the study enrolled 45 healthy 
adults in three treatment groups receiving different doses of 
the vaccine. all subjects were revaccinated after four weeks.

peak levels reached after the second vaccination. responses 
were detected as early as 2 weeks after the first vaccination 
in the highest dose group, in which 100% seroconversion was 
observed for all subjects after the second vaccination. the most 
common vaccine-related adverse event was injection site pain.
these clinically meaningful phase 1 data warrant further 
clinical investigation, and bavarian nordic is seeking additional 
funding for the further clinical advancement of the vaccine 
candidate
immuno-oncology
results from a phase 2 clinical study of bn-brachyury in 
chordoma were reported during 2020. while the study failed 
to meet its primary endpoint, it provided signs of clinical 
activity, supporting brachyury as a potentially important 
immunotherapy target, particularly for chordoma. these 
intriguing signs of clinical efficacy are also supported by results 
in chordoma patients following the intravenous administration 
of bn-brachyury in a separate trial. 
a tumor antibody enhanced therapeutic vaccine (taek-vac) 
targeting her2 and brachyury has been generated from the 
mva-bn platform. a phase 1/2 open label trial of intravenous 
administration of the vaccine, was initiated in early 2021 in pa-
tients with advanced her2- and brachyury-expressing cancers.

2020 represented year one in the commercial transformation 
of bavarian nordic, and a key priority for the company was the 
establishment of a full commercial infrastructure to support the new 
business. adding this completely new discipline to the company’s 
list of key competencies was a huge task that we have managed to 
implement according to plan.     
based in the new global commercial headquarter set up in zug, 
switzerland, the commercial leadership team was established from the 
beginning of the year, and quickly expanded to include core sales and 
marketing teams in europe and the us to cover the key markets. we 
have built a dedicated sales force in our priority markets as this is one 
of the key levers to drive market share gain and sales growth.
the primary objective for the new organization is to secure profitable 
growth of the commercial business which will be driven by a continued 
focus on retaining and gaining market shares for the established 
products, rabipur/rabavert and encepur, while also working to 
establish jynneos/imvanex/imvamune as the global leader for 
the prevention of smallpox and for jynneos also with respect to the 
monkeypox indication.
we wish to be recognized for our commercial excellence and aim to 
become a preferred partner to healthcare professionals, initially for 
the prevention and treatment of rabies and prevention of tick-borne 
encephalitis, smallpox and monkeypox. a key success factor to achieve 
this will be to improve the awareness and image of bavarian nordic 
among key stakeholders.
to achieve our long-term ambition to become one of the largest pure 
play vaccine companies, we continue to explore opportunities to further 
expand our portfolio of commercial stage products either organically or 
through acquisitions.

own commercial infrastructure in the marketing and distribution of 
valneva’s vaccines for japanese encephalitis and cholera in germany 
and switzerland. this is expected to happen at the beginning of 2022.
by march 2021, marketing and distribution in a total of 18 countries 
were transferred, corresponding to more than 90% of the total product 
revenue from rabipur/rabavert and encepur, and the company 
remains on track to complete the market transfers in 2021.
the five-year transition of rabipur/rabavert 
and encepur is a process involving all parts 
of bavarian nordic’s organization, gradually 
transferring the responsibilities for the different 
tasks from gsk to bavarian nordic while also 
gradually improving the profitability of these 
products for bavarian nordic.
in 2020, a full commercial infrastructure was 
established and by 2021, the company will 
have assumed marketing and distribution of the 
products in all markets.
transfer of manufacturing will occur stepwise 
with initial take-over of packing in 2021, fill and 
finish of vaccines in 2023 and production of the 
drug substance in 2024. to enable the latter, 
construction work to expand bavarian nordic’s 
facility was initiated in 2020.

driving awareness for future success
while the recent establishment of the commercial organization and 
the infrastructure to support the new business has been a success, the 
commercial presence is still in its very early days for bavarian nordic. 
although diverse and sound industry experience and deep market 
knowledge are common denominators for the strong sales and market-
ing teams that have been hired, the recognition of the bavarian nordic 
brand among relevant stakeholders is still low, as expected. having 
established products like rabipur/rabavert and encepur in the portfolio 
is an important driver for improving the awareness. in addition, the 
company has focused its efforts on activities to support this goal when-
ever new markets have been taken over, and improvements have been 
observed over the year. 
future growth drivers
while brand awareness, a dedicated salesforce, product availability 
and commercial excellence are important factors in securing continued 
profitable growth of the current commercial portfolio, the long-term 
ambition to become one of the largest pure play vaccine companies 
will require a broader portfolio of vaccines. the successful track history 
of bringing our own products to the market is expected to continue, 
but also the opportunity to expand our portfolio through acquisitions is 
being explored.

manufacturing
one of the important features that provides bavarian nordic with a 
unique profile is the strong in-house vaccine manufacturing capabil-
ities and capacity built over many years. we want to strengthen this 
expertise and are currently expanding our manufacturing footprint to 
encompass the full value chain from bulk manufacturing to fill and fin-
ish of both liquid and freeze-dried vaccines, as well as increasing bulk 
capacity and introducing the flexibility to manufacture different bulk 
vaccines in parallel. the aim is to be a best-in-class vaccine manufac-
turer with flexibility to support both current and future requirements.
despite covid-19, the existing bulk manufacturing continued its 
operations uninterrupted during 2020 with production of bulk vaccine 
for several customers according to plan. likewise, all activities to 
support commissioning of the new fill and finish facility continued 
successfully to enable commercial manufacturing of the first product in 
2021. additionally, the work to expand the bulk facility to support the 
transfer of the manufacturing of rabipur/rabavert and encepur has 
progressed according to plan.
kvistgaard site – a center of excellence for  
vaccine manufacturing
our manufacturing site in kvistgaard, north of copenhagen, has always 
been an important asset for the company and has played a pivotal role 
in reaching our strategic goals.
the site has been operating for more than a decade, manufacturing 
bulk vaccine for the company’s smallpox vaccine contracts with the u.s.

expanded over time, most recently with the addition of a commercial-
scale fill and finish facility, which is being put into operations in 2021. 
together with the existing manufacturing capabilities, this will enable 
bavarian nordic to control the entire value chain of the manufacturing 
process from raw materials to final product and distribution.
annual report 2020

fill and finish commencing in 2021
the fill and finish facility is designed to support concurrent aseptic 
manufacturing of up to three different products in the formulation and 
filling area at the same time within separated closed systems, so that 
one drug substance can be formulated while a second is filled and a 
third is being freeze-dried.
the facility construction was completed in 2019, and during 2020, vali-
dation and qualification activities were completed in order to bring the 
first commercial product on the line in 2021, which will be jynneos/
imvanex/imvamune smallpox vaccine in the liquid-frozen formulation. 
the freeze-dried formulation will be transferred to the line, once the 
process has been validated and approved by the us in connection with 
the fda approval of this improved formulation.
expanding the facility to support acquired and future products
the significant investment in the two vaccines from gsk also entails 
additional investments in the manufacturing infrastructure to increase 
the capacity and flexibility of the current facility.
therefore, in 2020, we initiated the expansion of our drug substance 
manufacturing unit, which will enable us to run two different products 
(viruses) at the same time. this will allow us to transfer the manufac-
turing of rabipur/rabavert and encepur into a dedicated production 
unit, while also offering the potential to bring in new technologies for 
new products.
rabipur/rabavert and encepur are currently manufactured by gsk 
and the basis of the technology transfer to bavarian nordic is an as-is 
transfer of the current manufacturing process. this transfer will be a 
staged process, starting with packaging then filling and ending with the 
transfer of bulk manufacturing. the tight regulation of pharmaceutical 
technology transfers together with bavarian nordic and gsk’s com-
mitment to ensure supply to the market makes it a five-year process 
before final completion. during this time, gsk will continue to manufac-
ture and supply rabipur/rabavert and encepur. 
while the current expansion of the facility is expected to be able to ful-
ly cover bavarian nordic’s manufacturing needs in a foreseeable future, 
the company last year acquired an adjacent property, securing land for 
potential future expansions of its the manufacturing footprint.

facility expansion provides 
a number of strategic 
advantages
with the expansion of our drug 
substance facility and the comple-
tion of the fill and finish facility 
we will:
•  gain more control of our 
manufacturing value chain
•  increase our overall capacity and 
enable manufacturing of multi-
ple products at the same time
•  establish a dedicated production 
unit for rabipur/rabavert 
and encepur that will ensure 
sufficient capacity and stable 
supply to the market
•  enable ourselves to bring in  
new products and technologies 
to the site
a future-proof asset
chief operating officer henrik birk has been with  
bavarian nordic since 2008, a period where the company’s 
manufacturing infrastructure has significantly expanded  
to fulfil the increasing demands for vaccines.
“our manufacturing journey continues as we in 2021 
will put our new fill and finish facility into operations 
and have also begun the construction to expand our bulk 
manufacturing capacity to meet the future requirements  
in our vaccine production.”

sustainability
our impact on global health
no other health intervention touches so many lives as vaccines. the 
development of new vaccines and increased vaccination efforts, par-
ticularly in developing countries, have helped to significantly reduce 
the incidence of major communicable, life-threatening diseases. it is 
estimated that vaccines have reduced these diseases by more than 
90% over the past three centuries1.
vaccines work, and they contribute to the u.n. sustainable develop-
ment goal2 (sdg) number 3, “good health and well-being” all around 
the world. however, according to gavi3, immunization positively 
impacts, directly or indirectly, 14 of the 17 sdgs that support the 2030 
agenda for sustainable development.
our contribution, as a vaccine company, may seem small in the global 
perspective, but we are here to help achieve the goal for securing 
good health and well-being of all humans.

corporate 
governance
bavarian nordic remains focused on good corporate governance, having 
implemented the recommendations from the committee of corporate 
governance (komitéen for god selskabsledelse) for companies listed on 
the nasdaq copenhagen exchange. 
management believes that the company is operated in compliance with 
guidelines and recommendations that support the company’s business 
model and can create value for bavarian nordic’s stakeholders. regularly 
and at least once a year, management monitors adherence to the recom-
mendations on corporate governance in order to ensure the best possible 
utilization of and compliance with the recommendations and legislation.
in accordance with section 107 b of the danish financial statements 
act, bavarian nordic has published a statutory report on corporate 
governance for the financial year 2020 on the company’s website:  
www.bavarian-nordic.com/corporategovernance.
the board of directors
the board of directors (“the board”) is responsible for the overall stra-
tegic management and the financial and managerial supervision of 
bavarian nordic, as well as for regular evaluation of the work of the 
corporate management. in addition, the board supervises the company 
in a general sense and ensures that it is managed in an adequate man-
ner and in accordance with applicable law and the company’s articles 
of association. the board discharges its duties in accordance with the 
rules of procedure of the board, which are reviewed and updated by all 
members of the board..
diversity in the board
the board of directors currently has a representation of two female 
members elected by the shareholders, corresponding to 28%, which 
is above the current target of 15%. the target is being reassessed in 
2021.
evaluation of the board
the board and its subcommittees conduct every year a self-evaluation 
of the board's and subcommittee’s work, accomplishments and com-
position. the chairman heads the annual evaluation, which is conduct-
ed at least every third year by an external consultant. the process, 
whether it is facilitated internally or by external consultants, evaluates 
annual report 2020
46
topics such as board dynamics, board agenda, quality of the materi-
al that is submitted to the board, discussions at the board meetings, 
the chairman’s leadership of the board, strategy, board composition 
and board competencies. typically, the process is further facilitated by 
each board member filling out a detailed questionnaire, and the board 
members are asked to score to which extent they agree to the indi-
vidual questions. the results of the questionnaire are then discussed at 
a subsequent board meeting, and the individual comments submitted 
are used in the planning and handling of future board meetings. the 
2020 self-evaluation was facilitated by an external consultant and, in 
general, key conclusions were positive with a continued satisfaction 
with the board’s work as well as the work in the committees. organiza-
tional development and continued optimization of board efficiency will 
also be a focus area in 2021.
for more details on the work and composition of the board and its 
committees, reference is made to the statutory report on corporate 
governance on the company’s website: www.bavarian-nordic.com/

tax policy
a tax policy describing our governing principles by which we manage 
our tax affairs was approved by the board in november 2020 and 
is available on the company’s website: www.bavarian-nordic.com/
about/corporate-governance/tax-policy.aspx.
remuneration policy and report 
the remuneration of the board and the executive management is 
governed by the company’s remuneration policy which was updated 
in 2020 and subsequently approved by the shareholders at the annual 
general meeting in june 2020. 
in accordance with section 139 b in the danish companies act, 
bavarian nordic has prepared a report on the remuneration of the 
individual members of the board and executive management in 2020,

at bavarian nordic risk management is an integrated part of the 
company’s operations. a formal process ensures both bottom-up and 
top-down identification and handling of risks. in this process key risks 
are first identified through a bottom-up process including description of 
the risks and mitigating actions taken to reduce either the likelihood of 
occurrence or the potential impact. residual risk after agreed mitigat-
ing actions is further mitigated by insurance where this is relevant and 
possible.

development
the development of a product can be delayed or even abandoned. 
the process involves pre-clinical and clinical tests as well as regulatory 
approval and even approval of manufacturing facilities in some cases. 
all steps through development are associated with risks and can fail. 
competitors can develop more promising product candidates, potentially 
reducing the value of bavarian nordic’s pipeline and products. some 
development projects require funding from third parties and if this is 
not available it can result in delays or even termination of the project. 
•  close dialogue with authorities (e.g. fda) to secure optimal  
path to approval and compliance with gmp etc.
•  strong quality system in place to ensure compliance with 
standards agreed with and required by authorities.
•  use of adaptive trial designs to minimize financial risk and  
impact of failure.
•  maintain good dialogue and relations with key existing or 
potential sponsors of development (see partnering further 
below).
on a quarterly basis major risks are reported to the finance, risk & 
audit committee (frac) and discussed at these meetings. during the 
year specific risks are selected for more in-depth discussions with 
frac involving the operational owner of the specific risk. the board of 
directors receives regular risk updates from frac which then form part 
of the board’s overall decisions about the company’s strategy. the table 
below summarizes some of the key risks that are important to bavarian 
nordic’s business including examples of mitigating actions.

financial  
review 2020
the financial review is based on the group’s consolidated financial 
information for the year ended december 31, 2020, with comparative 
2019 figures for the group in brackets. there is no significant difference 
in the development of the group and the parent company (except if 
noted specifically below).
in 2020, the company generated revenues of dkk 1,852 million (dkk 662 
million) compared to a guidance of dkk 1,900 million. the income before 
interest and taxes (ebit) was dkk 380 million (loss of dkk 328 million) 
and ebitda was an income of dkk 740 million (loss of dkk 271 million) 
compared to a guided income of dkk 725 million. ebitda came in slightly 
better than guided due to continued tight focus on cost and profitability.
securities, cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2020 amounted 
to dkk 1,670 million (dkk 472 million) compared to a guidance of dkk 
1,600 million. the year-end cash position exceeded guidance due to 
phasing of ongoing investments and working capital movements. this 
was achieved without draw-down of existing credit facilities of dkk 244 
million. due to the strong cash position the draw-down was deferred  
to 2021.
income statement
revenue
revenue for the year was dkk 1,852 million (dkk 662 million). 
revenue in 2020 significantly increased over 2019 as a result of the 
commercial transformation of bavarian nordic following the acquisition 
of two commercial vaccines, rabipur/rabavert and encepur. covid-19 
negative impact on rabipur/rabavert and encepur revenue was limited 
to approximately dkk 200 million by strong brand performance in key 
markets and largely offset by better than originally expected jynneos 
revenue. a usd weakening against dkk had some negative impact on 
rabavert revenue in the last two months of 2020.
revenue from product sales was dkk 1,623 million (dkk 324 million) 
composed of sale of rabipur/rabavert of dkk 628 million (dkk 0 
million), encepur of dkk 455 million (dkk 0 million) and sale of 
smallpox bulk drug substance batches and liquid frozen vials to the  
u.s. government of dkk 541 million (dkk 324 million).
annual report 2020
58
revenue from ongoing contract work amounted to dkk 162 million 
(dkk 338 million) mostly related to revenue from the u.s. biomedical 
advanced research and development authority (barda) for running 
the phase 3 study for the freeze-dried smallpox vaccine and the fund-
ing to support qualification of the new fill and finish facility as well as 
the transfer and validation of the freeze-drying production process. 
during 2020 the company received a milestone payment of dkk 
67 million (dkk 0 million) from janssen following the european 
commission’s grant of the marketing authorization for janssen’s ebola 
vaccine regimen.
in the parent company revenue was dkk 31 million higher than in the 
group due to internal sales related to rabavert sales in the us.
production costs
production costs amounted to dkk 1,195 million (dkk 355 million). 
costs related directly to revenue amounted to dkk 689 million (dkk 
307 million) of which cost of goods sold totaled dkk 585 million  
(dkk 87 million). 
other production costs totaled dkk 233 million (dkk 48 million) 
and includes an accrual for write-down of obsolete products related 
to the distribution switch of rabipur/rabavert and encepur from 
glaxosmithkline. write-down on other inventory amounted to net  
dkk 25 million (dkk 4 million). 
the product rights to rabipur/rabavert and encepur are amortized 
over 20 years with an annual amortization of dkk 273 million and 
recognized as production costs.
sales and distribution costs
the sales and distribution costs amounted to dkk 286 million (dkk 53 
million) split between costs for distribution of products dkk 113 million 
(dkk 0 million) and costs for running the commercial organization and 
activities dkk 173 million (dkk 53 million).
research and development costs
the total research and development spending were dkk 446 million 
(dkk 628 million). the amount included research and development 
spend for funded contract costs of dkk 104 million (dkk 219 million). 
these costs are recognized as production costs in the income state-
ment. the amount shown as research and development costs in the 
income statement totaled dkk 341 million (dkk 409 million), see  
note 6.
the higher research and development costs in 2019 were primarily 
explained by costs associated with formulation work on rsv. following 
the company’s decision not to invest further in the development of 
cv301, the cv301 intangible asset was fully written down in 2019. the 
write-down of dkk 22 million was recognized as research and develop-
ment costs in the consolidated financial statements for 2019.
administrative costs
administrative costs totaled dkk 278 million (dkk 173 million), an 
increase of dkk 105 million compared to last year. the increase follows 
the acquisition of rabipur/rabavert and encepur and include e.g. 
project management for the ongoing transfer project, service fee to 
glaxosmithkline for their contribution to the project, and increased it 
costs for implementation of new systems required to run a full-scale 
commercial business.
annual report 2020
59
non-recurring costs
the integration and transfer of rabipur/rabavert and encepur from 
glaxosmithkline necessitates expenses that by nature are no-longer 
needed after a full transition. examples are use of consultants to 
establish distribution infrastructures, program management resources, 
implementation of new it systems, recruitment costs etc. some of 
these costs are one-off for 2020 and some will remain until the transfer 
is complete. the non-recurring costs amounted to approximately dkk 75 
million in 2020. 
other operating income
other operating income totaled dkk 628 million (dkk 0 million) 
and regards the sale of the priority review voucher, granted to the 
company by the fda in connection with the approval of jynneos in 
2019. the sale of the priority review voucher was concluded in the 
first quarter of 2020.
ebit/ebitda
income before interest and tax (ebit) was positive with dkk 380 
million (loss of dkk 328 million).
ebitda was an income of dkk 740 million (loss of dkk 271 million). 
amortization of product rights related to rabipur/rabavert and encepur 
amounted to dkk 273 million (dkk 0 million) whereas depreciation and 
impairment losses on other fixed assets amounted to dkk 87 million 
(dkk 57 million).
financial income and financial expenses
financial income was dkk 98 million (dkk 23 million) and consisted of 
adjustment of deferred consideration to glaxosmithkline due to change 
in estimated timing of payments, dkk 68 million (dkk 0 million), 
currency adjustments on deferred consideration due to decreased eur/
dkk rate during 2020, dkk 12 million (dkk 0 million), interest income 
on securities of dkk 9 million (dkk 16 million), fair value adjustments 
on securities of dkk 7 million (net loss of 15 million) and net gains on 
derivative financial instruments of dkk 2 million (dkk 6 million).
financial expenses were dkk 196 million (dkk 39 million) and consist-
ed of unwinding1 of the discount related to deferred consideration, dkk 
145 million (dkk 0 million), interest expense on debt of dkk 32 million 
(dkk 18 million) and a net foreign exchange loss of dkk 19 million 
(dkk 5 million).
the net value adjustment of deferred consideration to gsk was 
an expense of dkk 65 million, consisting of the three components 
described above.
in the parent financial statements, the financial income was dkk 120 
million (dkk 50 million) and included interests on receivables from 
subsidiaries of dkk 22 million (dkk 24 million). the financial expenses 
were dkk 275 million (dkk 95 million) and included write-down of 
receivables from subsidiaries of dkk 34 million (dkk 61 million).
income before company tax was positive with dkk 282 million  
(loss of dkk 345 million).
1 the deferred consideration for product rights is measured 
at net present value and the difference between the net 
present value and the amounts due is recognized in the 
income statement as a financial expense over the period 
until expected payment date using the effective interest 
method.

tax on income for the year
tax on the income for the year was an expense of dkk 4 million in 
bavarian nordic gmbh (dkk 2 million), corresponding to an effective 
tax rate for the group of 1.6% (negative 0.6%). the effective tax 
rate for 2020 was low due to significant tax-deductible amortization 
on the acquired product rights creating a deferred tax liability which 
was offset by a reduction in non-recognized deferred tax assets. the 
new danish tax scheme allowing 30% 'step-up' deduction for costs 
related to research and development activities paid by danish entities 
also reduced the effective tax rate as this is a non-incurred expense 
deductible for tax purposes. the tax scheme has a tax value for the 
company of dkk 13 million. the effective tax rate for 2019 was 
impacted by the increase in non-recognized tax asset.
the parent company’s taxable income for the full year of 2020 was 
zeroed out by utilization of taxable amortization on the acquired 
product rights. no tax loss carry forwards were utilized. the deferred 
tax asset on the balance sheet remains at dkk 0 million. the company 
retains the right to use the tax losses carried forward that was written 
down in prior years.

such date.

(net spend of dkk 276 million), with a significant contribution from

encepur. investment in other intangible assets amounted to dkk 108 
million (dkk 3 million) and included the ongoing rabipur/rabavert

lion (dkk 1,115 million), following the rights issue with a net proceed 
of dkk 2,721 million partly offset by repayment of the bridge loan by

million positive).

the balance sheet total was dkk 8,759 million as of december 31, 
2020 (dkk 7,047 million).

intangible assets stood at dkk 5,291 million (dkk 5,484 million) with 
the main asset being the product rights to rabipur/rabavert and 
encepur of dkk 5,186 million (dkk 5,459 million). the product rights 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives  
of 20 years with an annual amortization of dkk 273 million. 
in july 2020, the company concluded a license and collaboration agree-
ment with adaptvac. the license agreement provides bavarian nordic 
the global commercialization rights to a covid-19 vaccine candidate 
based on adaptvac’s technology. under the terms of the agreement, 
bavarian nordic made an upfront payment of eur 4 million to adapt-
vac. the upfront payment has been capitalized and recognized as 
acquired patents and licenses. 
property, plant and equipment stood at dkk 1,011 million (dkk 846 
million) and included asset under construction of dkk 213 million (dkk 
618 million). assets under construction relates mainly to the fill and

building, the installations and the freezedryer, filing and packaging

related to sale of rabipur/rabavert and encepur products.
as of december 31, 2020, cash and securities stood at dkk 1,670 
million (dkk 472 million). the increase in the cash position follows the 
sale of the priority review voucher and the rights issue partly offset by 
the repayment of the bridge loan. 
bavarian nordic’s cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested 
in deposit accounts with highly rated banks and in short-term danish 
government and mortgage bonds.

million (dkk 1,865 million). net proceeds from the rights issue in

marketing authorizations for the main markets. in 2020, the company 
also paid an adjustment to the upfront consideration. total payment 
to glaxosmithkline amounted to dkk 394 million. the adjustment of

395 million (dkk 1,771 million) and included the european investment

treasury shares
in august 2020, the board of directors decided to launch a 
share buy-back program, under which the company bought 
back 52,397 of its own shares (28,849 shares in 2019). 
the purpose of the share buy-back program was to meet 
the company’s obligations arising from the share-based 
incentive program for the executive management and 
the board of directors. under the share-based incentive 
program, payment of half of the achieved bonus for 2019 
for members of the executive management are converted 
to restricted stock units for a value corresponding to half 
of the achieved bonus. the restricted stock units will be 
released to the executive management 3 years after grant. 
this to further increase the long-term shared interests 
between the executive management and the company’s 
shareholders. the board of directors is granted restricted 
stock units corresponding to 50% of the annual fee (excl. 
committee fee). the vesting period for those restricted 
stock units is also 3 years.
treasury shares represent 0.18% (0.21%) of the total share 
capital.
for further information about share based payment see 
note 30.

except for changes due to implementation of new and 
revised standards that were effective january 1, 2020. 
the consolidated financial statements are presented in 
danish kroner (dkk), which is the functional currency of the 
parent company.
the consolidated financial statements are presented on a 
historical cost basis, apart from derivative financial instru-
ments, securities and liability relating to phantom shares, 
which are measured at fair value.
the accounting policies have been consistently applied for 
the financial year and for the comparative figures except 
for implementation of new standards and amendments, 
see further below.
in the narrative sections of the consolidated financial state-
ments comparative figures for 2019 are shown in brackets.
implementation of new and revised standards and 
interpretations
the international accounting standards board (iasb) has is-
sued new standards and revisions to existing standards (ifrs) 
and new interpretations (ifric) which are mandatory for 
accounting periods commencing on or after january 1, 2020.
the group has adopted the following revised standards and 
interpretations:
•  amendments to ifrs 3, definition of a business
•  amendments to ias 1 and ias 8, definition of materiality
•  amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7, ibor reform
•  amendments to ifrs 16, covid-19-related rent 
 concessions
the implementation of new or revised standards and 
interpretations that are effective from january 1, 2020 has 
not had a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements in 2020. furthermore, management does not 
anticipate any significant impact on future periods from the 
adoption of these new amendments.
standards and interpretations not yet in force 
at the date of publication of the consolidated financial 
statements, a number of new and amended standards and 
interpretations have not yet entered into force or have not 
yet been adopted by the eu. therefore, they are not incor-
porated in the consolidated financial statements.
none of the new or amended standards and interpretations 
are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.
applying materiality
the consolidated financial statements are a result of 
processing large numbers of transactions and aggregating 
those transactions into classes according to their nature 
or function. the transactions are presented in classes of 
similar items in the consolidated financial statements. if a 
line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with 
other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial 
statements or in the notes. 
the specific disclosures required by ifrs are provided in 
the consolidated financial statements unless the informa-
tion is considered immaterial to the users of the financial 
statements.
accounting policies
the accounting policies for specific line items are described 
in the notes to the financial statements. set out below 
is a description of the accounting policies for the basis of 
consolidation, foreign currency translation and the cash 
flow statement.
recognition and measurement
income is recognized in the income statement when gen-
erated. assets and liabilities are recognized in the balance 
sheet when it is probable that any future economic benefit 
will flow to or from the group and the value can be reliably 
measured. on initial recognition, assets and liabilities are 
measured at cost. subsequently, assets and liabilities are 
measured as described in the description of the accounting 
policies in the respective notes to the financial statements.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include bavarian nor-
dic a/s and the subsidiaries in which the group holds more 
than 50% of the voting rights or otherwise has control. 
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the 
basis of the financial statements of the parent company 
and the individual subsidiaries, and these are prepared in 
accordance with the group’s accounting policies and for the 
same accounting period.
intra-group income and expenses together with all in-
tra-group profits, receivables and payables are eliminated 
on consolidation. in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements, the book value of shares in subsidiar-
ies held by the parent company is set off against the equity 
of the subsidiaries.
foreign currency translation 
on initial recognition, transactions denominated in curren-
cies other than the group’s functional currency are translat-
ed at the exchange rate ruling at the transaction date.
receivables, payables and other monetary items denom-
inated in foreign currencies that have not been settled at 
the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date. 
exchange differences between the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction and the exchange rate at the date 
of payment or the balance sheet date, respectively, are rec-
ognized in the income statement under financials. property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets, inventories 
and other nonmonetary assets acquired in foreign currency 
and measured based on historical cost are translated at the 
exchange rates at the transaction date. 
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of 
subsidiaries whose financial statements are presented in 
a functional currency other than danish kroner (dkk), the 
income statements are translated at the average exchange 
rates of the respective months. 
balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at 
the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising on the 
translation of foreign subsidiaries’ opening balance sheet 
items to the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and 
on the translation of the income statements from average 
exchange rates of the respective months to exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date are recognized as other compre-
hensive income.

segment reporting
the group does not prepare segment reporting inter-
nally and therefore only reports one operating segment 
 externally.
geographic spilt of revenue and revenue from major cus-
tomers is disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements. geographic location of noncurrent assets is 
disclosed in note 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is prepared in accordance with 
the indirect method on the basis of the group’s net profit 
for the year. the statement shows the group’s cash flows 
broken down into operating, investing and financing activi-
ties, cash and cash equivalents at year end and the impact 
of the calculated cash flows on the group’s cash and cash 
equivalents.
cash flows in foreign currencies are translated into danish 
kroner (dkk) at the exchange rate on the transaction date.
in the cash flows from operating activities, net profit for the 
year is adjusted for non-cash operating items and changes 
in working capital. 
cash flows from investing activities include cash flows from 
the purchase and sale of intangible assets, property, plant 
and equipment, investments and securities. 
cash flows from financing activities include cash flows from 
the raising and payment of loans and capital increases. 
additionally, cash flows from assets held under finance 
leases are recognized by way of lease payments made.

significant accounting estimates and judgments
significant accounting estimates
in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements, management makes a number of accounting 
estimates, which form the basis for the presentation, 
recognition and measurement of the group’s assets and 
liabilities.
the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities 
often depend on future events that are somewhat uncer-
tain. in that connection, it is necessary to assume a course 
of events that reflects management’s assessment of the 
most probable course of events. 
the significant accounting estimates identified are those 
that have a significant risk of resulting in a material 
adjustment to the measurement of assets and liabilities 
in the following reporting period. management bases 
its estimates on historical experience and various other 
assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the cir-
cumstances. the estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. if necessary, changes are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. 
management considers the key accounting estimates to be 
reasonable and appropriate based on currently available 
information. the actual amounts may differ from the 
amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes 
available.
management has made the following accounting estimates 
which significantly affect the amounts recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements:

revenue
accounting policies
sale of goods
revenue from sale of goods is recognized when the com-
pany has transferred control of products sold to the buyer 
and it is probable that the company will collect the consid-
eration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. 
control of the products is transferred at a point in time, 
typically on delivery. the amount of sales to be recognized 
is based on the consideration the company expects to re-
ceive in exchange for its goods. when sales are recognized, 
the company also records estimates for a variety of sales 
deductions, including product returns as well as rebates and 
discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health in-
surance companies, managed healthcare organisations and 
retail customers. revenue is measured net of value added 
tax, duties, etc. collected on behalf of a third party. 
where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, the 
company recognizes sales when the acceptance criteria are 
satisfied.
where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are 
recognized as other liabilities. wholesaler charge-backs are 
netted against trade receivable balances.
the pricing mechanisms in the us market and the different 
kind of rebates are described below.
pricing mechanisms in the us market 
in the us, sales rebates are paid in connection with govern-
ment and commercial programmes. key customers in the 
us include private payers, group purchasing organizations 
(gpos) and government payers. gpos play a role in
negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for 
the commercial channels, and determine which drugs are 
offered as preferred options on their drug lists. 
us wholesaler charge-backs 
wholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements 
between the company and indirect customers in the us 
whereby products are sold at contract prices lower than the 
list price originally charged to wholesalers. a wholesaler 
charge-back represents the difference between the invoice 
price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer’s contract 
price. accruals are calculated for estimated charge-backs 
using a combination of factors such as historical experience, 
current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the 
value of claims received but not yet processed.
us medicaid & medicare rebates 
medicaid & medicare are government insurance pro-
grammes. medicaid and medicare rebates have been 
estimated using a combination of historical experience, 
product and population growth, price increases, and the 
impact of contracting strategies. the calculation also 
involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are sub-
ject to changes in interpretative guidance from government 
authorities. the company adjusts the provision periodically 
to reflect actual sales performance. 
other us discounts and sales returns 
other discounts are provided to wholesalers, hospitals, 
pharmacies, etc. they are usually linked to sales volume or 
provided as cash discounts. accruals are calculated based 
on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales 
at the time the related sales are recorded. estimated sales 
returns are related to damaged or expired products.
sale of services and licenses
furthermore, revenue comprises the fair value of the con-
sideration received or receivable for income derived from 
development services where revenue is measured at the 
expected net sales price.
sales of licenses that transfer the rights associated with 
ownership of an intangible asset are recognized at a point 
in time when control is transferred. revenue from develop-
ment services and licenses that do not transfer the right of 
ownership to an intangible asset are recognized over time 
in line with the execution and delivery of the work.
agreements with commercial partners generally include 
non-refundable upfront license and collaboration fees, 
milestone payments, the receipt of which is dependent 
upon the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory or 
commercial milestones, as well as royalties on product 
sales of licensed products, if and when such product sales 
occur, and revenue from the supply of products. for these 
agreements that include multiple elements, total contract 
consideration is attributed to separately identifiable 
components on a reliable basis that reasonably reflects 
the selling prices that might be expected to be achieved in 
stand-alone transactions provided that each component has 
value to the partner on a stand-alone basis. the allocated 
consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with 
the principles described above. further details regard-
ing recognition of revenue on the main contracts with 
biomedical advanced research and development authority 
(barda) and janssen vaccines & prevention b.v. are 
described below.
significant accounting estimates
provisions for sales deductions
sales discounts and rebates are predominantly issued 
in the us in connection with the us federal and state 
government healthcare programs, namely medicare and 
medicaid, and commercial rebates. 
the estimate of sales discounts and rebates is based on 
a calculation which includes a combination of historical 
utilization data, combined with expectations in relation 
to the development in sales and utilization. furthermore, 
specific circumstances regarding the different programs 
are considered. the obligations concerning sales discounts 
and rebates are incurred at the time the sale is recorded. 
however, the actual discount or rebate related to a specific 
sale may be invoiced later. 
the company considers the provisions established for sales 
discounts and rebates to be reasonable and appropriate 
based on currently available information. however, the 
actual amount of discounts and rebates may differ from the 
amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes 
available.
partner contracts
whether a component of a multiple element contract has 
value to the partner on a stand-alone basis is based on 
an assessment of specific facts and circumstances and is 
associated with judgement. this applies also to the assess-
ment of whether a license transfers rights associated with 
ownership of an intangible asset. furthermore, allocation 
of the total consideration of a contract to separately iden-
tifiable components requires considerable estimates and 
judgement to be made by management.

accounting for contract with biomedical advanced 
research and development authority (barda)
in september 2017 the company secured a contract award 
from biomedical advanced research and development 
authority (barda) for supply of freeze-dried smallpox 
vaccine. the potential value of the initial base and optional 
awards is in excess of usd 539 million. initial base award 
secures additional smallpox bulk contract of usd 100 mil-
lion and initial options valued at usd 439 million. the initial 
options are divided between two distinct areas, the first 
of which is the filling and freeze-drying of smallpox bulk 
products, with total potential value of usd 299 million. the 
second part of the contract contains provisions for clinical 
development, regulatory commitments, and parts of the 
establishment and validation of fill and finish activities, 
with potential value of up to usd 140 million. the award 
also contains options to acquire additional vaccine bulk 
and/or doses of smallpox vaccine in the future.
the initial bulk procurement contract of usd 100 million 
for delivery of 40 bulk drug substance (bds) batches of 
smallpox vaccine was revenue recognized during 2018 and 
2019. recognition of revenue occured in concurrence with 
release of the bds batches. 
in april 2020 barda placed a new order under the con-
tract, awarded in 2017, for the manufacturing and supply 
of jynneos (smallpox and monkeypox vaccine), at a total 
value of usd 202 million. the contract expansion covers 
two years of performance and includes the manufacturing 
of additional bulk vaccine (30 bulk drug substance (bds) 
batches in 2020 and 35 batches in 2021) and the supply 
of up to 1.4 million doses of liquid frozen jynneos. the 
first usd 106 million of the award was exercised in april 
2020, whereas the second part was exercised in december 
2020, where barda committed to an additional usd 83 
million for the procurement of more bulk smallpox vaccine, 
which will be manufactured and invoiced in 2021. during 
2020, 30 bulk drug substance (bds) batches have been 
recognized as revenue in concurrence with release of the 
bds batches. 
the bds products remain in the company’s physical 
possession as the procurement contract includes filling and 
freeze-drying of the bds batches (a bill-and-hold arrange-
ment). the company is paid for the custodial service as 
part of the contract. the filling activities are going to take 
place in kvistgaard in 2021-2023 when the new fill and 
finish manufacturing facility is operational.
payment is due within 30 days after invoicing.
the company has also been awarded funding for de-
velopment work related to “clinical activities to support 
licensure” of the freeze-dried version of smallpox vaccine. 
the contract is funded based on cost incurred plus a fixed 
margin. recognition of revenue follows the timing of cost 
incurred. payment is due within 30 days after invoicing.
a new award was obtained in january 2019 to cover quali-
fication of the new fill and finish facility, as well as transfer 
and validation of the freeze-drying process (contract option 
valued at usd 33 million). in 2020 dkk 76 million (dkk 128 
million) was recognized as revenue. the remaining funds 
will be recognized as revenue in 2021. the contract is fund-
ed based on cost occurred plus a fixed margin. recognition 
of revenue follows the timing of cost incurred. payment is 
due within 30 days after invoicing. the award also included 
usd 11 million for storage of bulk drug substance until 
filling and future shipments of final products (total award 
of usd 44 million). dkk 9 million has been recognized in 
revenue for storage during 2020. the remaining revenue 
will be recognized over the coming years.
accounting for license and collaboration agreements 
with janssen vaccines & prevention b.v.
the company has concluded three license and collaboration 
agreements with janssen vaccines & prevention b.v. for 
development of vaccines against cancers induced by hu-
man papillomavirus (hpv), hepatitis b virus (hbv) and the 
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). all three contracts 
contains an upfront payment and subsequent milestone 
payments following the progress in the clinical develop-
ment program. 
each contract has two performance obligations, both paid 
for by the upfront and milestone payments in the contracts: 
1) conduct development work according to the develop-
ment plan and 2) grant of a license for use of mva-bn® 
vector. revenue for the development work is recognized 
over time using the “expected cost plus a margin ap-
proach”, i.e. recognized over time based on cost incurred 
plus a margin. allocation of revenue for the license grant 
is calculated using the “residual approach” by estimating 
the stand-alone selling price by reference to the total trans-
action price less the sum of the revenue allocated to the 
development work. when assessing residual value avail-
able for allocation to the license grant, expected costs for 
future development work are taken into consideration to 
ensure enough revenue is deferred to ensure an appropri-
ate margin on the development work over the period until 
the next milestone payment event. the residual value is 
calculated and recognized as revenue for the license grant 
when a milestone payment is received. revenue related to 
the license grant will increase over time if and when the 
next clinical milestone is reached, reflecting that the value 
of the license is expected in concurrence with the progress 
in the clinical development program. 
janssen vaccines & prevention b.v. obtains control of the 
development work in concurrence with work performed 
and therefore the recognition of revenue follows the timing 
of cost incurred.
as of december 31, 2020 all the initial prepayments under 
the contracts have been recognized as revenue. under the 
hpv contract a new prepayment of usd 2.5 million was 
recevied in february 2020 related to production of a new 
master seed virus. the full prepayment is recognized in the 
balance sheet, cf. note 28.

sales and distribution costs
the clinical activities to support licensure of the freeze-
dried version of smallpox vaccine and qualification of the 
new fill and finish facility including transfer and validation 
of the freeze-drying process was higher during 2019 com-
pared to 2020, therefore the decrease in contract costs.
other production costs amounted to dkk 233.2 million 
(dkk 48.3 million), of which net write-downs of inventory 
totaled dkk 25.2 million (dkk 4.0 million). development 
in write-downs is further described in note 19. other 
production costs also includes an accrual for write-downs 
of obsolete products related to the distribution switch of 
rabipur/rabavert and encepur from glaxosmithkline. this 
was disclosed as a contigent liability in the q3 2020 interim 
report.
the product rights to rabipur/rabavert and encepur are 
amortized over 20 years with an annual amortization of 
dkk 273 million.
accounting policies
production costs consist of costs incurred in generat-
ing the revenue for the year. costs for raw materials, con-
sumables, production staff and a proportion of production 
overheads, including maintenance, amortization, depre-
ciation and impairment of intangible and tangible assets 
used in production as well as operation, administration and 
management of the production facility are recognized as 
production costs. amortization of acquired product rights 
are recognized as production costs. in addition, the costs 
related to excess capacity and write-down to net realisable 
value of goods on stock are recognized as other production 
costs.
accounting policies
sales and distribution costs comprise costs incurred 
for the sale and distribution of products sold during the 
year. this includes costs incurred for sales campaigns, 
training and administration of the sales force and for direct 
distribution, marketing and promotion. also included are 
salaries and other costs for the sales, distribution and mar-
keting functions, loss allowance for expected credit losses, 
amortization, depreciation and other indirect costs.

accounting policies
administrative costs include costs of group manage-
ment, staff functions, administrative personnel, office costs, 
rent, short-term lease payments and depreciation not relat-
ing specifically to production, research and development or 
sales and distribution. 
research and development costs include expenses for ex-
ternal clinical research organizations, or cro’s, of dkk 121.3 
million (dkk 140.6 million).
in october 2019, the company announced that the stage 1 
of the phase 2 study evaluating the combination therapy of 
cv301 for the treatment of patients with bladder cancer did 
not meet the efficacy threshold to progress into stage 2 with 
expanded enrollment. following this decision the cv301 
development project was expensed by dkk 22.2 million.
accounting policies
research and development costs include salaries 
and costs directly attributable to the group’s research and 
development projects, less government grants. further-
more, salaries and costs supporting direct research and 
development, including costs of patents, rent, leasing 
and depreciation attributable to laboratories, and external 
scientific consultancy services, are recognized under 
research and development costs. no indirect or general 
overhead costs that are not directly attributable to research 
and development activities are included in the disclosure 
of research and development expenses recognized in the 
income statement.
research costs are expensed in the year they occur.
development costs are generally expensed in the year 
they occur. in line with industry custom, capitalization 
of development costs does not begin until it is deemed 
realistic that the product can be completed and marketed 
and it is highly likely that a marketing authorization will be 
received. in addition, there must be sufficient certainty that 
the future earnings to the group will cover not only produc-
tion costs, direct distribution and administrative costs, but 
also the development costs.
contract research and development costs incurred to 
achieve revenue are included in “research and develop-
ment costs incurred this year” and then transferred under 
“contract costs recognized as production costs” to be 
recognized as production costs.
grants that compensate the group for research and devel-
opment expenses incurred, which are recognized directly 
in the income statement, are set off against the costs of 
research and development at the time when a final and 
binding right to the grant has been obtained.

tax for the year
tax on income is an expense of dkk 4.5 million recognized 
in bavarian nordic gmbh (dkk 2.0 million), corresponding 
to an effective tax rate of 1.6% for the group (negative 
0.6%). the effective tax rate for 2020 is positively impact-
ed by the new danish tax scheme allowing 30% ‘step-up’ 
deduction for costs related to research and development 
activities paid by danish entities (reduces tax for the year 
by dkk 13 million). the reduction in not recognized de-
ferred tax asset (dkk 54 million) also reduces the effective 
tax rate. the effective tax rate for 2019 was impacted by 
write-down of the tax asset and the change in non-recog-
nized tax asset related to write-down of cv301.
accounting policies
income tax for the year comprises current tax and 
deferred tax for the year. the part relating to the profit for 
the year is recognized in the income statement, and the 
part attributable to items in the comprehensive income is 
recognized in the comprehensive income statement.
the tax effect of costs that have been recognized directly in 
equity is recognized in equity under the relevant items.
current tax receivable is recognized in the balance sheet 
under current asset.
current tax payable is recognized in the balance sheet 
under current liabilities.
deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability 
method on all temporary differences between accounting 
values and tax values. deferred tax liabilities arising from 
temporary tax differences are recognized in the balance 
sheet as a liability.
deferred tax assets arising from temporary deductible 
differences and tax losses carried forward are recognized 
when it is probable that they can be realized by offsetting 
them against taxable temporary differences or future 
taxable profits. at each balance sheet date, it is assessed 
whether it is probable that there will be sufficient future 
taxable income for the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
deferred income tax is provided on temporary taxable dif-
ferences arising on investments in subsidiaries, unless the 
parent company is able to control the timing when the de-
ferred tax is to be realized and it is likely that the deferred 
tax will not be realized within the foreseeable future.
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates applicable on the 
balance sheet date for the income years in which the tax 
asset is expected to be utilized.

deferred tax
recognized deferred tax assets relate to temporary 
differences between the tax base and accounting carrying 
amount and tax losses carried forward.
deferred tax assets arising from temporary deductible 
differences and tax losses carried forward are recognized 
to the extent they are expected to be offset against future 
taxable income.
recognized tax losses carried forward relate to bavarian 
nordic a/s and the two danish subsidiaries aktieselskabet 
af 1. juni 2011 i and aktieselskabet af 1. juni 2011 ii.
the tax value of non-recognized tax losses carried forward 
in bavarian nordic a/s and the two danish subsidiaries 
amounts to dkk 362.2 million (dkk 362.1 million), whereas 
the tax value of non-recognized temporary deductible 
differences amounts to dkk 10.5 million (dkk 64.4 million). 
tax rate used for danish entities is 22%.
as bavarian nordic, inc. has moved from california to north 
carolina in january 2017, the state tax losses and state tax 
credit carried forward will most likely never be utilized, 
hence no tax asset has been recognized. 
bavarian nordic gmbh and bavarian nordic switzerland ag 
have no tax losses carried forward.
the company’s right to use the tax losses carried forward is 
not time-limited.
non-recognized deferred tax asset on current year losses 
in foreign subsidiaries also includes deferred tax on inter-
company transactions between bavarian nordic a/s and 
bavarian nordic, inc. under the distribution agreement for 
sale of rabavert in us, dkk 14.6 million (dkk 0 million).

earnings per share (eps)
accounting policies
earnings per share is calculated as the profit or loss 
for the year compared to the weighted average of the 
issued shares in the financial year. the basis for the calcula-
tion of diluted earnings per share is the weighted-average 
number of ordinary shares in the financial year adjusted for 
the dilutive effects of warrants.

accounting policies
intangible assets are measured at historic cost less 
accumulated amortization and impairment losses. cost 
of acquired product rights are measured at cash consid-
eration and present value of any deferred payments for 
those rights. furthermore costs of acquired product rights 
include transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acqusition.
internal development projects that meet the requirements 
for recognition as intangible assets are measured at direct 
cost relating to the development projects.
amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the 
useful economic lives of the assets.
the useful lives of acquired product rights are estimated to 
be 20 years and software is estimated to be 3-5 years.
amortization of acquired product rights is recognized as 
part of cost of goods sold under production costs.
impairment
the carrying amounts of intangible assets carried at cost 
or amortized cost are tested at least annually to determine 
whether there are indications of any impairment in excess 
of that expressed in normal amortization. if that is the 
case, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. impairment losses on intangible assets are 
recognized under the same line item as amortization of the 
assets.
for development projects in progress, the recoverable 
amount is assessed annually, regardless of whether any 
indications of impairment have been found.
significant accounting estimates
when determining the amortization period for 
acquired product rights, management need to make 
an assessment of expected useful economic life. in the 
assessment management take among other things the fol-
lowing components into consideration: the maturity of the 
products acquired, development in the market the acquired 
products are targeting, the current competitors, clinical 
development of new competing products and entry barriers 
to the market due to advanced production technology. 
straight-line amortization reflects the use and impairment 
of the product rights.
management continuously updates the valuation model 
used when acquiring the product rights to assess the value 
creation expected from the acquisition. the latest update 
of the model indicates a value above the net present value 
of the purchase price, hence there is no indications of 
impairment.
as per december 31, 2020 management still judge that 
the sales milestone of eur 25 million included in asset pur-
chase agreement is not probably and therefore the present 
value has not been added to the cost of the product rights.
significant accounting judgments
management has made the following accounting 
judgment which significantly affect the amounts recognized 
in the consolidated financial statements:
the acquisition of the two product rights from glaxosmith-
kline does not include any legal entities, and no other 
tangible asset, no employees and no working capital has 
been transferred to the company as part of the transaction. 
management has assessed that the acquisition constitute 
an asset deal and not a business combination. in determin-
ing the accounting treatment, management has performed 
judgments and estimates determining the method for 
determination of the cost price of the acquired products 
rights including the method and period of amortization and 
method for recognition of deferred consideration.

product rights
december 31, 2019 the company acquired the product 
rights to two commercial products owned by glaxosmith-
kline - rabipur/rabavert and encepur. the products are 
further described in the management commentary. 
the products have been on the market for more than 20 
years. there is no need to further develop the products. 
management assess that it will require up to 10 years 
of clinical development for competitors to bring a new 
competing product to the market likewise the production 
process required to produce these products is highly com-
plex. based on these factors management assess that the 
acquired product rights should be amortized over 20 years.
the acquisition price for the two product rights consist of 
the upfront payment and the present value of the mile-
stone payments included in the asset purchase agreement 
with glaxosmithkline, see further below. transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition have also 
been included in the acquisition price. the upfront payment 
and the transaction costs have been divided between the 
two acquired product rights based on a 60%/40% split 
equal to the historical revenue split of the two products. 
the milestone payments, except for the sales milestone, 
are specific for each product and have been allocated 
accordingly.

the milestone payments relate to transfer and re-regis-

different steps of the production and packaging activities 
as well as a milestone payment when all services agreed 
to be rendered has been completed. the asset purchase 
agreement specifies the above milestone payments for 
each product. in total eur 470 million. the asset purchase 
agreement with glaxosmithkline also includes a sales 
milestone of eur 25 million. the sales milestone is related 
to the total revenue of the two products. as management 
didn’t judge the sales milestone to be probable as per de-
cember 31, 2019, the sales milestone was not recognized 
as part of the product rights at initial recognition.
deferred consideration for the acquired product rights are 
described in note 25.
acquired patents and licenses
in july 2020, the company concluded a license and collab-
oration agreement with adaptvac. the license agreement 
provides the company the global commercialization rights 
to a covid-19 vaccine candidate based on adaptvac’s 
technology. the company has conducted a preclinical study 
for which positive results were announced march 8, 2021. 
adaptvac will initiate a phase 1/2 open label, dose-escala-
tion trial sponsored by radhould university medical center.
the company will assume responsibility for the further 
clinical development and manufacturing. under the terms 
of the agreement, the company made an upfront payment 
of eur 4 million to adaptvac. the upfront payment has 
been capitalized and recognized as “acquired patents and 
licenses”. the company has also committed to payment 
of potential future development and sales milestones and 
tiered royalties. as those milestone payments are not 
assessed to be probable as per december 31, 2020, these 
milestone payments are not recognized as an asset and a 
liability.
the company will start amortizing the acquired license 
once a vaccine has been approved. at least annually man-
agement will assess if any indications of impairment.
intangible assets in progress
rabipur/rabavert and encepur are currently manufactured 
by glaxosmithkline and the basis of the technology transfer 
to the company is an as-is transfer of the current manufac-
turing process. this transfer will be a staged process, start-
ing with packaging then filling and ending with the transfer 
of bulk manufacturing. the company will incur material 
costs in terms of internal labour and consultancy to handle 
the technology transfer and gain crucial knowledge about 
the manufacturing process. these costs will be capitalized 
as an intangible asset. as per december 31, 2020 the 
capitalized costs amounts to dkk 38.1 million, recognized 
as intangible assets in progress. other intable assets in 
progress relates to it investments.

property, plant and equipment
accounting policies
property, plant and equipment include land and 
buildings, production equipment, leasehold improvements, 
office and it equipment and laboratory equipment and 
is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
cost includes the costs directly attributable to the purchase 
of the asset, until the asset is ready for use. for assets con-
structed by the group cost includes materials, components, 
third-party suppliers and labour. 
borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of 
property, plant and equipment are included in cost. other 
borrowing costs are recognized in the income statement.
depreciation is charged over the expected economic lives 
of the assets, and the depreciation methods, expected 
lives and residual values are reassessed individually for the 
assets at the end of each financial year. assets are depreci-
ated on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives 
as follows:
buildings  
10–20 years
installations  
5–15 years
leasehold improvements  
5 years
office and it equipment  
3–5 years
laboratory equipment  
5–10 years
production equipment  
3–15 years
management reviews the estimated useful lives of material 
property, plant and equipment at the end of each financial 
year.
impairment
the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment 
carried at cost or amortized cost are tested annually to 
determine whether there are indications of any impairment 
in excess of that expressed in normal depreciation. if that 
is the case, the asset is written down to the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use. impairment losses on property, 
plant and equipment are recognized under the same line 
item as depreciation of the assets.

right-of-use-assets
as of 1 january 2019, bavarian nordic applied ifrs 16 
‘leases’ for the first time. ifrs 16 “leases” replaced ias 17 
“leases”, and the new standard was implemented using 
the simplified retrospective transition approach without 
restating comparative figures, with a lease asset value 
equal to the lease liability value upon transition. upon 
implementation january 1, 2019, the group recognized a 
right-of-use-asset of dkk 83 million and a lease liability 
of dkk 83 million. the implementation did not have any 
impact on equity.
accounting policies
the right-of-use assets comprise the initial meas-
urement of the corresponding lease liability. right-of-use 
assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
all operating leases with a lease term of more than 12 
months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-
use-assets. 
for leases with a lease term of less than 12 months the 
lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
the right-of-use-assets are measured at the present value 
of all future lease payments. when assessing the lease 
term, any extension or termination options are included in 
the assessment. the options are included in determining 
the lease term, if exercise is reasonably certain. when de-
termining the discount rates used to calculate the net pres-
ent value of future lease payments, an incremental country 
specific borrowing rate is used, based on a government 
bond plus the group’s credit margin, ranging from 2.5% to 
3.0%. a single discount rate is used for a portfolio of lease 
assets with reasonable similar characteristics. initial direct 
costs are not included in measurement of the right-of-
use-assets. non-lease components are not separated from 
lease components. 
impact from change in lease terms, lease payments or mod-
ification of the lease contract is further described in note 27.
right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period 
of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. the 
depreciation starts at the commencement date of the 
lease. ias 36 is applied to determine whether a right-of-
use asset is impaired and any identified impariment losses 
are accounted for as described in note 16.

inventories
the inventory of rabipur/rabavert and encepur products 
amounted to dkk 307.5 million (dkk 0 million) as per 
december 31, 2020.
during 2020 a provisional write-down of dkk 21 million 
was made for batches at risk. later in the year the final 
release tests failed and products were scrapped and 
recognized as ‘use of write-down’. use of write-down also 
includes scrap of old jynneos vials full written down prior 
years.
2019 write-downs included a reversal of write-down on 
three batches that subsequently were deemed usable 
for the validation of the freeze-drying production process 
funded by the u.s. biomedical advanced research and 
development authority (barda). the batches were used 
and sold under the barda funded contract and recognized 
as contract income.
accounting policies
inventories except for raw materials are measured at 
the lower of cost using the weighted average cost formula 
method less write-downs for obsolescence and net realis-
able value. raw materials are measured at cost based on 
the fifo method. for raw materials, cost is determined as 
direct acquisition costs incurred. the cost of finished goods 
produced in-house and work in progress includes raw 
materials, consumables, filling cost, qc testing and direct 
payroll costs plus indirect costs of production. 
indirect costs of production include indirect materials and 
labour as well as maintenance of and depreciation on the 
machinery used in production processes, factory buildings 
and equipment used and cost of production administration 
and management. the net realisable value is the estimated 
sales price in the ordinary course of business less relevant 
sales costs determined on the basis of marketability, obso-
lescence and changes in the expected sales price.
significant accounting estimates
production overheads are measured on the basis 
of actual costs. the basis of the actual costs is reassessed 
regularly to ensure that they are adjusted for changes in 
the utilization of production capacity, production changes 
and other relevant factors. biological living material is used, 
and the measurements and assumptions for the estimates 
made may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected 
events or circumstances may occur, which may cause the 
actual outcomes to later deviate from these estimates. it 
may be necessary to change previous estimates as a result 
of changes in the assumptions on which the estimates 
were based or due to new information or subsequent 
events, for which certainty could not be achieved in the 
earlier estimates.
estimates that are material to the financial reporting are 
made in the determination of any impairment of invento-
ries as a result of ‘out-of-specification’ products, expiry of 
products and sales risk.

credit risk
the group's customers are predominantly public authorities 
and renowned pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers, 
therefore the credit risk is very low. historically the group 
hasn’t recognized losses on receivables. there are some 
insignificant overdue receivables as of december 31, 2020 
(dkk 4 million). as of december 31, 2020 a loss allowance 
of dkk 80 thousand has been recognized. the loss allow-
ance is recognized in the income statement under sales 
and distribution costs.
the majority of sales of rabipur/rabavert and encepur are 
made to wholesalers where the risk of loss is very low and 
therefore the loss allowance is limited.
the group has applied the simplified approach to measure 
the expected credit loss and a lifetime expected loss 
allowance for all trade receivables.the allowance is an 
estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and 
the days past due. at the time of revenue recognition, the 
company assesses the full lifetime expected credit losses. 
in addition, undue and due receivables are analyzed in an 
ongoing process. based on the credit assessment, receiva-
bles analysis, historical experience and industry experience, 
it is estimated whether the receivables are recoverable or 
write-downs are needed. the company monitors the credit 
exposure on all customers, both new and existing.
the company recognizes a loss allowance for expected 
credit losses and writes off trade receivables when there is 
information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial 
difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. 
subsequent recovery of amounts previously written down 
is credited against sales and distribution costs.
the payment conditions for the customers, including credit 
periods and any payment of interest in case of non-pay-
ment, vary, but are always based on industry practice in 
the relevant market. the weighted average credit period is 
approximately 60 days for the sales of rabipur/rabavert 
and encepur.
the tables detail the risk profile for trade receivables.
accounting policies
receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair 
value and subsequently at amortized value usually equal to 
the nominal value, net of impairment based on expected 
credit losses.
write-downs are calculated using the ‘full lifetime expected 
credit losses’ method, whereby the likelihood of non-ful-
filment throughout the lifetime of the financial instrument 
is taken into consideration. a provision account is used for 
this purpose.

and will not be paid out before retirement. the company 
has decided to deposit the accrued amount, dkk 25.1 mil-
lion, to the holiday fund (“lønmodtagernes feriemidler”) 
to ensure the asset management of the funds. the deposit 
was made in february 2021.
for a further description of financial instruments see  
note 24. the phantom share programs are described in 
note 30.
accounting policies
derivative financial instruments and liability relating 
to phantom shares are measured at fair value. for further 
details regarding measurement of fair value for phantom 
shares see note 30.
other financial liabilities are measured at initial recognition 
at fair value less any transaction costs. subsequent other 
financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method, whereby the difference be-
tween proceeds and the nominal value is recognized in the 
income statement as a financial expense over the period. 
amortized cost usually equal to the nominal value.

accounting policies
derivative financial instruments 
on initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are 
measured at the fair value on the settlement date. 
directly attributable costs related to the purchase or 
issuance of the individual financial instruments (transaction 
costs) are added to the fair value on initial recognition, un-
less the financial asset or the financial liability is measured 
at fair value with recognition of fair value adjustments in 
the income statement. subsequently, they are measured 
at fair value at the balance sheet date based on the official 
exchange rates, market interest rates and other market 
data such as volatility adjusted for the special characteris-
tics of each instrument.
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
designated as and qualifying for recognition as effective 
hedges of future transactions (cash flow hedges) are rec-
ognized as comprehensive income. the ineffective portion 
is recognized immediately in the income statement. when 
the hedged transactions are realized, cumulative changes 
are recognized in the income statement together with the 
hedged transaction or in respect of a non-financial item as 
part of the cost of the transactions in question. 
for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized as 
financials in the income statement as they occur.
the company has designated certain derivative financial 
instruments as cash flow hedges as defined under ifrs 9 
“financial instruments”. hedge accounting is classified as 
a cash flow hedge when the hedges of a particular risk is 
associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast 
transactions.
securities
securities consist of listed bonds, which are measured 
at fair value on initial recognition and as of the balance

policy for managing financial risks
through its operations, investments and financing the 
group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates and 
interest rates. these risks are managed centrally in the 
parent company, which manages the group´s liquidity. the 
group pursues a treasury policy approved by the board of 
directors. the policy operates with a low risk profile, so that 
exchange rate risks, interest rate risks and credit risks arise 
only in commercial relations. the group therefore does not 
undertake any active speculation in financial risk.
the group´s capital structure is regularly assessed by the 
board of directors relative to the group´s cash flow position 
and cash flow budgets.
market risks
the pharmaceutical market is characterized by the aim of 
authorities to reduce or cap healthcare costs in general. 
market changes such as price reductions and launch of 
competing generic products may have a considerable 
impact on the earnings potential of pharmaceuticals.
interest rate risk
it is the group’s policy to hedge interest rate risks on 
loans whenever it is deemed that interest payments can 
be hedged at a satisfactory level relative to the related 
costs. hedging will then consist of interest rate swaps that 
convert floating rate loans to fixed rate loans. management 
determines the economic relationship between the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument to ensure a high hedge 
effectiveness. the interest rate risk involved in placing cash 
funds and investing in securities is managed on the basis 
of duration.
exchange rate risks
the group’s exchange rate exposure is primarily to usd and 
eur. the exchange rate exposure to usd is hedged to the 
greatest possible extent by matching incoming and outgo-
ing payments denominated in usd, looking at maximum 
one year ahead. regular assessments are made of whether 
the remaining net position should be hedged by currency 
forward contracts or currency option contracts.
the exposure to eur is not hedged as management be-
lieves that fluctuations in eur are limited due to the danish 
fixed-rate policy which is expected to be maintained. thus 
the fluctuations in eur do not have a significant impact on 
financial performance.
the table shows the net effect it would have had on equity 
and profit for the year if the year-end exchange rates of 
usd, eur and chf had been 15% or 1%, respectively, 
higher than the actual exchange rates. a corresponding fall 
in the actual exchange rates would have had an opposite 
(positive/negative) effect on profit and equity.

hedging of expected future cash flows
in december 2020 the company concluded currency 
forward contracts of usd 125 million to hedge the sale of 
bulk drug substance batches to barda following the award 
of the contract for 2021 deliveries. the concluded currency 
forward contracts are deemed to be 100% effective.
in december 2019 the company concluded a currency 
forward contract of usd 90 million to hedge the main part 
of the income from sale of the priority review voucher. 
in 2016 the company refinanced the old mortgage loans 
(fixed rate) and obtained a new mortgage loan with float-
ing rate. the company also concluded an interest rate swap 
to convert the floating rate loan to a fixed rate loan. the 
interest rate swap has the same maturity date and nominal 
amount as the mortgage loan to secure high effectiveness 
of the hedge.
cash risks
the group´s bank deposits are placed in deposit accounts 
without restrictions. the group’s cash and cash equivalents 
totaled dkk 285.4 million as of december 31, 2020 (dkk

fluctuations in interest rate levels affect the group’s bond 
portfolio. an increase in the interest rate level by 1 percent-
age point relative to the interest rate level on the balance 
sheet date would have had a negative impact of dkk 23.5 
million on the group´s profit and equity (dkk 25.5 million). 
a corresponding decrease in the interest rate level would 
have had a positive impact of dkk 23.5 million on profit 
and equity (dkk 25.5 million). the impact for 2019 was 
calculated based on the average bond portfolio holdings 
for the year. the bond portfolio was reduced to a very low

with respect to the group´s debt to credit institutions, an 
increase in the applicable interest rate by 1 percentage 
point would have had a negative impact on the group’s 
profit and equity of dkk 4.0 million (dkk 4.0 million). a 
corresponding decrease in the interest rate would have had 
an equivalent positive impact.
in may 2015, the group secured a loan facility of eur 50 
million from the european investment bank (eib) in support 
of the group’s research and development of vaccines 
against ebola and other infectious diseases as well as can-
cer immunotherapies. the loan facility, which is unsecured, 
was fully utilized in october 2017 with a net proceed of 
dkk 372.2 million. the loan is a five year bullet loan with 
expiry in 2022 and with a fixed interest of 3.532%.
in august 2018 the company was granted an unsecured 
loan facility of eur 30 million from the european invest-
ment bank to support the company’s investments in the 
fill and finish manufacturing facility. the loan facility, which 
is unsecured, may be utilized in up to three tranches. the 
repayment period may be up to seven years from disburse-
ment of the tranches. the loan could potentially carry a 
fixed or variable interest payment. the margin associated 
with the loan facility is 3.21%. as of december 31, 2020 
the balance remains unused. the company will have to 
draw down on the loan latest august 2021.
in october 2019, the company entered into a committed 
bridge loan facility agreement with citi and nordea as 
lenders pursuant to which the lenders granted a eur 185 
million (dkk 1,373 million) bridge loan to the company. 
the bridge loan was utilised on december 30, 2019 
and the proceeds were applied towards partly financing 
the upfront payment of the acquisition of product rights 
from glaxosmithkline, eur 307.6 million paid in cash on 
 december 31, 2019. 
the bridge loan was repaid march 2020 following the 
completion of the right issue. 
debt to credit institutions also include a mortgage loan of 
dkk 23.2 million (dkk 25.4 million), further described in 
note 26.
the group has a credit facility of dkk 20 million (dkk 20 
million) at nordea. as of december 31, 2020, dkk 0.1 
million (dkk 0.1 million) of the credit facility is utilized for 
bank guarantees.

credit risks
the primary credit risk relates to trade receivables. the 
company assesses the expected credit losses also con-
sidering changes in the macro environment that might 
impose an increased risk of losses. this is compared to the 
previous model where indications of credit losses were 
needed for the company to recognize an expected loss. 
the group´s customers are predominantly public authorities 
and renowned pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers, 
and the credit risk on the group’s receivables is therefore 
considered to be very low. a loss allowance of dkk 80 
thousand has been recognized as of december 31, 2020, 
cf. note 20.
to manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, 
the company only enters into derivative financial contracts 
and money market deposits with financial counterparties 
possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from 
at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies: 
standard and poor’s, moody’s and fitch.
cash and cash equivalents are not deemed to be subject to 
any special credit risk as they are deposited with nordea. 
the bond portfolio is invested in either danish government 
bonds, danish mortgage bonds or bonds issued by danish 
banks with high ratings.
optimization of capital structure
management regularly assesses whether the group´s 
capital structure best serves the interests of the group 
and its shareholders. the overall goal is to ensure that the 
group has a capital structure which supports its long-term 
strategy and growth target.
securities (level 1)
the portfolio of publicly traded government bonds, publicly 
traded mortgage bonds and bank bonds is valued at listed 
prices and price quotas.
derivative financial instruments (level 2)
currency forward contracts, currency option contracts and 
currency swap contracts are valued according to generally 
accepted valuation methods based on relevant observable 
swap curves and exchange rates.
liability relating to phantom shares is determined using the 
black-scholes. the valuation is based on observable share 
price, interest rates and volatility rates.

deferred consideration for product rights 
the asset purchase agreement with glaxosmithkline 
includes milestone payments relating to transfer and regis-
tration of marketing authorizations, technology transfer of 
different steps of the production and packaging activities 
as well as a milestone payment when all services agreed 
to be rendered by glaxosmithkline has been completed. in 
total eur 470 million. during 2020 the two first mile-
stone payments of a total of eur 50 million was paid. the 
payments are presented as cash flow from investment 
activities in the cash flow statement. the majority of the 
milestone payments are expected to be payable in 2022-
2023. the completion milestone is expected to be payable 
beginning of 2025.
the asset purchase agreement with glaxosmithkline 
also includes a sales milestone of eur 25 million. as per 
december 31, 2020 management does not judge the sales 
milestone to be probable and therefore the sales milestone 
has not been recognized as either part of the product rights 
(note 16) nor the deferred consideration for product rights.
the carrying amount are measured using a discount rate of 
4% per annum. the discount rate was determined at intial 
recognition based on an interest rate on a similar loan of 
the same size and maturity as the contingent milestone 
payments and the company’s credit rating as of december 
31, 2019. 
the fair value of the deferred consideration as per decem-
ber 31, 2020 amounts to dkk 2,838 million, measured 
using the updated discount rate of 3.8%. the discount rate 
has been determined based on the same components as 
described above.
accounting policies
deferred consideration including contingent mile-
stone payments for product rights is recognized when its 
payment is probable and it can be measured reliably and 
is at initial recognition measured at fair value which equals 
present value of future deferred payments. subsequently, 
the deferred consideration is measured at amortized cost. 
this means that the difference between the present value 
of the consideration and the nominal amounts due is 
recognized in the income statement as a financial expense 
over the period until expected payment date using the 
effective interest method. 
the expected phasing of future payments and the probabil-
ity of contingent payments are assessed on each reporting 
date.
the cash flow from payment of deferred consideration 
for product rights will be recognized as cash flow from 
investment activities.

the fair value of the debt to credit institutions amounts to 
dkk 395.6 million (dkk 1,779.5 million). the fair value of 
mortgage debt is based on the market value of the un-
derlying bonds set by the bank (level 2), whereas the fair 
value of the bridge loan and the european investment bank 
loan is based on a discounted cash analysis flow of future 
payments of interest and principal by applying a market 
based discount rate (level 2). 
the bridge loan was repaid end march 2020 when the 
rights issue was completed.
the tables below detail changes in the group’s liabilities 
arising from financing activities, both cash and non-cash 
changes. liabilities arising from financing activities are 
those for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will 
be, classified in the group’s consolidated statement of cash 
flow as cash flows from financing activities.
accounting policies  
loans are measured at the time of borrowing at 
fair value less any transaction costs. subsequently, debt is 
measured at amortized cost. this means that the difference 
between the proceeds of the loan and the amount to be 
repaid is recognized in the income statement over the 
term of the loan as a financial expense using the effective 
interest method.

lease liabilities
accounting policies
the lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments (see further in note 
18), discounted by using an incremental country specific 
borrowing rate ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% applying only 
a single discount rate for a portfolio of lease assets with 
reasonable similar characteristics. 
the lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing 
the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability 
using the effective interest method and by reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.
the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding 
adjustments are made to the related right-of-use-asset 
whenever:
•  the lease term has changed, in which case the lease 
liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease 
payments using a revised discount rate.
•  the lease payments change due to changes in an index 
or rate, in which case the lease liability is remeasured 
by discounting the revised lease payments using an 
unchanged discount rate.
•  a lease contract is modified and the lease modification 
is not accounted for as a seperate lease, in which case 
the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease term 
of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease 
payments using a revised discount rate at the effective 
date of the modification.

share-based payment
accounting policies
share-based incentive plans in which employees 
can only opt to buy shares in the company (warrants) are 
measured at the equity instruments’ fair value at the grant 
date and recognized in the income statement over the 
vesting period. the balancing item is recognized directly 
in equity. the fair value on the date of grant is determined 
using the black-scholes model. 
cash-based incentive programs in which employees can 
have the difference between the agreed exercise price and 
the actual share price settled in cash (phantom shares) are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognized 
in the income statement over the period when the final 
right of cash-settlement is obtained. granted rights are 
subsequently re-measured on each balance sheet date and 
upon final settlement, and any changes in the fair value of 
the programs are recognized in the income statement. the 
balancing item is recognized under other liabilities. 
the fair value of the cash-based incentive programs is 
determined using the black-scholes model.
restricted stock units are measured at fair value at grant 
date. based on the achieved cash bonus for members of 
the executive management, subject to the board of direc-
tors’ decision on the portion that should be converted to 
restricted stock units, the number of restricted stock units 
are calculated by dividing the allocated cash bonus amount 
by the share price of the company at grant date. as the 
cash bonus has already been accrued and expensed in the 
income statement, the grant of restricted stock units has no 
additional impact on the income statement. the accrued li-
ability for the converted cash bonus is reclassified to  equity.
 
matching shares are measured at the same fair value as 
the initial restricted stock units and expensed over the 
three year vesting period. the balancing item is recognized 
directly in equity. restricted stock units granted as sign-on 
bonus for members of the executive management and 
restricted stock units granted to the board of directors are 
expensed at grant date with the balancing item recognized 
directly in equity.
incentive plans
in order to motivate and retain key employees and en-
courage the achievement of common goals for employees, 
management and shareholders, the company has estab-
lished incentive plans by way of warrant programs and 
restricted stock units programs, the latter only for members 
of the executive management and board of directors. 
furthermore, the company has established three-year 
phantom share programs for all employees of the group.
warrants
the board of directors has been granting warrants to the 
company´s management and selected employees of the 
company and its subsidiaries.
the warrants are granted in accordance with the authoriza-
tions given to the board of directors by the shareholders. 
the board of directors has fixed the terms of and the size 
of the grants of warrants, taking into account authorizations 
from the shareholders, the group’s guidelines for incentive 
pay, an assessment of expectations of the recipient´s work 
efforts and contribution to the group´s growth, as well as 
the need to motivate and retain the recipient. grant takes 
place on the date of establishment of the program. exercise 
of warrants is by default subject to continuing employment 
with the group. the warrants granted are subject to the 
provisions of the danish public companies act regarding 
termination of employees prior to their exercise of warrants 
in the case of recipients who are subject to the act.

share-based payment – continued
the expected volatility for 2020 is based on the volatility 
for a peer group, whereas the volatility for prior years is  
based on the historic volatility of the company.
phantom shares granted in 2020 provided an expense 
of dkk 0.0 million, whereas the revaluation of previously 
granted phantom shares provided an income of dkk 0.3 
million, total net income of dkk 0.3 million (net expense 
2019: dkk 0.1 million).
the expected volatility is based on the historic volatility.
the 2017-2019 program expired in january 2020 without 
exercise as the actual share price was below the exercise 
price of dkk 260.20.
reversal of the phantom share program provided  
an income of dkk 0.0 million (net income 2019:  
dkk 0.1 million).
the liability is included in other liabilities, cf. note 23.
the 2018-2020 program will exercise in january 2021 if  
the average share price for the period december 30, 
2020 - january 14, 2021 will exceed the exercise price of 
dkk 239.70. otherwise the program will expire without 
exercise.

restricted stock units
in march 2020, the board of directors decided to postpone 
the payment of half of the achieved cash bonus for mem-
bers of the other executive management for 3 years, con-
verting the postponed bonus of dkk 2.1 million into 8,705 
unconditional restricted stock units using the share price of 
the company at grant date (dkk 240). the board of direc-
tors decided to grant additional restricted stock units free of 
charge on expiry of a 3 years period (so-called “matching 
shares”) upon the recipient still being employed in march 
2023. one matching share is granted for each two acquired 
restricted stock units. the maximum number of matching 
shares is 4,353. the initial granted restricted stock units and 
the potential matching shares total 13,058 shares. 
at the annual general meeting in june 2020, the board 
of directors were granted a total of 7,111 unconditional 
restricted stock units corresponding to 50% of the annual 
fixed fee of dkk 1.4 million (excl. committee fee). the 
restricted stock units will be delivered after 3 years in june 
2023. 
as sign-on bonus the new cmo was granted a total of 
8,651 unconditional restricted stock units in may 2020 
and 4,325 additional restricted stock units on expiry of a 3 
years period (“matching shares”) upon the cmo still being 
employed in may 2023.

in august/september 2020, the company bought back 
52,397 of its own shares to meet the obligation to deliver 
up to 33,145 shares to the members of the executive 
management and the board of directors in march/may/
june 2023. the purchase of own shares also captured 
the adjustment to previous granted restricted stock units 
following the rights issue, 19,252 shares. 
the grant of the initial restricted stock units to the executive 
management (8,705 shares) had no impact on the income 
statement for 2020, as the corresponding cash bonus (dkk 
2.1 million) was accrued in 2019, though the amount has 
been reclassified from “salary and wages” to “share-based 
payment” in the staff cost note (note 8). the obligation 
related to the matching shares amount to dkk 1.0 million 
measured at the same fair value as the initial restricted 
stock units (dkk 240). the obligation will be expensed 
over the three year vesting period. the sign-on bonus to 
the new cmo was expensed by dkk 1.3 million. during 
2020, dkk 4.6 million has been expensed and recognized 
as share-based payment for executive management (incl. 
grants of matching shares for prior years). the grant of 
restricted stock units to the board of directors (7,111 shares 
- dkk 1.4 million) were fully expensed at grant.

sales milestone to glaxosmithkline
the asset purchase agreement with glaxosmithkline 
regarding the acquisition of the product rights to rabipur/
rabavert and encepur includes a sales milestone of eur 25 
million. as per december 31, 2019 management does not 
judge the sales milestone to be probable and therefore the 
sales milestone has not been recognized as either part of 
the product rights (note 16) nor the deferred consideration 
for product rights (note 25).
license and collaboration agreement adaptvac
under the license and collaboration agreement with 
adaptvac the company has an obligation of payment of 
potential future development and sales milestones and 
tiered royalties.
license agreements national cancer institute
the group has license agreements with the national cancer 
institute (nci) and public health service (phs) in the u.s. 
for prostvac, cv301 and bn-brachyury, respectively. the 
agreements include contingent liabilities for the group 
to pay performance-based royalties, if and when certain 
milestone events are achieved. further, the agreements 
include potential contingent liabilities for the group to pay 
additional sublicensing royalties on the fair market value of 
consideration received, if and when the group grants such 
sublicenses.
company mortgage
the company has by letter of indemnity granted nordea a 
floating charge on unsecured claims arising from the sale 
of goods and services and stocks of raw materials, interme-
diate products and finished products, dkk 150 million (dkk 
150 million). the floating charge secures the operating 
credit line of dkk 20 million and the line for trading in 
financial instruments, dkk 50 million (dkk 50 million).
lawsuits

involved in any lawsuits or arbitration cases which could 
have a material impact on the group’s financial position or 
results of operations.

investment in subsidiaries 
in november 2019, the company established a compa-
ny in switzerland for the purpose of running the future 
commercial organisation for rabipur/rabavert, encepur 
and jynneos.
the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries mainly 
relates to bavarian nordic gmbh (dkk 137.2 million) and 
the net share of profit from this subsidiary amounts to dkk 
12.3 million.
accounting policies
investments in subsidiaries are recognized and 
measured under the equity method. this means that, in 
the balance sheet, investments are measured at the pro 
rata share of the subsidiaries’ equity plus or less unam-
ortized positive, or negative, goodwill and plus or less 
unrealized intra-group profits or losses.
subsidiaries with a negative equity value are measured 
at zero value, and any receivables from these subsidiaries 
are written down by the company’s share of such negative 
equity if it is deemed irrecoverable. if the negative equity 
exceeds the amount receivable, the remaining amount is 
recognized under provisions if the company has a legal 
or constructive obligation to cover the liabilities of the 
relevant subsidiary.
upon distribution of profit or loss, net revaluation of invest-
ments in subsidiaries is transferred to the net revaluation 
reserve according to the equity method under equity, if the 
net revaluation is positive. if the net revaluation is nega-
tive, it is recognized in retained earnings in equity.
goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost of the 
investments and the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired which have been measured at fair value at the 
date of acquisition. the amortization period for goodwill is 
usually five years.
investments in subsidiaries are written down to the lower 
of recoverable amount and carrying amount.
income from investments in subsidiaries’ contains pro rata 
share of subsidiaries profits or losses after elimination of 
unrealized intra-group profits and losses.
significant accounting estimates
as of december 31, 2020, bavarian nordic, inc. had 
a negative equity of dkk 414 million (dkk 442 million). 
following the discontinuation of the prospect study in 
september 2017, the parent company’s receivable from 
bavarian nordic, inc. was fully written-down as manage-
ment assessed that there would be no significant cash 
flows from sale in the coming years. management main-
tains this assessment as of december 31, 2020.

sales milestone to glaxosmithkline
the asset purchase agreement with glaxosmithkline 
regarding the acquisition of the product rights to rabipur/
rabavert and encepur includes a sales milestone of eur 
25 million. as per december 31, 2019 management does 
not judge the sales milestone to be probable and therefore 
the sales milestone has not been recognized as either part 
of the product rights nor the deferred consideration for 
product rights.

adaptvac the company has an obligation of payment of 
potential future development and sales milestones and

tax audit
in april 2018 the danish tax authority (“skattestyrelsen”) 
notified the company that skattestyrelsen was proposing 
an adjustment of the allocation of the prostvac devel-
opment costs between bavarian nordic a/s and its u.s. 
subsidiary, bavarian nordic, inc. for the income years 
2012-2016. during 2018 and 2019 the company has been 
in dialogue with skattestyrelsen regarding the proposal. 
on july 1, 2019, skattestyrelsen decided to withdraw 
the proposed adjustment. the transfer pricing tax audit 
for 2012-2016 has thereby been completed without any 
changes to taxable income.

auditor's reports
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements of bavarian nordic a/s for the financial year 
january 1 – december 31, 2020, which comprise the income statement, 
statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity and 
notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the 
group as well as the parent, and the statement of comprehensive 
income and the cash flow statement of the group. the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements of the danish financial statements act, and the parent 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with the danish 
financial statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the group’s financial position at december 31, 2020 and 
of the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year 
january 1 – december 31, 2020 in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements under the danish financial statements act.
to the shareholders of bavarian nordic a/s
further, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the parent’s financial position at december 31, 2020 and of 
the results of its operations for the financial year january 1 – december 
31, 2020 in accordance with the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit book comments issued to the 
finance, risk and audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards 
on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements 
are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial 
statements section of this auditor’s report. we are independent of the 
group in accordance with the international ethics standards board of 
accountants' code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) 
and the additional requirements applicable in denmark, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

key audit matter 
revenue under the barda contracts for jynneos
revenue recognized under the biomedical 
advanced research and development authority 
(barda) contracts with the u.s. government 
related to jynneos amounted to dkk 680 million 
in 2020 (dkk 539 million in 2019).
 
contracts with barda include multiple elements, 
and recognition of revenue is significant and 
requires subjective evaluations. management 
therefore exercises judgement in determining 
whether the group has fulfilled all of its perfor-
mance obligations. 
management’s assessment includes whether it is 
probable that future economic benefits from the 
sale of jynneos bulk drug substance will flow to 
the group, the benefits can be measured reliably, 
ownership of the goods and services is transferred 
to barda, and the group no longer retains man-
agerial responsibility for, or control of, the goods 
sold and services delivered to barda. 
refer to notes 2 and 3 in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
based on our risk assessment procedures  
on the group’s business process and internal 
controls for revenue under the barda contracts, 
we tested the appropriateness of the group’s 
revenue recognition. 
we read the barda contracts, discussed them 
with management and evaluated the related 
accounting treatment. during the audit, we tested 
whether the performance obligations for revenue 
recognized and measured under the barda 
contracts were met in 2020. 
we also evaluated the financial statements 
disclosures related to revenue.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided any 
prohibited non-audit services as referred to in article 5(1) of regulation 
(eu) no 537/2014.
after bavarian nordic a/s was listed on nasdaq omx copenhagen in 
1998, we were appointed auditors at the annual general meeting held 
on may 27, 1999 for the 1999 financial year. we have been reappointed 
annually at the annual general meeting for a total consecutive engage-
ment period of 22 years up to and including the 2020 financial year.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judge-
ment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements for the financial 
year january 1 – december 31, 2020. these matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
statement on the management commentary
management is responsible for the management commentary.
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements does not cover the management commentary, and 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements, our responsibility is to read the manage-
ment commentary and, in doing so, consider whether the management 
annual report 2020
142
commentary is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements or our knowledge ob-
tained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management 
commentary provides the information required under the danish 
financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the 
management commentary is in accordance with the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any material misstatement of the 
management commentary.
management's responsibilities for the consolidated  
financial statements and the parent financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional require-
ments of the danish financial statements act as well as the preparation 
of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with the danish financial statements act, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consol-
idated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent’s ability to continue as a going concern, for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and 
for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements 
unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the entity 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated  
financial statements and the parent financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guaran-
tee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements 
and these parent financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the con-
solidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
annual report 2020
143
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent’s internal control. 
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the group's and the parent’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our con-
clusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause 
the group and the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the con-
solidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, 
including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives  
a true and fair view.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit  
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies  
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde-
pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent finan-
cial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements of bavarian nordic a/s we performed 
procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of ba-
varian nordic a/s for the financial year january 1 - december 31, 2020 
with the file name bava-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material re-
spects, in compliance with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic format (esef regulation) 
which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual 
report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements. management is responsible for preparing an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility includes:
•  the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format.
•  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, including 
extensions to the esef taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to 
elements in the taxonomy, for financial information required to be 
tagged using judgement where necessary.
•  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the consolidat-
ed financial statements presented in human readable format.
•  for such internal control as management determines necessary to 
enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with 
the esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the 
annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with 
the esef regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and 
to issue a report that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and 
extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the 
requirements set out in the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or 
error. the procedures include:
•  testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format.
•  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging process 
and of internal control over the tagging process.
•  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the consolidated 
financial statements.
•  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl 
elements selected from the esef taxonomy and the creation of 
extension elements where no suitable element in the esef taxonomy 
has been identified.
•  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in 
the esef taxonomy.
•  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consolidated 
financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of bavarian nordic a/s for the financial 
year january 1 – december 31, 2020 with the file name bava-2020-12-
31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation.
