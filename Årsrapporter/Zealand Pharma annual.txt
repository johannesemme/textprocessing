overview
zealand pharma 
in short
every day we work to pursue our 
mission of transforming patients’ 
lives through peptide innovations 
and novel treatment solutions.
our ambition is to be a leading provider of innovative peptide 
therapeutics and novel treatment solutions to address the 
unmet medical needs of patients. we have a unique peptide 
research platform that we leverage to discover, develop and 
commercialize innovative treatments focusing on metabolic 
and gastrointestinal diseases, including rare disease areas. this 
platform has enabled us to develop a broad pipeline of both 
clinical and pre-clinical programs.
headquartered in copenhagen, we are a global company with 
locations in boston and marlborough, ma, and new york, ny. 
in 2020, we established our commercial organization in the 
u.s., where today we market the v-go® insulin delivery device. 
by 2025, we plan to have five products on the market and are 
working to make a number of our pipeline candidates available to 
patients, beginning with the dasiglucagon auto-injector and pre-
filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia this year, pending regulato-
ry approval by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda).

letter from the chairman
the start of  
a new era
2020 marked zealand pharma’s 
transformation from a small research 
and development-focused company 
to a fully integrated biopharmaceutical 
company.
7
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
letter from the chairman
when two visionary scientists founded the company 
in 1998, it was only a dream that zealand pharma 
would become an integrated biopharmaceutical 
company. today it is on the verge of its first poten-
tial independent product launch, has an established 
commercial presence in the us, a broad and medi-
cally meaningful clinical pipeline, several promising 
pre-clinical programs and a proven track record of 
developing approved medicines. thanks to a long-
term bold vision, exceptional global employees, 
agility in an ever-evolving field and an unwavering 
commitment to scientific discovery and patients, 
zealand pharma is well positioned for success in a 
new era.
strength of our people 
zealand pharma’s success is based on the collective 
contributions from our talented employees, past and 
present. their creativity, teamwork, perseverance, 
and ability to execute on our plans over the years 
have contributed to our success. this really came 
into focus in 2020, when we progressed against our 
goals despite challenges presented by the covid-19 
pandemic. i am proud of and impressed by our grow-
ing team of talented professionals, who have chosen 
to pursue their careers at zealand pharma. 
unique peptide platform
our competitive and distinguishing advantage is our 
unique peptide platform that allows us to design and 
engineer highly innovative peptide or peptide-like 
medicines. since its inception, zealand pharma has 
developed and commercialized two such medicines, 
and in 2021, we expect to potentially achieve the 
launch of dasiglucagon auto-injector and pre-filled 
syringe for severe hypoglycemia by zealand’s own 
commercial subsidiary in the us. we are determined 
to continue to build on our position of strength.
the courage to invest
courage, boldness, and confidence are other influen-
tial elements that have transformed zealand pharma 
into what it is today. in 2015, we made the bold de-
cision to rely less on partnerships so we could more 
independently control our assets — and thereby our 
future. we have demonstrated the courage to invest 
significantly in our people and the r&d pipeline, as 
well as our commercial capabilities in the us by ac-
quiring valeritas. 
the journey continues
while it has been a remarkable journey for zealand 
pharma so far, our success is also built on a drive 
for continual advancement. we feel an obligation to 
always do more and create more value for patients, 
shareholders, and society. we have significant poten-
tial, and we will continue to invest in developing new 
medicines, expanding our research and development 
efforts into new disease areas, and making our prod-
ucts available to as many patients as possible. 
on behalf of the board of directors, i thank our 
shareholders for your belief and support. i also thank 
the ceo, emmanuel dulac, the management team 
and the rest of the organization for their fantastic 
contributions and achievements in 2020. i look for-
ward to our continued collaboration to grow zealand 
pharma even further.

letter from the ceo
ready to execute 
on our potential 
first independent 
launch and pursue 
our 2025 ambition
zealand pharma demonstrated the resilience, 
energy, and innovative thinking that makes our 
company unique as we faced the unprecedented 
challenges presented by the global pandemic in 
2020. thanks to our employees’ dedication, we 
kept our company, labs, and trials running, and also 
started our transformation into a fully integrated 
biopharmaceutical company with a commercial 
presence in the us. we are now set up for our 
potential first independent product launch in the 
first half of 2021.

zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
letter from the ceo
it is with a great sense of pride that we at zealand 
pharma reflect on 2020. like so many other com-
panies across the globe, we encountered numerous 
challenges due to the covid-19 pandemic. yet, we 
worked to overcome them and pursue our strategic 
objectives to transform into a fully integrated bio-
pharmaceutical company. today we are in a strong 
position as we approach the historical milestone of 
independently launching our first product with the 
anticipated launch of the dasiglucagon auto-injector 
and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia in the 
us in the first half of 2021 (pending approval). 
this launch will also be an important step towards 
achieving our 2025 vision. in the coming four years, 
we aim to build on all of our earlier accomplishments 
and leverage our platform and investments to expand 
our leadership in peptides, conduct research and 
development in new indications, and launch several 
products as we build a high-performing commercial 
organization. 
addressing covid-19
the pandemic and the associated pressure on health 
care systems, shutdowns, and restrictive health care 
measures presented challenges to all facets of our 
business. from the outset, our priority has been to 
keep our employees, patients, business, and clinical 
partners safe, while also supporting our communi-
ties’ efforts to reduce the transmission of covid-19. 
we quickly adapted to a much more virtual way of 
working and managed to keep our company, labs, 
and trials running.
we took measures to secure our discovery activities, 
minimizing the impact of covid-19 on our research 
activities. employees who could work from home 
did so, while team members in laboratory facilities 
worked in shifts to reduce the number of people 
gathered at one time. we continued our clinical trials 
while working with authorities, investigators, trial 
sites, and contract research organizations to mini-
mize site visits and ensure optimal trial follow-ups. 
we minimized business travel and relied on digital 
technologies to meet virtually rather than in person. 
virtual meetings, trainings, and support also trans-
formed our engagement with health care providers 
and patients, with whom we met less in person.
progressing our clinical programs
despite the circumstances of 2020, we accomplished 
a lot, thanks to the resilience, energy, and innovative 
thinking from our dedicated employees. for the first 
time ever, we independently submitted a us food 
and drug administration (fda) new drug applica-
tion (nda) — for the dasiglucagon auto-injector and 
pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia — which 
the fda accepted in may. we are hopeful and excited 
that, if approved, the dasiglucagon auto-injector and 
pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia can be-
come an important option for people with diabetes 
and their caregivers to treat severe hypoglycemia. 
pending approval, the dasiglucagon auto-injector 
and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia is 
expected to become the first dasiglucagon–based 
medicine made available to patients. we are also 
developing dasiglucagon in congenital hyperinsu-
linism, a devastating ultra-rare disease, and we were 
able to carry through the first phase 3-trial in 2020, 
with the next trial expected to read out this year. for 
the bi-hormonal artificial pancreas pump, which also 
uses dasiglucagon, we plan to initiate the pivotal 
phase 3-trial in 2021.
on behalf of the 
management team, and all 
my other zealand pharma 
colleagues, i extend my 
thanks to our partners and 
patients for trusting us. we 
are committed to fulfilling 
the significant potential 
of zealand pharma and 
realizing our mission to 
transform patients’ lives 
through peptide innovations 
and novel treatment options.
emmanuel dulac
president and chief executive officer
our partner, boehringer ingelheim (bi), progressed 
the clinical development of bi-456909 with the initi-
ation of a phase 2-trial in type 2 diabetes and obesity, 
and plans to also pursue development in non-alco-
holic steatohepatitis (nash).
we also made progress in the clinical development 
of our gastrointestinal programs. though the pan-
10
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
demic impacted patient recruitment for our phase 3 
trial with glepaglutide in short bowel syndrome (sbs), 
we kept the trial running. we also completed the first 
phase 1 trial with dapiglutide, a potential next gener-
ation of sbs treatment, and initiated another phase 1 
trial to move the program forward.
expanding and advancing our early pipeline
in addition to our many clinical development pro-
grams, zealand pharma also has a broad pre-clinical 
pipeline that gives us opportunities to grow our drug 
portfolio candidates by expanding into new indica-
tions.
we made strong progress in our early pipeline dur-
ing 2020. we regained the worldwide rights to the      
amylin-analog program from bi, and we expect to 
start clinical development for this program in 2021.
in our gip-program, which has potential for devel-
opment in multiple major diseases and compris-
es mono-, dual-, and triple-agonists, we selected 
the lead molecule and progressed towards clinical 
development. we also progressed our alpha4be-
ta7-program, which has the potential to provide our  
first-ever oral peptide therapeutic. we are excited by 
this prospect, as oral delivery could potentially ease 
the use of peptide treatments for patients. it could 
also make administering peptides easier and possibly 
improve treatment and compliance.  
transforming to a fully integrated 
biopharmaceutical company
while successfully driving our research and devel-
opment activities, we also managed to complete our 
strategic objective of building our own commercial 
platform in the us, thus transforming zealand phar-
ma into a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical 
company. we integrated staff and assets from valer-
itas, growing our total number of employees world-
wide by approximately 50%, and gaining the v-go® 
wearable insulin device. through v-go®, which is al-
ready on the market, zealand has expanded its team 
with a seasoned salesforce, laying the groundwork 
for the potential launch of the dasiglucagon auto-in-
jector and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia.
securing a strong financial position
with so many activities and achievements, we have 
maintained a high level of investments across our 
company. this is made possible by our strong financial 
position, enhanced through a record-breaking capital 
raise in zealand’s history in june, raising dkk 658m. 
this means we can continue to allocate adequate             
resources, to ensure we achieve the highest value of 
our assets.
growing as a leader in peptide therapeutics
while 2020 was a successful year of transformation 
for zealand pharma, we are focused and continue the 
work needed to prepare to progress several products 
as we build a high performing commercial organiza-
tion.
2021 will be a year of execution as we 
set out to achieve our 2025 ambition 
to expand our leadership in peptides, 
conduct research and development in 
new indications. 
five years ago, we were solely a research & 
development- company with an early stage-pipeline. 
today, we have our own commercial presence in the 
us, we have filed our first own marketing applica-
tion, are ready for our first ever independent product 
launch and have a broad late-stage pipeline. this year 
may be the end of the beginning for zealand pharma 
as we enter yet another transformational year for the 
company. 
on behalf of the management team, and all my other 
zealand pharma colleagues, i extend my thanks to 
our partners and patients for trusting us. we are 
committed to fulfilling the significant potential of 
zealand pharma and realizing our mission to trans-
form patients’ lives through peptide innovations and 
novel treatment options.

first independent 
launch
with an established us platform 
and commercial presence, we are 
ready to introduce the dasiglucagon 
auto-injector and pre-filled 
syringe for severe hypoglycemia to

zealand pharma’s first independent launch
established us 
organization
in line with our strategy of 
independently commercializing 
our medicines, zealand pharma has 
established its own fully-fledged 
commercial operation in the us, 
preparing us not only for the 
dasiglucagon launch but for  
the additional launches expected  
by 2025.
in 2020, zealand pharma transformed from a primar-
ily r&d-focused company to a fully integrated bio-
tech company with an established footprint in the us 
diabetes market. the establishment of our us com-
mercial platform is a pivotal element in our strategy, 
and this transformation will allow us to independently 
launch and market the medicines we develop on the 
world’s biggest pharmaceutical market. 
accelerating commercial build-up
in april of 2020, we closed on a transaction with us-
based valeritas holdings, inc., in which we acquired 
all of the company’s assets including the marketed 
v-go® wearable insulin delivery device, providing us 
with a commercial infrastructure and accelerating 
our plans for build-up in the us. as part of the trans-
action, we gained an existing commercial organi-
zation and 110 employees, including approximately 
75 sales representatives, all supporting systems, 
processes, and the majority of established contracts, 
us-based
in marlborough,  
massachusetts
110 employees
including approximately  
75 sales representatives
v-go®
one marketed product – a 
wearable insulin delivery device
acquired us activities in brief
as well as an operations site in marlborough, massa-
chusetts. 
in parallel with the acquisition, we achieved an-
other historical milestone with the filing of our 
first ever new drug application (nda) with the us 
food and drug administration for the dasiglucagon                
auto-injector and pre-filled syringe for severe hypo-
glycemia. pending approval, the dasiglucagon au-
to-injector and pre-filled syringe for severe hypogly-
cemia will be the first product ever we launch on our 
own, leveraging our us commercial platform.
by acquiring the already marketed v-go® wearable 
insulin delivery device, we immediately became a 
commercially active company in the us, interacting 
with key stakeholders in the diabetes space, including 
patients, physicians and payors. many of the these 
stakeholders will also be essential for the successful 
launch of the dasiglucagon auto-injector and pre-

filled syringe. on top of its strategic value, v-go® 
generates revenue that helps finance our significant 
investments across commercial and research & de-
velopment activities.
successful integration
due to the pandemic, the undertaking of integrating 
our new colleagues and assets into zealand phar-
ma was done virtually with a very limited number of 
physical meetings. we are proud to have risen to the 
challenge and navigated this already complex task, 
successfully completing the integration – increasing 
the total number of employees by close to 50% – 
according to plans and deadlines. 
we also strengthened the us leadership team with 
the appointment of frank sanders as president of 
zealand pharma us. having more than 25 years of 
experience within commercial operations, frank 
joined from a position as general manager of the 
us commercial team at sage therapeutics and is a 
member of zealand pharma’s global corporate man-
agement team. 
we further expanded our operations in the us in july 
of 2020 by opening a new office in boston, where 
commercial operations are headquartered.
v-go® wearable insulin delivery device
designed to deliver insulin like the body does—gradually, during the day 
and night—and replace both long-acting basal insulin and multiple meal-
time insulin injections, v-go delivers a continuous basal insulin rate over 
24 hours that mimics the body’s natural approach to all-day-and-night 
blood sugar control. with a continuous, preset rate of fast-acting insulin 
along with convenient, on-demand dosing at mealtimes (bolus dosing). 
v-go is designed to meet insulin needs throughout the day. studies have 
shown that v-go provides better control of blood sugar levels than multi-
ple daily insulin injections.¹

june of 2021, following our pdufa date of march 27, 
2021.
with v-go®  already on the market, we will be able to 
hit the ground running with the dasiglucagon launch. 
our sales representatives currently interact with 
potential dasiglucagon prescribers including endo-
crinologists and diabetologists, covering the most 
densely populated areas of the us. 
underdeveloped market
dasiglucagon will address a us market where hy-
poglycemia is the most common cause for emer-
gency room (er) visits for adults with diabetes, with 
235,000 er visits/year, of which 57,000 resulted in 
hospitalizations1. our highly experienced team of 
sales, medical affairs, and market access profes-
sionals have a strong and active presence with us 
medical opinion leaders, endocrinologists and diabe-
tologists, and major national and regional payors and 
pharmacy benefit managers. foundational marketing, 
patient support, and commercial operations infra-

severe hypoglycemia is an underdeveloped market. 
while approximately 675,000 glucagon prescriptions 
were filled in 2020, there are more than 8.2 million 
adults on insulin therapy in the us.
the significant growth potential is already starting 
to materialize, supported by introductions of new

the anticipated launch of dasiglucagon auto-injector 
and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia in the 
us is potentially just the first of a number of launches 
of new medicines from zealand pharma in the coming 
years. our goal is to have five commercialized products 
in the us by 2025.
dasiglucagon for severe hypoglycemia is the first 
product in our franchise built on the dasiglucagon 
molecule. the next potential launch is a continuous 
infusion for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulin-
ism (chi), a rare disease with often devastating conse-
quences for patients and their families. we expect our 
second phase 3 trial to readout in 2021. 
we are also planning to start a phase 3 trial with 
dasiglucagon used in a fully automated bi-hormonal 
pump, in collaboration with beta bionics. this "bionic" 
pancreas has been shown in phase 2 studies to achieve 
more stable levels of blood glucose levels, while 
reducing hypoglycemia. if successful, this opportunity 
constitutes another potential launch of dasiglucagon in 
the coming years.
in the gastrointestinal field we have the potential to 
launch a new treatment for patients with short bowel 
syndrome (sbs). glepaglutide, a long-acting glp-2 
analog, is being developed in an auto-injector with 
potential for convenient weekly administration. it is 
currently in phase 3 and has been granted orphan drug 
designation by the us fda.
we are excited about the our first independent launch 
of dasiglucagon for severe hypoglycemia and the 
prospect of having multiple additional potential new 
product launches in the metabolic and gastrointestinal 
disease areas over the next 5 years.

and increased stability to provide 
innovative and better treatments for 
a range of different diseases.
since our founding in 1998, zealand pharma’s sole 
focus has been on the discovery and development 
of peptide-based medicines to harness the power 
of native peptides and enhancing their effects. we 
have a unique peptide platform and design pro-

peptide platform and pre-clinical programs
vital to human health
peptides are produced by all living organisms and 
humans have peptides in every cell and tissue. they 
can function as biological messengers (hormones) 
carrying information between cells or organs and 
thereby perform a wide range of essential functions, 
e.g., regulating appetite and blood glucose and 
stimulating tissue growth. this makes peptides vital to 
keeping us functioning and healthy.
native peptides are composed of amino acids (fifty 
or less) in a linear or cyclic form, have powerful           
biological functions but are inherently unstable and 
short-lived in the bloodstream. to convert these 
native peptides into effective peptide therapeutics 
requires the instability and thus duration of action 
to be corrected while maintaining or enhancing the 
biological activity. this requires modifications to the 
amino acid sequence of the peptide, generally using 
substitution with another amino acid.
nature’s own inventions
zealand pharma uses its unique in-depth understand-
ing of peptide chemistry and biology to focus the 
substitution process on key amino acids to remove 
the weak points that result in poor solubility, stability 
or activity, and thus create new drug candidates. we 
have successfully applied this approach to glucagon, 
amylin, glp-1, glp-2 and gip. enhancing their natural 
properties or combining their activities in single pep-
tides present multiple therapeutic opportunities.

23 years of 
experience
where zealand pharma’s sole focus 
has been on the discovery and 
development of peptide-based 
medicines
we base our research and development on endog-
enous peptides found in humans and peptides from 
venoms from various animals. we also manipulate 
bacteria to produce peptide libraries. in other words, 
we make broad use of nature’s own inventions to 
improve human health and quality of life.
in line with zealand’s strategy to access cutting-edge 
technology, we have a range of research collabo-
rations providing us with access to novel peptide 
libraries or new technologies for peptide stabilization 
and delivery.
because of their unique features – specificity, phys-
ical size and attractive risk profile – peptide-based 
medicines may allow us to in the future treat diseases 
that we can’t treat today. furthermore, they may ena-
ble us to treat more patients, initiate treatment earlier 
and ensure better treatment compliance, all of which 
could improve health outcomes.

pre-clinical 
programs
new technologies and scientific 
advancements within peptides 
enable zealand pharma to 
continuously optimize our 
peptide platform. our research 
and development capabilities 
and current pre-clinical programs 
provide opportunities to grow our 
scientific and medical presence by 
expanding into new indications like 
obesity and inflammatory diseases. 
our pre-clinical pipeline contains 
programs focused on analogs of 
endogenous peptide hormones, as 
well as programs with innovative 
peptide candidates acting on 
components of the complement 
cascade, ion channels and other 
target classes.
long-acting amylin analog
amylin is derived from b-cells in the pancreas 
and is co-secreted with insulin. it both regu-
lates blood glucose by delaying gastric empty-
ing after meal ingestion and directly mod-
ulates satiety signals in the brain. preclinical 
studies also suggest that amylin, like glucagon, 
can increase energy expenditure, contributing 
to its weight loss effect.
our lead molecule, zp8396, is a long-acting 
analog of amylin designed to allow for co-for-
mulation with other anti-obesity treatments. 
it has demonstrated significant weight loss in 
pre-clinical models of obesity.
we plan on initiating phase 1 clinical testing 
in 2021.
long-acting gip analogs
glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide 
(gip) is synthesized by k cells, which are found 
in the proximal intestine. gip receptors are 
expressed in many organs and tissues includ-
ing the central nervous system, enabling gip 
to influence regulation of appetite and satiety, 
while showing antiemetic effects. thus, gip 
can contribute to the efficacy of other an-
ti-obesity peptides by both a complementary 
effect and by providing an improved thera-
peutic window of the other peptide.
our lead molecule, zp6590, has shown addi-
tive effects when co-administered with a glp-
1ra in pre-clinical obese models. we expect 
to bring the analog to phase 1 in 2022.

programs focusing  
on obesity
the global prevalence of obesity has tripled 
since the mid-1970s with 650 million adults and 
124 million children and adolescents suffering 
from obesity. in the us alone, more than 40% of 
the population are considered obese1. we hope 
to address the obesety pandemic with peptide 
molecules with built-in dual-acting pharmacology 
or molecules with mono pharmacology that can 
be combined or co-formulated with other anti-
obesity treatments

zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
pre-clinical programs
integrin α4β7 inhibitor
zp10000 is being developed as an orally 
delivered peptide drug to target integrin α4β7, 
which is involved in the pathogenesis of in-
flammatory bowel disease (ibd). specific bind-
ing to surface α4β7 on the t cells prevents the 
interaction with madcam-1 on the endothelial 
cells, which plays a critical role in immune cell 
recruitment to the intestinal tissue. this mode 
of action has been clinically validated in ibd 
by vedolizumab, an approved injection-only 
α4β7 integrin inhibitor antibody. zp10000 is a 
peptide ligand that selectively binds to α4β7, 
and its efficacy has been demonstrated in vivo 
in ibd models. zp10000 has binding proper-
ties on par with marketed antibodies as well 
as oral bioavailability as demonstrated in vivo. 
we are currently exploring the optimal oral 
formulation for this compound while we pro-
gress the program towards clinical testing. 
kv1.3 ion channel blockers
kv1.3 is a potassium conducting ion channel, 
which is selectively upregulated on t effector 
memory cells. t effector memory cells play 
a key role in autoimmunity and chronic 
inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, which drives tissue damage. the 
anti-inflammatory effects of blocking the 
kv1.3 ion channel have been demonstrated in 
multiple pre-clinical models of autoimmune 
diseases. the specific and selective location 
of the kv1.3 on the effector memory t cells 
makes it an attractive pharmaceutical target, 
as blocking preserves the protective effects 
of the rest of the immune system. zp9830 
is a potent and selective kv1.3 blocker with 
potential to treat a broad range of t cell 
driven autoimmune diseases. currently we are 
progressing the molecule into ind enabling 
toxicity studies and aim to target inflammatory 
bowel diseases as a first indication, with the 
expectation to initiate phase 1 in 2022.
complement c3 inhibitor
the complement system is a part of the innate 
immune system and a central component of 
the complement cascade is the c3 protein. 
altered activation of the complement cascade 
is implicated in many immune-mediated 
diseases and in particular rare diseases such 
as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, cold 
agglutinin disease, myasthenia gravis and c3 
glomerulopathy. there is currently only one 
approved drug to treat complement mediated 
diseases: an antibody that blocks the comple-
ment cascade c5, the final step in comple-
ment activation. we have selected a candidate 
molecule that acts on c3, upstream of c5 
and thus offering potential differentiation and 
broader utility than the current therapy. the 
candidate peptide is potent, selective, and 
long-acting and has the potential to be best-
in-class, which we are currently progressing 
into the next stage of development in collabo-
ration with alexion. 
programs focusing  
on chronic inflammatory diseases
peptide medicines have proven their effectiveness in other therapeutic 
areas such as type 2 diabetes and obesity and we believe that they 
represent a great opportunity for new innovation in the chronic 
inflammatory diseases area. the programs we are progressing represent 
high-profile peptide targets that have shown to be difficult to address with 
small molecules and antibodies or orally available peptides against disease 
targets that have already been clinically proven with injectable antibodies.

diabetes
severe hypoglycemia is an acute, 
life-threatening condition resulting 
from a critical drop in blood glucose 
levels. unpredictable and among the 
most feared complications of diabetes 
treatment1, severe hypoglycemia 
requires another person for rescue2.
~8 million people
with diabetes are on insulin therapy in the us³
~235,000 emergency 
room visits
occur annualy in the us due to severe hypoglycemia³
dasiglucagon auto-injector and pre-filled syringe
the dasiglucagon auto-injector is a ready-to-use auto-injec-
tor containing 0.6 mg dasiglucagon, designed to offer people 
with diabetes fast, effective and reliable treatment for severe 
hypoglycemia.  
2020 achievements
in march 2020, zealand pharma submitted the new drug 
application (nda) for the dasiglucagon auto-injector and pre-
filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia to the us food and drug 
administration (fda), which accepted the submission for review 
in may 2020. 
the nda is based on the clinical program which was conclud-
ed in 2019. in the pivotal and confirmatory phase 3 trials, the 
primary and all key secondary endpoints were successfully 
achieved with a median time to blood glucose recovery of 10 
minutes. results from a pediatric phase 3 trial demonstrated 
that the median time to blood glucose recovery was also 10 
minutes in this patient population.
 
next steps
under the prescription drug user fee act (pdufa), the fda has 
set a target action date of march 27, 2021. pending approval, 
zealand pharma expects to launch dasiglucagon auto-injector 
and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia later in 2021. 
this will be our first independent product launch.

severe hypoglycemia in diabetes
robert floyd
robert was diagnosed with type 2 
diabetes about 12 years ago. every-
day he has to deal with the chal-
lenges of the disease. when robert 
was diagnosed and started taking 
insulin, the company he worked for 
had complaints about him checking 
his blood sugar and doing insulin 
shots. there are still things robert 
can’t do anymore because of his 
diabetes, things he used to do all the 
time. 
as part of living with type 2 diabe-
tes, robert has also experienced 
hypoglycemia multiple times. mild 
hypoglycemia is blood glucose less 
than 70 mg/dl, moderate hypogly-
cemia is blood glucose less than 54 
mg/dl, and severe hypoglycemia is 
defined as having low blood glucose 
levels that requires assistance from 
another person to treat.

congenital 
hyperinsulinism
congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) 
is an ultra-rare and devastating 
congenital disorder in newborns. 
it is caused by a defect in 
pancreatic beta cells, resulting 
in insulin overproduction. 
this leads to persistently and 
dangerously low blood sugar 
levels (hypoglycemia).

1/25,000-1/50,000
is the ratio of births in which chi occurs in most 
countries. it is the most frequent cause of severe, 
persistent hypoglycemia in newborn babies and 
children¹.
next steps
a second phase 3 trial with 12 children with chi from 7 days up 
to one year of age is ongoing, with topline results expected in 
2021.
2020 achievements
the first phase 3 trial with 32 children with chi aged 3 months 
to 12 years completed enrollment in august, with topline 
results announced in december. the trial showed that dasi-
glucagon, on top of standard of care (soc), did not significantly 
reduce the rate of hypoglycemia compared to soc alone 
when assessed by intermittent self-measured plasma glucose 
(primary endpoint). however, hypoglycemia was reduced by 
40–50% with dasiglucagon as compared to soc alone when 
assessed by blinded continuous glucose monitoring (explora-
tory analysis).
dasiglucagon treatment was assessed to be safe and well tol-
erated in the study, and 31 out of 32 patients chose to continue 
into the long-term extension study.
substantial burden of disease²
• high resistance to existing medical treatment
• high risk of seizures and permanent brain injury 
• most severe cases require pancreatic surgery
• prolonged hospitalization and intolerable burden 
to patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare 
systems 
dasiglucagon subcutaneous continuous infusion
dasiglucagon is a potential first-in-class glucagon analog for the treatment of children with chi.
the potential of chronic dasiglucagon infusion delivered via a pump to prevent hypoglycemia in children with chi is being evaluated 
in a phase 3 program. the aim is to reduce or eliminate the need for intensive hospital treatment, reduce the frequency of severe 
hypo glycemia and need for constant feeding, and to potentially delay or eliminate the need for pancreatectomy. the us food and 
drug administration and the european commission both granted orphan drug designation to dasiglucagon for the treatment of chi.

type 1 diabetes 
management
in spite of newer insulins and 
better administration systems, 
the vast majority of people with 
type 1 diabetes are unable to reach 
glycemic goals as defined by the 
american diabetes association.¹
maintaining good control of blood glucose levels for 
a person with type 1 diabetes requires continuous in-
tervention with insulin. the amount of insulin admin-
istered is subject to continuous adaptation dictated 
by the individual’s blood glucose levels, food intake, 
activities such as exercise, sickness, prior insulin 
injections, etc. 
when too much insulin is injected, dangerously low 
blood glucose levels can develop and rapid intake of 
sugar-rich food is needed to prevent development of 
severe hypoglycemia. conversely, injecting too little 
insulin will lead to dangerously high blood glucose, 
which is also associated with significant acute and 
chronic complications.
despite progress with faster acting modern insu-
lins and novel insulin pumps connected to glucose 
sensors, current therapies require considerable effort 
by people with diabetes and their caregivers. as such, 
type 1 diabetes remains one of the most burdensome 
diseases to manage. 
2020 achievements
beta bionics initiated the pivotal insulin-only ilet trial in people 
with type 1 diabetes. late in the year we had the end-of-
phase 2 meeting with the fda to agree on the scope of the         
bi-homonal ilet.
next steps
together with beta bionics we expect to initiate the pivotal 
bi-hormonal phase 3-trial with dasiglucagon in 2021.

dasiglucagon for bi-hormonal artificial pancreas pump systems
zealand is developing a 1 ml cartridge containing 4 mg/ml dasiglucagon, intended for use in bi-hormonal artificial pancreas pumps.
we are collaborating with beta bionics, developer of the ilet™, a pocket-sized, dual-chamber, autonomous, glycemic control 
system. the ilet mimics a biological pancreas by calculating and dosing insulin and/or glucagon (dasiglucagon) as needed, based 
on data from the diabetic person’s continuous glucose monitor. the ilet is the world’s first autonomous bionic pancreas device — a 
bi-hormonal system leveraging lifelong machine learning and artificial intelligence to deliver insulin and glucagon analogs for the 
autonomous treatment of type 1 diabetes.
top-line results from a phase 2-trial in patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated that the bi-hormonal ilet using dasiglucagon 
provided superior glycemic control over the insulin-only ilet. during the bi-hormonal period, 90% of participants had a mean cgm 
glucose level of < 154 mg/dl, corresponding to the glycemic target recommended by the ada. the corresponding number for the 
insulin-only system was 50%. importantly these glycemic targets were achieved while time spent with blood glucose levels < 54 mg/
dl was only 0.3% in the bihormonal and 0.6% in the insulin-only arm.²

other 
hypoglycemic 
conditions
people with type 1 diabetes often 
experience hypoglycemia after 
exercise and people who have 
undergone bariatric surgery as a 
treatment for obesity, experience 
reactive hypoglycemia after  
eating a meal. today there are  
no approved treatment options  
for these conditions.
next steps
initiation of a phase 2 outpatient study  in people with type 1 
diabetes and in people with post-bariatric hypoglycemia in 
2021. the studies will utilize a durable mini-dose pen, being 
developed by zealand pharma.
2020 achievements
we reported positive results in from a phase 2 trial in with 
dasiglucagon in pbh in march 2020. the results demonstrated 
a single mini-dose injection of dasiglucagon in post bariatric 
hypoglycemic patients significantly reduced meal-induced 
hypoglycemia compared to placebo in individuals who have 
undergone gastric bypass bariatric surgery.
we also initiated a phase 2 low-dose dasiglucagon trial for the 
prevention of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes 
in 2020.
dasiglucagon mini doses
mini-dose dasiglucagon may provide an attractive treatment 
solution for people who experience hypoglycemic events such 
as type 1 diabetics or those who experience post bariatric 
hypoglycemia.

² riddel mc et al. lancet diabetes endocrinol. 2017;5(5):377-390.
post-bariatric hypoglycemia
post-bariatric hypoglycemia can be severe and disabling. the 
prevalence is believed to be between 5-15% of people who un-
dergo bariatric surgery¹. there are no approved treatments for 
these people and as such there is a large unmet medical need.
exercise-induced hypoglycemia
many people with type 1 diabetes experience episodes of 
hypoglycemia during or after physical activity. this can result in 
improper diabetes management, with many people not getting 
to their recommended long-term glycemic targets². we believe 
their is a high unmet medical need for novel treatment oppor-
tunities in this setting.

other hypoglycemic conditions
next steps
two additional phase 2-trials — one in obesity, one in nash — 
are planned for initiation in 2021. the first phase 2 trial in type 2 
diabetes is expected to complete this year.
2020 achievements
a phase 2 trial in 410 patients with type 2 diabetes was initiated 
in 2020, based on the safety, tolerability, and favorable weight 
loss potential in individuals with a bmi up to 40 kg/m² observed 
in phase 1. this triggered a eur 20 million milestone payment 
to zealand pharma.
long-acting glp-1/glu dual agonist (bi 456906)
the glp-1/glucagon dual agonist activates two key hormone receptors simultaneously and may offer better blood sugar and 
weight-loss control than current single-hormone receptor agonist treatments. the lead molecule, bi 456906, is targeting treatment 
of obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash). 
clinical development is carried out by boehringer ingelheim with whom zealand pharma has a long and productive partnership. 
boehringer ingelheim has a track record of excellence in research and development in cardiometabolic diseases which has resulted 
in important breakthroughs in recent years, especially in thromboembolic diseases and type 2 diabetes.
under the terms of the agreement, boehringer ingelheim funds all research, development and commercialization activities. zealand 
pharma is entitled to receive up to eur 345 million in outstanding milestone payments. the agreement also carries high-single digit 
to low-double digit percentage royalties on global sales.
obesity / 
type 2 diabetes
excessive weight and obesity are 
among the leading risk factors for 
heart disease, ischemic stroke, liver 
diseases and type 2 diabetes as well 
as for a number of cancers.
there are insufficient therapeutic options available, 
resulting in a high unmet medical need for safe and 
effective treatments that achieve significant weight loss.

obesity / type 2 diabetes
short bowel 
syndrome
patients with short bowel 
syndrome (sbs) have undergone 
massive intestinal surgery 
resulting in significantly reduced 
or complete loss of intestinal 
function.
underlying causes for sbs include inflammatory 
bowel syndrome, intestinal infarction, radiation dam-
age or trauma, and recurrent intestinal obstruction 
or congenital disorders.¹,²,³ sbs affects an estimated 
20,000-40,000 people in the us and europe.⁴
sbs patients cannot absorb adequate fluids and nutri-
tion taken orally, and those most severely affected 
become dependent on home parenteral support to 
survive. home parenteral support is delivered through 
daily infusion of intravenous fluids and nutrition via a 
central venous catheter.¹,² long-term use of paren-
teral support carries a risk of catheter-related blood 
stream infections, blood clots, and organ impairment 
including liver and kidney damage.² patients are 
required to connect to the infusion lines and pumps 
for up to 16 hours every day, which can pose signifi-
cant restrictions on ability to engage in normal daily 
activities.⁵ 
limitations of current treatments
management of sbs is a complex multidisciplinary 
task with a focus on optimizing the patient’s hydra-
tion and nutritional status. it includes striking the right 
balance between parenteral support and oral intake 
of fluids and nutrition. treatment with glp-2 analogs 
has demonstrated an increase in the absorptive ca-
pacity of the remaining intestine, thereby making the 
patients less dependent on parenteral support with 
some gaining full enteral autonomy. 
despite the clear benefits of reducing the depend-
ency on parenteral support, people treated with the 
only currently available short-acting glp-2 therapy 
have shown high levels of treatment discontinua-
tion,¹,² emphasizing the need for more effective, less 
complex and better tolerated treatments tailored to 
the needs of sbs patients.
2020 achievements
worked diligently to support the patients and investigators 
in the pivotal phase 3 trial to accommodate the constraints 
imposed by covid-19. while recruitment into the trial was 
impaired in 2020 we have started to see patient enrolment 
increasing towards pre-covid levels after the introduction of 
vaccinations.
next steps
we continue to work closely with investigators on recruiting 
participants and progressing the phase 3 trial.
pending a continued positive development in enrolment we 
expect the results of the trial in 2022.

mike
mike was born with an abnormal 
cluster of veins in his small bow-
el. when that cluster had ruptured, 
mike progressed through a series of 
surgeries that resulted in removing 
approximately seven meters of his 
intestine. mike had now become a 
patient with short bowel syndrome. 
the remaining eight centimeters of his 
intestine were not capable of absorbing 
the nutrition and fluids mike needed to 
live, so he also became dependent on 
parenteral support to survive. reducing 
the complexity – and time spent – for 
parenteral support enables this driven 
college football coach to get back in 
the game.

board and ceo positions and identifies and recom-
mend candidates for the board of directors.
specific topics discussed in 2020 included the com-
position of the independent members of the board 
of directors. one potential candidate was considered  
but no formal vote was taken with respect to the 
nomination of new members. 
the nomination committee met after each board 
meeting in 2020.
evaluation of the board of directors
in 2020 an independent vendor, pwc, evaluat-
ed the board of directors. 
the process included electronic ques-
tionnaires and one on one interviews with 
members of the board and members of the 
corporate management. there were also one 
on one meetings between the chairman and 
each board member.
in general, there was a good level of satis-
faction reported with the operation of the 
board and its interaction with members of the 
corporate management. the evaluation, in 
general, revealed a good performance by the 
board of directors as well as good collabora-
tion between the board of directors and the 
corporate management.
compliance with the corporate  
governance recommendations
zealand complies with the recommenda-
tions on corporate governance issued by the 
danish committee on corporate governance, 
november 23, 2017, with one exception:
3.4 board committees (recommendation, 
section 3.4.8): the remuneration and com-
pensation committee will be using the same 
external advisers as the executive manage-
ment. the board considers that the external 
advisers will provide professional and unbiased 
advice in both capacities: as advisers to the 
executive management and to the remunera-
tion committee.

responsibility
as we work toward realizing our 
ambition of becoming a fully 
integrated biopharmaceutical 
company, to improve care for 
patients and deliver value for our 
shareholders, we further recognize 
the importance of protecting the 
world around us. we believe in 
operating as a responsible company 
that serves broader economic, 
societal, and environmental interests.
we have incorporated selected un sustainable de-
velopment goals that are aligned to our business to 
further connect zealand’s efforts with those of other 
companies to address global challenges.
zealand’s csr policy focuses on areas most relevant 
to our core business:
• working environment, employee well-being, and 
diversity,
• quality in relation to research, development, and 
supply chain activities,
• patient-centric approach,
• environmental sustainability and climate, and
• business ethics.
commitment to sustainable development goals
zealand is committed to addressing global challeng-
es through support of the sustainable development 
goals established by the united nations. six goals 
that are relevant to our business were placed into fo-
cus last year, and we continue to identify and imple-
ment initiatives and metrics to evaluate our progress 
in these areas. additional goals may be considered as 
our company continues to grow and evolve.
diversity 
diversity provides better understanding of the com-
munities in which we operate, so that we can create 
value for patients and our stakeholders. zealand aims 
to achieve equal representation of both genders at all 
management levels – from the board of directors to 
the heads of departments.
zealand has an even distribution of female and male 
managers, and slightly more women than men across 
the organization in general. overall zealand is made 
for the statutory reporting on corporate 
social responsibility, gender distribution 
and diversity in management cf. the danish

risk management 
and internal 
control
we constantly monitor and assess 
the overall risk of doing business in 
the pharmaceutical/biotech industry 
and the particular risks associated 
with our current activities and 
corporate profile.
this section contains a summary of zealand’s key risk 
areas and how we attempt to address and mitigate 
such risks. environmental and ethical risks are cov-
ered in our corporate social responsibility reporting, 
and risks related to financial reporting are covered in 
our corporate governance reporting.
doing business in the pharmaceutical/biotech indus-
try involves major financial risks. the development of 
novel medicines takes several years, costs are high, 
and the probability of reaching the market is relatively 
low due to developmental and regulatory hurdles.
zealand’s management is responsible for imple-
menting adequate systems and policies in relation 
to risk management and internal control, and for 
assessing the overall and specific risks associated 
with zealand’s business and operations. furthermore, 
zealand’s management seeks to ensure that such 
risks are managed optimally and in a responsible and 
efficient manner.
risks of particular importance to zealand are scientif-
ic and development risks, commercial risks, intellec-
tual property risks, clinical trial risks, regulatory risks, 
partner interest risks, and financial risks. risk and 
mitigation plans are monitored by management, and 
the continuous risk assessment is an integral part of 
the yearly reporting to the board of directors.

and development
research and 
development
risk
risks relating to the sales 
of v-go®, market size, 
competition, develop-
ment time and costs, 
partner interest and 
pricing of products in 
development.
research and develop-
ment of new pharma-
ceutical medicines is 
inherently a high-risk 
activity. the probabil-
ity of discovering and 
developing an efficient 
and safe new medicine 
with strong ip protection 
is very low.
mitigation
zealand maintains a 
reporting system for 
v-go® to monitor the 
product and will establish 
a similar system for future 
launches. from early in 
the research phase and 
throughout development, 
commercial potential 
and risks are assessed to 
ensure that final products 
have the potential to be 
commercially viable. in 
order to cope with the 
restrictions imposed by 
covid-19 zealand has 
adapted its marketing ac-
titives to protect its staff 
and patients.
throughout the research 
and development pro-
cess, zealand regularly 
assesses these risks by 
means of a quarterly risk 
assessment of all the 
company’s research and 
development projects, 
conducted by manage-
ment together with the 
department heads and 
project managers. this 
assessment, which is 
presented to the board of 
directors, describes each 
project and measures its 
progress based on mile-
stones. it analyzes the 
individual risks of each 
project and prioritizes the 
project portfolio.

it
risk
our product candidates will 
need to undergo time-con-
suming and expensive trials to 
document efficacy and safety, 
the outcome of which is 
unpredictable, and for which 
there is a high risk of failure. 
if clinical trials of our product 
candidates fail to satisfactorily 
demonstrate safety and effi-
cacy to the fda, the ema and 
other comparable regulatory 
authorities, zealand may incur 
additional costs or experi-
ence delays in completing, 
or ultimately not be able to 
complete, the development 
of these product candidates.
if zealand or its partners were 
to face infringement claims 
or challenges by third parties, 
an adverse outcome could 
subject zealand or its part-
ners to significant liabilities to 
such third parties. this could 
lead zealand or its partners to 
curtail or cease the develop-
ment of some or all of their 
candidate drugs, or cause 
zealand’s partners to seek 
legal or contractual remedies 
against zealand, potentially 
involving a reduction in the 
royalties due to zealand.
the regulatory approval 
processes of the fda, the 
ema and other comparable 
regulatory authorities are 
lengthy, time consuming and 
inherently unpredictable, and 
if zealand or its collaboration 
partners are ultimately unable 
to obtain regulatory approval 
for their internal or outli-
censed product candidates, 
zealand’s business could be 
substantially harmed.
entering into collaborations 
with partners can bring 
significant benefits as well 
as involve risks. in addition, 
full control of the product is 
often given to the partner.
financial risks relate to cash 
and treasury management, 
liquidity forecasts and financ-
ing opportunities.
the company’s information 
technology systems are key 
to its operations and need 
protection from intrusion 
from unauthorized entry.
mitigation
zealand’s clinical project 
teams work closely with 
external expert clinicians and 
product development experts 
within the industry to design, 
set up and conduct the 
clinical programs. zealand’s 
employees have been select-
ed due to their extensive ex-
perience within their field of 
expertise, receive training and 
are continuously developed 
to fulfill requirements. zea-
land also engages in meetings 
with regulatory authorities to 
ensure that there is alignment 
on the regulatory strategy and 
trial requirements.
zealand’s patent department 
works closely with external 
patent counsels and partners’ 
patent counsels to minimize 
the risk of patent infringe-
ment claims as well as to 
prepare any patent defense 
should this be necessary.
zealand’s employees receive 
training and updates on 
policies regarding the correct 
and lawful management of 
external intellectual property.
zealand’s regulatory de-
partment works closely with 
external consultants and 
regulatory agents to develop 
regulatory strategies and 
frequently interacts with 
regulatory agencies.
zealand has taken a decision 
to increase its focus on pro-
prietary programs in order to 
decrease its dependence on 
partners in the development 
process and capture more of 
the value of its projects.
partnerships may still be 
relevant in the future and, to 
maximize the value of such 
partnerships, zealand strives 
to foster a close and open 
dialogue with its partners, 
thereby building strong part-
nerships that work effectively.
financial risks are managed in 
accordance with the finance 
policy, regularly assessed by 
the company’s management 
and reported to the audit 
committee and the board of 
directors. during 2019 and 
2020 zealand has worked to 
design and implement an in-
ternal control framework to 
respond to the requirements 
of the sarbanes- oxley act as 
a result of the us listing.see 
also p. 94, note 28 - financial 
risks.
the company employs 
qualified it professionals 
who use external assistance 
from qualified vendors to 
provide advice on cyber-
security and systems security 
were relevant. all members 
of staff are trained in it 
security and its it systems 
use authentication systems 
to reduce the risk of 
unauthorized entry into its 
systems. it has appropriate 
protection from viruses and 
malware.  its most sensitive 
data is encrypted and subject 
to restricted internal use.

business overview
zealand (the “company”, the “group”, “zealand” and “we”) was founded in 1998 and is a bio-
technology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative peptide-based 
medicines. more than 10 drug candidates invented by zealand have advanced into clinical de-
velopment, of which two have reached the market. zealand’s current pipeline of internal prod-
uct candidates focus on specialty gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. zealand’s portfolio 
also includes two clinical license collaborations with boehringer ingelheim and one discover 
and develop collaboration with alexion pharmaceuticals.
in september 2018 we entered into an agreement with royalty pharma to transfer all the royal-
ties that we were due to earn from our 2003 agreement with sanofi in exchange for an upfront 
one-time payment of usd 205 million. excluded from this agreement was a potential milestone 
payment from sanofi of up to usd 15 million.
in april 2020, we acquired substantially all of the medical technology business from valeritas 
holdings, inc. refer to note 29.

significant accounting policies
basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements of zealand have been prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting 
standards board (iasb) and as adopted by the eu and additional requirements under the danish 
financial statements act (class d).
the board of directors considered and approved the 2020 annual report of zealand on march 
10, 2021. the annual report will be submitted to the shareholders of zealand for approval at 
the annual general meeting on april 15, 2021.
the consolidated financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis, except for cer-
tain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services.
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of 
 whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into level 1, 2 or 3 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and 
on the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement as a whole. the inputs are 
described as follows:
• level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the entity can access at the measurement date
• level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
• level 3 inputs are fair value measures derived from valuation techniques that include inputs 
for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
the consolidated financial statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is the func-
tional currency of the parent company.
in the narrative sections of the financial statements, comparative figures for 2019 and 2018 are 
shown in brackets if not indicated otherwise. 
implementation of new and revised standards and interpretations
a few amendments apply for the first time in 2020, but do not have an impact on the consoli-
dated financial statements of the group.
amendments to ifrs 3: definition of a business
the amendment to ifrs 3 clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activ-
ities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create output. furthermore, it clarified that a business 
can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. 
amendments to ifrs 7, ifrs 9 and ias 39: interest rate benchmark reform
the amendments to ifrs 7, ifrs 9 and ias 39 financial instruments: recognition and meas-
urement provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly 
affected by interest rate benchmark reform. a hedging relationship is affected if the reform 
gives rise to uncertainties about the timing and or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of 
the hedged item or the hedging instrument. 
amendments to ias 1 and ias 8: definition of material
the amendments provide a new definition of material that states “information is material if 
omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that 
the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial 
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.”
the amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of informa-
tion, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial 
statements. a misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to 
influence decisions made by the primary users.

standards and interpretations issued, but not yet applied 
iasb has issued a number of new and amended standards which are not yet effective. none of 
these new standards or amendments are expected to impact the group.
accounting policies
the group has applied new accounting policies to the following areas as a consequence of the 
acquisition of the valeritas business as disclosed in note 29. 
• revenue (extended)
• cost of goods sold
• sales and marketing expenses (extended)
• impairment testing (extended)
• inventories
• trade receivables write-down (extended)
• discount and rebate provision
• business combinations  
the accounting policies are apart from the line items above unchanged from last year. the 
accounting policies for specific line items and transactions are included in the respective notes 
to the financial statements except for basis and principles of consolidation, foreign currency 
translation, classification of income statement, segment reporting, classification of financial 
assets and the cash flow statement, which are included below.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company 
and entities (including structured entities) controlled by the company and its subsidiaries. con-
trol is achieved when the company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
the company reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the financial statements of 
the parent company and the individual subsidiaries, which are based on uniform accounting 
policies and accounting periods in all group entities. consolidation of group entities is per-
formed after elimination of all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses.
functional currency
a functional currency is determined for each group entity. the functional currency is the cur-
rency used in the primary financial environment in which the individual group entity operates.
foreign currency translation
transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entity's functional currency 
are translated at the exchange rates on the transaction dates. 
exchange differences arising between the rate on the transaction date and the rate on the pay-
ment day are recognized in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.
receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that have 
not been settled at the statement of financial position date are translated by applying the ex-
change rates at the statement of financial position date. differences arising between the rate at 
the statement of financial position date and the rate at the date on which the receivable or pay-
able arose are recognized in the income statement as financial income and financial expenses.
recognition in the consolidated financial statements
on preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the income statements of entities with 
a functional currency different from dkk are translated at the average exchange rate for the pe-
riod, and balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date.
foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the equity of foreign entities and on 
translation of receivables considered part of net investment are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income.
foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of income statements from the average 
exchange rate for the period to the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date are also recog-
nised in other comprehensive income. adjustments are presented under a separate translation 
reserve in equity.
materiality in financial reporting
in preparing the annual report, management seeks to improve the information value of the 
consolidated financial statements, the notes to the statements and other measures disclosed by 
presenting the information in a way that supports the understanding of the group’s perfor-
mance in the reporting period.
this objective is achieved by presenting fair transactional aggregation levels on line items and 
other financial information, emphasising information that is considered of material importance 
to the user and making relevant rather than generic descriptions throughout the annual report.
67
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
notes
note 1 – significant accounting policies, and significant accounting estimates and assessments (continued)
all disclosures are made in compliance with the international financial reporting standards, the 
danish financial statements act and other relevant regulations, ensuring a true and fair view 
throughout the annual report.
consolidated financial statements
income statement
the expenses recognized in the income statement is presented as an analysis using a classifica-
tion based on their function.
cost of goods sold
cost of goods sold includes raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses and 
reserves for anticipated scrap and inventory obsolescence.
segment reporting
the group is managed by a corporate management team reporting to the chief executive 
officer. the corporate management team, including the chief executive officer, represents the 
chief operating decision maker (codm). no separate business areas or separate business units 
have been identified in connection with line of business, product candidates or geographical 
markets. consequently, there is no segment reporting concerning business areas or geograph-
ical areas.
statement of financial position
financial assets
financial assets include receivables, marketable securities and cash. financial assets are divided 
into categories of which the following are relevant for the group:
1.  financial assets at amortized cost comprising of receivables with contractual cash flows 
solely comprising of payment of principal and interest and which are held for the purpose of 
collecting the contractual cash flow. 
2.  financial assets at fair value through the income statement, which are marketable securities 
categorized as equity instruments are held for trading and classified at fair value through 
profit and loss.
3.  equity investments. these investments are measured at fair value through the profit and loss.
financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, 
depending on the cash flow characteristics and purpose for which the assets were acquired. 
all financial assets are recognized on their settlement date. all financial assets other than those 
classified at fair value through the income statement are initially recognized at fair value, plus 
transaction costs.
statement of cash flows
the cash flow statement is prepared in accordance with the indirect method on the basis of the 
operating result for the year. the statement shows the cash flows broken down into operating, 
investing and financing activities, cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the 
year, and the impact of the calculated cash flows on cash and cash equivalents. the cash flow 
statement cannot be derived directly from the balance sheet and income statement.
cash flows in foreign currencies are translated into danish kroner at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date.
cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities is presented indirectly and is calculated as the net operating 
result adjusted for depreciation and amortization, sale of royalties, non-cash operating items, 
changes in net working capital, financial items paid, and income tax benefits received and paid.
cash flow from investing activities
cash flow from investing activities includes cash flows from the sale of future royalties and 
milestone relating to the sanofi license, purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, in-
vestments and deposits, net cashflow from acquisition of valertias activities, as well as transfers 
to and from restricted cash related to the royalty bond.
cash flow from financing activities
cash flow from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of new ordinary shares, 
proceeds from issuance of shares related to exercise of sharebased compensation. and related 
costs, finance lease installments and loan financing. 
cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances. cash and cash equivalents are 
instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. the company does not have any cash 
equivalents for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
information on covid-19
our business, operations and clinical studies were, of course, impacted by the effects of  
covid-19. although our clinical studies continued without interruption during 2020, there 
were delays and increased total costs arising from the implications of covid-19.
however, we have not recognized any write-offs, impairments of assets, or losses to onerous 
contracts due to covid-19. the impairment of v-go ip as explained in note 12 was due to 
68
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
notes
note 1 – significant accounting policies, and significant accounting estimates and assessments (continued)
managements decision to allocate resources to support future product launches while limiting 
the investment in the v-go product. 
the covid-19 pandemic is also having an effect on other aspects of our business, including: 
our third-party manufacturers, and other third parties; albeit with no material effect or impact. 
the covid-19 pandemic may, in the long-term, affect the productivity of our staff; our ability 
to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified personnel or key employees; our global supply 
chains and relationships with vendors and other parties; significant disruption of global financial 
markets; and reduced ability to secure additional funding. we continuously monitor the  
covid-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and financials.
significant accounting estimates and judgments
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judg-
ments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabil-
ities, and the accompanying disclosures. in applying our accounting policies, management is 
required to make judgements and estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. the estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. actual re-
sults may differ from these estimates. the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
the estimates used are based on assumptions assessed to be reasonable by management. 
however, estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. the assumptions may be 
incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur. furthermore, 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in deviations in actual results compared 
with estimates.
please refer to the table below to see in which note the accounting estimates and judgements 
are presented.

additional description of management estimates and judgements made are described below
revenue recognition (management estimate and judgement)
revenue comprises license payments, milestone payments, product revenue and royalty in-
come. license payments which provide the buyer with the right to use the license as it exists at 
the date of transfer are recognized upon transfer of the associated licensing rights at the point 
at which the buyer obtains the right to use the license. upon entering into agreements with 
multiple components, management determines whether individual components are distinct, 
which is the case if the buyer can obtain benefits from the goods or service and the promise is 
distinct within the context of the contract. if no individual components are distinct, the contract 
is treated as a single performance obligation. when entering into licensing and development 
agreements, a critical judgment relates to whether the customer could continue development 
of the intellectual property (ip) to the stage promised by zealand under the promise to provide 
r&d services. if this is not the case, the ip and the r&d services are considered a single perfor-
mance obligation. 
milestone payments are related to the collaborative research agreements with commercial 
partners and are recognized when it is highly probable that zealand pharma will become enti-
tled to the milestone which is generally when the milestone is achieved. royalty income from 
licenses is based on third-party sales of licensed products and is recognized in accordance with 
contract terms in the period in which the sales occur.
revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services which are consumed by the cus-
tomer simultaneously with delivery is recognized along with delivery of the services.
employee incentive programs (management estimates)
in accordance with ifrs 2, share-based payment, the fair value of the warrants classified 
as equity settled is measured at the grant date and recognized as an expense in the income 
statement over the vesting period. the fair value of each warrant granted during the year is 
69
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
notes
note 1 – significant accounting policies, and significant accounting estimates and assessments (continued)
estimated using the black– scholes option pricing model. this requires the input of subjective 
assumptions such as:
• the expected stock price volatility, which is based on the historical volatility of zealand’s 
share price
• the selection of the risk-free interest rate, which is determined as the interest rate on danish 
government bonds with a maturity equal to the expected term
• the duration of the warrants, which is assumed to be until the middle of the exercise period
the total fair value of the warrants is recognized in the income statement over the vesting 
period. an adjustment is made to reflect an expected attrition rate during the vesting period. 
the attrition rate is re-estimated at year-end based on the historical attrition rate resulting 
in recognition of an expense equal to grant date fair value of the number of warrants which 
actually vest.
discount and rebate (management estimate and judgement)
provisions regarding sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesal-
ers, retail pharmacies, managed care and other customers are recorded at the time the related 
revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. 
for both managed care rebates and the medicare part d rebates, the key assumptions relate 
to the rebate percentages by each pharmacy as determined in each pharmacy's contract with 
the company and forecasted number of prescriptions that will be filled by each pharmacy (re-
ferred to as payor mix). for co-pay card redemptions, the key assumptions relate to expected 
settlement rate for sales units remaining in the channel that have yet to be presented under 
co-pay terms. these assumptions are made based on historical actuals, which are used to es-
timate forecasted trends, including payor mix and settlement rates, which are used to estimate 
the expected settlement of managed care rebates and medicare part d rebates, and co-pay 
card redemption, and the specific terms in the individual agreements. unsettled rebates are 
recognized as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain. where absolute amounts are 
known, the rebates are recognized as provisions.please refer to note 25 for further information 
on sales rebates and provisions.
encycle therapeutics, inc. acquisition (management judgement)
as of october 2019, zealand acquired all outstanding shares in encycle therapeutics, inc. and 
all its intellectual property, including all rights to develop and commercialize the lead asset. 
zealand did not acquire any infrastructure or personnel costs with this transaction. the total 
future consideration for the acquisition could potentially reach usd 80 million in one-time 
contingent value rights (“earn-outs”), of which usd 10 million in earn-outs could be payable up 
to the successful completion of a phase 2 study. all earn-outs are payable in cash and/or zea-
land equity at zealand’s discretion, are linked to the lead asset only, and contingent on certain 
future successful development, regulatory, and commercial-related milestones. there is also a 
potential mid-single digit royalty on global net sales from the lead asset.
the acquistion has been measured based on the overall cost of the transaction less the fair 
value of the cash balance and trade payables also acquired. the fair value of the contingent 
considerations related to encycle therapeutics was assessed to be zero as per the acquisition 
date based on the significant uncertainty of the outcome of the development to be performed 
by zealand. 
business combinations (management estimates and judgements)
in applying the acquisition method of accounting, estimates are an integral part of assessing fair 
values of several identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as observable market prices 
are typically not available. 
valuation techniques where estimates are applied typically relate to determining the present 
value of future uncertain cash flows or assessing other events in which the outcome is uncer-
tain at the date of acquisition.
more significant estimates are typically applied in accounting for intellectual properties, cus-
tomer relationships, trade receivables, deferred tax and debt.
the calculation of the fair value of intangible assets is most sensitive to the revenue and gross 
margin growths. please refer to note 29 for further information on business combinations.
as a result of the uncertainties inherent in fair value estimation, measurement period adjust-
ments may be applied.

zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020

note 2 – revenue
 accounting policies
revenue comprises license payments, milestone payments, royalty income and sale of goods. 
license payments which provide the buyer with the right to use the license as it exists at the date 
of transfer are recognized upon transfer of the associated licensing rights at the point at which 
the buyer obtains the right to use the license. milestone payments related to the collaborative 
research agreements with commercial partners are recognized when it is highly probable that 
zealand pharma will become entitled to the milestone which is generally when the milestone is 
achieved. royalty income from licenses is based on third-party sales of licensed products and is 
recognized in accordance with contract terms in the period in which the sales occur.
revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services which are consumed by the 
customer simultaneously with delivery is recognized along with delivery of the services.
upon entering into agreements with multiple components, management determines whether 
individual components are distinct, which is the case if the buyer can obtain benefits from the 
goods or service and the promise is distinct within the context of the contract. if no individual 
components are distinct, the contract is treated as having a single performance obligation.
revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion of the r&d services, which is 
estimated based on the expenses incurred during that period. zealand applies the output based 
method (budget cost) when determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obliga-
tions as the development services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts over the 
development timeline and accordingly, time elapsed and budget costs as an output measure is 
considered to be the unit which most appropriately depicts the transfer of control of services to 
alexion in total.
trade receivables are recognised as services delivered are invoiced to the customer and are not 
adjusted for any financing components as credit terms are short – typically between 14 to 60 
days – and the financing component therefore insignificant. where services delivered have yet 
to be invoiced and invoices on services received from vendors have still to be received, con-
tract assets and accrued cost of services are recognised at the reporting date.
revenue from sale of goods
revenue from sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods are 
transferred to the customer and recorded net of adjustments for managed care rebates, whole-
sale distributions fees, cash discounts, prompt pay discounts, and co-pay card redemptions, all 
of which are established at the time of sale.
in order to prepare the consolidated financial statements, the company is required to make es-
timates regarding the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related product sales, including 
the following: 
• managed care and medicare rebates, which are based on the estimated end user pay or mix 
and related contractual rebates;
• distribution fees, prompt pay discounts and other discounts, which are recorded based on 
specified payment terms, and which vary by customer and other incentive programs; and 
• co-pay card redemption charges which are based on the net transaction costs of prescrip-
tions filled via a company-subsidized card program and other incentive programs.
zealand believes rebates and co-pay card redemptions related to sales in the u.s. are complex 
in nature and establishing appropriate provisions requires assessment of multiple factors as well 
as significant judgement and estimation by management as not all conditions are known at the 
time of sale.
the group has concluded that it is the principal in this revenue arrangements since it controls 
the goods before transferring them to the customer.
return reserve
we record allowances for product returns as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales 
are recorded. several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product 
returns is required, including the customers’ return rights and our historical experience with 
returns and the amount of product sales in the distribution channel not consumed by patients 
and subject to return. management replies on historical return rates to estimate returns. in the 
future, as any of these factors and/or the history of product returns change, adjustments to the 
allowance for product returns will be reflected
revenue from alexion
in 2020, we recognized dkk 42.9 million (2019: 37.4 million) as income from the license, 
research and development agreement signed in march 2019 reflecting the progress on the 
lead project. under the agreement dkk 97.8 million is accounted for as deferred revenue at 
december 31, 2020.
in 2019, dkk 0.6 million of other revenue is recognized related to other projects with alexion.
no revenue was recognized in 2018.
revenue from sanofi
no revenue was recognized in 2020 or 2019. in 2018, we recognized dkk 24.9 million as roy-
alty income, reflecting milestones related to sales of lyxumia® of eur 9.5 million and sales of 
soliqua® 100/33 of eur 23.8 million. no milestone revenue was received.

revenue from boehringer ingelheim (bi)
in 2020, we recognized dkk 149.1 million as income from milestone payments from bi related 
to the initiation of the phase 2 trial for the long-acting glp-1/glucagon. 
no revenue was recognized from bi in 2019 or 2018, as no milestone event was achieved. 
revenue from sale of goods
in 2020, we recognized dkk 161.3 million as net sales from goods sold generated from our 
v-go product. the rights to the v-go product was acquired on april 2, 2020 as part of the busi-
ness combination described in note 29. thus revenue from sale of the v-go product recog-
nized in 2020 solely relates to the period april 2 - december 31.
revenue from other agreements
in 2020, we recognized zero revenue from other agreements.
in 2018 and 2019, we recognized dkk 9.8 million and dkk 3.3 million, respectively, in revenues 
from a milestone payment and license option payments, respectively, from undisclosed coun-
terparties relating to two material transfer agreements.
in 2018, we recognized dkk 3.3 million in revenue from milestone payments from protagonist 
therapeutics in connection with the start of phase 2 with the novel hepcidin mimetic ptg-300.
zealand is managed and operated as one business unit, which is reflected in the organizational 
structure and internal reporting. no separate lines of business or separate business entities have 
been identified with respect to any of the product candidates or geographical markets and no 
segment information is currently disclosed in the internal reporting.

note 2 – revenue (continued)
accounting for the alexion pharmaceuticals, inc. agreement
in march 2019, zealand entered into a license, research and development agreement with 
alexion pharmaceuticals, inc. (alexion) to develop novel therapies to treat complement medi-
ated diseases. this agreement provided zealand an immediate cash injection as well as further 
external validation of zealand’s peptide platform.
the collaboration with alexion is not limited to c3 but offers the potential to work on identifi-
cation of peptide inhibitors to up to three additional components of the complement cascade. 
zealand will have responsibility for the c3 project and other targets up to ind and alexion will 
then progress the peptides into clinical development. 
under the alexion license, research and development agreement, zealand has received an 
upfront non-refundable payment of usd 25 million for the c3 program and a concurrent usd 
15 million equity investment in zealand at a premium to the market price. the agreement also 
provides the potential for development-related milestones of up to usd 115 million, as well as 
up to usd 495 million in sales-related milestones and high single- to low double-digit royalty 
payments. the 3 additional programs will provide further non-refundable upfront payments 
(usd 15 million each), development and sales milestone and royalties.
accounting treatment 
the non-refundable up-front fee was allocated to the combined license, research and devel-
opment services, and is being recognized as revenue along with provision of the research and 
development services under the lead program. expenses to provide the services is being recog-
nized when incurred. further, the premium over the market share price on the zealand shares 
subscribed by alexion, dkk 12.7 million, is attributed to the agreement as further consideration 
and consequently also recognized over the period over which the r&d services are provided. , 
alexion has paid usd 40 million, corresponding to dkk 262.9 million that as of december 31, 
2019 has affected equity by dkk 85.6 million, deferred revenue by dkk 139.9 million, and reve-
nue by dkk 37.4 million in 2019. hence the cash flow from operating activities was dkk 177.3 
million and the cash flow from financing activities was dkk 85.6 million.
in 2020 revenue of dkk 42.9 million was recognized.
milestone payments, if any, will be recognized as revenue when the relevant milestones are 
achieved as they relate to performance obligations already satisfied at this stage. royalty pay-
ments, if any, will be recognized along with the underlying sales.
significant judgement applied (performance obligations and revenue recognition) 
determination of whether the license transferred and the research and development services 
constitute separate performance obligations, or form part a single performance obligation 
comprising a combined output has a significant impact on the accounting treatment. zealand 
has applied significant judgment to determine whether the promised services are distinct and 
concluded that alexion cannot benefit from the license alone. it is zealand assessment that the 
r&d services under this agreement requires specific zealand know-how and expertise which 
cannot be easily identified or sourced externally. therefore, alexion would not in the absence 
of the contractual provisions have had the practical ability to engage a third-party r&d service 
provider to provide the agreed r&d services.
judgments and estimates in respect of output is made when entering the agreement and is 
based on research and development budgets and plans. the planned service periods (output) 
and budget costs for the respective research and development projects are assessed on an 
ongoing basis. if the expected service period is changed significantly, this will require a reas-
sessment.  
all zealand’s revenue-generating transactions have been subject to such evaluation by man-
agement.
as the nature of the collaboration with alexion may affect the accounting treatment of the 
agreement, zealand has considered whether the agreement takes the form of a collaborative 
partnership with alexion rather than a customer-vendor agreement. after consideration of all 
facts and circumstances, zealand has assessed that the agreement takes the form of a custom-
er-vendor relationship. accordingly, the agreement is treated under the guidelines of ifrs 15 
revenue from contracts with customers.
as any additional programs are optional and paid for separately, they are not considered part 
of the initial agreement. it has been considered whether the options for additional compo-
nents represent a material right and, thus, a separate performance obligation under the initial 
agreement to which a portion of the initial upfront payment should be allocated. zealand has 
determined that the probability of exercising the option is low and in combination with the fact 
that the development is significantly less advanced than the lead target, we have determined 
that the options do not represent a material right.
accounting for the sanofi license agreement
in 2003, zealand entered into a license agreement with sanofi (the sanofi license agreement), 
pursuant to which zealand granted sanofi exclusive rights to its patents, know-how and other 
intellectual property relating to lixisenatide, for all fields. pursuant to the sanofi license agree-
73
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
notes
note 2 – revenue (continued)
ment, which has been amended over the years, sanofi assumed responsibility for the further 
development, manufacturing and marketing of lixisenatide, and we cannot research or develop 
lixisenatide while the sanofi license agreement remains in effect.
under the sanofi license agreement, zealand were eligible to receive remaining milestone 
payments relating to commercialized products of up to usd 100 million, contingent on the 
achievement of certain sales levels, as well as royalties on global sales of such products. royal-
ties correspond to tiered, low-double-digit percentages of sanofi’s global net sales of lixisenati-
de (branded as adlyxinr in the u.s. and as lyxumiar in the eu and in other countries) plus a 
10% royalty on global net sales of a combination of lixisenatide and insulin glargine 100 units/ml 
(lantusr) marketed under the brand name soliquar 100/33 in the u.s. and as suliquar in the eu. 
in 2016, sanofi challenged the validity of certain patents owned by a competitor, astrazeneca 
(and its affiliates), in both administrative and court proceedings in the u.s. and in certain other 
countries, and astrazeneca brought counterclaims in the u.s. proceedings asserting that prod-
ucts containing lixisenatide infringe its patents. sanofi and astrazeneca subsequently agreed to 
settle all claims and counterclaims between them in various proceedings relating to lixisenatide.
our financial obligations related to this now-resolved intellectual property dispute could reduce 
our net revenue from the original commercial milestone payments from sanofi relating to soli-
qua r 100/33/suliquar. the amount and timing of any such reductions of future revenue are 
not currently known, but they will not exceed usd 15 million in total. 
zealand pays alkermes plc 13% of all payments received on lixisenatide while lixisenatide is sub-
ject to a commercialization agreement such as the sanofi license agreement. zealand also pay 
one of the inventors of the structure induced probe (sip) technology employed in lixisensatide 
a 0.5% royalty on amounts received in connection with drug candidates that, like lixisenatide, 
are produced using the sip technology.
milestone payments have been recognized as revenue when the relevant milestones are 
achieved.
all future royalties and all but up to usd 15 million of future milestone payments relating to the 
sanofi license agreement were sold to royalty pharma in september 2018. refer to note 7.
accounting for the boehringer ingelheim license agreements
in 2011, zealand entered into a license, research and development collaboration agreement 
with boehringer ingelheim international gmbh (bi) to advance novel glp-1/glucagon dual- 
acting peptide receptor agonists (ggdas) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and 
obesity. under the terms of the 2011 bi license agreement, bi paid a fixed amount per full-time 
employee and other costs related to all research, development and commercialization in re-
spect of the compounds covered by the agreement.
zealand is eligible to receive license and milestone payments of up to eur 386 million, of 
which eur 345 million was outstanding at december 31, 2020, related to the achievement of 
pre-specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the lead product. we are 
also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from high single-digit to low double-digit per-
centages on bi’s sales of all products stemming from this collaboration. in addition, we retain 
copromotion rights in scandinavia.
in 2014, zealand entered into a second global license, research and development collaboration 
agreement with bi (the 2014 bi license agreement). this agreement pertained to a collabo-
ration on a specific therapeutic peptide project from our portfolio of preclinical programs for 
a period of up to four and a half years, with the aim of developing novel drugs to improve the 
treatment of patients with cardiometabolic diseases. in 2015, bi selected a novel peptide thera-
peutic to be advanced into preclinical development under this agreement.
no product candidates out licensed to bi are currently marketed, and accordingly we have not 
received any royalty payments to date under our licensing agreements with bi.
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the relevant milestones are achieved.
accounting for other license agreements
in 2019, zealand recognized revenue related to a material transfer agreement with an undis-
closed counterpart. the revenue related to a license option has been recognized in the period 
in which the services were rendered.
in 2018, zealand entered into a material transfer agreement with an undisclosed counterpart. 
a milestone payment was recognized as revenue, when the relevant milestone was achieved. 
such material transfer agreement related to the delivery of an existing material to the undis-
closed third party. no remaining performance obligations exist related to such agreement. 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the relevant milestones are achieved.

note 4 – research, development, sales, marketing and administrative expenses
 accounting policies
research expenses comprise salaries, share-based compensation, contributions to pension 
schemes and other expenses, including patent expenses, as well as depreciation and amortiza-
tion directly attributable to the group’s research activities. research expenses are recognized in 
the income statement as incurred. 
development expenses comprise salaries, share-based compensation, contributions to pension 
schemes and other expenses, including depreciation and amortization, directly attributable to 
the group’s development activities. development expenses are recognized in the income state-
ment as incurred, except where the capitalization criteria is met.
no indirect costs that are not directly attributable to research and development activities are 
included in the disclosure of research and development expenses recognized in the income 
statement. overhead expenses have been allocated to research and development or adminis-
trative expenses based on the number of employees in each department, determined accord-
ing to the respective employees’ associated undertakings.
judgment applied related to research and development expenses 
a development project involves a single product candidate undergoing a large number of tests 
to demonstrate its safety profile and its effect on human beings, prior to obtaining the nec-
essary final approval for the product from the appropriate authorities. the future economic 
benefits associated with the individual development projects are dependent on obtaining such 
approval. considering the significant risk and duration of the development period for biological 
products, management has concluded that whether the intangible asset will generate probable 
future economic benefits cannot be estimated with sufficient certainty until the project has 
been finalized and the necessary final regulatory approval of the product has been obtained. 
accordingly, zealand has not recognized such assets at this time, and all research and develop-
ment expenses are therefore recognized in the income statement when incurred.
capitalization of development costs assumes that, in the group’s opinion, the development 
of the technology or the product has been completed, all necessary public registrations and 
marketing approvals have been received, and expenses can be reliably measured. furthermore, 
it must be established that the technology or the product can be commercialized and that the 
future income from the product can cover not only the production, selling and administra-
tive expenses but also development expenses. zealand has not capitalized any development 
expenses in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
note 3 – royalty expenses
 accounting policies
royalty expenses comprise contractual amounts payable to third parties that are derived from 
the milestone payments and royalty income earned from the corresponding collaboration 
agreements.  
we have agreed to pay some of our revenue in deferred payments or royalties to third parties. 
at the time of the dissolution of a former joint venture with elan corporation, plc (elan) and 
certain of its subsidiaries that were party to the joint venture agreement with us, we agreed to 
pay royalties to elan – now alkermes plc, as successor in interest to a termination agreement 
between us and the elan entities – including 13% of future payments we receive in respect of 
lixisenatide under the sanofi license agreement.
in addition, we have agreed to pay a royalty of 0.5% of the total amounts we receive in connec-
tion with our sip-modified peptides, including lixisenatide, to one of the inventors of our sip 
technology, who is one of our employees. the royalty to be paid to this inventor is calculated 
on the basis of all the amounts we receive, including license payments, milestone payments 
and sales. in 2019, the royalty expenses relate to mentioned inventor.
in 2018, the royalty expenses related to royalties from sales of lyxumia® and soliqua® 100/33 
and milestone payments received from sanofi. the arrangement was settled in 2018 as part of 
transferring the right to future royalty and milestone payments under the sanofi agreement.

 accounting policies
the value of services received as consider-
ation for granted warrants is measured at 
the fair value of the warrant. the fair value 
of equity settled share based compensa-
tion is determined at the grant date and 
is recognized in the income statement as 
employee benefit expense over the period 
in which the warrants vest. the offsetting 
entry to this is recognized under equity. an 
estimate is made of the number of warrants 
expected to vest. subsequently, an adjust-
ment is made for changes in the estimate of 
the number of warrants, which will vest, so 
the total expense is equal to fair value of the 
actual number of warrants which vest. the 
fair value of warrants granted is estimated 
using the black–scholes pricing model and 
monte carlo model in programs with value 
caps whereas the average share price prior 
to grant is used for rsu and psus

determination of fair value of the warrants granted during the period
the exercise price is determined by the closing price of zealand’s shares on nasdaq copenha-
gen on the day prior to the grant date. for warrants granted before april 19, 2018, the exercise 
price is determined by the closing price of zealand’s shares on nasdaq copenhagen on the day 
prior to the grant date plus 10%.
warrants granted prior to april 15, 2020 expire automatically after five years. warrants vest 
either after 3 years of service, with 1/36 each month from the grant date, or with 1/3 after 
one year, 1/3 after two years and 1/3 after three years. the service cost is recognized over the 
respective vesting periods. warrants granted from april 15, 2020 and going forward expires 
automatically after 10 years.
warrants may be exercised four times a year during a four-week period starting from the date 
of the publication of zealand’s annual report or interim reports. dividend is not expected.
for warrants granted before january 1, 2019, the volatility rate used is based on the 5-year 
historical volatility of the zealand share price. for warrants granted after january 1, 2019, the 
volatility rate used is based on a historical volatility of the zealand share price calculated as the 
vesting period of 3 years plus 50% of the exercise period (2020: 7 years, 2019: 2 years).

employee warrant programs
in order to motivate and retain key employees and encourage the achievement of common 
goals for employees, management and shareholders, the group has established an incentive 
plan based on warrant programs. incentive programs have been offered in 2005, 2007 and in 
the 2009-2020 period.
the warrants are granted in accordance with the authorizations given to the board of directors 
by the shareholders. the board of directors has fixed the terms of and size of the grants, taking 
into account authorizations from the shareholders, the group’s guidelines for incentive pay, 
an assessment of expectations of the recipient’s work efforts and contribution to the group’s 
growth, as well as the need to motivate and retain the recipient. grant takes place on the 
date of establishment of the program. exercise of warrants is by default subject to continuing 
employment with the group. the warrants granted are subject to the provisions of the danish 
public companies act regarding termination of employees prior to their exercise of warrants in 
the case of recipients covered by the act.
2010 employee incentive program
this program was established in 2010 for zealand’s board of directors, executive management, 
employees and consultants.

2019 long-term incentive program (ltip) for corporate management
this program was established in 2019 for zealand’s corporate management.
under the ltip, the executive management and other corporate management are eligible to 
receive a number of performance share units (“psus”) at no cost, as determined by the board of 
directors. thereafter, psus are expected to be granted annually (together with any share-based 
long-term incentive program, up to a maximum of 10% of zealand’s share capital). the targets 
for the first psus granted on june 13, 2019 under the ltip are related to zealand's filing of a 
submission for a new drug approval ("nda") to the food and drug administration ("fda") in the 
united states and zealand's receipt of an approval letter from the fda for this nda application.
the psus will vest over a three-year period. the psus that have not vested will lapse without 
any compensation. each vested psu entitles the holder to receive one share in zealand at no 
cost provided that the targets are met.

lion of potential commercial milestones for soliqua® 100/33/ suliqua® and lyxumia®/ adlyxin® 
to royalty pharma. under the agreement, all rights and obligations under the sanofi licensing 
agreement apart from potential payments from sanofi of up to usd 15.0 million, expected in 
2021 and 2022 have been transferred to the buyer. zealand had in 2018 received usd 205.0 
million (dkk 1,310.2 million) upon closing of the transaction on september 17, 2018. in 2018, 
royalty expenses to third parties amounted to 13.5% or dkk 176.9 million and fees to advisors 
amounted to dkk 34.5 million. the sanofi license agreement was classified as an intangible as-
set upon adoption of ifrs 15, and the agreement with royalty pharma was treated as a sale of 
this license. the payment to the third parties was considered additional cost price for a license 
forming part of the rights under the sanofi agreement and therefore forming part of the gain.

ducting preclinical and clinical development, as well as for commercializing the products 
stemming from the agreement and funding all activities under the agreement.

note 10 – income tax
 accounting policies
income tax on results for the year, which comprises current tax and changes in deferred tax, 
is recognized in the income statement, whereas the portion attributable to entries in equity is 
recognized directly in equity.
current tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recognized in the statement of financial 
position as tax calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on previous years’ 
taxable income and taxes paid on account/prepaid.
deferred tax is measured according to the statement of financial position liability method in 
respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and 
liabilities.
deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and de-
ferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be avail-
able against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. such deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. in addition, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differ-
ence and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable 
future. deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interest are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be 
sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and 
they are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position 
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. in case of ongoing tax disputes a 
provisions for are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax receivables and tax payables.
this judgment is made on an ongoing basis and is based on recent historical losses carrying 
more weight than factors such as budgets and business plans for the coming years, including 
planned commercial initiatives. the creation and development of therapeutic products within 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is subject to considerable risks and uncertain-
ties. zealand has so far reported significant losses and, consequently, has unused tax losses. 
management has concluded that deferred tax assets should not be recognized at december 
31, 2020. (none recognized in 2019.)
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net 
basis.
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.deferred tax from business 
combinations is initially recognized at fair value.
income tax receivables are recognized in accordance with the danish tax credit scheme (skat-
tekreditordningen). companies covered by the tax credit scheme may obtain payment of the 
tax base of losses originating from research and development expenses of up to dkk 25 million 
(tax value of dkk 5.5 million). 
under danish tax legislation, zealand is eligible to receive dkk 5.5 million in 2020 (dkk 5.5 
million in 2019 and dkk 0.0 million 2018) in cash relating to the surrendered tax loss of dkk 
183 million (dkk 108 million in 2019 and dkk 0 million for 2018) based on qualifying research 
and development expenses. these tax receipts comprise the entire current tax benefit in 2020 
and 2019, respectively. 
the income from sale of future royalties and milestones in 2018 resulted in a positive net re-
sult, meaning that zealand was not in 2018 eligible for similar tax income based on qualifying 
research and development expenses, but was able to utilize a portion of the unrecognized 
deferred tax asset
when considering tax and duties disputes, management applies significant estimates of the 
likely outcome based on the knowledge available of the actual substance of the disputes, 
including opinions and estimates by external tax experts and case law, if available. the 
resolution of disputes may take several years, and the outcome is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.

note 11 – basic and diluted earnings per share
 accounting policies
basic result per share
basic result per share is calculated as the net result for the period that is allocated to the parent 
company’s ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares out-
standing. this includes the treasury shares held by the company.
diluted result per share
diluted result per share is calculated as the net result for the period that is allocated to the 
parent company’s ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding and adjusted by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
the result and weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic and

note 12 – impairment
 accounting policies
assets with indefitie usefull time are annually assesed for impairment whereas assets with defi-
nite usefull lifetime are assessed for impairment indicators.
each year, the assets are reviewed in order to assess whether there are indications of impair-
ment. if such indications exist, the recoverable amount, determined as the higher amount of 
the fair value of the asset adjusted for expected costs to sell and the value in use of the asset, is 
calculated. the value in use is calculated based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted 
by using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying 
amount, an impairment charge is recognized in respect of the asset. the impairment loss is 
recognized in the income statement. in addition, for goodwill and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives, impairment tests are performed at each balance sheet date, regardless 
of whether there are any indications of impairment. for acquisitions, the first impairment test is 
performed before the end of the year of acquisition. 
key assumptions in the impairment test
the impairment assessment for 2020 identified a need for impairment on the v-go related 
intellectual property of dkk 12.7 million. the impairment loss was primarily related to man-
agement’s decision to allocate resources to support future product launches while limiting the 
investment in the v-go product.
no impairment indicators were identified in 2019.
through the assessment of impairment indicators regarding the v-go intellectual property, 
management identified impairment indicators and an impairment test was performed by calcu-
lating recoverable amount of the v-go intellectual property.
the recoverable amount was determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow 
and projections for subsequent years up to and including 2030, equivalent to the expected 
useful life of the intangible asset. the expected future net cash flows are determined based on 
budgets and business plans approved by management board.  from 2031 onwards, a perpetual 
cash flow decreasing by the terminal growth rate of -50% is used. the pre-tax discount rate 
applied to the cash flow projections was 13 %. the analysis showed a need of an impairment of 
dkk 12.7 million regarding the v-go intellectual property. the amount is recognized as sales 
and marketing expenses in the income statement.
due to the full impairment of the v-go related intellectual property, no additional sensitivity 
analysis is performed.

note 13 – intangible assets
 accounting policies
separately acquired licenses, rights and patents are initially measured at cost. licenses, rights 
and patents acquired in connection with the purchase of a legal entity where substantially all 
of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset are considered an 
asset acquisition and initially recognized at cost at the acquisition date. the cost accumulation 
model has been applied for accounting for contingent considerations, whereby all further con-
sideration is added when incurred, to the cost of the asset initially recorded.
the acquired intangibles have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less 
accumulated amortizations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life and 
impairment losses.  the amortization periods are as follows:
• license, rights and patents: based on lifetime of patent etc.
• intellectual property: 10 years
• physician relationsship: 8 years
amortizations will recognized in the income statement as r&d expenses when the intangibles 
are available for use based on the determined useful life. useful lifetime is assessed continuous-
ly for all new acquried assets.
if circumstances or changes in zealand's operations indicate that the carrying amount of the 
intangibles may not be recoverable, management will review the intangibles for impairment. 
refer to note 12.
at december 31, 2020, licenses, rights and patents comprise a right that will be included in a 
future development project originating from the acquisition of encycle therapeutics in october 
2019 and the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of valertias activities.
the right has been measured based on the overall cost of the transaction less the fair value of 
the cash balance and trade payables also acquired. the fair value of the contingent consider-
ations related to encycle therapeutics was assessed to be zero as per the acquisition date due 
to zealand applying the cost accumulation model for accounting for contingent considera-
tions, whereby all further consideration is added when incurred, to the cost of the asset initially 
recorded.
physician relationships and ip rights acquired through business combinations are measured 
at fair value at the acquisition date and amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life 8 
and 10 years respectively (unless the asset has an indefinite useful life, in which case it is not 
amortized).

note 14 – property, plant and equipment
 accounting policies
plant and machinery, other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment and leasehold improve-
ments are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation.
cost comprises acquisition price and costs directly related to acquisition until the time when 
the group starts using the asset.
tangible assets under construction are recorded as work in progress until construction has 
been completed and use of asset commenced.
the basis for depreciation is cost less estimated residual value at the end of the useful life. as-
sets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets. 
the depreciation periods are as follows:
• buildings 5-13 years
• plant and machinery 5-10 years
• other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3-5 years
gains and losses arising from disposal of plant and equipment are stated as the difference 
between the selling price less the costs of disposal and the carrying amount of the asset at the 
time of the disposal. gains and losses are recognized in the income statement under research 
and development expenses, sale and marketing expenses and administrative expenses.
at the end of each reporting period, the group reviews the carrying amount of property, plant 
and equipment as well as non-current asset investments to determine whether there is an 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if 
any). if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. if 
a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, assets are also allocated to 
cash-generating units, or allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
no impairments to property. plant and equipment have been recognized for 2020, 2019 and 
2018.

note 15 – right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
 accounting policies
the group leases an office buildings, equipment and vehicles. the rental contract for the hq 
office building has been made for a minimum period of 13 years (terminable by the landlord 
after 15 years). management has assessed the lease period to be 13 years. the rental contract 
for the us office site has been made for a minimum period of 16 years. equipment and vehicles 
are leased over a period of 3-4 years with no extension option.
contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. the group allocates the con-
sideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components according to the specific 
pricing of the services in the agreements.
lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms 
and conditions. the lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security 
interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.
until the 2018 financial year, all leases were classified as operating leases, but are from january 
1, 2019 recognized as a right-and-use asset and corresponding liability at the date at which the 
asset is available for use by zealand. ifrs 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on 
the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a pe-
riod of time in exchange for consideration. zealand applies the definition of a lease and related 
guidance set out in ifrs 16 to all contracts entered into or changed on or after january 1, 2019.
assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. lease 
liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:
• fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable
• variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index 
or rate as at the commencement date 
lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in 
the measurement of the liability. 
short-term and low value leases are also recognized as right-of-use assets.
the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. if that rate 
cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, the group’s 
incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the group would have to pay to borrow 
the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
the group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an in-
dex or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. when adjustments 
to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and 
adjusted against the right-of-use asset. 
lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. the finance cost is charged 
to the income statement over the lease period to ensure a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: 
• the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability 
• any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received 
• any initial direct costs and restoration costs.
right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the 
lease term on a straight-line basis. if the group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase 
option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.

 accounting policies
raw materials, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realizable value. cost is determined on a first in, first out basis and comprises direct materials, 
direct labor and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter 
being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. costs of purchased inventory are 
determined after deducting rebates and discounts. net realizable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimat-
ed costs necessary to make the sale. 
inventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capitalised but 
immediately provided for, until there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. 
a write-down is made against inventory, and the cost is recognised in the income statement as 
research and development costs. once there is a high probability of regulatory approval being 
obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.
we review our inventory for excess or obsolescence and write down inventory that has no 
alternative uses to its net realizable. economic conditions, customer demand and changes in 
purchasing and distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory. as circumstances war-
rant, we record provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory and lower of cost 
or net realizable value inventory adjustments. in some instances, these adjustments can have 
a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period. in order to determine 
such adjustments, we evaluate the age, inventory turns, future sales forecasts and the estimated 
fair value of inventory.

note 18 – trade receivables
 accounting policies
on initial recognition, receivables are measured at fair value. the group holds the trade receiv-
ables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them 
subsequently at amortized cost. 
trade receivables are written down for expected credit losses. the group applies the simplified 
approach in ifrs 9 to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss 
allowance for trade receivables and contract assets. a write-down is recognized in sales and 
marketing expenses.
there are no material overdue receivables and the write-down for expected credit losses is not 
material.
at december 31, 2020 and 2019, zealand had no trade receivables related to milestone pay-
ments.
note 19 – prepaid expenses
 accounting policies
prepaid expenses comprise amounts paid in respect of goods or services to be received in 
subsequent financial periods. clinical trials, which are outsourced to clinical research organ-
izations (“cros”), take several years to complete. as such, management is required to make 
estimates based on the progress and costs incurred to-date for the ongoing trials. judgements 
are made in determining the amount of costs to be expensed during the period, or recognized 
as prepayments or accruals on the statement of financial position. 
other receivables are measured at amortized cost less impairment. prepayments include ex-
penditures related to future financial  periods and are measured at nominal value
the increase by dkk 17.5 million from 2019 (dkk 30.8 million) to 2020 (dkk 48.3 million) is 
primarily related to an increase in prepaid insurance, taken as a result of higher insurance costs 
because of the increased premiums required for director & officer insurance.

note 17 – other investments
 accounting policies
other investments are measured on initial recognition at cost, and subsequently at fair value. 
changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement under financial items.
the group’s other investments consist of a usd 5.4 million (2019: usd 5.3 million) investment 
in beta bionics, inc., the developer of ilet™, a fully integrated dual-hormone pump (bionic 
pancreas) for autonomous diabetes care. the investment in beta bionics, inc. is recorded at fair 
value through profit and loss. this investment represents 1.6% (2019:1.6%) ownership of beta 
bionics, inc., and is recorded at a fair value of dkk 32.3 million as of december 31, 2020 (dkk 
35.6 million as of december 31, 2019).
in determining fair value, zealand considered the impact of any recent share capital issuances 
by beta bionics as an indicator of the fair value of the shares. in particular, beta bionics under-
took a capital offering in june 2019 and subsequent infliction points was used as the basis for 
determining fair value. measurement is considered a level 3 measurement. 
a fair value adjustment of dkk 0.1 million and currency conversion impact of dkk -3.3 million, 
respectively, have been recognized in financial income in 2020 (2019: dkk 2.2 million and dkk 
0.8 million respectively).

ual agreements. unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is 
uncertain. where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. 
please refer to note 1 and note 2 for further information on sales rebates and provisions and 
managements estimates and judgements. 
zealand pharma issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. where there 
is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can other-
wise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is recorded. the provision is measured 
at gross sales value.
 accounting policies
provisions are recognized when the company has an existing legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of events occurring prior to or on the balance sheet date, and it is probable that the uti-
lization of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. provisions are measured 
at management’s best estimate of the expenses required to settle the obligation.

note 28 – financial risks
the objective of zealand’s financial management policy is to reduce the group’s sensitivity 
to fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates, credit rating and liquidity. zealand’s financial 
management policy has been endorsed by zealand’s audit committee and ultimately approved 
by zealand’s board of directors.
zealand is exposed to various financial risks, including foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate 
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
capital structure
zealand aims to have an adequate capital structure in relation to the underlying operating 
results and research and development projects, so that it is always possible to provide sufficient 
capital to support operations and long-term growth targets.
the board of directors finds that the current capital and share structure is appropriate for the 
shareholders and the group.
exchange rate risk
most of zealand’s financial transactions are in dkk, usd and eur.
due to denmark’s long-standing fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the eur, zealand has 
evaluated that there is no material transaction exposure or exchange rate risk regarding trans-
actions in eur.
zealand’s milestone payments have been agreed in foreign currencies, namely usd and eur. 
however, as milestone payments are unpredictable in terms of timing, the payments are not 
included in the basic exchange rate risk evaluation.
currency exposure regarding our us activities are managed by having revenue and expenses in 
the same currency.
as zealand conducts clinical trials and toxicology studies around the world, zealand will be 
exposed to exchange rate risks associated with the denominated currency, which is primarily 
usd based on volume and fluctuations against dkk. to date, zealand’s policy has been to man-
age the transaction and translation risk associated with the usd passively, placing the revenue 
received from milestone payments in usd in a usd account for future payment of zealand’s 
expenses denominated in usd, covering payments for the next 12-24 months and thus match-
ing zealand’s assets with its liabilities.
as of december 31, 2020, zealand holds dkk 568.4 million (2019: dkk 306.7 million) of its cash 
in usd.
note 26 – other liabilities
 accounting policies
financial liabilities are recognized initially at cost less transaction costs. in subsequent periods, 
financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost corresponding to the capitalized value using 
the effective interest method.

note 27 – contingent assets, liabilities and other contractual obligations
contingent assets include potential future milestone payments. contingent liabilities and other 
contractual obligations include contractual obligations related to agreements with contract 
research organizations (cros), milestone payments and lease commitments.
 accounting policies
contingent assets and liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of an inflow or outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits is virtually certain.
contingent assets
at december 31, 2020, zealand is still eligible for a payment from sanofi of up to usd 15.0 mil-
lion, of which dkk 5.0 million is expected in 2021 and dkk 10.0 million in 2022. however, it is 
management’s opinion that the amount of any payment cannot be determined on a sufficiently 
reliable basis, and therefore have not recognized an asset in the statement of financial position 
of the group.
contingent liabilities and contractual obligations
at december 31, 2020, total contractual obligations related to agreements with cros amount-
ed to dkk 252.6 million (dkk 198.1 million for 2021 and dkk 54.5 million for the years 2022 up 
to and including 2024).
zealand may be required to pay future development, regulatory and commercial milestones 
related to the acquisition of encycle therapeutics. refer to note 13.

interest rate risk
zealand has a policy of avoiding financial instruments that expose the group to any unwanted 
financial risks. as of december 31, 2020, zealand only has lesae liabilities as interest bearing 
debt amounting to dkk 130.1 million. up until the redemption in september 2018, zealand had 
a fixed rate royalty bond.
during 2020, all cash has been held in current bank accounts in usd, eur and dkk. interest 
rates on bank deposits in dkk and eur have been negative since 2018, while usd accounts 
have generated a low level of interest income.
during 2020 and 2019, zealand has invested in low risk marketable securities. the group’s mar-
ketable securities portfolio comprises bonds in danish kroner. the average weighted duration 
of the bond portfolio on the statement of financial position date was 3 years in both years.
credit risk
zealand is exposed to credit risk in respect of receivables, bank balances and bonds. the max-
imum credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount. management believes that credit risk is 
limited, as the counterparties to the trade receivables are large global pharmaceutical compa-
nies and wholesalers.
cash and bonds are not deemed to be subject to credit risk, as the counterparties are banks 
with investment-grade ratings (i.e. bbb- or higher from standard & poor’s).
liquidity risk
the purpose of zealand’s cash management is to ensure that the group has sufficient and 
flexible financial resources at its disposal at all times.
zealand’s short-term liquidity is managed and monitored by means of the company’s quarter-
ly budget revisions to balance the demand for liquidity and maximize the company’s interest 
income by matching its free cash in fixed-rate, fixed-term bank deposits and bonds with its 
expected future cash burn.

a breakdown of the group’s aggregate liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities is given 
below.
the following table details the group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities 
with agreed repayment periods. the table has been prepared using the undiscounted cash 
flows for financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to 
pay. the table includes both interest and principal cash flows. to the extent that the specific 
timing of interest or principal flows is dependent on future events, the table has been prepared 
based on management’s best estimate of such timing at the end of the reporting period. the 
contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the group may be required to pay.
with the exception of leasing, there are no interest cash-flows to be included in the table below

note 28 – financial risks (continued) 
capital management
zealand’s goal is to maintain a strong capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence, and a continuous advancement of zealand’s product pipeline and business in 
general. zealand is primarily financed through capital increases and partnership collaboration 
income and had, as of december 31, 2020, a cash position of dkk 960.2 million (2019: 1,081.1 
million). the cash position supports the advancement of our product pipeline and operations.
the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including progress in our 
research and development programs, the magnitude of those programs, our commitments 
to existing and new clinical collaborators, our ability to establish commercial and licensing 
arrangements, our capital expenditures, market developments, and any future acquisitions. ac-
cordingly, we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through 
equity or debt financings, collaborative agreements with partners, or from other sources.
the board of directors monitors the share and capital structure to ensure that zealand’s capital 
resources support the strategic goals. there was no change in the group’s approach to capital 
management procedures in 2020.
neither zealand pharma a/s nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital 
requirements.

note 29 – business combinations
accounting policy
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. at the 
date of the acquisition, the company initially recognizes the fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business.
the consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and the excess 
of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets of the business 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. in circumstances where the consideration transferred is less 
than the fair value of net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recog-
nized directly in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase.
where the settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the 
future are discounted to their present value. contingent consideration is classified either as eq-
uity or a financial liability and is recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. amounts clas-
sified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value in accordance with ifrs 9 
(financial instruments), with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive loss as an administrative expense.
business combinations require management making an assessment of the fair value of the 
net assets acquired as well as an assessment regarding whether control exists. management 
judgement is particularly involved in the recognition and measurement of the following items at 
fair value:
•  intellectual property: this may include patents, licenses, trademarks and similar rights for 
currently marketed products, and also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with 
projects that are currently in research or development phases, and requires the projection 
of estimated future cash inflows and outflows and relevant risks, the terminal value of these 
assets, discount rates and weighted average costs of capital,
• working capital items such as trade receivables, inventory (raw materials, work in process, 
parts and finished goods), prepaid expenses, trade payables, and fixed assets
• guarantees, warranties, indemnities, rights, claims, counterclaims etc. set off against third 
parties relating to the acquired assets or assumed liabilities, including rights under vendors’ 
and manufacturers’ warranties, indemnities, guaranties and avoidance claims and causes of 
action under any applicable law, employee liabilities and other contingencies
in all cases, management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance 
of the items concerned, and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these 
items. in making these assessments, management relies to a significant extent on the work of 
valuation experts. however, the assessments are highly subjective and sensitive to the assump-
tions used.
in accordance with ifrs 3, if a business combination indicates a bargain gain all applied as-
sumptions will be reassessed by management before recognition.
directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred within the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive loss.
customer relationships and ip rights acquired through business combinations are measured 
at fair value at the acquisition date and amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life 8 
and 10 years respectively (unless the asset has an indefinite useful life, in which case it is not 
amortized).
acquisition of medical technology business from valeritas, inc.
on april 2, 2020 (or “the acquisition date”) zealand acquired substantially all of the medical 
technology business from valeritas holdings, inc. (or “valeritas”) pursuant to the terms of the 
stalking horse asset purchase agreement previously entered into with valeritas and following 
approval by the u.s. bankruptcy court for the district of delaware on march 20, 2020.
valeritas was a u.s. based commercial-stage company whose activities comprised develop-
ment, production and sale of wearable disposable insulin pumps and has therefore been ac-
quired to accelerate zealand’s plans for establishing u.s. operations to support the anticipated 
launch of the auto-injector and pre-filled syringe for severe hypoglycemia.
the acquisition comprises all medical technology business related tangible and intangible 
assets that pursuant to the bankruptcy code was transferred to zealand free and clear of all 
claims, liabilities and encumbrances including the valeritas workforce. additionally, the acquisi-
tion includes most of the working capital assets and selected liabilities.
under ifrs 3, business combinations, the acquisition has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. the consolidated financial statements include the 
results of valeritas for the from the acquisition date.
the consideration transferred was dkk 167.7 million (usd 24.5 million), and the fair values of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities of valeritas as at the date of acquisition were:

the fair value attributable to intangible assets (dkk 82.2 million as of the acquisition date) 
consists of the value arising from the existing valeritas physician network and relationships, 
valued at dkk 68.5 million which is based on the estimated cost it would require to establish 
similar network and relationships, or a so-called with/without valuation method, and intel-
lectual property related to the v-go technology, valued at dkk 13.7 million using an excess 
earnings model. (subsequently impaired. refer to note 12) the valuations is calculated using 
cash flow projections from financial budget approved by corporate management covering a 
10 year period. the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 13%. the growth rate 
used to extrapolate the cash flows of the unit beyond the 10 year period is -50% which reflects 
note 29 – business combinations (continued)
our estimate of the expected lifetime of the product of 10 years with a significant decrease in 
revenues afterwards.
the calculation of the fair value of intangible assets is most sensitive to the revenue and gross 
margin growths.revenue and gross margin: revenue and gross margin are based on historical 
trends. the revenue growth applied in the calculation is between 1-20% in the 10-year budget 
period with the first years having the highest revenue growth in percentage.operating costs: 
operating costs are based on historical trends and industry knowledge. operating costs over 
the 10-year budget period has been adjusted to incorporate the allocation related to shared 
efforts of future product launches.
trade receivables have been measured at the contractual amount expected to be received 
which approximates the fair value of dkk 50.6 million. the amounts have not been discounted, 
as maturity on receivables is generally very short and the discounted effect therefore immate-
rial.
the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of dkk 36.7 million which was recognized 
within other operating income in the consolidated income statement. the gain arose as the 
fair value of the net assets acquired (dkk 204.4 million) exceeded the fair value of the purchase 
consideration (dkk 167.7 million). the gain is primarily attributable to the company purchasing 
the medical technology business of valeritas out of bankruptcy. valeritas encountered opera-
tional and financial difficulties in late 2019 and filed for bankruptcy in february 2020.specifically, 
the fair value of the tangible and financial assets acquired (dkk 147.5 million), such as invento-
ries, trade receivables, and property, plant and equipment, represents a significant component 
of the purchase price prior to consideration of the fair value of the identified intangible assets.
acquisition-related costs of dkk 7.1 million have been expensed and are included in adminis-
trative expenses in profit or loss and are part of operating cash flows in the statement of cash 
flows have all been incurred in the three months period ended march 31, 2020.adjustments 
may be applied to the various net asset categories when full alignment to zealand accounting 
policies is finalized. consequently, adjustments may be applied for a period of up to twelve 
months from the acquisition date in accordance with ifrs 3.
the valeritas business acquisition has contributed with net revenues of approximately dkk 
161.3 million in net revenue and profit and loss of approximately dkk -278.8 million to the 
group for the period ending december 31, 2020 since the acquisition on april 2, 2020.
if the acquisition had occurred on 1 january 2020, the consolidated pro forma revenue and 
operating result of zealand pharma group for the period ended 31 december 2020 would have 
been approximately dkk 395.8 million and dkk -868.9 million, respectively.

contractual maturity (liquidity risk)
a breakdown of the company’s aggregate liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities is given 
below.
the following table details the company’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabil-
ities with agreed repayment periods. the table has been prepared using the undiscounted cash 
flows for financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which the company can be required 
to pay. the table includes both interest and principal cash flows. to the extent that the specific 
timing of interest or principal flows is dependent on future events, the table has been prepared 
based on management’s best estimate of such timing at the end of the reporting period. the 
contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the company may be required to 
pay.
there are no interest cash-flows to be included in the table below for the existing financial 
liabilities as they are not interest-bearing financial liabilities.

free cash flow
free cash flow is calculated as the sum of cash flows from operating activities less purchase of 
property, plant and equipment. a positive free cash flow shows that the group is able to finance 
its activities and that external financing or capital raises is thus not necessary for the group’s 
operating activities. therefore, executive management believes that this non-ifrs liquidity 
measure provides useful information to investors in addition to the most directly comparable 
ifrs financial measure “net cash flow from operating activities.” the table below shows a rec-

report on the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and parent company financial 
statements
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company financial statements 
of zealand pharma a/s for the financial year january 
1 – december 31, 2020, which comprise income 
statement, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of financial position, statement of changes 
in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including 
accounting policies, for the group and the parent 
company. the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as issued by the international 
accounting standards board (iasb) and as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
group and the parent company at december 31, 
2020 and of the results of the group's and the parent 
company's operations and cash flows for the finan-
cial year january 1 – december 31, 2020 in accord-
ance with international financial reporting standards 
as issued by the international accounting standards 
board (iasb) and as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements of the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our long-form au-
dit report to the audit committee and the board of 
directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with inter-
national standards on auditing (isas) and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. our responsi-
bilities under those standards and requirements are 
further described in the "auditor's responsibilities for 
the audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements" (hereinafter 
collectively referred to as "the financial statements") 
section of our report. we believe that the audit evi-
dence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with 
the international ethics standards board for account-
ants' code of ethics for professional accountants 
(iesba code) and additional requirements applicable 
in denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these rules and 
requirements. 
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided 
any prohibited non-audit services as described in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no. 537/2014.
appointment of auditor
we were initially appointed as auditor of zealand 
pharma a/s on april 2, 2020 for the financial year 
2020.

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our pro-
fessional judgement, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements for the financial year 
2020. these matters were addressed during our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole and in forming 
our opinion thereon. we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. for each matter below, our 
description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the 
"auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements" section, including in relation to the key 
audit matters below. accordingly, our audit includ-
ed the design and performance of procedures to 
respond to our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements. the results 
of our audit procedures, including the procedures 
performed to address the matters below, provide the 
basis for our audit opinion on the financial state-
ments.
valeritas business combination and bargain 
purchase gain
as disclosed in note 29 to the consolidated financial 
statements, on april 2, 2020, zealand pharma a/s 
acquired substantially all the medical technology 
business from valeritas holding, inc. a u.s. based 
commercial-stage company. the consideration 
transferred was dkk 167.7 million. the acquisition, 
which was accounted for as a business combina-
tion, resulted in a bargain purchase gain of dkk 36.7 
million.
the company has accounted for the valeritas 
business combination by applying the acquisition 
method of accounting, including the recognition and 
measurement of the identified assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition-date fair values 
and the recognition of the gain from the bargain 
purchase. 
purchase price allocation is complex and bargain 
purchases are uncommon in nature. auditing this 
matter required the involvement of valuation spe-
cialists due to the highly judgmental nature of the 
initial and reassessed fair value assumptions. these 
fair value assumptions included prospective financial 
information relating to revenue and gross margin 
growth and operating expense assumptions used 
in the fair value measurement process of intangible 
assets in the form of the v-go technology and phy-
sician network and relationships. these assumptions 
have a significant effect on the bargain purchase. 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
we obtained an understanding of the processes for 
accounting for business combinations and evaluated 
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls relating to the measurement and valuation 
of the identified assets acquired and liabilities as-
sumed. for example, we tested controls over man-
agement’s use of external valuation specialists, man-
agement’s review of the purchase price allocation, 
management’s reassessment of the purchase price 
allocation, the revenue and gross margin growth and 
operating expense assumptions and related prospec-
tive financial information. 
to test the purchase price allocation, our audit 
procedures included, among others, evaluating 
the methodology used, the significant prospective 
financial information used in the initial fair value 
assumptions and reassessed fair value assumptions 
of the v-go technology and physician network and 
relationships, and the underlying data used by the 
company. we compared the assumptions used by 
management to historical trends and market partic-
ipant expectations. for example, we evaluated man-
agement’s methodology for determining revenue and 
gross margin growth and operating expense assump-
tions compared to relevant publicly available market 
data, including market participant expectations, and 
methodology for reassessment of the purchase price 
allocation. we involved valuation specialists to assist 
with our procedures.
to evaluate the fair value of acquired intangible 
assets, we compared the initial fair value assump-
tions and reassessed fair value assumptions applied 
with publicly available market data and assessed any 
entity-specific adjustments that were applied. we 
also tested the completeness and accuracy of the 
underlying data, including the market data provided 
by management’s external valuation specialists.
accounting for rebates and discounts related to 
the company’s sales in the united states
as disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated finan-
cial statements revenue from products sold by the 
company in the united states (u.s.) is impacted by 
estimates related to managed care rebates, medicare 
part d rebates, and co-pay card redemption.
the estimates for managed care rebates, medicare 
part d rebates, and co-pay card redemption and 
related provisions are recognised as a reduction to 
gross sales in the period in which the underlying sales 
are recognised. as of december 31, 2020, the provi-
sions for sales discounts and rebates amounts to dkk

36.4 million, as disclosed in note 25 in the consoli-
dated financial statements. 
auditing managed care rebates and medicare part 
d rebates, and co-pay card redemption and related 
provisions is complex due to the judgmental nature 
of management’s estimates, which involves multi-
ple assumptions, as not all conditions are known at 
the time of sale. for both managed care rebates and 
the medicare part d rebates, the key assumptions 
relate to the rebate percentages by each pharmacy 
as determined in each pharmacy's contract with the 
company and forecasted number of prescriptions 
that will be filled by each pharmacy (referred to as 
payor mix). for co-pay card redemptions, the key 
assumptions relate to expected settlement rates for 
sales units remaining in the channel that have yet to 
be presented under co-pay terms. these assump-
tions are made based on historical actuals, which are 
used to estimate forecasted trends, including payor 
mix and settlement rates, which are used to estimate 
the expected settlement of managed care rebates 
and medicare part d rebates, and co-pay card re-
demption, and the specific terms in the individual 
agreements.
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
we gained and obtained an understanding of the 
company’s processes for accounting for managed 
care rebates, medicare part d rebates, and co-pay 
card redemptions related to sales in the u.s. including 
the methods for which management developed their 
assumptions used in the estimates, such as rebate 
percentages and payor mix for both managed care 
rebates and the medicare part d rebates and expect-
ed settlement rate for sales units remaining in the 
channel that have yet to be presented under co-pay 
terms for co-pay card redemptions.
we obtained management’s calculation of provisions 
for managed care rebates, medicare part d rebates, 
and co-pay card redemptions and assessed the 
assumptions applied by management and compared 
them to applicable commercial policies, historical 
experience and the specific terms in the individu-
al agreements. we further examined subsequent 
settlement obligations to assess completeness and 
accuracy of the recorded provisions. we performed 
an independent assessment on the key assumptions 
of the provisions as of december 31, 2020, including 
the payor mix and expected settlement rates, and 
compared these to the actual provisions recognised. 
in addition, we have assessed the adequacy of the 
company’s disclosures on rebates and discounts 
related to the matter described above.
statement on the management's review
management is responsible for the management's 
review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the management's review, and we do not ex-
press any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read the manage-
ment's review and, in doing so, consider whether the 
management's review is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the audit, or otherwise appears to be material-
ly misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether 
the management's review provides the information 
required under the danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that the management's review is in accordance with 
the financial statements and has been prepared in ac-
cordance with the requirements of the danish finan-
cial statements act. we did not identify any material 
misstatement of the management's review. 
management's responsibilities for the financial 
statements
management is responsible for the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements and parent compa-
ny financial statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with international financial report-
ing standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements of the danish financial statements 
act and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the group's and the parent 
company's ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of ac-
counting in preparing the financial statements unless 
management either intends to liquidate the group or 
the parent company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.

auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
as to whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report 
that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggre-
gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
the financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with 
isas and additional requirements applicable in den-
mark, we exercise professional judgement and main-
tain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we 
also:
• identify and assess the risks of material misstate-
ment of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrep-
resentations or the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control rele-
vant to the audit in order to design audit proce-
dures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the group's and the parent com-
pany's internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting pol-
icies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by man-
agement.
• conclude on the appropriateness of management's 
use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the group's and 
the parent company's ability to continue as a going 
concern. if we conclude that a material uncertain-
ty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor's report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are in-
adequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor's report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group and the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
contents of the financial statements, including the 
note disclosures, and whether the financial state-
ments represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-
garding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with govern-
ance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in in-
ternal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consol-
idated financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in our auditor's report unless law or regula-
tion precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation 
as part of our audit of the financial statements of 
zealand pharma a/s we performed procedures to 
express an opinion on whether the annual report for 
the financial year january 1 – december 31, 2020 
with the file name [name of file] is prepared, in all 
122
zealand pharma ∞ annual report 2020
material respects, in compliance with the commis-
sion delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the 
european single electronic format (esef regulation) 
which includes requirements related to the prepara-
tion of the annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial statements. 
management is responsible for preparing an annual 
report that complies with the esef regulation. this 
responsibility includes: 
the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format; 
the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl 
tags, including extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, 
for financial information required to be tagged using 
judgement where necessary; 
ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and 
the consolidated financial statements presented in 
human readable format; and 
for such internal control as management determines 
necessary to enable the preparation of an annual 
report that is compliant with the esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance 
on whether the annual report is prepared, in all mate-
rial respects, in compliance with the esef regulation 
based on the evidence we have obtained, and to 
issue a report that includes our opinion. the nature, 
timing and extent of procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material departures from the require-
ments set out in the esef regulation, whether due to 
fraud or error. the procedures include: 
testing whether the annual report is prepared in 
xhtml format; 
obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl 
tagging process and of internal control over the tag-
ging process; 
evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of 
the consolidated financial statements; 
evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use 
of ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxono-
my and the creation of extension elements where 
no suitable element in the esef taxonomy has been 
identified; 
evaluating the use of anchoring of extension ele-
ments to elements in the esef taxonomy; and 
reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited 
consolidated financial statements. 
in our opinion, the annual report for the financial year 
january 1 – december 31, 2020 with the file name 
549300itbb1ulbl4cz12-2020-12-31_en.zip is pre-
pared, in all material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation.
