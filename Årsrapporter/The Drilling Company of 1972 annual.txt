our stakeholders
2020 was an unprecedented and unpredictable 
year for the world and even more so in the oil 
and gas industry. the covid-19 pandemic spread 
rapidly across the globe causing lockdowns and 
other quarantine measures. the health crisis for our 
industry meant a dramatic fall in the demand for oil 
and gas and was exacerbated by the opec fall-out 
which early in the year led to an oil price crash. 
2020 has taken its toll on the entire industry, 
though the worst could now seem to be behind 
us. for maersk drilling, several contracts were 
terminated or postponed, rigs were stacked, 
and measures were taken to protect the 
company, including unfortunate, yet unavoidable 
redundancy rounds. 
our ceo will say it as well, but i wish to take a 
moment to say a heartfelt thank you and express 
my gratitude to our entire organisation. on- and 
offshore – you have all done an outstanding job!
for other offshore drillers, the consequences have 
been more severe with significant competitors 
filing for bankruptcy protection and others facing 
severe liquidity constraints. 
despite the current hardship, we see clear 
signs that the circumstances could become the 
opening to a more profound and much needed 
transformation of the drilling industry. there 
is a need to achieve significant operational and 
financial efficiency gains which combined with 
the need to redefine the future role of offshore 
drilling in society in relation to the un sustainable 
development goals, sets the scene for a new 
industry landscape. 
in maersk drilling, we want to take an active 
role in this transformation. in the autumn, we 
launched a new sustainability strategy with 
climate action as the centrepiece, addressing the 
need for decarbonisation of current activities as 
well as exploring new technologies to reduce co2 
emissions. we have made significant progress to 
fulfil our ambition to make maersk drilling a more 
sustainable and profitable company in the future, 
helping the world harness the many benefits of 
affordable energy and oil- and gas-based products.
we are only at the very beginning of an exciting 
future but with a business model relying on 
sustainability, resource and time efficiency, digital 
solutions and sharing benefits with our customers 
we have a solid foundation. in many ways, the 
business model is a natural continuation of our 
current strategy relying on skilled people and 
a modern fleet being able to meet the highest 
standards in the most challenging parts of the 
offshore drilling markets.
after a challenging 2020, the world economy is 
on track to recover, recharging the world’s need 
for energy and stimulating the demand pipeline in 
our key markets. while the commercial landscape 
is beginning to stabilise, the market continues 
to be volatile and this calls for a fundamental 
transformation of the oil and gas industry. maersk 
drilling is determined to take a winning position in 
tomorrow’s energy market.

jørn madsen
ceo
as the chairman also expressed, the dramatic 
developments in the oil and gas sector in 2020 
exposed our industry to challenges unlike 
anything we have seen before. faced with a 
global pandemic and a sudden and sharp decline 
in oil price, operators reacted swiftly by cutting 
near-term investments in exploration and project 
development. drilling contracts were postponed or 
terminated and stacking locations soon started to 
be filled with idle rigs.
this only exacerbated the deep-rooted challenges 
of the global offshore drilling industry. for some 
time, profitability levels have been depressed with 
too much capacity chasing the available projects 
and an abundance of older rigs unable to meet 
modern standards. 
in an environment with volatile oil prices, 
building future-proof portfolios is vital for our 
customers to remain competitive. to further 
ensure resilience and improve competitiveness 
of their portfolios, we expect our customers to 
accelerate the adoption of technology and new 
commercial and collaborative models. this will 
require the ecosystem of suppliers – including 
offshore drilling contractors – to radically 
simplify processes and interfaces, lower costs 
and emissions, and reduce uncertainty, leading to 
increased speed and quality of the entire system.
maersk drilling is well-positioned to address all 
these challenges. based on our heritage in the 
challenging north sea market, we are leading the 
way in exploring new business models to convert 
closer collaboration into increased efficiency and 
value-creation for our customers, partners and 
owners. we are addressing the drilling industry’s 
role in the green transition in our ambitious 
sustainability strategy and industry-leading 
emissions reduction target. and we continue to 
enjoy a financially solid position which enables 
us to fund the investments in innovation that 
are necessary to facilitate our response to the 
fundamental challenges found in our industry.
given the challenging business environment in 
2020, i am pleased that we in maersk drilling 
delivered an ebitda before special items of  
usd 289m, in line with the revised financial 
guidance that we provided in may 2020, and that 
we still managed to generate a positive free cash 
flow. i am immensely proud that our operations, 
during these extraordinary times, maintained 
a high level of safety and quality with the best 
safety performance in years, a financial uptime of 
nearly 100%, and continued satisfied customers.
this is first and foremost the result of our crews' 
relentless efforts to deliver operational excellence, 
despite the many obstacles placed by the 
pandemic. under such conditions, it is a significant 
challenge to run a global service business like 
maersk drilling with high dependency on crew 
changes and international travel and transactions. 
but thanks to the determination, ingenuity and 
unwavering commitment of our people, we have 
achieved remarkable performance levels under 
extraordinary circumstances. we, as management, 
applaud the efforts of our people and we are 
quite certain that they have not gone unnoticed by 
neither our customers nor our shareholders.
our drive to offer the foremost innovation 
capabilities in the industry also served us well 
in 2020, producing several tangible results. our 
first fully retrofitted low-emission rig went into 
operation in the fourth quarter and demonstrated 
carbon emission reductions in the range of 25%. 
we have also explored the opportunities offered 
by longer-term energy transition, announcing our 
participation in project greensand, which aims 
to offer carbon capture and storage beneath the 
danish north sea. and we continued to invest in 
digital solutions to support the vital coordination 
between rig company, operator, and service 
suppliers, targeting significant efficiency gains.
initiatives like these underpin our strong customer 
relations and allow us to forge long-term 
alliances in support of the increased focus on 
efficiency, digitalisation and close collaboration. 
combined with our newly announced sustainability 
ambitions, this provides us with a powerful 
platform to deliver customer value and lead the 
way to a more sustainable and profitable future 
for the offshore drilling industry.

289 
ebitda before special items 2020 (usd million) 
(26% margin)
the financial performance in 2020 was substantially 
impacted by the outbreak of covid-19 and the oil 
price turmoil in the first half of the year leading to 
contract terminations and budget revisions by oil 
and gas companies. maersk drilling responded by 
reducing costs through staff reductions, stacking  
of rigs and adjusting maintenance programmes to 
the revised activity levels. 
ebitda before special items amounted to usd 289m 
(usd 415m), in line with the latest guidance of ebitda 
before special items in the range of usd 275–300m.

launching a new  
 
sustainability strategy 
in 2020 maersk drilling established a new sustainability 
strategy based on three strategic pillars: sustainable energy 
future, caring for people and responsible business.
as part of the oil and gas value chain, maersk 
drilling seeks to do business in a responsible 
and sustainable manner, acting with integrity 
and high standards of business ethics. to stay 
at the forefront, we continuously develop 
our approach to anticipate and respond to 
changing requirements in our environment.
in 2020, we concluded a comprehensive 
sustainability strategy project, which reassessed 
the main priorities for our future sustainability 
work. based on a thorough stakeholder analysis 
and materiality assessment, the work identified 
nine of the un sustainable development goals 
(sdgs) where the maersk drilling business has, 
or could have, major impact. it also assessed 
which of the sustainability topic areas were 
already well addressed and which areas needed 
special attention to close gaps or address 
opportunities. 
 
the conclusions of the strategic work are 
depicted in our sustainability framework, 
which applies our focus across three 
strategic pillars, relates our priority areas 
to the relevant sdgs and outlines the 
company’s strategic sustainability initiatives. 
opportunities for improvement were identified 
within climate action and diversity & 
inclusion, and specific targets and action plans 
have been launched for these topic areas.
sustainability is integrated into our 
performance scorecard. we measure 
progress and results through a combination 
of qualitative and quantitative measures, 
resulting in a corporate performance score 
which directs the collective bonus element of 
executive and staff remuneration.
maersk drilling’s sustainability approach 
is described in further details on our 
website and in our sustainability report 
which also serves as our reporting 
pursuant to section 99a of the danish 
financial statements act. it can be found 
online at https://www.maerskdrilling.com/

north sea jack-ups
revenue in the north sea segment of usd 608m in 2020 (usd 800m) was negatively impacted 
by lower utilisation partly offset by a higher average day rate. financial uptime remained high 
at 99.8% in 2020 (99.6%). 
the average day rate of usd 208k in 2020 (usd 193k) was positively impacted by performance 
bonuses for drilling ahead of schedule and additional revenue received for covid-19 related 
costs being recharged to customers. excluding the impact from covid-19 related recharges 
and lump sum termination fees received, the average day rate was usd 200k (usd 193k).
ebitda before special items amounted to usd 264m (usd 385m), reflecting the lower activity 
levels. the ebitda margin for the north sea jack-up segment remained relatively high at 43% 
(48%), supported by cost reductions. 
international floaters
revenue in the international floater segment of usd 460m in 2020 (usd 395m) increased 
compared to 2019 primarily due to better average day rates and a higher activity level, 
reflected in more contracted days.  as available days also increased due to fewer yardstays, 
utilisation was in line with 2019. 
the financial uptime for the year reached 97.9% (97.1%) supported by strong operational 
performance throughout the covid-19 pandemic but negatively impacted by unscheduled 
maintenance down-time.
the average day rate increased to usd 239k (usd 220k) due to the startup of longer-term 
contracts and additional revenue received for covid-19 related costs being recharged to 
customers. excluding the impact from covid-19 related recharges and lump sum termination 
fees received, the average day rate was usd 224k (usd 220k). 
ebitda before special items amounted to usd 18m (usd 28m), reflecting the low day 
rates prevailing in this segment as well as reactivation costs for several previously stacked 
deepwater units which commenced contracts during 2020. the ebitda margin for the 
international floater segment remained at a depressed level at 4% (7%).

backlog
despite challenging market conditions, maersk 
drilling managed to secure 19 new contracts and 
contract extensions during 2020, adding usd 469m  
(usd 828m) to the contract backlog. 
at the end of 2020, the contract backlog 
amounted to usd 1.3bn (usd 2.1bn), of which  
usd 665m is for execution in 2021. in addition, 
maersk drilling has since the beginning of 2021 
secured additional contracts and conditional 
letters of award with a total value of more than 
usd 500m.
supported by the recovery of the oil and gas 
prices and based on bilateral customer dialogues, 
maersk drilling expects the demand pipeline in its 
key markets to further build in 2021, partly due to 
projects originally scheduled for execution in 2020 
being postponed to 2021.
details on current and future contract status for 
the rig fleet is provided in the fleet status report

outlook 
 
for 2021
for 2021, we expect profit before depreciation and 
amortisation, impairment losses/reversals and 
special items (ebitda before special items) in the 
range of usd 225m–275m.
capital expenditures are expected to be in the 
range of usd 120m–140m.
the profitability guidance for 2021 is partly 
secured through the current contract backlog. 
achieving the higher end of the 2021 guidance 
range requires that additional contracts 
are secured within both the north sea and 
international divisions.
the capital expenditures guidance is linked to the 
assumed commercial activity providing certain 
flexibility in total spend and timing.
sensitivity guidance
our guidance for 2021 is subject to risks and 
uncertainties as various factors, many of which 
are beyond maersk drilling’s control, may cause 
the actual development and results to differ 
materially from expectations. ebitda before 
special items is primarily sensitive to the level 
of contracting of additional days to the current 
backlog, especially in the high margin north 
sea segment, and the day rates thereon. capital 
expenditures are sensitive to final scheduling  and 
scoping of rig upgrades and yard stays,  which are 
subject to commercial and  operational planning.
the table below lists two additional sensitivities, 
all else being equal.

market 
market development in 2020
in 2020, measures to contain the spread of 
covid-19 led to an unprecedented decline in 
demand for oil and gas. lockdown measures in 
countries reduced the use of cars and public 
transport, which in combination with widespread 
passenger flight cancellations, resulted in lower 
demand for transportation fuels, and thereby oil. 
at the same time, the intervention by opec+ 
member states was insufficient to balance the 
market. after initially responding to the demand 
shock by increasing their production, saudi arabia 
and other large producers agreed on historic 
production cuts, but these were insufficient to 
offset the decline in oil and gas demand. 
as a result, brent oil prices dropped from pre-
covid levels of usd 50–70 to usd 20–40 per 
barrel. since then, brent oil prices have stabilised 
nonetheless, many oil and gas companies took 
swift measures to manage liquidity in the first  
half of 2020: maintaining capital discipline and, in 
the case of several operators, reducing dividends 
for the first time. capital expenditure budgets were 
reduced, and consequently many exploration and 
development projects were postponed, offshore 
rig tenders were cancelled, and existing drilling 
contracts were suspended or terminated – resulting 
in reduced demand for offshore drilling rigs.
 
during 2020, the number of jack-up rigs under 
contract in the north sea declined from 28 at the 
beginning of the year to 21 at the end of the year. 
during the same period, the total supply of jack-up 
rigs in the north sea was nearly unchanged, only 
marginally declining from 41 to 40 units, and similarly 
the marketed supply declined marginally from 38 
to 37 units. the marketed utilisation declined from 
73% to 57% during the year. at the end of 2020, the 
at levels around usd 40–50 per barrel, and in 
december 2020 brent prices climbed above usd 
50 per barrel, the highest level since march 2020¹.
 
in 2020, operators were better positioned to 
weather a sharp drop in oil prices than they 
were during the previous crisis in 2014–15. 
the corporate ‘breakeven price’ – the oil price 
required to generate cash flow to cover capital 
expenditures and dividends – of the large oil and 
gas companies has fallen significantly since 2014, 
providing a degree of resilience in their asset 
portfolios amid lower oil and gas prices. this trend 
has been reinforced by capital discipline, as well 
as ongoing transformations that operators have 
enacted since the previous downcycle, achieving 
structural cost deflation through simplification, 
standardisation and optimisation, and for some 
operators new partnering models with their 
suppliers.
one-year forward coverage in the north sea jack-up 
market was 34% (at the end of 2019: 37%).
 
during 2020, the number of floaters under contract 
globally declined from 126 at the beginning of the 
year to 102 at the end of the year. during the same 
period, the total supply of floaters was reduced from 
235 to 212 units. the marketed supply was reduced 
from 194 to 173, insufficient to offset the impact of 
lower demand, and the marketed utilisation declined 
from 65% to 59% during the year. at the end of 
2020, the one-year forward coverage in the global 
floater market was 37% (at the end of 2019: 41%).
during the year, the decline in utilisation and 
forward coverage exerted pressure on day rates 
across most segments, though the market for 
high-specification harsh environment rigs proved 
more resilient with a healthier demand and supply 
balance and only limited impact on day rates.

in the unprecedented 2020 market, maersk drilling's strong 
financial position stood out from its peers. the demand in 
key markets is expected to grow in 2021 and beyond. the 
long-term energy transition towards low-carbon energy will 
drive efficiency, use of new technologies, repositioning and 
alternative use of offshore drilling rigs.

industry structure  
and supply-side dynamics
the combination of lower utilisation and day rates 
adversely impacted earnings and cash flows in 
2020 for most offshore drillers at a time when 
many offshore drillers were already struggling 
with high debt burdens and liquidity constraints.
it was within this market context that several 
offshore drillers in 2020 commenced proceedings 
to restructure their balance sheets and resolve 
their liquidity situations. in contrast to its 
distressed peers, maersk drilling continued to 
stand out with a robust balance sheet and strong 
liquidity position, enabling it to withstand the 
impact of the current downturn.
 
among industry analysts there is a widely held 
belief that industry consolidation is needed to 
drive the necessary rationalisation of the supply 
side. there are numerous potential opportunities 
in the context of the broad restructuring currently 
underway in the offshore drilling sector – from 
traditional corporate and asset m&a transactions, 
to asset joint ventures and rig management 
and operating partnerships. the screening of 
opportunities continues to be based on an 
assessment of the attractiveness of the different 
market segments combined with maersk drilling’s 
relative competitive strengths.
short-term and  
long-term demand outlook
supported by the recovery of the oil and gas prices 
and bilateral customer dialogues, maersk drilling 
expects the demand pipeline in its key markets 
to further build in 2021, partly due to projects 
originally scheduled for execution in 2020 being 
postponed to 2021.
in the norwegian jack-up market, there 
are currently a few short duration drilling 
campaigns with commencement in 2021, and 
a few programmes with longer duration with 
commencement in early 2022. maersk drilling has 
seen certain projects maturing in 2020 following 
the tax relief scheme introduced during the 
summer. in 2021, more approvals for shallow water 
assets are expected, which will drive demand for 
jack-up rigs in the following years.
 
in the north sea jack-up market outside of norway, 
several new rig requirements have come to the 
market with commencement in 2021 with contract 
durations ranging from one-well to multi-year. 
in the international floater market, requirements 
are building in africa, latin america and south 
east asia, with contract durations ranging from 
one well to multi-year.
the future capital expenditures targeted for 
offshore, and thereby the future actual demand 
for offshore drilling rigs, are subject to several 
factors, particularly developments in the global 
oil and gas markets. the demand for oil and gas 
is dependent on public health, the impact of 
vaccines, and the policy responses to covid-19 
and the supply side of the oil and gas markets 
will depend on the associated policy responses of 
opec+ and the influence of us shale. 
given the recent years of underinvestment in 
new oil and gas developments, there is also 
potential for short-term dramatic moves, such 
as price spikes in the oil and gas markets, which 
may encourage additional investments and drive 
demand for offshore drilling rigs.

energy transition
the ongoing and accelerating energy transition 
from hydrocarbons to renewables poses a 
challenge to the oil and gas sector: oil and gas will 
continue to play a critical role over the coming 
decades to maintain and further develop the 
global economy and meet the needs of a growing 
global population while the push to drastically 
reduce emissions, particularly those resulting 
from the combustion of hydrocarbons, is placing 
structural pressures on oil and gas demand. given 
this degree of uncertainty, there are a range of 
demand scenarios that could develop over the 
next 20 years, two of which (from the iea) are 
depicted below.
although the energy transition will likely play 
out over the course of decades, the increased 
uncertainty around the transition impacts the 
energy markets on a much shorter time scale than 
the transition itself. 
capital allocation towards oil and gas depends 
on investors’ beliefs about returns and risk; 
oil and gas companies must make decisions 
regarding growth vs. deleveraging vs. dividends, 
renewables vs. hydrocarbons, and short- vs. long-
cycle investments. uncertainties associated with 
the transition have already altered the business 
strategies of some operators invested in offshore 
oil and gas projects. this dynamic is further 
emphasized by an increased push for ‘green’, esg-
related considerations by institutional investors, 
who have increasingly advanced this agenda. 
 
in this context, several oil and gas companies 
have already announced transition plans as they 
prepare for the shift to low-carbon energy and 
have implemented company-wide reorganisations 
to position themselves for the energy transition. 
while some operators may have accelerated 
the shift away from fossil fuels, low-cost and 
low-emission barrels are still needed to fund the 
change in global energy mix according to the main iea scenarios

transition. oil and gas companies will thus look 
to service companies, including offshore drillers, 
which truly embrace technology and lean ways 
of working, and which are open to exploring new 
operating and partnering models; all in an effort 
to reduce costs and emissions associated with 
the extraction of hydrocarbons. the oil and gas 
companies with the highest quality and most 
resilient portfolios of lowest cost and lowest 
emissions per barrel of oil equivalents will be the 
ones best positioned for the energy transition. 
maersk drilling’s strategy of smarter drilling for 
better value supports this customer need for 
building future-proof portfolios. 
further, the energy transition also brings with 
it a mosaic of solutions beyond renewables. 
hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are 
examples of such solutions which will likely play 
a role in transforming and decarbonising the 
interconnected energy system. both of these 
could offer alternative uses of offshore drilling 
rigs beyond the traditional drilling operations and 
are areas where maersk drilling can leverage its 
capabilities.
the stated policies scenario includes today’s policy intentions and targets, and illustrates the potential results of
policy-makers. the sustainable development scenario charts a path aligned with the paris agreement, holding the rise  
in global temperatures to “well below 2°c”. source: iea world energy outlook 2020

strategy
it is a goal of maersk drilling to generate 
superior returns to its shareholders. to achieve 
this, maersk drilling’s strategy is anchored on 
three pillars: smarter drilling for better value, 
responsible drilling and applying our capabilities 
and innovation capabilities to selected energy 
transition opportunities.
smarter drilling for better value
a key challenge for maersk drilling’s customers is 
the significant inefficiencies caused by misaligned 
incentives between the various third-party 
suppliers involved in a drilling campaign. maersk 
drilling aims to take on an expanded role in 
order to establish better planning, execution and 
orchestration across the value chain, with the 
overarching objective of creating better outcomes 
for its customers enabling them to maintain and 
build resilient and future-proof portfolios of 
assets in a volatile price environment. 
our alliance with aker bp, which dates back to 
2017, demonstrated our early commitment to 
this strategy. more recently, our contract with 
omv (norge) as supports the increased focus 
of our customers on this approach. our drilling 
on the valhall flank west presented on page 21 
quantifies the results for this specific project and 
is a testimony to the potential of smarter drilling 
for better value.
we have transformed our company to support this 
strategic ambition, centralised functions in our 
new location in gdansk, realigned management 
reporting lines and set up a dedicated innovation 
group.  we are now taking this a step further by 
redefining our customer engagement model and 
digitalising key components of our service delivery, 
in collaboration with our customers. one example 
of this is our drilling process platform, presented 
on page 22.

responsible drilling
in addition to the time and cost efficiency gains, 
maersk drilling’s value proposition of providing 
safe, reliable, and efficient offshore driller 
services also addresses the greenhouse gas (ghg) 
emissions related to drilling campaigns. maersk 
drilling is at the forefront of working with oil and 
gas companies in achieving their goal of improving 
offshore project economics and lowering ghg 
emissions. we have committed to reducing our 
co2 emissions by 50% by 2030. the emissions-
reduction target is in line with most oil and 
gas companies’ 2030 targets and supports the 
ambitions of the paris agreement. 
the reduction target will place maersk drilling as 
a leader among drilling contractors, the ambition 
goes perfectly together with our focus on reducing 
time of drilling operations per well. maersk 
drilling estimates that about half of the target 
can be achieved via further efficiency gains and 
known technical solutions and concepts, while 
the other half will be facilitated by investments in 
innovation in this space.
in 2020, maersk drilling installed two emission 
packages on its harsh environment jack-up rigs, 
maersk intrepid and maersk integrator rigs working 
in the north sea. maersk drilling’s first low-emission 
rig shows very promising emission reduction levels 
after entering operations in norway. 
the full technology package was expected to 
deliver a double-digit energy savings potential, 
and this has now been confirmed on maersk 
intrepid where the first month of operations on 
martin linge produced an initial data point of 
reducing fuel consumption and co2 emissions 
by approximately 25% compared to the baseline 
average for the rig. in addition, nox emissions were 
reduced by approximately 95%, an improvement 
from the original target of 90%. the installation 
of low-emission technology is one of several 
initiatives that support maersk drilling’s efforts 
to reach the company’s co2 emissions target. 
other initiatives relating to co2 reductions include 
operating rigs on shore power and participation 
in the project greensand consortium which is 
targeting the use of discontinued oil and gas fields 
for permanent storage of co2 offshore denmark.
 
energy transition
there are numerous potential opportunities in 
the energy transition space that are adjacent 
to maersk drilling technology, operational 
capabilities and commercial portfolio. we 
have dedicated resources to exploring those 
opportunities within our innovation team and are 
actively exploring opportunities with customers 
and partners. 
our participation in project greensand, which 
aims to store co2 beneath the danish north sea, 
is presented on page 23 and is one concrete 
illustration of our support to addressing the 
climate challenges our customers and the industry 
at large are seeking to solve.
working strategically  
with climate scenarios
maersk drilling’s strategic work 
encompasses the short-, mid-, and long-
term opportunities and risks relating to 
current and potential new markets. the 
climate-related aspects are an inherent 
part of this work, setting boundaries for 
the growth of our core drilling activities. 
these activities are closely related to the 
future prospects of the global oil and 
gas markets which we analyse closely 
using climate and energy scenarios from 
iea and leading private energy data 
providers.
strong climate action opens up for 
market share gains by maersk drilling, if 
we can offer superior climate solutions 
that help customers meet emissions 
targets in the short- and mid-term. 
it also creates opportunities for new 
revenue streams for the mid- and long-
term. our carbon storage activities in 
the north sea are an example of the 
latter, and maersk drilling is exploring 
a multitude of long-term strategic 
options to leverage the unique assets 
and competencies of the company both 
within and beyond the current offshore 
markets.

the drilling programme on valhall flank west was 
completed in june 2020. over the course of 11 
months, maersk invincible set 12 conductors, drilled 
nine wells and drilled 22,000 metres of reservoir.
“the jack-up rig alliance between aker bp, maersk 
drilling and halliburton has delivered world-
class performance. we’re demonstrating that 
the strategy of creating increased value through 
alliances yields results,” confirms aker bp’s svp 
drilling and wells tommy sigmundstad.
maersk invincible arrived on the valhall field in 
late june 2019. after the 12 large conductors 
were set, the rig drilled an average of one well 
per month. a total of nine wells were drilled and 
completed. three of these were multibranch wells. 
“this would not have been possible without a 
strong alliance team capable of bringing out 
the very best efforts in each other. compared 
with a comparable campaign completed 
outside the alliance, we see an improvement of 
88% in average rate of penetration and 186% 
improvement in connection times. congratulations 
go out to everyone involved,” says sigmundstad.
first alliance project for the rig
the drilling programme on valhall flank west was 
the first project delivered through the alliance and 
maersk invincible.
“it all started with batch setting 12 conductors, 
where we had a fantastic learning curve and 
ended up 15 days ahead of our estimated time 
consumption. this learning curve has simply 
continued to grow. we’ve had some challenges, 
but they were resolved in a very good way because 
the whole team has pulled in the same direction. 
now, as we look ahead, it’s important that we 
capture the lessons learned, so the alliance can 
continue to deliver good projects,” says drilling 
superintendent anders linndal.
the completion of the conductor campaign 15 days 
ahead of time amounted to a 36% time saving 
compared to the original estimate. maersk drilling’s 
calculations have shown that this also meant that the 
operation was completed with a 36% co2 emissions 
reduction compared to the rig’s baseline average.
2,278 metres in one day
in february 2020, maersk invincible set a new 
record on the norwegian shelf when it drilled 
2,278 metres in a 12¼” section in 24 hours. the 
maximum drilling speed achieved by the rig on the 
record-breaking day was 280 metres per hour.
“i want to thank the entire drilling and subsurface 
team offshore and on land. we achieved this 
milestone because we’re constantly improving all 
parts of our performances. behind this record lies 
a lot of hard work, fantastic craftsmanship and 
a strong team throughout the entire operation,” 
says assistant drilling superintendent knut eugen 
svendsen at aker bp.
“we push the envelope because we constantly 
manage to tackle bottlenecks together, as an 
alliance team,” says tor kvinnesland, rig manager 
on maersk invincible.
maersk invincible also held the previous drilling 
record in aker bp, with 1,953 metres drilled in a 
single day. that record was also set on a well on 
valhall flank west.
world-class drilling 
 
on valhall flank west
“the jack-up rig alliance between aker bp, maersk drilling 
and halliburton has delivered world-class performance. 
we’re demonstrating that the strategy of creating 
increased value through alliances yields results.”

process platform
by digitalising maersk drilling’s core business of well 
construction operations while establishing digital 
integration towards oil companies, the drilling 
process platform introduces a whole new way  
of working in drilling operations.
the drilling process platform (dpp) is a digital solution 
to be part of maersk drilling´s future operating model 
driving efficient well construction execution.
dpp will integrate in the oil company’s well 
programme and digitalises the information flow of 
well construction activities on a rig enabling maersk 
drilling, the service companies and the oil company to 
perform as one team with consistency, efficiency and 
transparent operations.
dpp consumes digital instructions, replacing mails and 
printed copies and enabling instant changes to plans, 
all with a smart distribution of information. it enables a 
joint accessible real-time plan of the well construction 
activities both by onshore teams and rig crew, providing 
situational awareness and better coordination.
faster and more efficient drilling operations directly 
translates into emissions reduction, making dpp a key 
part of maersk drilling’s sustainability journey.
driving faster and more predicable well construction 
operations, whilst establishing better operational 
insight makes dpp a key enabler for performance  
based contracts.

storage in depleted oil wells 
far below the earth’s surface.
ccs can capture the co2 emissions 
from e.g. powerplants, heavy 
industry and refineries.
the emissions are 
transported in liquid form 
for port bunkering.
from the port the emissions 
are transported by vessels to 
depleted oil wells for storage.
in addition to decarbonising drilling activities, 
it will be important to apply carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (ccus) and hereby prevent 
co2 from entering the atmosphere.
the iea sustainable development scenario expects 
increased investment and rapid growth in ccus. 
the annual capacity is expected to increase from 
33 million tonnes co2 per year today to 850 million 
tonnes co2 in 2030 and 5,000 million tonnes co2 in 
2050. for comparison, total global co2 emissions 
were around 30,000 million tonnes in 2020.
during 2020, maersk drilling joined ineos oil & 
gas denmark and wintershall dea in the project 
greensand consortium, which is maturing one of 
the most advanced carbon capture and storage 
(ccs) projects inside danish jurisdiction. project 
greensand targets the development of co2 storage 
capacity beneath the danish north sea by re-using 
discontinued oil and gas fields for permanent  
co2 storage. 
the project has received support from the  
energy technology development and demonstration 
program (eudp) via the danish energy agency 
and entered the validation phase in 2020, 
including successful feasibility studies for the 
chosen reservoir’s compatibility for co2 injection. 
laboratory experiments and results analysis were 
conducted by the project’s research partner, the 
geological survey of denmark and greenland 
(geus), and the external verifier dnv gl has issued 
a certificate of feasibility for the reservoir. 
the target is to have the first well ready for 
injection from the nini platform offshore denmark 
in 2025. longer-term, the goal is to develop the 
capacity to store approximately 3.5 million tonnes 
co2 per year by 2030. ccs is one of the four pillars 
of the green research strategy announced by the 
danish government in september 2020.
storage in depleted offshore reservoirs is a 
relatively new concept and involves challenges, 
particularly in terms of ensuring cost- and 
carbon-efficient transportation of the co2 from 
shore to the injection site. however, employing 
ccs in offshore reservoirs also has significant 
advantages since the geological structures are 
well understood, existing infrastructure can be 
utilised, and the injection sites are situated far 
away from populated areas.
supporting other carbon-negative technologies
in 2020, maersk drilling began cooperation with the california-based company clean energy systems to facilitate 
carbon-neutral drilling. the technology is based on using biomass waste as fuel to produce syngas, from which 
renewable natural gas and hydrogen are separated for sale. the net-negative carbon emissions are sold as credits, 
and maersk drilling will eventually be able to offer these as part of a carbon-neutral drilling proposal to customers.

organisation 
 
 
and people
maersk drilling has a global footprint with offices 
on four continents supporting our 22 drilling rigs.
during 2020 maersk drilling’s offshore and 
onshore organisations averaged 2,678 employees 
of 59 different nationalities with 1,917 working 
offshore and 761 working onshore. at the 
end of the year, maersk drilling had 2,383 
employees, which is a reduction of around 450 
employees since the end of 2019. the reduction 
is a consequence of the lower activity level 
following the outbreak of covid-19 and the oil 
price fluctuations in the first half of the year 
partly offset by the insourcing of certain support 
functions. 
we want to uphold a supportive and productive 
working environment where all of our people 
are valued for their contributions, accepted for 
who they are, and can develop a meaningful 
career in a trusted environment that is free from 
discrimination – regardless of gender, nationality, 
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic 
background, or disability.
in an industry facing transformation, it is imperative 
to attract, develop and retain the best talent 
effectively. maersk drilling is actively focusing on 
tapping into a wider diverse talent pool to meet 
challenges and generate sustainable value.
in 2020, maersk drilling developed a dedicated 
diversity & inclusion plan with targets and 
initiatives to make significant progress within a 
time-frame of three years. 
as the cornerstone of this plan, maersk drilling 
is tackling the industry-specific challenge of 
under-representation of women. we are pursuing 
a significant leap forward on gender diversity to 
increase female representation in all onshore 
leadership levels through a target of 30% across 
leadership levels, 25% for senior leaders and 20% for 
the executive leadership team by end-year 2023.
in 2020, maersk drilling saw a slight improvement 
in diversity performance and with the new strategic 
focus, these developments will be accelerated. our 
share of female employees increased from 13% in 
2019 to 14% in 2020. onshore, women represent 
40% of our workforce. female leaders made up 
25% of our onshore leadership in 2020 compared 
to 23% in 2019. offshore, women only make up 
2% of the workforce. in 2020, we appointed our 
second female rig manager in the history of the 
company.

organisational set-up and delivery model
following the appointment of christine morris as 
chief financial officer, maersk drilling’s executive 
leadership team consists of jørn madsen (chief 
executive officer), christine morris (chief financial 
officer), morten kelstrup (chief operating officer) 
and nikolaj svane (chief strategy & people 
officer).
maersk drilling is further organised in a divisional 
structure with a north sea division, comprising the 
harsh environment jack-up rigs capable of working 
in the most challenging environments in the 
north sea, including the ultra-harsh norwegian 
environments, and an international division, 
comprising all drillships and semi-submersible rigs 
designed to operate in benign mid- and deepwater 
environments. the head of each division reports to 
the chief operating officer.
during 2020, maersk drilling continued to 
strengthen its global business solutions function 
and successfully insourced all operational finance 
functions into its central office in gdansk, poland, 
which also provides supply chain management and 
hr services to the global organisation.
the current market environment with a high 
number of short-term contracts requires 
agility and flexibility from all maersk drilling 
departments as the teams are working within 
short time frames in ever changing environments. 
maersk drilling is therefore exploring the concept 
of virtual rig teams.
in order to deliver the best possible services 
to customers, a small core team is co-located  
alongside the customer with a support team 
working out of one of maersk drilling's permanent 
locations – a virtual rig team.
the virtual rig team pilot is setting a strong 
foundation for future rig operations, as the lessons 
learned will be used to establish a concrete model 
for future work in the virtual set-up.
the impact of covid-19
maersk drilling is accustomed to operating in an 
industry which is cyclical by nature. the covid-19 
pandemic combined with substantial oil price 
fluctuations caused some customers to either 
cancel ongoing contracts or postpone future 
contracts. as a consequence, it was necessary 
to reduce the number of employees. prior to 
the decision, multiple options were explored, 
including re-deployment, early retirement and a 
hiring freeze but these measures were deemed 
insufficient given the magnitude of the downturn. 
the total workforce was reduced by around 30%, 
but the number of employees offshore has since 
increased again due to the pickup in activity levels 
towards the end of the year.

target to reach in 2030
as part of the new sustainability strategy 
launched in 2020, maersk drilling established 
a climate action plan comprising the drilling 
industry’s most ambitious emissions reduction 
target. by 2030, maersk drilling will have reduced 
its relative scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions by 50% 
compared to 2019, which is the baseline year. we 
are actively staying abreast of developments and 
technological advancements to ensure that our 
target can be met as effectively as possible. the 
target will be measured on ghg emissions relative 
to revenue, contracted days and drilled meters.
at the onset of the strategy implementation, 
maersk drilling expects that around half of 
the needed savings can be achieved via known 
solutions. the other half will be achieved 
by deploying new technologies or existing 
technologies that are not yet commercially viable.  
carbon offsets, e.g. via investments in carbon-
saving projects, may be applied to achieve any 
residual savings.

financial policy  
 
 
and capital 
 
allocation
the overall objective of the financial policy is 
to enable maersk drilling to manage through 
the cyclicality that characterises the offshore 
drilling industry, with the aim to create long-term 
shareholder value.
the financial policy ensures:
•  financial flexibility, including adequate liquidity 
reserves;
•  a long-term funding view to minimise 
refinancing risk; and
•  a robust capital structure through the business 
cycle.
in order to meet these objectives, free cash 
flow is to be allocated based on the following 
prioritisation:
1.  maintain a robust capital structure with 
sufficient funding available to support the 
business through the cycle;
2.  pursue investment opportunities supporting 
long-term shareholder value creation; and
3.  return surplus capital to shareholders.
maersk drilling will generally work towards a 
leverage ratio (net debt divided by ebitda before 
special items) of around 2.5x.
this means that if the leverage ratio is below 
2.5x over time, and no attractive investment 
opportunities have been identified, maersk drilling   
will seek to return capital to shareholders by 
means of dividends and/or share buy-backs.
if value adding investment opportunities that 
require additional funding arise, or if ebitda is 
reduced in a business down cycle, the leverage 
may exceed the target level of around 2.5x for a 
period of time. the focus here will be to reduce 
net debt to reach the targeted leverage level of 
around 2.5x.
as of 31 december 2020, the leverage ratio was 
3.7x. in line with the principles set out above, 
maersk drilling will not propose any dividends 
based on the 2020 annual report.
until the annual general meeting in 2024, the 
board of directors is authorised to acquire 
treasury shares of up to 10% of the share capital 
provided that the purchase price does not deviate 
by more than 10% from the price quoted on 
nasdaq copenhagen at the time of the acquisition.

performance  
in 2020
the sharp drop in oil prices in q1 2020, caused by 
covid-19 and opec+ actions, drove reductions 
in spending budgets by upstream oil and 
gas companies, postponement of projects, 
cancellation of tenders and suspensions and 
terminations of contracts. 
for maersk drilling, drilling contracts for maersk 
venturer, mærsk developer, maersk reacher, 
maersk resilient, mærsk innovator and maersk 
guardian were terminated for convenience and 
drilling contracts for maersk voyager in angola 
and namibia and mærsk deliverer in australia  
were suspended from end april and into 
september. apart from the termination for 
maersk venturer, maersk drilling has received 
compensation in the form of lump sum payments 
or reduced day rates for the remainder of the 
original contract periods leading to a limited 
ebitda impact from the terminations.
despite challenging market conditions, maersk 
drilling managed to secure 19 contracts and 
contract extensions during 2020 adding usd 469m 
(usd 828m) to the contract backlog. 
at the end of 2020, the contract backlog amounted 
to usd 1.3bn (usd 2.1bn), of which usd 665m is 
for execution in 2021. in addition, maersk drilling 
has since the beginning of 2021 secured additional 
contracts and conditional letters of award with a 
total value of more than usd 500m.
in close cooperation with customers, maersk drilling 
has since march 2020 implemented a number of 
measures to reduce the risk of transmission of 
covid-19. generally, the organisation has managed 
to navigate the increased complexity related to 
crew changes, supply chain and logistics and has 
thereby kept operations largely unaffected. 
the number of contracted days decreased to 
5,208 (6,310) resulting in a utilisation of 65% 
(77%) mainly due to the north sea segment being 
negatively impacted by contract terminations and 
more idle rigs. 
 
substantial incremental costs were incurred 
due to covid-19, and such costs are generally 
recharged to customers. covid-19 related costs 
not recharged to customers amounted to  
usd 18m, which are presented under special  
items due to their one-off nature. 
to adapt the cost structure to the changed 
business environment, maersk drilling took 
precautionary measures in the form of stacking 
of rigs and adjusting maintenance programmes to 
the revised activity levels. 
maersk drilling also took steps to adapt the 
offshore crew pool to the lower activity in the 
offshore drilling market. further, the need for 
onshore support was also adversely impacted by 
the reduced offshore activity and maersk drilling 
has therefore reduced its onshore organisation in 
the danish headquarters and offices globally by 
around 150 positions. 
for 2020, ebitda before special items amounted 
to usd 289m (usd 415m), in line with the latest 
guidance of ebitda before special items in the 
range of usd 275–300m.
capital expenditures of usd 162m was in line with 
the most recent guidance of around usd 150m 
but a substantial reduction over last year  
(usd 309m). capital expenditures in 2020 
comprised three special periodic surveys (sps), 
rig upgrades linked to contracts and general 
maintenance of the fleet. 
income statement
revenue
revenue for 2020 was usd 1,096m compared to 
usd 1,222m in 2019, negatively impacted by lower 
utilisation, especially in the north sea segment 
as a result of contract terminations and general 
lower activity levels. this was partly offset by 
additional compensation for covid-19 related 
costs and termination fees.
the other share of total revenues increased to 
usd 155m from usd 123m in 2019, equal to 14% 
(10%) driven mainly by additional compensation 
for crew overtime due to covid-19 as well as 
further delivery of additional services and 
increased performance-based revenue.
the average day rate was usd 210k in 2020 
compared to usd 194k in 2019. excluding lump 
sum termination fees and additional other revenue 
for covid-19 related costs, the average day rate 
was usd 200k.
costs
despite cost reduction measures initiated, operating 
costs increased to usd 725m from usd 710m 
in 2019 primarily due to reactivation costs for 
previously stacked rigs, which were reactivated to 
commence contracts during the first half of 2020. 
incremental costs related to covid-19 amounted 
to usd 40m, of which usd 22m are to be 
reimbursed. the residual costs of usd 18m are 
presented under special items due to their non-
recurring nature and operating costs thus include 
usd 22m of covid-19 related costs. 
sales, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) 
decreased to usd 76m compared to usd 87m 
in 2019 due to general cost saving initiatives. 
similarly, innovation costs decreased from  
usd 10m in 2019 to usd 6m in 2020.

ebitda before special items amounted to  
usd 289m (usd 415m) resulting in an ebitda 
margin of 26% (34%).
special items
special items of usd 42m (usd 16m) comprised 
redundancy costs from the reduction of the 
offshore and the onshore organisations of  
usd 24m and covid-19 related costs not 
recharged to customers of usd 18m. 
impairment losses/reversals
following the revised market outlook with lower 
expectations as to utilisation and day rates for the 
coming years, maersk drilling initially recognised 
a net impairment loss of usd 1,476m in its interim 
financial report as of and for the six months ended 
30 june 2020. the impairment calculations have 
been updated as of 31 december 2020 due to 
changes in fiscal regimes in certain markets and 
to reflect the most current expected commercial 
outlook resulting in a further impairment loss of 
usd 104m bringing the total impairment loss for the 
year to usd 1,580m. potential impairment reversals 
of usd 82m have not been recognised as not arising 
from a substantially improved market outlook.
in 2019, a write-down of usd 34m was recognised 
in connection with the re-classification of maersk 
completer to held for sale. no further impairment 
write-downs or impairment reversals were 
recognised in 2019.
gain/loss on sale of non-current assets
the sale of maersk completer was finalised on  
7 january 2020 at a price equal to the rig’s 
carrying amount. the disposal of other minor 
assets resulted in a loss of usd 2m (gain of  
usd 8m related to the sale of mærsk giant).
financial income and expenses 
the net financial expenses increased to usd 72m 
(usd 68m) due to currency exchange movements. 
net interest expenses decreased from usd 81m 
to usd 68m. the average funding costs including 
fees were around 5% in 2020.
tax
tax for the year was an income of usd 41m 
(expense of usd 29m), impacted by a usd 42m 
deferred tax adjustment from the impairment 
charge recognised. cash tax paid during the year 
of usd 9m (usd 24m) primarily comprised income 
and withholding taxes paid in the countries in 
which maersk drilling operates, offset by joint 
taxation contributions from jointly taxed entities 
outside the maersk drilling group.
profit/loss for the year
the net loss for the year of usd 1,653m (loss of  
usd 113m) is primarily impacted by the impairment 
charge recognised.
cash flows
cash flow from operating activities
cash flow from operating activities was usd 267m 
(usd 420m), equal to a cash conversion of 108% 
(105%). 
cash flow used for investing activities
in line with expectations, cash flow used for 
investing activities decreased in 2020 to usd 150m 
(usd 303m), impacted by the proceeds from the 
disposal of maersk completer and a lower number 
of rig upgrades and yard stays in connection with 
spss for three rigs (nine rigs in 2019). 
cash flow from financing activities
cash flow from financing activities was an 
outflow of usd 204m (usd 180m), comprising 
amortisation of borrowings including lease 
liabilities of usd 137m (usd 103m), net interest 
payments of usd 62m (usd 77m) and purchase of 
treasury shares of usd 5m (nil).
free cash flow
excluding the usd 38m proceeds from the sale 
of maersk completer, the free cash flow after 
interest payments amounted to usd 17m  
(usd 32m).

our values
our five core values were far ahead 
of their time when they were 
created by the founders of the 
maersk group. today they remain 
our guiding principles, calling upon 
us to remain conscientious as we 
strive to do better. 
our five core values remain unchanged and 
have been ingrained in maersk drilling’s way of 
conducting business since its founding in 1972. 
they remain guiding principles for the work of the 
board of directors, the executive management and 
all activities in maersk drilling and translate into 
our approach to corporate governance.
governance structure
shareholders and general meeting
the governing body of maersk drilling is the 
general meeting, at which the shareholders 
exercise their rights in such matters as the election 
of board members and the external auditor, 
approval of the annual report and deciding 
on proposals submitted by the shareholders. 
except for resolutions to amend the articles of 
association, resolutions can generally be passed by 
a simple majority.
board of directors
maersk drilling has a two-tier management 
structure consisting of the board of directors and 
the executive management. the board of directors 
supervises the work of the executive management 
and is responsible for the overall strategic 
management and proper organisation of the 
group’s business and operations. the executive 
management handles the day-to-day management 
of the group. no person may serve as a member of 
both corporate bodies.
in 2020, the board of directors consisted of seven 
members elected by the general meeting and 
two members elected among the employees. 
members elected by the general meeting are 
elected for a term of one year, whereas employee 
representatives are elected for a term of four years. 
re-election of board members may take place.
the general meeting elects a chairman of the 
board of directors, and the board of directors 
elects a vice chairman among its members. 
the chairman and the vice chairman together 
constitute the chairmanship.
the board of directors held nine meetings in 2020. 
all members attended all meetings, except that 
alastair maxwell attended eight meetings.
diversity, competencies  
and board evaluation
maersk drilling strives towards diversity in the 
composition of the board of directors, including 
gender as well as nationality, international 
experience, qualifications and competencies.
maersk drilling’s overall ambition is to work 
towards having an equal gender distribution of 
the board of directors. maersk drilling’s target 
of having two female board members elected 
by the general meeting no later than 2022 was 
satisfied at the annual general meeting in 2020. 
additionally, maersk drilling’s current target is 
that at least 1/3 of the board of directors should 
be non-danish citizens.
at 31 december 2020, three shareholder-elected 
board members were female and four were male, 
while five shareholder-elected board members 
were non-danish citizens and two were danish 
citizens.

our corporate 
 
governance structure
annually, the board of directors conducts an 
evaluation of its composition considering the 
competencies needed to perform its tasks, and of the 
cooperation between the board of directors and the 
executive management. the key competencies and 
areas of experience and expertise required by the 
board of directors are currently defined as: capital 
markets, offshore oil & gas operations and industry, 
executive leadership and financial acumen, corporate 
transformations and esg, including health & safety.  
in 2020, the evaluation was facilitated by an 
external consulting firm by way of a written 
questionnaire combined with individual interviews 
with the directors of the board and the executive 
management. the evaluation included, among 
other things, the board of directors’ general 
competencies and overall effectiveness and 
value contribution, transparency and openness of 
information and discussions, cooperation with the 
executive management, the chairman’s role, the 
work and the structure of the board committees 
and a “time-spent analysis” of the board meetings. 
all members of the board of directors and 
the executive management participated in the 
evaluation and provided their detailed input via 
both the questionnaire and individual interviews, 
which formed the basis of a comprehensive 
evaluation report. the findings and conclusions 
were presented to and discussed by the board of 
directors in december 2020.
the evaluation concluded that overall, the board 
is well set to become a top performing board. 
identified key strengths include:
•  the board consists of experienced executives, 
and employee elected board members are well 
positioned to contribute meaningfully. all board 
members are highly committed, seeking to 
understand the dynamics of the business and  
to add as much value as possible; 
•  the board is particularly strong in terms of 
financial experience and has a broad and deep 
understanding of financial issues. with the 
recruitment of the two most recent board 
members, the board’s composition has improved 
with more varied experience and cognitive diversity.
in order to take the board to the next level, an action 
plan has been prepared pursuing improvements in 
2021. the board agreed on two focus areas:
•  effectiveness: increasing board effectiveness aimed 
at spending more time on strategy and discussions 
and less time on management reporting; 
•  culture: the board becoming “one team”, 
better leveraging the competences by aligning 
expectations and creating an even more 
conducive and forward leaning dialogue between 
the executive management and the board.
in 2021, the board of directors will focus on long-
term strategy development.
executive management
during 2020, the executive management consisted 
of jørn madsen as chief executive officer (ceo) 
and jesper ridder olsen as chief financial officer 
(cfo). from january 2021, christine morris 
succeeded jesper ridder olsen as cfo. 
the executive management is responsible for 
the day-to-day management and compliance 
with the procedures, instructions, guidelines and 
recommendations issued by the board of directors.
the chairmanship and the executive management 
regularly discuss the cooperation between the 
board of directors and the executive management. 
the board of directors also regularly and at least 
annually evaluates the work and performance of 
the executive management.

receive a fixed annual base fee, while the chairman 
and the vice chairman receive fixed multiples of 
the fixed annual base fee. participation in a board 
committee entitles a board member to an additional 
fixed annual fee based on a proportion of the fixed 
annual base fee. members of the board of directors 
and the board committees do not receive any 
incentive or share- based pay. fee levels are reviewed 
periodically taking into account independent 
advice (on comparisons with other large companies 
of similar size and complexity based in denmark 
and europe, supplemented by a perspective 
based on global drilling industry remuneration 
levels for industry specific expertise) and the time 
commitment required of the board members.
executive management
remuneration of the executive management 
will be decided by the board of directors based 
on recommendations from the remuneration 
committee. when determining the fixed pay of 
the executive management, the board of directors 
takes into consideration:
•  our policy generally to provide a total reward 
opportunity at around the median for similar 
positions with comparable status, responsibility 
and skills, in organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity in denmark and in europe;
•  a perspective based on global drilling industry 
remuneration levels for industry specific expertise.
the remuneration and benefits package for the 
executive management will consist of:
•  fixed pay: a fixed annual cash salary.
•  other benefits: telephone, insurance coverage, 
annual health check, newspaper subscriptions, 
training/education and similar benefits.
•  short-term incentive: a short-term cash 
incentive based on the achievement of the 
targets established for the current year.
•  long-term incentive: a share-based incentive 
scheme is offered to incentivise long-term 
performance, commitment and retention 
of the executive management, as well as to 
promote alignment of their interests with the 
shareholders. all long-term incentives must 
have a vesting or maturity period of at least 
three years from the relevant date of grant. 
the executive management will not be able to 
sell any shares vesting until the total period 
from grant is five years, i.e. an additional 
“holding period” of two years in addition to 
the three-year “vesting period”. the executive 
management is also subject to a share 
ownership requirement of twice the annual 
long-term incentive grant level applicable.

risk
 management
the objective of maersk drilling’s risk 
management is to contribute to the fulfilment 
of the company’s strategy by ensuring that risks 
are identified, assessed, reported, monitored 
and addressed in a way that is aligned with the 
business operations, objectives and risk appetite.
the processes are structured through an 
enterprise risk management (erm) framework, 
setting forth the necessary elements for having 
coordinated actions and alignment among the 
various stakeholders with regards to addressing 
the key risks. climate related risks are treated in 
the same way as all other risks and in accordance 
with the recommendations of the task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd). 
the executive management assesses risks on 
an ongoing basis to address mitigation and 
contingency planning activities. risks are reported 
to and discussed with the board of directors on a 
regular basis and top risks are reported annually 
to external stakeholders through the annual 
report. 
the 2020 risk management framework is generally 
unchanged from the prior year, but has been 
expanded to also cover tcfd requirements. during 
2019, a risk management maturity assessment 
conducted by an external party concluded that 
maersk drilling’s risk management process 
is at a “mature” level on a scale ranging from 
undeveloped, basic, intermediate, mature and 
advanced.
the most significant risks and their potential 
impact are listed on the following pages together 
with the appropriate mitigation activities.

maersk drilling and 
climate-related risks
climate-related risks are identified 
and managed in accordance 
with procedures laid down in the 
enterprise risk management 
system, in the same way as other 
risks affecting maersk drilling. in 
accordance with the framework, 
major risks are reviewed on a 
bi-annual basis. a distinction is 
made between risks with expected 
impact in the near term (12–18 
months) and emerging risks with a 
longer-term impact. 
this approach captures both 
physical risks – in the case of 
maersk drilling, the increased risk 
of severe weather impacting the 
future operations of our rigs  
– but more importantly, transition 
risks e.g in the form of emerging 
market developments, changing 
political framework conditions and 
reputational stigmatisation due to 
the climate issue.

risk description
risk mitigation
offshore drilling requires use of heavy equipment 
and exposure to hazardous conditions which carry 
inherent health and safety risks. maersk drilling’s 
operations are subject to hazards inherent 
in drilling for oil and gas, such as blow-outs, 
reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well 
control, punch through, lost or stuck drill strings, 
equipment defects, craterings, fires, explosions 
and pollution.
maersk drilling’s operations are also subject to 
hazards inherent in marine operations, such as 
capsizing, grounding, navigation errors, collision, 
oil and hazardous substance spills, extensive 
uncontrolled fires and marine life infestations.
such hazards present a potential risk to the safety 
of people, to the environment, assets, liquidity 
position and reputation.
the risks associated with operational accidents 
are mitigated through safety and maintenance 
standards, response preparedness, continuous 
training and rigorous monitoring. in addition 
to operational activity mitigations, our drilling 
contracts provide for varying levels of indemnity 
and allocation of liabilities between our customers 
and us. also, people, assets and activities remain 
comprehensively insured against personal injuries, 
physical damage and liabilities.
weather
risk description
risk mitigation
some of our drilling rigs are located in areas 
that frequently experience hurricanes and other 
forms of severe weather conditions which can 
cause damage or destruction to the drilling rigs. 
further, high winds and turbulent seas could cause 
suspension of operations, and revenue, on drilling 
rigs for significant periods of time. the increasing 
severity and frequency of severe weather and 
rising sea levels is considered a climate related risk 
for maersk drilling which is likely to exacerbate the 
weather related risk longer term.
maersk drillings jack-up rigs can potentially be 
operated with an increased safety height to cater 
for higher waves. furthermore, maersk drilling 
has shut-down, moving and down-manning 
procedures in place in case of severe weather 
conditions. additionally, in order for maersk 
drilling to ensure a high level of safety, tests of 
processes are conducted at regular intervals for 
rigs operating in risk areas.

contractual risks
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling may be subject to the risk of its 
customers seeking to terminate or renegotiate 
contracts generally or in the event of our non-
compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract.
contractual risks are addressed during the 
negotiation of new contracts or re-negotiation of 
existing contracts, where significant efforts are 
undertaken to ensure that contracts leave minimal 
opportunity for termination or that the impact 
from termination will not result in a significant 
financial loss.
environmental laws and regulations
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling’s operations are subject to a variety 
of laws, regulations and requirements in multiple 
jurisdictions controlling the discharge of various 
materials into the environment, requiring removal and 
clean-up of materials that may harm the environment, 
controlling carbon dioxide emissions, or otherwise 
relating to the protection of the environment such 
as restrictions on e&p licensing areas to protect 
sensitive marine geographies and/or to limit new oil 
& gas exploration as society transitions to a lower 
carbon economy. in general, the laws and regulations 
protecting the environment are becoming increasingly 
numerous, stringent and complex. failure to comply 
with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
or to obtain or maintain necessary environmental 
permits or approvals, or even an accidental release 
of oil or other hazardous substances in connection 
with operations, could subject maersk drilling 
to significant administrative and civil fines and 
penalties, criminal liability, remediation costs for 
natural resource damages, third-party damages 
and material adverse publicity, or may result in the 
suspension or termination of its operations.
we are committed to doing business in accordance 
with applicable regulatory standards and 
have adopted policies and procedures which 
are designed to promote legal and regulatory 
compliance.
in accordance with industry practice, maersk 
drilling’s customers typically take primary 
responsibility for any environmental pollution 
resulting from the customer’s use of the drilling 
rigs under the contracts, and maersk drilling 
typically assumes liability for pollution originating 
from its own equipment. maersk drilling has 
generally been able to obtain a certain degree of 
contractual indemnification pursuant to which our 
customers agree to hold harmless and indemnify 
maersk drilling against liability for pollution, well 
and environmental damage.
market dynamics
risk description
risk mitigation
the offshore drilling industry is highly competitive, 
and profitability is strongly impacted by 
developments in rig supply and drilling demands. 
in addition, the industry is volatile and cyclical, 
which is largely the result of changes in oil and
gas prices and their impact on exploration and 
production company expenditures. in addition, the 
long-term transition to a lower carbon economy is 
likely to impact long term offshore exploration & 
productions activity levels with the risk of longer 
periods of rig over-supply.
periods of low drilling demand and excess rig 
supply intensify competition in the industry 
and may result in rigs being idle or earning 
substantially lower day rates than the historical 
average for long periods of time. additionally, 
general contractual terms and conditions are 
under pressure during periods of low industry 
activity, potentially further reducing the 
commercial value of available rig contracts.
maersk drilling mitigates the risks associated with 
low demand through a high focus on customers 
and their requirements, a continuous strong 
operational delivery and maintaining a fleet of 
modern and technologically advanced drilling rigs. 
maersk drilling is also focused on co-developing 
new compensation and business models with 
customers, focusing on reducing waste and costs 
related to drilling a well. further, maersk drilling 
has adopted a warm stacking strategy for its fleet, 
enabling shorter time for reactivation and lower 
risks in reactivation to meet customer demands 
and keep utilisation high.
rig moves
risk description
risk mitigation
the offshore drilling market is a global market 
as rigs can relocate and operate in various 
environments. however, mobilisation of rigs 
is expensive and time-consuming and can be 
impacted by several factors, including weather and 
currents. when mobilising a rig, additional risks are 
introduced such as risk of collision, loss of tow, loss 
of stability/water tight integrity, mooring line failure 
and anchor dragging, which can cause human 
fatalities, damage to the rig or to other units.
maersk drilling mitigates the risks associated 
with rig moves through timely preparation of the 
mobilisation, which includes extensive planning 
and verification processes.

near-term funding
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling is funded   through a combination 
of shareholders’ equity and borrowings. access to 
near-term funding is not considered a major risk 
however, as society transitions to a lower carbon 
economy, funding for the oil and gas industry 
may become more scarce reducing the overall 
debt financing available for the offshore drilling 
industry.
by maintaining its position as a top tier contractor 
in the industry known for reliable, safe and 
responsible drilling with best-in-class financial 
results and robustness, maersk drilling should 
be best possibly positioned to retain its access to 
funding sources. maersk drilling’s current funding 
arrangements provides a solid capital structure 
and a high degree of financial flexibility, with 
longer term funding in place. through the strategic 
sustainability agenda, putting maersk drilling at 
the forefront of the industry, maersk drilling may 
be able to tap into funding sources which would 
otherwise not be accessible to companies within 
our industry. 
infectious diseases
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling is an international offshore drilling 
company with global operations and therefore 
exposed to the risk that a global pandemic disease 
will impact maersk drilling negatively, and with 
varied levels of impact in different countries. 
mobilising rigs, changing crews and supplying 
rigs on an ongoing basis exposes maersk drilling 
staff, subcontractors and customers to the risk 
of infection in the event of a global pandemic. if 
authorities worldwide respond by implementing 
travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard 
controls, and facility closures etc, thereby causing 
disruption to the global economy, demand for 
maersk drilling’s rigs and operations could be 
significantly impacted.
implementation of official recommendations 
during a pandemic such as social distancing, 
working from home, private jet charter for 
crew changes, testing, isolation and quarantine 
procedures etc. in combination with contractual 
terms with customers and subcontractors. in 
general, mitigations will put further emphasis 
on the use of it solutions and additional safety 
focus. during peak infection periods, suspension of 
operations may be necessary. 
agent / partner risks
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling relies on third-party suppliers to 
provide parts, crew and equipment. the reliance on 
third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service 
providers used in the drilling operations exposes 
us to the risk of these partners not adhering to 
company values and/or corporate policies and 
exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and 
availability of such items, especially where the 
number of suppliers is limited.
maersk drilling seeks to mitigate the risks 
associated with partners not adhering to company 
values and/or corporate policies through due 
diligence procedures, including termination 
clauses in contracts and assigning clear roles 
and responsibilities with partners. additionally, 
continuous monitoring of partners and education 
in our values and corporate policies mitigate these 
risks. maersk drilling also seeks to ensure that we 
have good working relationships with multiple 
suppliers to reduce the risks of over-reliance on 
single suppliers.
tax risks
risk description
risk mitigation
maersk drilling operates worldwide, which entails 
an inherent tax risk with respect to regulatory 
tax compliance, including corporate taxes, 
value added taxes and excise duties, as well as 
withholding taxes and taxes regarding specific rig 
taxation.
as tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation, 
there is a risk that these interpretations could affect 
the taxes maersk drilling pays in various jurisdictions. 
maersk drilling’s tax positions are also subject to 
audit by relevant tax authorities who may disagree 
with our interpretations or assessments of the 
effects of tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their 
applicability to our corporate structure or specific 
transactions we have undertaken.
as outlined in our tax policy, tax-related risks 
are mitigated through an upright approach, 
cooperation with the authorities in respect of 
investigations and enquiries, as well as ensuring 
that an efficient organisation of specialists with 
the necessary competencies is in place to best 
meet the requirements and tax regulations 
relevant to operations. tax exposures are assessed 
before entering new commercial contracts and 
monitored systematically on an ongoing basis and 
presented to the audit & risk committee.

equity
at 31 december 2020, equity amounted to  
usd 2,017m (usd 3,680m), impacted by the 
loss for the year of usd 1,653m (loss of  
usd 113m) and negative value adjustment 
of hedges of usd 7m (usd 21m). the loss for 
the year was primarily due to the non-cash 
impairment charge of usd 1,580m (usd 38m) 
recognised during the year. in addition, share 
buybacks of usd 5m were completed during  
the year (nil).
reserves
the reserve for hedges is the only reserve 
presented in the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity. the reserve for hedges 
represents the accumulated fair value of 
hedging instruments qualifying for cash flow 
hedge accounting, net of tax. the reserve is 
transferred to the income statement when  
the hedged transaction is settled. 
the group does not have a translation reserve 
as all material subsidiaries have the united 
states dollar (usd) as their functional currency.  
other comprehensive income
other comprehensive income consists of 
income and costs not recognised in the 
income statement, cash flow hedges as well 
as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit 
plans, etc. other comprehensive income 
includes current and deferred income tax 
to the extent that the items recognised in 
other comprehensive income are taxable or 
deductible.

basis of preparation
this annual report reflects the consolidated figures for the drilling company of 1972 a/s (the “company”) and 
its subsidiaries (the “group” or “maersk drilling”). the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and further requirements 
in the danish financial statements act.
all amounts in the annual report are stated in united states dollars (usd) and rounded to the nearest million. the 
accounting policies described have been applied consistently for the financial year and for the comparative figures.
consolidation
consolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the entities within the group. internal 
income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, balances and gains on internal transactions within the group 
are eliminated. certain entities in which maersk drilling has an ownership share of less than 100% but holds the 
full right to govern and receive dividends through shareholder agreements etc. are considered subsidiaries and 
consolidated without any non-controlling interest.
foreign currency translation
the consolidated financial statements are presented in usd, which is also the functional currency of most material 
companies within the group.
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated 
at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income 
statement as financial income or expenses.
cash flow statement
cash flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arisen from investments 
and divestments, principal payments of loans, instalments on finance lease liabilities, financial income received, 
financial expenses paid and equity transactions. capitalisation of borrowing costs are considered as non-cash items, 
and the actual payments of those are included in cash flow from financing activities.
new reporting requirements
the accounting policies described have been applied consistently for the financial year and for the comparative 
figures for 2019 and new standards and amendments effective for the financial year 2020 have not had any 
material impact on the accounting policies applied. maersk drilling expects no material impact of endorsed but not 
yet implemented amendments or interpretations of ifrs standards.
basis of preparation
management’s judgments and estimates
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make 
judgements and estimates and form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. management forms its 
judgements and estimates based on historical experience, independent advisors and external data points as 
well as in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
in certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to 
execute those plans or to settle claims that are raised against maersk drilling, is highly uncertain. therefore, 
assumptions may change or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward 
or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
the most significant accounting judgments and estimates are described in the following notes to the 
consolidated financial statements:

the allocation of business activities into segments 
is in line with the internal management reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision maker.  
the reportable segments are as follows:
north sea segment
jack-up rigs operating in depths up to 500 ft and 
comprise the aggregated operating segments 
ultra-harsh environment jack-up rigs and harsh 
environment jack-up rigs.
international segment 
semi-submersible rigs and drillships designed to 
operate in benign mid- and deepwater environments 
in depths up to 12,000 ft.
the benign jack-up rigs maersk completer, which 
was sold on 7 january 2020, and maersk convincer 
are not included in either segment and are reported 
under unallocated activities based on their different 
nature and limited materiality.
segment profit/loss (defined as profit/loss before 
depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses/
reversals and special items) comprise items directly 
related to or which can be allocated to segments. 
costs in group functions are allocated to reportable 
segments if they can be allocated to segments. 
financial assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
from these items, and tax are not attributed to 
reportable segments.
total revenue, total ebitda before special items, 
total depreciation and amortisation and total 
impairment losses/reversals reconcile directly to the 
income statement and further reconciliations are 
therefore not included.
total investment in non-current assets and total 
non-current assets comprise intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment.
quarterly revenue figures and business drivers for 
both segments are disclosed under additional 
information on page 99.

note 1.2 revenue
revenue backlog
revenue from drilling activities typically comprises fixed amounts for each day the rig is under contract 
differentiated by the activities undertaken (“day rate revenue”) and other revenue components such as lump 
sum payments for rig mobilisation and demobilisation and payments for investments in equipment or rig 
upgrades required to meet the operational needs of the drilling campaign, both of which are amortised over 
the contract period; bonuses linked to performance in terms of time, efficiency or drilling outcome measures 
such as reservoir targeting; or payments for third-party services to be delivered by maersk drilling.
for revenue, geographical information is based on geographical location where earned. for non-current assets, 
such as drilling rigs, the geographical location is where the assets were located at 31 december. for all other 
assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership.
significant customers

despite challenging market conditions, maersk drilling managed to secure 19 new contracts and contract extensions 
during 2020, adding usd 469m (usd 828m) to the contract backlog. 
at the end of 2020, the contract backlog amounted to usd 1.3bn (usd 2.1bn), of which usd 665m is for execution 
in 2021. in addition, maersk drilling has, since the beginning of 2021, secured additional contracts and conditional 
letters of award with a total value of more than usd 500m. 
supported by the recovery of the oil and gas prices and based on bilateral customer dialogues, maersk drilling 
expects the demand pipeline in its key markets to further build in 2021, partly due to projects originally scheduled 
for execution in 2020 being postponed to 2021.
details on current and future contract status for the rig fleet is provided in the fleet status report dated 12 february 
2021 and included on page 100.

remuneration of the board of directors, executive management and key employees
board of directors
the board of directors receives a fixed annual base fee, while the chairman and vice chairman receive fixed 
multiples of the fixed annual base fee. participation in a board committee entitles a member of the board of 
director to an additional fixed annual fee based on a proportion of the fixed annual base fee.
claus v. hemmingsen has received prorated board fees since 2 april 2019, as his services to the maersk drilling 
group prior to this point in time were considered part of his position as vice-ceo in a.p. møller - mærsk a/s. alastair 
maxwell, caroline alting and glenn gormsen were appointed to the board of directors on 2 april 2019. ann-christin 
g. andersen and kristin h. holth were appointed to the board of directors on 2 april 2020 at which date robert 
routs retired from the board of directors.
executive management
during 2020, the executive management consisted of jørn madsen as chief executive officer (ceo) and jesper 
ridder olsen as chief financial officer (cfo). from january 2021, christine morris succeeded jesper ridder olsen 
as cfo. the compensation of the executive management consists of a combination of fixed pay (a fixed annual 
cash salary, from which any contribution made by maersk drilling towards the cost of any pension or company 
car elections is deducted), other non-monetary benefits such as, phone, insurance coverage, annual health check, 
newspaper subscriptions, training/education and similar benefits, and short-term and long-term incentive pay. in 
addition, the executive management received in 2019 a one-time cash-based bonus related to the demerger and 
listing of the company.

short-term incentive plan for executive management.
2  in july 2020, maersk drilling announced the resignation of former cfo, jesper ridder olsen. as a consequence 
thereof, the former cfo forfeited all unvested rsus under the lti programme (which includes the grants in 2019 
and 2020), and as a result the cost for the lti that was expensed in 2019 is reversed.

for all of 2020, the group’s key management personnel included the board of directors, the executive management 
(ceo and cfo) and two other key employees who together with the executive management have the authority 
and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the group’s day-to-day activities. during 2019, other key 
employees comprised up to six individuals simultaneously. the compensation of other key employees is generally 
structured in a similar way as for the executive management.
under the short-term incentive plan, the target annual cash-based bonus payable can constitute an amount of up 
to 50% of the member of the executive management’s fixed pay at the end of the performance period of earning 
the cash incentive. the maximum bonus is 200% of the individual target.
under the long-term incentive programme, the executive management was awarded an annual grant of restricted 
share units with a three year vesting period and a further two year holding period amounting to 100% (ceo) and 65% 
(cfo) of fixed pay. in addition, a transition award in lieu of unvested a.p. møller - mærsk a/s' shares and options of 
twice the annual grant level was awarded.

special items incurred in 2020 comprised redundancy costs from the reduction of the offshore and the 
onshore organisations of usd 24m and covid-19 related costs not recharged to customers of usd 18m. 
covid-19 related costs are defined as additional costs triggered by the covid–19 pandemic in the form of costs 
incurred to comply with local travel and quarantine rules and customer requirements, additional costs incurred 
with procuring testing kits for crews operating rigs, additional crew change costs for quarantine hotels, charter 
flights, per diems as well as additional costs to reimburse subcontractors in instances where they need to 
comply with  quarantine regulations.
the separation and listing costs incurred in 2019 primarily comprise listing fees, maersk drilling’s part of 
fees to banks, advisors, lawyers and auditors as well as one-off bonuses to executive management, other key 
management personnel and other employees.
of total special items costs, usd 34m related to staff costs (2019: usd 8m) and usd 8m to other external costs

operating costs (2019: usd 3m) and usd 2m as sales, general and administrative costs (2019: usd 15m).
in the classification of special items, judgment is applied in ensuring that only exceptional items not associated 
with the ordinary operations of maersk drilling are included.

maersk drilling’s total tax comprises current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous 
years for the individual entities covered by the consolidated financial statements. income tax is tax on taxable 
profits and consists of corporate income tax and withholding tax paid in lieu of corporate income tax (revenue 
tax), etc. tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent it arises from items recognised in the income 
statement.
current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet at the amounts calculated on the 
taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and for taxes paid on account. 
of the usd 65m of current tax liabilities it is estimated that usd 31m may only be settled after 12 months from 
the balance sheet date. 
in line with the published tax policy, maersk drilling support the development, growth and prosperity of the 
countries in which we operate by paying taxes in accordance with local legislation. the tax policy is reviewed and 
approved by the board of directors once a year.
taxable profits are generally split between the countries of operation and the flag states of the drilling rigs, which 
are denmark, united kingdom or singapore. under current market conditions with limited profitability, the majority 
of taxes paid are paid in the countries of operation which for 2020 were primarily norway, united kingdom, ghana, 
angola and azerbaijan. 
 
in denmark, maersk drilling is subject to a mandatory joint taxation scheme with all other danish entities under the 
common control of a.p. møller holding a/s. to the extent maersk drilling incurs tax losses in denmark or have tax 
losses carried forward from previous years, such losses may be utilised by other jointly taxed entities. in such events, 
maersk drilling is compensated through a joint taxation contribution.

note 2.2 property, plant and equipment – continued
property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives to an estimated 
residual value. the cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if  
the useful lives of the individual components differ:
pledges
property plant and equipment with carrying amount of usd 2,997m (2019: usd 4,655m) has been pledged as 
security for borrowings with a carrying amount of usd 1,254m (2019: usd 1,378m).
asset held for sale
assets held for sale comprise assets for which the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry 
out a sale have been initiated, when the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and 
when the assets are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. liabilities directly associated with assets 
held for sale, if any, are presented separately from other liabilities.
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount immediately before classification as 
held for sale and the fair value less costs to sell. non-current assets are not depreciated while classified as held 
for sale.
no assets are classified as held for sale as of 31 december 2020. 
at the end of 2019, the jack-up rig maersk completer was classified as held for sale with a carrying amount  
of usd 38m. the sale of the rig was finalised on 7 january 2020. 
estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.
the five-year special periodic survey costs are recognised in the carrying amount of rigs when incurred 
and depreciated over the period until the next five year special periodic survey. costs of on-going routine 
maintenance of the assets are expensed as incurred.
the cost of assets constructed by maersk drilling includes directly attributable expenses. for assets with a 
long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general 
borrowings are capitalised.
grants received from governments or similar institutions are recognised when there is reasonable certainty 
that they will be received. grants for capital expenditures are offset against the cost of the assets to which the 
grants relate. during 2020, grants of usd 13m have been offset against non-current assets (2019: nil).
useful lives are estimated based on past experience. management decides from time to time to revise the 
estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as standard 
of maintenance and repair, technical development and environmental requirements. 
residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives of rigs, the uncertainty as to future economic 
conditions and the future price of steel, which are considered as the main determinant of the residual price. 
the long-term view is prioritised in order to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations 
which may be significant.

there are no significant lease commitments for leases not commenced at year-end.
lease contracts, under which the group is the lessee, are capitalised using an incremental borrowing rate and 
recognised in the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. the right-of-use 
assets are generally depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. lease payments made are split into 
an interest element presented under financial expenses and amortisation of the lease liability. both elements 
are included under cash flow from financing activities in the cash flow statement.
lease contracts with a term shorter than 12 months or for which the underlying asset are of low value are not 
capitalised but expensed straight-line over the lease term. service components included in lease costs are not 
recognised as part of the lease liability. such costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied was 4.0% (2019: 4.4%).

the oil and gas markets have during 2020 been hit by simultaneous demand and supply shocks. measures to contain 
the spread of covid-19 have led to an unprecedented decline in demand for oil and gas, and initial intervention by 
opec+ member states struggled to balance the market. as a result, brent oil prices dropped from pre-covid levels 
of usd 50–70 to usd 20–40 per barrel. since then, brent oil prices have stabilised at levels around usd 40–50 per 
barrel, and in the end of 2020, the one-year forward coverage in the december 2020 brent prices climbed above 
usd 50 per barrel, the highest level since march 2020.
the decline in oil prices has driven reductions in spending budgets by upstream oil and gas companies and 
consequently many exploration and developments projects were postponed, offshore rig tenders were cancelled, 
and existing drilling contracts were suspended or terminated – resulting in reduced demand for offshore drilling 
rigs. the decline in utilisation and forward coverage exerted pressure on day rates across most segments, though 
the market for high-specification harsh environment rigs proved more resilient with a healthier demand and supply 
balance and only limited impact on day rates. 
based on bilateral dialogues with oil and gas companies, maersk drilling expects the demand pipeline in its 
key markets to further build in 2021, partly due to projects originally scheduled for execution in 2020 being 
postponed to 2021.
the future capital expenditures targeted for offshore, and thereby the future actual demand for offshore 
drilling rigs, are subject to several factors, particularly the development in the global oil and gas markets. the 
demand for oil and gas is depending on the public health, the impact of vaccines, and the policy responses to 
covid-19, and the supply side of the oil markets will depend on the associated policy responses of opec+ and 
the influence of us shale. 
outcome of impairment test
following the revised market outlook with lower expectations as to utilisation and day rates for the coming years, 
maersk drilling initially recognised a net impairment loss of usd 1,476m in its interim financial report as of and for 
the six months ended 30 june 2020. the impairment calculations have been updated as of 31 december 2020 due 
to changes in fiscal regimes in certain markets and to reflect the most current expected commercial outlook and 
updated budget for 2021 resulting in further impairment losses of usd 104m. the impairment loss relates to both 
jack-ups and floaters. potential impairment reversals of usd 82m have not been recognised as mostly arising from 
the passage of time. 
an impairment loss of usd 34m was recognised in 2019 due to the reclassification of maersk completer to assets 
held for sale prior to its disposal. no other impairments or impairment reversals were recognised in 2019.
basis for impairment test
maersk drilling considers rigs with similar functionality and operating environment as cash generating 
units due to largely interdependent cash flows. the cash generating units in the table above are further 
subcategorised in connection with the impairment test performed, however the methodology and assumptions 
are similar across the subgroups. 
the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit is determined based on the higher of its value-in-use 
or fair value less cost to sell. given the continued illiquidity of the secondary market for offshore rigs with no 
supportable price indications maersk drilling applies value-in-use calculations in the impairment test.
the value-in-use is calculated based on cash flow projections in financial budgets and business plans for the 
coming 5 years as approved by management. for the period after the 5-year forecast period an expected inflation 
rate of 2.5% p.a. is applied. in nature, these cash flow projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are 
uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. in a separate section below is set 
out sensitivity analysis for certain key assumptions applied in the expected future cash flows.
the discount rate applied in the value-in-use calculation is 10.0% p.a. after tax which is unchanged from the 
latest impairment testing done in 2018. the discount rate applied reflects the time value of money as well as 
the sector specific risks related to the underlying cash flows. any uncertainties reflecting past performance and 
possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount 
rates, except that specific assumptions relating to the future utilisation of the assets are applied. the useful 
lives and residual value of the assets are aligned with the accounting policies applied as set out in note 2.2.

sensitivity analysis
the value in use calculations for the individual cash generating units are particularly sensitive to the day rates 
expected to apply when contracts expire and to the risks of idle periods in the forecasts. in addition, the discount 
rate, growth rate and ebitda margin after the budget period are critical variables.  
the sensitivity analysis shows that the impairment losses in 2020 would have been:
•  usd -1,181m and usd -1,932m with a -/+ 1 percentage point change in the discount rate, keeping all other 
assumptions unchanged.
•  usd -1,379m and usd -1,765m with a +/- 1 percentage point change in the growth rate after the 5-year forecast 
period, keeping all other assumptions unchanged.
•  usd -768m and usd -2,256m with a +/- 5 percentage point change in ebitda margin after the 5-year forecast 
period, keeping all other assumptions unchanged.
•  usd -1,133m and usd -2,027m with a +/- 5 percentage point change in utilisation after the 5-year forecast, 
keeping all other assumptions unchanged.

note 2.5 deferred tax – continued
deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities. deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities where at 
the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise 
in a business combination. in addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, 
when maersk drilling controls the timing of dividends, and no taxable dividends are currently expected. a 
deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable 
future.
maersk drilling is engaged in a limited number of disputes with tax authorities of various scope. in evaluating 
the accounting impact of uncertain tax positions, maersk drilling applies a two stage test in accordance with 
ias 12 and ifric 23. if it is probable (i.e. a probability of more than 50%) that a tax authority will accept a 
particular uncertain tax position, then the tax position reported in these consolidated financial statements 
is consistent with what is or will be used in the tax returns of the entity and no further liability is recognised. 
however, if it is not probable that a tax authority will accept a particular uncertain tax position then the 
income tax accounting is adjusted generally by recognising an additional liability. the adjustment could also 
be a decrease in tax receivables or an adjustment to deferred tax balances, depending on the tax position. the 
uncertain tax position is measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on 
which is thought to give a better prediction of the resolution of each uncertain tax position.
the classification as deferred or current tax is often encumbered with uncertainty due to the nature of these 
disputes and effects within joint taxation including calculated interest, and final assessments could impact the 
classifications and estimates of the disputes.
estimation has been applied in the measurement of deferred tax assets with respect to maersk drilling’s ability 
to utilise the assets. management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and 
recent financial performances of the individual entities.

no provisions are expected to be realised after more than five years.
provisions are recognised when maersk drilling has a present legal or constructive obligation from past 
events. the item includes, among other, provisions for legal disputes, disputes over indirect taxes or duties and 
provisions for decided and publicly announced restructuring. provisions are recognised based on best estimates 
and are discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably 
determinable.
reversals of provisions primarily relate to settlement of contractual disagreements, which are recognised in the 
income statement under operating costs.
management’s estimate of the provisions in connection with legal disputes, including disputes on indirect taxes 
and duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual substance of the cases and a legal assessment 
of these. the resolution of legal disputes, through either negotiations or litigation, can take several years to 
complete and the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.

the overall objective of the financial policy is to enable maersk drilling to manage through the cyclicality that 
characterises the offshore drilling industry with an aim to create long-term shareholder value.
the financial policy ensures:
• financial flexibility including adequate liquidity reserves;
• a long-term funding view to minimise refinancing risk; and
• a robust capital structure through the business cycle.
in order to meet these objectives, free cash flow is to be allocated based on the following prioritisation:
1. maintain a robust capital structure with sufficient funding available to support the business through the cycle;
2. pursue investment opportunities supporting long-term shareholder value creation; and
3. return surplus capital to shareholders.
maersk drilling will generally work towards a leverage ratio (net debt divided by ebitda before special items) of 
around 2.5x.
this means that if the leverage ratio is below 2.5x over time and no attractive investment opportunities have been 
identified, maersk drilling will seek to return capital to shareholders by means of dividends and/or share buy-backs.
if value adding investment opportunities that require additional funding arise, or if ebitda is reduced in a business 
downcycle, the leverage may exceed the target level of around 2.5x for a period of time.
share capital
the share capital comprises 41,532,112 shares of dkk 10 each. the company has only one share class, and all shares 
hold one vote. no shares hold special rights, preferences or restrictions. all shares are fully paid up.

reserves
the reserve for hedges is the only reserve presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. the reserve 
for hedges represents the accumulated fair value of hedging instruments qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, 
net of tax. the reserve is transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction is settled. 
the group does not have a translation reserve as all material subsidiaries have the united states dollar (usd) as 
their functional currency.    
other comprehensive income
other comprehensive income consists of income and costs not recognised in the income statement, cash flow 
hedges as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. other comprehensive income includes current 
and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or 
deductible.

financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. subsequently, the financial 
liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and 
any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities.
in addition to the collateral rigs set out in note 2.2, certain bank accounts and shares in the subsidiaries being owners 
of the collateral rigs and certain intra-group charterers in respect of the collateral rigs are pledged as security for term 
loans and credit facilities with a carrying amount at 31 december 2020 of usd 1,254m. in certain circumstances, earnings 
in respect of drilling contracts for the collateral rigs will be assigned in favour of the lenders under the loan agreements.
financial risk management
the group's operating and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, comprising:
• liquidity risk
• interest rate risk
• currency risk
• credit risk
management of these financial risks is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by 
the board of directors. the treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges each financial risk if appropriate. 
the group’s overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and 
seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. the group uses derivative 
financial instruments to hedge certain risks.
exposure from each of the financial risks, together with the group's policies and mitigation procedures are further 
described below.

liquidity risk is the risk that maersk drilling will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations when they occur or 
ceasing to have access to adequate funding to pursue its strategic ambitions. the overall objective is to maintain 
adequate liquidity reserves to meet the group's obligations and to withstand volatility in cash flow from operations.
the group’s revenue backlog provides visibility into the group’s future cash flow generation and is a key component 
in the group’s mitigation of the liquidity risk inherent in the group's financial liabilities. at 31 december 2020, the 
group had a revenue backlog of usd 1,327m (31 december 2019: usd 2,131m) which provides clarity of the group’s 
ability to meet its obligations as they fall due.
the group has a centralised and structured approach to liquidity, capital funding and cash management, focusing 
on repatriating and concentrating cash. short-term funding of subsidiaries is handled by the central treasury 
department, primarily through a group wide cash pool structure.
the liquidity reserve, which consists of cash and bank balances plus the aggregate amount of undrawn or unutilised 
committed credit facilities that remain committed for a period of not less than 365 days, amounts to usd 626m 
(2019: usd 710m).
the group’s usd 400m revolving credit facility remains undrawn. the group's loan facilities including its revolving 
credit facility contain customary representations, certain covenants and undertakings (including on minimum 
requirements of the aggregate fair market value and insurance of the pledged rigs, customary restrictions on the 
flag and classification society applicable to the pledged rigs and restrictions on creating liens on the pledged rigs) 
and customary events of default (in each case, subject to customary agreed exceptions, materiality tests, carve- 
outs and grace periods). in addition, the loan facilities contain minimum free liquidity, leverage ratio and equity ratio 
financial covenants, with which the group must comply throughout the tenor of the facilities. the covenants have all 
been complied with in 2020.
the maturities of the group's total loan facilities, comprising term loans drawn in full and the undrawn committed 
revolving facility, are illustrated in the chart below.

interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. the interest rate exposure arises from loans and other credit facilities carrying floating interest 
rates. the exposure towards interest rates is mitigated by entering into fixed rate loans or interest rate swaps.
maersk drilling’s policy is that a minimum of 50% of the gross debt is at fixed interest rates using a model under 
which a larger proportion of risk is hedged in the short to medium term and a smaller proportion is hedged in the 
longer term. as of 31 december 2020, the average fixed ratio of gross funding is 54% for the whole term with 62% 
and 49% for 2021 and 2022, respectively. as of 31 december 2019, the average fixed ratio of gross funding was 48% 
for the whole term with 63% and 50% for 2020 and 2021, respectively. at 31 december 2020, the weighted average 
duration of term loans was 1.5 years (2019: 2.0 years). 
currency risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. the 
currency exposure arises from maersk drilling operating in countries with different local currencies. revenue is 
primarily denominated in usd, the functional currency of all material entities in the group, while related operating 
expenses are incurred in both usd and local currencies. the group’s net liability is also primarily denominated in 
usd and only a minimum of the group’s other net liability is in other currencies such as dkk and aud.
the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is mitigated by entering into customer contracts where an 
element of the contract value is in local currency to create a natural hedge between the contracted revenue and 
local operating costs. subsequently, foreign exchange forwards are used to hedge any excess exposure.
exposure to currency risk is generally low and does not significantly affect the group’s profit or the value of financial 
instruments. it is the group's policy to hedge significant net cash flows in currencies other than usd using a layered 
model with a 12-month horizon.
cash kept in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash is subject to currency risks. as of 31 december, 
the group had the equivalent of usd 14m of restricted cash (2019: usd 14m).
currency sensitivity
depreciation of the most material currencies in which maersk drilling trades (dkk, nok, eur, gbp, egp, aud and  
aoa) against usd by five percent is estimated to increase profit for the year by usd 3m and decrease other 
comprehensive income (and thereby equity) by usd 3m (2019: decrease profit for the year by usd 0m and decrease 
other comprehensive income (and thereby equity) by usd 4m). this analysis is based on financial instruments at  
31 december and assumes that all other variables remain constant. a five percentage point appreciation would  
have a corresponding inverse effect.
interest rate sensitivity
an increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated to decrease profit for the year by usd 5m and 
increase other comprehensive income (and thereby equity) by usd 14m (2019: decrease profit for the year by 
usd 6m and increase other comprehensive income (and thereby equity) by usd 20m). this analysis is based on 
borrowings and loans receivable at 31 december and assumes that all other variables remain constant. a one 
percentage point decrease would have a corresponding inverse effect.

the group has exposure to commercial and financial counterparties.
for drilling contracts, credit risk is minimised by undertaking a credit assessment of the counterparty prior to 
entering into the contracts. depending on the creditworthiness, the group may seek protection, in form of parent 
company guarantees, pre-payments or other type of security.
in 2020, revenue from four major international oil companies, which individually account for more than 10% of 
revenue, represented 69% (2019: 71%) of the group’s revenue. the credit risks associated with these significant 
customers are considered limited.
for financial counterparties, the credit risk is minimized by applying credit limits and transacting with financial institutions 
with a strong credit rating defined as a minimum credit rating of ‘a3’, ‘a-‘ and/or ‘a-‘ for moody’s, s&p or fitch, respectively. 
for derivatives, counterparties with an investment grade rating may be used. a limited number of geographies are not 
serviced by our relationship banks and have no operations by financial counterparties with a satisfactory credit rating.
financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable and other receivables. these are all considered to have 
low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated on the basis of 12 month expected losses is considered 
immaterial. the financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default and the issuer has a 
strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. 
receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. the group applies the simplified approach to providing 
the expected credit losses prescribed by ifrs 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision 
for all trade receivables. customer contracts do not include unusual payment terms or material financing 
components. to measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared 
credit risk characteristics and the days past due. in accordance with ifrs 9, non-due trade receivables have also 
been considered for expected credit losses.
for loans receivable and other receivables than trade receivables, the initial impairment provision is calculated on the basis of 
12 month expected credit losses. if a significant increase in credit risk occurs, lifetime expected credit losses are recognised.
the group enters into derivative transactions in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate exposure related to costs 
incurred in local currencies and interest rate exposure on term loans. the derivative transactions comprise foreign 
exchange forward and swap contracts and interest rate swaps. foreign exchange derivative contracts are used to 
hedge the currency risk related to recognised and unrecognised transactions, of which the majority are designated 
as cash flow hedges. interest rate swaps are used to swap variable interest payments on term loans to fixed interest 
payments. all interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. 
derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally 
acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates.
the effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments designated to hedge highly probable 
future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions are realised. at that 
time, the cumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. 
the ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, 
which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are mainly realised within one year, whereas interest rate swaps 
designated as cash flow hedges generally mature over three years.
the notional value of currency derivative contracts at 31 december amounts to:
the majority of currency derivative contracts hedge future cash outflows, hence the respective foreign currencies 
are purchased and usd is sold.
the notional amount of interest rate swaps at 31 december 2020 amounts to usd 652m (2019: usd 737m) and all 
swaps are denominated in usd.
the average fixed rate of the interest rate swaps is 2.7%, which jointly with margins and fees paid results in an 
average 2020 interest cost of around 5.0% (2019: 5.7%).
negative fair value of derivative contracts are recognised as non-current derivatives at usd 33m (2019: usd 22m) 
and for the current part in other receivables at usd 4m (2019: usd 1m in other payables).

note 4.1 earnings per share
financial instruments measured at fair value
financial instruments carried at fair value can be divided into three levels:
level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
level 2 –  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
fair value of derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable 
market data as of the end of the reporting period. the group has no financial instruments within level 3.
financial instruments carried at amortised cost
fair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially 
different from the carrying amount. in general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of 
expected future cash flows. where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
fair value of the borrowing items falls within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is estimated on the basis of 
discounted future cash flows.
the fair value of loans receivable and borrowings against related parties have a floating interest rate and the fair 
value is assessed to be similar to the carrying amount.

earnings per share amounted to usd -39.9 (usd -2.7) and diluted earnings per share usd -39.9 (usd -2.7).
earnings per share is equal to profit/loss for the year divided by the average number of shares in circulation or the 
average diluted number of shares in circulation. 
at 31 december 2020, a potential dilution effect from 176,793 shares (31 december 2019: 130,313 shares) 
outstanding under the long-term incentive programme (see note 4.3 below) are excluded from the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share as the inclusion would result in a reduction in the loss per share.

the term loans and credit facilities set out in note 3.2 may become repayable in whole or in part on the occurrence 
of certain events including a change of control over the company. except for these and for customary agreements 
within the group’s activities, no material agreements have been entered into that will take effect, change or expire 
upon changes of the control over the company.
the group is involved in legal and tax disputes in certain countries. some of these are subject to considerable 
uncertainty as described in notes 2.5 and 2.8.
through participation in a joint taxation scheme with a.p. møller holding a/s, the danish companies are jointly and 
severally liable for taxes payable in denmark.
following the demerger from the a.p. moller - maersk group, maersk drilling is subject to a statutory demerger 
liability. in the event that a.p. møller - mærsk a/s defaults on its obligations, the drilling company of 1972 a/s will 
be liable for any obligations of a.p. møller - mærsk a/s existing at the date of publication of the demerger plan on 
4 march 2019. similarly, a.p. møller - mærsk a/s will be liable for any obligations assigned to the drilling company 
of 1972 a/s existing at that date. the potential liability for maersk drilling is capped at a maximum amount equal 
to the net value of the assets and liabilities contributed as part of the demerger. the risk of the statutory liability 
materialising will generally persist for three years from the demerger date and potentially up to thirty years for 
unknown claims.
capital commitments and newbuilding programme
the group has capital commitments relating to acquisition of non-current assets totalling usd 30m (2019: usd 95m). 
no capital commitments are related to newbuildings.
note 4.2 contingent liabilities and commitments
following the listing on 4 april 2019, maersk drilling implemented a long-term incentive programme (the “lti”) and 
a one-time transition grant was awarded to certain employees. maersk drilling believes that providing remuneration 
in the form of shares to appropriate levels of management promotes sustainable long-term value creation and 
ensures alignment of interests with its shareholders.
under the lti and transition grant the executive management, key employees and certain other employees received 
a number of restricted share units (“rsus”). the vesting period for the rsus is three years from the date of grant. 
except for rsus granted as part of the exchange grant, the executive management will not be able to sell any shares 
vesting until the total period from grant (inclusive of the vesting period) is five years, i.e. a holding period of two 
years in addition to the three-year vesting period. executive management and other key management personnel are 
also subject to a share ownership requirement of twice the annual lti grant level applicable.
the transfer of restricted shares is contingent on the participants still being employed and not being under notice of 
termination and generally takes place when three years have passed from the time of grant. the participants are not 
entitled to any dividend during the vesting period. special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation 
as well as changes in capital structure, etc.
in 2020, 90,120 rsus have been granted under the lti. in 2019, 48,188 rsus was granted under the lti and 94,515 
rsus was granted under a one-time transition grant, inclusive of 20,803 rsus that represent an exchange grant for 
forfeited unvested restricted shares and options in a.p. møller - mærsk a/s (see below “the a.p. møller - maersk 
group's restricted shares plan”).

the fair value of restricted shares granted to four key management personnel (2019: eight) and to 38 other 
employees (2019: 33) was usd 2m (2019: usd 11m) at the time of the grant. total expense recognised in the income 
statement in 2020 for granted restricted shares was a cost of usd 2m (2019: usd 2m).
the average fair value per restricted share at the time of grant was dkk 134 / usd 20 (dkk 510 / usd 77), which is 
equal to the closing price of the day of the grant.
the average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 december 2020 was 1.7 years  
(2019: 2.3 years).
equity settled restricted shares allocated to employees as part of maersk drilling’s long-term incentive 
programme are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at estimated fair value at the grant date and  
a corresponding adjustment in equity.
at the end of each reporting period, maersk drilling revises its estimates of the number of awards that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. any impact of the revision 
is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
the a.p. moller - maersk group’s restricted shares plan
in prior years, certain executives and employees participated in the a.p. moller - maersk group's incentive programs. 
the a.p. moller - maersk group’s restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013 and grants have been awarded to 
employees on a yearly basis since then. the transfer of restricted shares was contingent on the employee still being 
employed and not being under notice of termination and took place when three years have passed from
the time of granting.
to ensure that the executive management, other key executives and certain other employees in maersk drilling  
had an equity interest in the company from the date of the demerger, they were required to forfeit all unvested  
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s shares and share options as of 1 january 2019. the individuals instead received restricted 
share units in maersk drilling (the “exchange grant”). a total of 1,138 restricted share units (b-shares in a.p. møller - 
mærsk a/s) were converted to restricted share units in the drilling company of 1972 a/s of a corresponding value. 
981 of these related to key management personnel and 157 related to other employees.

the drilling company of 1972 a/s
at 31 december 2020, notional borrowings amounting to usd 1,276m had a carrying amount of usd 1,254m, none of 
which mature after more than five years.
interest rate risk
interest rate risk comprises the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. the interest rate exposure arises from loans and other credit facilities carrying floating interest 
rates. the exposure towards interest rates is mitigated by entering into fixed rate loans or interest rate swaps. 
 
the company enters into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate interest rate exposure on term loans. interest 
rate swaps are used to swap variable interest payments on term loans to fixed interest payments. the interest rate 
swaps mature over up to five years. the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair values of 
derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. 
 
the notional amount of interest rate swaps at 31 december 2020 amounts to usd 652m (2019: usd 737m) and all 
swaps are denominated in usd. 
the average fixed rate of the interest rate swaps is 2.7%, which jointly with margins and fees paid results in an 
average 2020 interest cost of around 5% (2019: 5.7%).

dividends from subsidiaries are recognised as income at the time of declaration.  
financial income and expenses 
financial income and expenses are recognised in the income statement at the amounts relating to the financial year. 
 
tax on result for the year 
tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and changes in deferred tax for the year. the tax attributable to 
the result for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions 
is recognised directly in equity. the company is part of a.p. møller holding a/s' joint taxation. the current danish 
income tax is allocated among the jointly taxed companies proportionally to their taxable income (full allocation 
with refund concerning tax losses). 
balance sheet 
property, plant and equipment 
property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings contributed as part of the demerger. land and buildings 
are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives to an estimated residual value. useful lives are estimated at 
25–40 years.  
 
investments in subsidiaries 
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost or at lower recoverable amount. 
 
if indications of impairments are identified, an impairment test as described in the accounting policies for the 
consolidated financial statements is prepared. if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the 
asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount. indicators of impairment could be if dividends declared from 
the subsidiary exceed total comprehensive income for the year of the subsidiary, or if the carrying amount of the 
subsidiary exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets in the subsidiary. 
  
receivables 
receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which 
corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of 
an individual assessment of each receivable. 
 
the drilling company of 1972 a/s
the financial statements of the drilling company of 1972 a/s for 2020 have been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the danish financial statements act applying to reporting class d entities.

drilling activities from the a.p. moller - maersk group with financial effect from 1 january 2019.  
cash flow statement
with reference to section 86(4) of the danish financial statements act, no cash flow statement has been prepared.
recognition and measurement
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the 
asset will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. liabilities are recognised in the 
balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow out of the company and the value of the 
liability can be measured reliably.
assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost. subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described  
for each item below.
income statement
revenue
revenue comprises income earned during the year from the operation of the property recognised under property, 
plant and equipment.
other external cost
other external costs comprise expenses incurred during the year.
derivatives
derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trading date and measured at fair value using generally 
acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant observable swap curves and exchange rates. the company 
does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognised in 
the income statement as financial income or expenses. 
 
provisions
provisions are recognised when the company has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events.  
the item includes, among other, provisions for legal disputes, disputes over indirect taxes or duties and provisions 
for decided and publicly announced restructuring. provisions are recognised based on best estimates and are 
discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.

the drilling company of 1972 a/s
when preparing the financial statements of the company, management undertakes a number of accounting 
estimates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify the company's assets and liabilities. the only significant 
accounting estimate and judgement relates to the assessment of impairment of investments in subsidiaries. 
 
management assesses impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries and determines the recoverable 
amount generally consistent with the assumptions described in note 2.4 of the consolidated financial statements to 
which reference is made.
note 9  significant accounting estimates  
and judgements
no events have occurred after the balance sheet date which are expected to have a material impact on the parent 
company financial statements.
note 10 subsequent events
dividend 
dividend distribution proposed by management for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. 
 
current tax receivables and liabilities 
current tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recognized in the balance sheet as calculated tax on the 
taxable income adjusted for tax on prior years' taxable income and paid on account taxes.

translation policies 
transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. gains and 
losses arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are 
recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.  
 
receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies that have not been settled at the balance 
sheet date are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. any differences between the exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are recognised in financial income and expenses in 
the income statement. 
 
fixed assets acquired in foreign currencies are measured at the transaction date rates. 
 
usd is used as presentation currency because the majority of transactions are in u.s. dollars. at 31 december 2020, 
the exchange rate dkk/usd was 605.76.

statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review (pages 3–48 and pages 99–102).
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s review, and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management’s 
review and, in doing so, consider whether management’s review is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s review includes the disclosures required by the 
danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s review is in accordance with the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial statements act. we did not 
identify any material misstatement in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu 
and further requirements in the danish financial statements act and for the preparation of parent 
company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
valuation of non-current assets
the carrying amount of the drilling rigs 
(non-current assets) is significant to the 
consolidated financial statements.
the most significant risks in relation 
to management’s assessment of the 
recoverability of the carrying amount 
of drilling rigs relate to the value-in-use 
calculations, including determination of key 
assumptions.
bearing in mind the generally long-lived 
nature of the assets, the most critical 
assumptions in estimating the future cash 
flows are management’s long-term outlook 
for day-rates, margins and utilization as 
well as determining the discount rates and 
growth rates, and defining appropriate cash 
generating units (cgus).
we focused on this area as the amounts 
involved are significant and because 
management is required to exercise 
considerable judgement in the selection of 
assumptions and because of the inherent 
complexity in estimating the values-in-use. 
 
reference is made to note 2.4 in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
in addressing the risk, we considered the 
appropriateness of management defined 
cgus. we examined the methodology used by 
management to assess the carrying amount of 
drilling rigs assigned to cgus, and the process 
for identifying cgus that required impairment 
testing to determine compliance with ifrs as 
adopted by the eu. 
we performed detailed testing for the assets 
where a need for an impairment test was 
identified. we assessed the reasonableness 
of significant assumptions in relation to the 
ongoing operation of the assets. 
we corroborated management’s estimate of 
future cash flows and challenged whether these 
were appropriate in light of the significant 
assumptions being day-rates, margins, utilization 
and growth rates. 
we used our internal valuation experts to 
independently calculate the discount rate. in 
calculating the discount rate, the key inputs 
used were independently sourced from market 
data, and we assessed the methodology 
applied. we compared the discount rate used by 
management to our calculated rate. 
we tested the mathematical accuracy of the 
relevant value-in-use models prepared by 
management.  
finally, we assessed management’s disclosure 
of these matters in the consolidated financial 
statements.

as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark, 
we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.  
we also: 
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s internal control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may 
cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. 
we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
