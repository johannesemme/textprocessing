despite the disrupting covid-19 pandemic, 2020 was another 
strong year for dsv panalpina. our staff have delivered an extra-
ordinary effort to keep supply chains flowing and have achieved 
excellent results. we have now completed the integration of 
panalpina and have set new ambitious long-term targets,  
both for sustainability and financial performance.

dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
introduction
in just
15 months, 
we succeeded 
in integrating 
panalpina, 
a company 
half the size 
of dsv.
47.3% growth in ebit before special items  
for the group, we achieved revenue of dkk 115,932 million 
(+26.0%), gross profit of dkk 28,534 million (+23.5%) and 
operating profit before special items of dkk 9,520 million 
(+47.3%). adjusted free cash flow came to dkk 8,746 mil-
lion, and we distributed dkk 5,619 million to shareholders in 
2020 via share buybacks and dividend. the dsv panalpina 
share price rose 33% in 2020. 
 
2020 was a tough and unpredictable year, and it is a remark-
able achievement that the financial results for 2020 are bet-
ter than we anticipated before covid-19 hit us. across all 
our divisions and markets, we have delivered excellent results 
and, throughout the year, dsv panalpina has played an impor-
tant role in global society; when the world closed due to the 
pandemic, our employees found transport solutions to secur-
ing, e.g., food, household products and personal protection 
equipment on behalf of our customers. despite grounded 
passenger aircrafts and disruption across all transport modes, 
we managed to keep supply chains flowing. 
 
panalpina successfully integrated 
in just 15 months, we succeeded in integrating panalpina,  
a company half the size of dsv and the biggest acquisition  
in the history of our company. it takes a lot of effort and at-
tention to carry out a comprehensive integration in such short 
time, but the good results of joining forces are already showing. 
the skills, knowledge and capacity that panalpina has brought 
to dsv have made us a stronger company and have clearly 
created value for our shareholders.  
with the addition of panalpina, the group is now among the 
leading companies in the global transport and logistics indus-
try, but our market share is less than 5% due to a very frag-
mented industry. our acquisition ambition therefore remains a 
core part of our growth strategy along with our ambition to 
grow organically. in 2020, we announced two smaller bolt-on 
acquisitions, prime cargo and globeflight, but large acquisi-
tions remain our primary focus. 
 
new ambitious sustainability targets  
earlier this year, we unveiled our ambitious targets for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. the combined dsv and panalpina 
emissions amounted to 16 million tonnes co2 in 2019, of which 
the largest part was related to freight transport. we are commit-
ted to the science based targets initiative, which enables us 
to credibly demonstrate that we do our fair share to pave the 
road for a greener future. therefore, by 2030, we must reduce 
our carbon footprint by at least 30% from a 2019 base year.
in 2020, we already saw a reduction; however, this was 
mainly due to lower volumes following covid-19. the long-
term target can only be achieved if we work closely with our 
customers and suppliers and form partnerships with different 
stakeholders in and outside our industry. in 2020, we have 
partnered with other large companies to develop sustainable 
fuels, and in the coming years we will increase our focus on 
developing sustainable logistics services. 
we went through a challenging 2020 without reducing focus 
on other corporate responsibility activities. we remain com-
mitted to the un global compact, we support the sustainable 
development goals, and we focus strongly on both business 
ethics, responsible procurement and, not least, a safe and se-
cure working environment for our employees. the latter has 
been especially important in 2020, where the safety of em-
ployees has been a top priority during the pandemic. 
technology driving us forward 
in dsv panalpina, we take part in pushing the industry for-
ward towards a more digitalised future. technology helps us 
support our customers effectively and professionally with 
better products and value-added services. it is also an impor-
tant tool for our employees in securing our company’s pro-
ductivity and efficiency.   
in 2020, we have taken important steps forward in several 
areas: we have introduced new, advanced track-and-trace 
services creating visibility in supply chains. we have implemented 
new robotic storage and retrieval systems in our warehouses 
that are particularly suited for e-commerce operations. and 
we have tested our first autonomous drones, which help us 
manage inventory in warehouses. 
 
new ambitious financial targets 
we have already signed off on our old financial targets.  
we met our goals, ahead of schedule, and i am happy that  
we can now announce a new set of ambitious targets. 
we are a top performer in our industry, but we see further 
potential to improve – driven by growth, scale, technology 
and our strong organisation. by 2025, we target a conversion 
ratio of 40.0% or higher for the group (see more details 
about the targets on page 15). 
we owe our employees a special thank you for their tireless and 
impressive effort in very difficult circumstances throughout the 
year. the covid-19 crisis has shown us that freight forwarding 
is still a people’s business, and the results that dsv panalpina has 
achieved in 2020 are due to our people. 2021 will be another 
unpredictable and challenging year, but with our strong and 
flexible business model and the right people on board, we will 
make sure to keep our customers’ supply chains flowing.

operating profit before special items 
came to dkk 9,520 million. despite 
challenging market conditions and  
covid-19, we delivered strong results.
adjusted free cash flow 
for 2020, adjusted free cash flow came 
to dkk 8,746 million. the positive devel-
opment is mainly due to the higher ebit 
before special items.
roic before tax
the return on invested capital came to 
14.3% in 2020 against 13.4% for 2019. 
the increase can mainly be attributed to 
the growth in ebit before special items.

the growth in ebit before special items was primarily a result of the successful 
integration of panalpina and strong cost management. freight volumes were 
negatively impacted by the covid-19 crisis, however, this was compensated 
by strong gross profit per shipment, especially in air freight.
 
ebit before special items:

road
the road market was negatively impacted by the covid-19 crisis during 2020. 
the market recovered gradually in the second half of 2020, especially the do-
mestic distribution activities picked up, whereas activity on most international 
transports remained low. the growth in ebit before special items was driven by 
strong cost management (covid-19 cost savings) and improved productivity.
ebit before special items: 
dkk 1,390 million
solutions
the solutions market gradually recovered in the second half of the year, and

dation of warehouse capacity and the successful integration of panalpina.

global top five freight forwarders and 
market share based on 2019 revenue.
the competitive landscape
dsv panalpina is among the top five players in the global freight for-
warding market and has an estimated market share of less than 5%. to-
gether, the top 20 players have an estimated market share of 30-40% 
of the global freight forwarding market. the remaining market consists 
of a long tail of regional and local freight forwarders. 
the fragmented industry and the standardised services mean that the 
pricing environment is competitive. due to scale benefits, dense global 
networks and superior service levels, the largest freight forwarders are 
in a good position to gain market share from the smaller players, and  
we expect this trend to prevail in the coming years. 
gdp sets the pace for market growth 
in 2020, the transport and logistics markets were negatively impacted  
by covid-19, and we expect that 2021 will be characterised by rela-
tively high growth rates as the global economy gradually recovers. in re-
cent years, growth in global trade has been in parallel with gdp growth, 
and we expect this correlation to continue. air freight is the most volatile 
transport mode, and changes in economic growth or events like the  
covid-19 crisis impact both demand and the available capacity.  
growth rates vary regionally, and several trends are impacting global 
trade flows; the economic growth in asia is generally higher than that  
of the mature markets in europe and north america. however, the 
historically- known export markets in asia are gradually also becoming  
import markets as economies are shifting towards consumption. after 
years of outsourcing of production to china, we have in recent years seen 
a shift to other countries, mainly in east asia. this outsourcing shift can 
create more robust supply chain opportunities by reducing dependency 
on single countries and single suppliers, but it also increases complexity, 
as more countries are involved. this creates business opportunities for 
freight forwarders, e.g. in relation to purchase order management and 
custom clearance.
industry and 
markets
political trends impacting trade flows
in recent years, we have seen a political trend towards increased protec-
tionism. the trade tensions between the us and china and the brexit 
process are examples of such trends which may cause changes to supply 
chains if tariffs are implemented. however, we expect that the benefits 
of global supply chains will outweigh disadvantages of potential protec-
tionist measures, and we can assist companies prepare for and adapt to 
the changes. international trade and transport of goods are impacted by  
other regulatory changes, and we see a steady increase in trade restric-
tions, trade embargoes and security measures. this means that a strong 
compliance setup is an important part of the value proposition of a  
freight forwarder. 
new distribution channels
the growth in e-commerce has impacted consumer goods and last-mile 
distribution significantly, and this trend has accelerated following covid-19. 
while distribution to physical shops has declined, the activity in distri-
bution centres and last-mile distribution has increased. as freight for-
warders, we must adapt to these changes and ensure that we can offer 
the relevant services to customers. this has created a new market and 
growth opportunities as we provide e-fulfilment to customers in our 
warehouses.
new market entrants
when digital start-ups emerge in our industry or if established carriers 
offer traditional freight forwarding services, we are potentially faced  
with new competition. given our strong road map for continuous de-
velopment of our services and digital platforms, we – along with other  
established freight forwarders with years of experience and pre-existing  
global networks – are in a strong position to hold on to and expand our 
market position.

to consignee 
dsv panalpina is one of the leading players in the global freight forward-
ing market. through our network in more than 80 countries, we offer 
services within air and sea freight, overland transport (road and rail) as 
well as contract logistics (solutions). 
we support our customers’ entire supply chain – all the way from shipper 
to consignee. we organise the transportation of goods through our sub-
contractors (container carriers, airlines, road hauliers and railway opera-
tors). our business model is asset-light, enabling us to scale activities to 
match changes in demand in the market and to choose the suppliers with 
the most appropriate service offering, e.g. related to sustainability. 
adding value to complex supply chains
in addition to organising transports, we offer our customers a full range of 
freight forwarding, logistics and distribution services. these value- added 
services, among others, include digital tools for purchase order manage-
ment, booking and track-and-trace, as well as cargo consolidation, insur-
ance, customs clearance and pick-and-pack. 
our workflows are highly digitalised and our it systems are integrated 
with both customers and suppliers. this enables us to monitor the entire 
supply chain and provide supply chain visibility services and propose opti-
misation initiatives. the increasing complexity and time sensitivity of 
global supply chains have added lead logistics (4pl) and supply chain 
innovation to our value proposition in recent years. together with the in-
creasing focus on sustainable logistics, this illustrates that the market and 
our services continuously develop.

bedded in the strategic planning in recent years. we have been working 
with corporate responsibility for many years, but the topic is moving up 
on the agenda, driven by our own ambitions and influenced by important 
stakeholders: including customers, employees, investors and authorities. 
customers at the centre
we offer our customers global and competitive transport and logistics ser-
vices of a consistently high quality that support their entire supply chain. 
we have a strong foothold among both the large, global customers and in 
the sme segment (small and mid-sized customers). to cater for different 
needs and requirements, we offer industry-specific solutions for customers 
within automotive, industrial, retail & fashion, healthcare, technology 
and renewable energy. 
we want to be a leading global supplier, 
fulfilling customers’ needs for transport 
and logistics services, targeting extensive 
growth and to be among the most 
profitable in our industry.
we continually work with customers to find optimal solutions to their 
logistics challenges – and we proactively manage relations through our 
global customer success programme.
above-market growth 
we pursue profitable growth balanced between a solid, above-market 
growth and an active acquisition approach. 
measured by revenue and profit margins, we rank among the largest and 
most profitable players in the industry. this gives us a strong market posi-
tion and a foundation for continuously growing our business above market 
level in all markets where we operate. 
the group has a strong track record of company integrations – with the 
recent acquisitions of uti worldwide and panalpina as good examples.  
our main acquisition targets are large, global freight forwarders, prefera-
bly with high exposure to the air and sea market. 
operational excellence: transparency, productivity, scalability
freight forwarding is a service industry characterised by high volumes and 
a low profit per shipment. operational excellence is essential to achieving 
profitability above market level, and transparency, productivity and scala-
bility are the key components. 
we create transparency by measuring productivity and financial perfor-
mance across the organisation to ensure that management has the best 
possible basis for decision making. 
standardised workflows and efficient systems support productivity and 
ensure a high quality of the services we provide to customers. 
our international and regional shared service centres serve as admini-
strative competency hubs, servicing our global organisation and driving  
up productivity. 
11 
dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
strategy and financial targets
based on the principle of one main system per business area, we 
operate a consolidated, standardised and scalable it landscape. 
we work systematically to ensure high data quality and data secu-
rity. when available, we prefer standard, off-the-shelf it systems. 
dsv property drives an ongoing consolidation of our physical 
infrastructure. based on road maps for each country, we de-
velop large and efficient warehouses, terminals and offices, 
replacing smaller and outdated facilities. in line with our as-
set-light business model, developed properties are sold to  
external investors and leased back.
people at the heart of operations
while we focus on it and business process optimisation, our 
people are at the heart of our operations. we strive to ensure 
that they have the tools, training and conditions to perform 
their best. the covid-19 crisis has demonstrated that the 
transport markets can quickly be disrupted and only the skills 
of an experienced freight forwarder can help solving the issues. 
our group has experienced significant changes and growth 
over the years, but we still aim to maintain a flat organisation 
with a high degree of local empowerment. we want our staff 
to be close to the local market and to the customers, and we 
encourage decisions which are based on sound business acu-
men and supported by solid data. we work as one global com-
pany, we centralise back-office functions and we use stand-
ardised, global it systems and workflows – but we always 
strive to maintain the local ownership and responsibility.
recruitment and retention of talent remain key to the group’s 
success. we offer clear career-advancing opportunities to tal-
ented employees. global hr initiatives, e.g. dsv academy, 
e-learning, talent management and global mobility, are all in 
place to attract, motivate and retain the best people.
corporate responsibility 
we are committed to a responsible and sustainable way for-
ward for transport and logistics. this is the overarching state-
ment and ambition for our responsibility work, and this goes 
hand in hand with the vision and strategy described in the pre-
vious section. our impact on the environment, our ethical be-
haviour and the working environment we offer to our employ-
ees are just some of the areas which are becoming increasingly 
important. moreover, we can only create value for our stake-
holders if we set a high standard and ambitious targets. 
the combination of dsv and panalpina has created a group with 
a strong profile within corporate responsibility. based on the 
principles in the un global compact, dsv had a strong founda-
tion and governance in place, whereas panalpina had been more 
active in entering into partnerships and communicating about 
corporate responsibility. with the combined strengths of the 
two legacy companies, we intend to lead the way in our industry, 
and in 2020 we updated our corporate responsibility strategy.
corporate responsibility is anchored with the board of direc-
tors and executive management, but the plans can only be 
brought to life and targets achieved if the initiatives are driven 
and implemented by our central responsibility team and the 
local management teams across the organisation.
our responsibility focus areas 
our corporate responsibility strategy focuses on five areas, 
which are all of high importance for the group: business ethics, 
people, environment, community engagement and responsible 
procurement. within each of these areas, we identify the most 
material topics and set targets for improvement. we measure 
the performance systematically and work with both global and 
local initiatives to ensure that we achieve the targets.
we are a signatory to the united nations global compact, and 
we have pledged to adhere to the compact’s ten principles. 
we have also been supporting the un’s sustainable develop-
ment goals since 2015, and we have identified and work sys-
tematically with nine sdgs within the areas we affect the 
most through our business. 
ambitious environmental targets 
dsv panalpina is committed to the science based targets initi-
ative, and in 2020 we were one of the first logistics compa-
nies to set approved targets: using 2019 as baseline, we aim 
to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and company cars 
(scope 1 and 2) by 40% and to reduce emissions from freight 
transports (scope 3) by 30% by 2030.
to achieve these ambitious targets, we need to collaborate 
with customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders. via our 
co2 reporting platform, our customers can receive reports on 
greenhouse gas emissions which will enable us to identify areas 
for optimisation to ensure greener supply chains. de veloping 
sustainable logistics services is a focus area for us – we wish to 
offer a range of standardised services, which give our custom-
ers a clear choice when it comes to optimising supply chains, 
also considering the environmental impact of the transport.
partnerships with other stakeholders in our industry are key to 
achieve progress on the green agenda. during 2020, we have 
joined two partnerships with the purpose of exploring renew-
able hydrogen as an alternative to fossil-based fuels, which  
will be one of the key focus areas in the decarbonation of the 
transportation industry. 
in 2020, we established a sustainability board, chaired by our 
ceo. the board sets the direction for our activities and ap-
proves global initiatives related to environmental sustainability. 
dsv panalpina 
can only create 
value for the 
stakeholders, if 
we set a high 
standard and 
ambitious 
targets.

diversity and inclusion
we believe that having a diverse workforce where employees 
can realise their potential based on their different individual 
backgrounds is a significant business advantage. a diverse 
workforce situated in an inclusive culture fosters dynamic 
workplaces and ultimately better business decisions.  
we recognise and support equal human rights and we are 
against discrimination, differential treatment and harassment 
of any kind. this and more is reflected in our diversity and  
inclusion policy, which was updated in 2020. 
health and safety
we have more than 56,000 employees across the world per-
forming a large variety of jobs – from office workers to ware-
house operatives and truck drivers. regardless of the job 
function, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy 
workplace worldwide and to nurture and develop our employ-
ees through mentorship, motivation and talent management. 
by setting and implementing health and safety standards, our 
employees and subcontractors are informed about hazards 
and required safety measures in their line of work. 
throughout the covid-19 crisis, our priority has been the 
health and safety of our people, who have worked hard to 
keep global supply chains flowing. due to lockdowns, a large 
part of our staff were working from home during the year. 
however, not all logistics can be handled from home, and for 
those who had to come to work we have prioritised a safe 
working environment by providing personal protection equip-
ment and providing guidelines for all employees.  
 
in 2020, we also implemented a new qhse (quality, health, 
safety, environment) programme and moved forward on sev-
eral other related initiatives. we continue to work systemati-
cally with our targets; to keep occupational accidents to a 
minimum, to reduce loss of working days and to completely 
avoid fatalities. 
in this report, you will find a review of our performance within 
corporate responsibility during 2020 on page 20. more infor-
mation can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility  
report. 
we are committed to a responsible 
and sustainable way forward for 
transport and logistics.

market trends driving technology 
technological development is a major driver for change in our industry, 
and we work with strategic road maps for each area of our operations to 
ensure that we stay on top of the development. 
customer integrations and real-time supply chain visibility
digitalisation impacts our interaction with customers in several ways; this 
includes all steps of a shipment from quote, purchase order, booking, 
shipment tracking and status alerts to the final billing and kpi report to 
the customer. 
mydsv is our digital freight forwarding platform, and we continue to de-
velop and add more customers to the platform. for large customers, we 
also work extensively with classic edi integrations and more advanced api 
integrations. 
through our dsv mobility driver app and last mile delivery app, we en-
sure that critical data are captured and the shipment can be tracked by 
our customers. dsv eta is the latest addition to mydsv; through the use 
of gps tracking and traffic data, customers can see the estimated time of 
arrival and receive alerts about delays. 
warehouse automation
warehouse processes can be automated and optimised in several ways. 
growth in e-commerce and increase in number of transactions lead to an 
increase in demand for efficient warehouse solutions. it is key for us that 
automation solutions are scalable and can be implemented across several 
warehouses. 
technology and 
digitalisation
we have successfully implemented automated storage/retrieval systems 
and automated guided vehicles in several warehouses. this enables fast 
order fulfilment, improved productivity and efficient utilisation of ware-
house spaces. furthermore, in 2020 we have successfully tested drone 
technology for inventory management. 
new and modern warehouses are a prerequisite for large-scale automa-
tion; the layout of the warehouse, quality of floors, fire safety measures 
and energy efficiency are examples of areas where dsv property plays 
an important role, when we implement new technology.
a flexible it landscape for the future
to support the requirements of a dynamic market and to fulfil our strategy, 
we operate a robust and flexible it landscape. we are now implementing a 
hybrid computing platform to manage both on-premise and cloud-based 
infrastructure – operational systems, data and analytics, customer inte-
grations and engagement services. the new architecture governance 
model enables us to combine our global network and physical infrastruc-
ture with a high level of digitalisation. 
dsv innovation hub
in close cooperation with the operational units and the it department, our 
innovation hub monitors and prioritises relevant trends and technologies. 
several technologies are already in use, while others are tested or merely tracked. 
self-driving vehicles on public roads and blockchain are examples of 
technologies which do not yet have a significant commercial impact on 
our industry. we continue to monitor these and other technologies and if, 
at some point, we see a good business case, we will be ready to act.

market assumptions 
the 2021 outlook assumes stable development in the mar-
kets in which we operate and a continued gradual recovery of 
the global economy after the covid-19 crisis. the oecd and 
imf project global economic growth around 5% in 2021, with 
lower growth rates in europe and usa and higher growth in 
emerging economies, mainly in asia. we expect growth rates 
in the transport markets to be in line with underlying eco-
nomic growth. our ambition is to gain market share in all the 
markets in which we operate. 
with growth in transport volumes and our continuous focus 
on operational excellence, we see opportunities to improve 
productivity. our it systems, infrastructure and back-office 
functions are scalable, providing operational leverage oppor-
tunities in all three divisions. 
the air & sea division is expected to benefit from a strength-
ened market position after the panalpina integration, and from 
further optimisation of work flows and improved utilisation of 
it systems in the period. 
the road division is expected to continue the positive 
momen tum from 2020, and the road way forward project is 
expec ted to gradually improve productivity during the period. 
the solutions division will continue the work on automation, 
consolidation of existing infrastructure and addition of new 
warehouse capacity at key logistics locations. 
forward-looking 
statements
this annual report includes 
forward-looking state-
ments on various matters, 
such as expected earnings 
and future strategies and 
expansion plans.
such statements are uncer-
tain and involve various 
risks, because many fac-
tors, some of which are 
beyond our control, may 
result in actual develop-
ments differing considera-
bly from the expectations 
set out in the 2020 annual 
report.
such factors include, but 
are not limited to, general 
economic and business 
conditions,  exchange rate 
and interest rate fluctua-
tions, the demand for our 
services, competition in the 
transport sector, opera-
tional problems in one or 
more of dsv panalpina’s 
subsidiaries and uncertainty 
in connection with the ac-
quisition and divestment of 
enterprises.
impact from integration synergies  
and covid-19 cost savings
synergies and savings were achieved faster than expected in 
2020, and the remaining full-year impact in 2021 will be  
approximately dkk 1,200 million (previously expected dkk 
1,300 million). this will bring total annual cost synergies and 
savings to dkk 3,700 million, in line with what we have previ-
ously communicated.
the outlook for 2021 assumes that the currency exchange 
rates, especially the us dollar against dkk, will remain at the 
current level. 
long-term financial targets
following the integration of panalpina in 2019-2020, new 
ambitious 2025 financial targets have now been set for the 
group as a whole and for each division. 
the targets are based on the assumption of stable global eco-
nomic development during the period, with annual global gdp 
growth of approximately 3% and transport market growth in 
line with gdp. based on our market position, we expect that 
we can take market share in all divisions and exceed the mar-
ket growth in the five-year period.
the targets are based on organic growth and do not include 
the potential impact from larger acquisitions in the period. 
the strategic objectives of the group are translated into the 
following targets:
15 
dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
strategy and financial targets
capital structure 
the aim of the target capital structure is to ensure:
•  sufficient financial flexibility to meet the strategic objectives; 
•  a robust financial structure to maximise the return for our shareholders.
our target financial gearing ratio is below 2.0 x ebitda before special 
items. the ratio may exceed this level following significant acqui sitions. 
capital allocation policy
our free cash flow allocation strategy is unchanged from previous years:
1  repayment of net interest-bearing debt in periods when the financial 
gearing ratio is above target range;
2  value-adding investments in the form of acquisitions or development 
of the existing business;
3  distribution to the shareholders by means of share buybacks and  
dividends.
value-adding investments 
dsv panalpina actively participates in the consolidation of a fragmented 
industry and has created substantial shareholder value through m&a over 
the years.
the group has a track record of successful com pany integrations – the 
acquisition of panalpina in 2019 being the newest, significant chapter in 
this story. 
as illustrated in the graph, the group has been able to create increasing 
return on invested capital over time. however, large acquisitions have ini-
tially diluted roic before tax.  
group management continuously monitors whether the capital structure 
is in line with the targets and excess capital is distributed to shareholders 
through share buybacks and dividends.
adjustments to the capital structure are normally announced in connec-
tion with the release of quarterly financial reports and are made primarily 
through share buybacks.
dividend policy
dsv panalpina aims to ensure an annual dividend pay-out ratio of 
approxi mately 15% of net profit. 
proposed dividend for 2020 amounts to dkk 4.00 per share (2019:  
2.50 per share). the proposed dividend for 2020 is equivalent to 22%  
of net profit and 15% of adjusted earnings.

financial review
performance
in 2020, all three divisions delivered strong results and 
achieved significant growth compared to 2019. 
we completed the panalpina integration in 2020, and this 
was accomplished in 15 months. the synergies were achieved 
faster than expected, and the successful integration is the 
main reason why the conversion ratio for the group came  
to 33.4% for 2020 against 28.0% for 2019.
covid-19 started to impact our markets and financial results 
in february and march 2020. as we saw volumes decline and 
uncertainty increase, we reacted by adjusting our capacity. 
our covid-19 cost savings initiatives reduced the cost base 
by approximately 10%, and the strict cost discipline was a 
main driver for the growth in earnings during the second  
half of 2020.
adjusted free cash flow for the year was dkk 8,746 million 
(2019: dkk 3,678 million). when the covid-19 crisis broke 
out, we suspended our ongoing share buyback programme, 
but based on the strong cash flow during the year a new  
programme was initiated in october 2020. 
return on invested capital (roic before tax) including goodwill 
and customer relationships was 14.3% for 2020, compared to 
13.4% for the same period last year. the increase can be at-
tributed to the growth in ebit before special items, which was 
partly offset by higher average invested capital (+33%) due  
to the full-year impact of the panalpina transaction.
integration of panalpina
the acquisition of panalpina welttransport (holding) ag (panalpina) 
was closed on 19 august 2019, as of which date panalpina 
was included in the consolidated financial statements. the full-
year effect of panalpina had a significant impact on the consol-
idated income statement in 2020 compared to 2019.

results
revenue  
the growth of 26.0% was driven by the acquisition of panalpina, especially  
in air & sea. the transport volumes were negatively impacted by the 
covid-19 crisis, but due to lack of capacity the freight rates reached 
record-highs during the year, both for air and for sea. road and solutions 
were also impacted by covid-19, especially in q2, but the markets re-
covered during the second half of the year, and road achieved revenue 
which was close to the level of 2019 and solutions above 2019.

gross profit
similar to revenue, gross profit was impacted positively by the acquisition 
of panalpina and grew 23.5% in 2020. the decline in transport volumes 
following covid-19 was compensated by improved gross profit per ship-
ment across most business areas. as the pandemic disrupted supply chains 
and created capacity shortages, we did our best to find solutions for our 
customers, and, in some cases the extraordinary market conditions have 
led to temporarily improved yields, most significantly in air freight.
during 2020, gross profit was also positively impacted by benefits from 
the integration, where the combination of the two networks and consoli-
dation of it created scale benefits. both road and solutions have also 
benefitted from the continuous focus on optimisation of workflows and 
consolidation of infrastructure. 
ebit before special items
the 47.3% growth in ebit before special items was driven by the air & 
sea division, which benefitted from the panalpina integration and cost 
discipline in 2020. after a challenging h1 2020, road and solutions 
achieved growth in earnings due to improving market conditions and 
strong cost discipline. ebit before special items was negatively impacted 
by currency translation of dkk 192 million in 2020, mainly due to usd 
and currencies floating with the usd.

financial and non-financial performance
diluted adjusted earnings
the diluted adjusted earnings per share for 2020 grew by 19.9% and 
came to dkk 26.5 (2019: dkk 22.1). the growth in adjusted earnings 
more than offsets the higher average number of shares issued. please 
refer to note 4.6 for further details.
cash flow statement 
cash flow from operating activities for 2020 increased by 49.4% and 
came to dkk 10,276 million. cash flow was positively affected by higher 
ebit before special items, although this was partly offset by the cash  
impact of special items. 
cash flow from investing activities was negative by dkk 556 million in 
2020 (2019: positive by dkk 1,371 million). 2019 was impacted by a 
net cash position of dkk 1,975 million acquired from panalpina. 
cash flow from financing activities was negative by dkk 6,999 million 
in 2020 (2019: dkk 7,484 million) and was mainly related to allocations 
to shareholders and repayments of lease liabilities.  
adjusted free cash flow (adjusted for m&a, ifrs 16 and special items) 
amounted to dkk 8,746 million and was significantly above the dkk 
3,678 million for 2019, reflecting the improved ebit before special items. 
in accordance with the group’s capital allocation policy, the majority of 
the free cash flow for 2020 was distributed to shareholders, as the fi-
nancial gearing ratio was below the target level throughout the year. 
distributions to shareholders totalled dkk 5,619 million in 2020. it 
should be noted that, due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, 
share buybacks were suspended from march to october 2020. 
capital structure
dsv panalpina shareholders’ share of equity was dkk 47,385 million on 
31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 49,430 million). equity was positively 
impacted by the result for the period, but reduced by distribution to 
shareholders and currency translation on goodwill.
net interest-bearing debt came to dkk 16,970 million by the end of 
2020 (2019: dkk 18,355 million). the financial gearing ratio was 1.3 x 
ebitda before special items and in line with the target of below 2.0 x 
ebitda before special items. 
the weighted average duration of the company’s bonds, committed 
loans and credit facilities was 3.2 years on 31 december 2020, com-
pared to 2.9 years on 31 december 2019. the group issued new  
seven-year bonds of eur 500 million (approx. dkk 3,730 million) in 
february 2020, which were used for repayment of other loans. 
in february 2021, the group received an a3 rating with a stable outlook 
from moody’s.
net working capital (nwc) came to dkk 2,701 million on 31 december 
2020 (2019: dkk 3,125 million). relative to full-year revenue, funds 
tied up in nwc at year-end decreased to 2.3%, compared to 3.3% in 
2019. we consider the level at year-end 2020 to be satisfactory, but 
we will continue to focus on optimisation of nwc.
pact in 2021 will be approximately dkk 1,200 million (previously ex-
pected dkk 1,300 million in 2021). 
temporary cost savings due to covid-19 impacted both staff costs  
and other external cost, e.g. due to reduced travel activity and reduced 
working hours. we estimate that these temporary savings amounted  
to dkk 350 million in 2020.
depreciations totalled dkk 4,039 million for 2020 (2019: dkk 3,638 mil-
lion). the increase was mainly due to the integration of panalpina and depre-
ciations on new leased terminals and warehouses. amortisation of customer 
relationships was dkk 208 million for 2020 (2019: dkk 102 million). 
special items totalled dkk 2,164 million for 2020 (2019: dkk 800 mil-
lion) and are expenses derived from the combination of dsv and panalpina 
and the covid-19 cost saving initiatives. the acquisition of prime cargo 
in q4 2020 was the main reason that total special items were slightly 
higher than previously guided for the year.  
net financial expenses totalled dkk 1,729 million for 2020 (2019:  
dkk 858 million). the increase was due to higher currency translation 
which amounted to an expense of dkk 1,055 million (2019: dkk 188 
million). the currency translation primarily relates to non-cash exchange 
rate adjustments on intercompany loans in usd, chf and other loans in 
currencies floating with the usd.

integration and revised strategy
a key activity in 2020 was the integration of employees from 
the panalpina acquisition into our business ethics framework. 
our organisation and geographical footprint have expanded, 
and it is important that we all share the corporate culture and 
comply with the same code of conduct. the process started 
in 2019, and in 2020 we continued onboarding our new col-
leagues and communicating the framework via newsletters, 
e-learning and other channels.
equally important was integrating new entities and suppliers  
of panalpina into our framework for responsible procurement. 
the dsv panalpina supplier code of conduct outlines the 
standards required to perform services on our behalf and is dis-
tributed to all suppliers with a yearly spend above eur 25,000.
while managing the challenges of covid-19 and finalising 
the integration of panalpina in 2020, we also revised our 
strategy for corporate responsibility. based on a reassessment 
of the topics that are most important to our stakeholders and 
to dsv panalpina, the revised strategy includes new and more 
ambitious targets for short- and long-term improvements.  
we raised our ambitions for corporate 
responsibility in 2020 and made good 
progress on our initiatives.

progress towards our science-based targets
in 2020, we made progress towards our science-based targets, 
which are based on a 2019 baseline, which has been adjusted 
for the full-year impact of panalpina. 
the reduction in 2020 compared to our science-based tar-
gets was mainly due to the covid-19 crisis, which caused 
reduced transport volumes and thus reduced co2 emissions 
from subcontracted transport. other consequences of 
covid-19 restrictions, such as less business travel, also  
affected total emissions. in 2021, we expect increased  
co2 emissions as shipping volumes and business activities  
rebound.
in 2020, we also saw reductions in co2 emissions resulting 
from energy efficiency improvements in our own facilities and 
through our partnerships with subcontractors. through these 
partnerships, we encourage the use of more energy efficient 
vehicles. we will continue our focus on energy efficiency and 
green transport solutions in the coming years.
employee developments
unfortunately, we saw an increase in the rate of occupational 
accidents, mainly in our terminals and warehouses, in 2020. 
as the impact and severity of the accidents were low, we also 
experienced the lowest rate of lost workdays due to occupa-
tional injury since 2016.
we implemented a new health and safety programme in 
2020 and moved forward on several other related initiatives 
aiming to reduce work accidents among our employees. after 
finalising the integration of panalpina, we have reinstated tar-
gets for lost workdays and occupational accidents and in-
cluded a target for eliminating fatalities.
we saw an increase in the employee turnover ratio in 2020, 
which was due to the integration of panalpina and organisa-
tional adjustments as a response to the decline in global trade 
activity during covid-19. as the integration is now com-
plete, we expect the turnover ratio to decline in 2021 and 
revert to historical levels. employee turnover is generally high 
among blue-collar workers in the transport and logistics in-
dustry due to seasonal fluctuation in the required workforce.
new diversity and inclusion policy
we revised our diversity policy in 2020, adding focus on in-
clusion and making it clear that we respect, recognise and 
value the uniqueness of each individual. to strengthen the  
development of a diverse and inclusive working environment, 
we started a number of initiatives all aiming to promote and 
increase general diversity and inclusion awareness. we have 
also accommodated for this in our recruitment and advance-
ment practices, talent management processes and succession 
planning.
guiding ethical behaviour
in 2020, we continued our journey of creating awareness 
about our business ethics framework and whistleblower pro-
gramme. by the end of the year, we had reached a 100% 
completion rate among managers of our code of conduct 
e-learning. in 2021, our target is to ensure that 100% of our 
white-collar employees complete the e-learning course and 
to achieve a first-attempt pass rate of 90% or above. the 
course will be automatically assigned to all new managers  
as a mandatory, annual task.

dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
financial and non-financial performance
the integration of panalpina was completed in 2020, 
and dsv air & sea reported ebit before special items of 
dkk 7,026 million against dkk 4,506 million in 2019. 
covid-19 impacted volumes negatively, but this was 
compensated by strong yields and cost discipline. 
air & sea
market development
the global air freight market was significantly impacted by 
the covid-19 crisis during a volatile 2020 and we estimate 
that market volumes were 13-15% below 2019. as a large 
part of passenger planes were grounded, the belly-hold ca-
pacity was missing, and total available capacity was more 
than 20% below pre-covid-19 levels. the demand for air 
freight exceeded available capacity on most trade lanes, lead-
ing to historical high rate levels. geographically the demand 
was strongest for exports from asia during the year, whereas 
european exports were weaker. 
dsv achieved growth in air freight volumes of 19% for 2020. 
the positive development was driven by the full-year impact 
of panalpina.
we expect that the air freight market will remain challenging 
in the foreseeable future. it may take two years before inter-
continental passenger traffic is back at 2019 levels, and the 
market will continue to rely on freighter aircraft capacity. 
the sea freight market was less impacted by the covid-19 
crisis than the air market, and we estimate that the market 
volumes declined 3-5% compared to 2019. the trans-pacific 
trade lane stood out with a growth of 4% in 2020 whereas 
the development on other major trade lanes was negative. 
due to efficient capacity management by the carriers, rates 
were high during 2020, and during q3 and q4 the rates 
reached record levels on several trade lanes. covid-19 re-
strictions also played a role as container ports were con-
gested, and, in the last months of 2020, lack of capacity and 
empty containers caused severe challenges in the market. 
dsv achieved sea freight volume growth of 16% for 2020, 
also impacted by the addition of panalpina. we expect that 
the current situation with tight capacity and high rates in the 
sea freight market will persist for a good part of 2021.

dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
financial and non-financial performance
due to the group’s european footprint, dsv air & sea has a 
relatively high exposure to european imports and exports and 
less exposure to the trans-pacific and intra-asia traffics, 
which had the strongest development in 2020. dsv’s volume 
performance in 2020 was also impacted by the discontinua-
tion of certain panalpina activities and customer contracts 
which had low profitability and did not fit into the network. 
results 
revenue totalled dkk 73,689 million for 2020 (2019: dkk 
51,151 million). growth for the year came to 49.7%. 
the growth in revenue was mainly attributable to the acqui-
sition of panalpina. during the year, revenue was negatively 
impacted by lower volumes following covid-19, but this  
was compensated by higher freight rates both for air and sea 
freight.  
gross profit totalled dkk 16,909 million for 2020 (2019: 
dkk 12,517 million). growth for the year came to 39.7%. 
the growth in gross profit was mainly driven by the full-year 
impact of panalpina. the negative volume impact from 
covid-19 was compensated by improved gross profit per 
unit (yields), especially for air freight in q2 and q3, driven  
by the high rates and improved profitability of the air charter 
network. the improved yields can also be contributed to the 
integration of panalpina and the benefits from combining the 
volumes and optimising panalpina’s operations. furthermore, 
the disposal of airflo (perishables) in q3 2020 and other dis-
continued low-yield contracts during the year led to a better 
activity mix and higher average yields.  
in line with market trends, the division achieved the highest 
growth in gross profit in the apac region, driven by export 
volumes growth, especially related to consumer goods and 
personal protection equipment.

segmentation 2020
division gross profit

by the following 
geographi cal areas:

emea

apac
29%
the division’s gross margin was 22.9% for 2020, compared to 
24.5% in 2019. the decline was mainly due to the difference 
in activity mix between legacy dsv and panalpina and, sec-
ondly, a negative impact from pass-through revenue where 
higher freight rates cause lower gross margin. 
ebit before special items totalled dkk 7,026 million for 
2020 (2019: dkk 4,506 million). growth for the year was 
61.0%. the positive development was mainly a result of the 
inclusion of panalpina, the realisation of synergies and the im-
pact from the covid-19 cost savings. all regions contributed 
to the ebit growth, but the apac region achieved the highest 
growth, driven by strong performance on gross profit. 
amortisation of customer relationships was dkk 181 million 
(2019: dkk 82 million) and ebit before special items was 
negatively impacted by currency translation of dkk 142 mil-
lion in 2020, mainly due to usd and currencies floating with 
the usd.
the conversion ratio came to 41.6% for 2020 against 36.0% 
for 2019. the conversion ratio improved during 2020 as in-
tegration synergies and cost savings were realised. the oper-
ating margin also increased during 2020 but was diluted by 
the high pass-through revenue. 
net working capital came to dkk 3,215 million at the end of 
2020 against dkk 2,433 million at year-end 2019. the de-
velopment was mainly due to increased activity with large key 
accounts with long credit terms. 
return on invested capital was 15.8% in 2020 against 15.5% 
in 2019. the increase is due to the increase in ebit, however, 
partly offset by the full-year impact of the panalpina transac-
tion on invested capital.

dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
financial and non-financial performance
strategic and operational highlights
2020 was very much about integration and covid-19. with 
the integration of panalpina completed, dsv has significantly 
strengthened the air & sea division, which holds a position as 
a top-three player in both markets. our organisation and it- 
systems have stood the test, and we have integrated more than 
60 countries on time and in line with the integration plans, de-
spite the covid-19 impact. that is a remarkable achievement. 
dsv and panalpina are now one company, operating from the 
same offices and using one it platform. however, there is still 
potential for improvement across the organisation and this is 
reflected in our new long-term financial targets. we will con-
tinue our focus on optimising processes and ensuring that we 
use our systems the right way across the organisation. this 
includes our integrations with customers (edi, api, mydsv), 
and we will continue to promote these solutions to customers 
and ensure that the booking data we receive from customers  
has the right quality.  
during 2020, we have made great efforts to secure the re-
quired freight capacity for our customers. we have benefitted 
from our strong market position and relationships with carriers, 
and, while our processes are highly digitalised, the classic 
craftsmanship of a freight forwarder has been important.  
the capacity issues will continue into 2021 and we are ready 
to assist, also when companies take a critical look at their  
supply chains. 
our air charter network (a legacy from panalpina) has proven 
its worth in 2020. it is a unique and strong value proposition to 
customers where we control air cargo capacity and the gate-
way, and we use alternative and less congested airports. in 
2020, we have expanded capacity, now handling around 10% 
of the divisions air freight volumes. the capacity is based on 
more flexible charter contracts, compared to panalpina’s long-
term leasing contracts, but the service offering is the same.
focus areas 2021
in 2021, our focus will be on organic growth. we have a strong 
value proposition and relationships with both large, global cus-
tomers and customers in the sme segment, and we will focus 
on profitable growth within both segments. our target is growth 
above the market, and our ability to achieve this target will 
improve as 2021 progresses.
during the year we will also focus on our internal processes  
to ensure we all benefit from our digital tools.
our systems have enabled us to work from home during lock-
downs, but we hope for a normalisation soon. winning new 
business and sharing best practices are easier when we can 
meet face to face.
one of the leading 
freight forwarders
with the inclusion of panalpina, 
we significantly strengthened 
the air & sea division and our 
market position within air 
freight and sea freight, be-
come a global top three player 
in both markets. our com-
bined industry-specific solu-
tions have been strengthened.

financial and non-financial performance
dsv road achieved ebit before special items of 
dkk 1,390 million for 2020, compared to dkk 
1,251 million in 2019. the activity was negatively 
impacted by covid-19, but strong cost discipline 
supported growth in earnings for the year. 
road
market situation and performance
we estimate that the demand for road freight was down by 
approximately 5-7% in 2020. in the second half of the year, 
the market gradually recovered and the domestic distribution 
markets showed year-on-year growth, whereas the market 
for international transports only partly recovered. certain  
industries, especially in the automotive industry and capital 
goods, remained below normal activity levels. 
geographically, the southern european and south african 
markets were more negatively impacted by the covid-19 
crisis than northern/eastern europe and north america. 
results 
revenue totalled dkk 30,395 million for 2020 (2019: dkk 
31,621 million). growth for the year was negative 2.6% and 
was impacted by the covid-19 crisis. 
the activity picked up since the low point in q2 2020, and,  
in line with the general market, our domestic distribution  
activities (e.g. distribution to supermarkets and do-it-your-
self markets) achieved the strongest performance, whereas 
international transports remained below last year. in a chal-
lenging market, dsv road has benefitted from scale and 
strong network, enabling the division to offer a high service 
level to customers, also on trade lanes with lower-than- 
normal activity.
gross profit totalled dkk 6,138 million in 2020 (2019: dkk 
6,156 million). growth for the year was 1.0%. 
the division’s gross margin for 2020 was 20.2%, compared  
to 19.5% for 2019. the improvement was mainly driven by 
lower rates from external hauliers, due to excess capacity  
on the market for international transports. furthermore, the  
division achieved higher productivity and cost savings on 
cross-dock terminals.

financial and non-financial performance
ebit before special items totalled dkk 1,390 million for 2020 
(2019: dkk 1,251 million). growth for the year was 12.3% 
and was mainly driven by the covid-19 cost-saving initia-
tives implemented during q2 2020. the growth in earnings 
was mainly driven by northern europe, where dsv road has 
the strongest presence on the domestic markets.    
the cost discipline and improved productivity was reflected  
in the conversion ratio, which came to 22.6% for 2020, 
against 20.3% for 2019. the operating margin saw a similar 
improvement. 
net working capital was negative by dkk 1,310 million at  
the end of 2020, compared to a negative dkk 422 million at 
year-end 2019. the development was mainly attributable to 
strong nwc management, changes in provision and lower 
funds tied up in inventories.
return on invested capital was 14.5% in 2020 (2019: 
13.6%). the improvement was driven by higher result and 
lower invested capital.
strategic and operational highlights 
on top of the challenges in handling the covid-19 situation, 
the preparations for brexit impacted our operations during 
2020, both in the uk and the rest of the network. we added 
capacity for custom clearance and prepared as much as pos-
sible in close cooperation with customers.  
in 2020 we continued to develop our digital services. we add-
ed the dsv eta module, which allows customers to receive  
a pre-alert on the day of delivery.
while digital development is crucial, our physical infrastructure 
– cross-dock terminals – are the backbone of our groupage 
network, and during 2020 we added two new terminals.
the development of our new transport management system 
– now called road way forward – progressed in 2020. the 
comprehensive project is taking shape, and after a final  
pilot planned during 2021 we expect to start the roll-out  
at the end of year. road way forward comprises several 
modules and is expected to facilitate improved productivity  
in the coming years through standardisation and automation 
of processes.
focus areas in 2021 
road way forward is at the top of our agenda for 2021, and 
we will maintain our focus on the project to ensure progress.
in 2021, we hope to see market growth returning and we are 
ready to service our customers. international groupage is an 
important part of our product catalogue, and this is an area  
we plan to prioritise and optimise in 2021. 
we receive more than 90% of bookings from customers elec-
tronically, but the quality of the data is not optimal. we will in 
close cooperation with customers focus on improving the 
quality of booking data. 
finally, we look forward to working with our customers on 
sustainability. this involves both individual solutions for large 
customers and standardised green logistics services.

financial and non-financial performance
dsv solutions reported ebit before special items 
of dkk 1,161 million against dkk 1,013 million 
in 2019. the growth in earnings was driven by 
improved productivity, cost discipline and 
continued consolidation of warehouse capacity. 
solutions
market situation and performance 
we estimate that the market for contract logistics was  
down by approximately 5% for 2020. the initial impact of the 
covid-19 lockdowns led to a decline in activity of up to 20% 
in q2 2020, but activity gradually picked up in the second 
half of the year.  
activity levels within the e-commerce segment, pharma-
ceuticals, essential retail and do-it-yourself stores have been 
growing following the crisis, whereas automotive and capital 
goods are examples of industries that remain below 2019 
levels. retail businesses with a high dependency on high street 
sales have been severely impacted during 2020, and these 
retailers have accelerated the process of moving as much 
business as possible to online sales. 
results 
revenue totalled dkk 14,608 million in 2020 (2019: dkk 
14,390 million). growth for the year was 4.5%. the develop-
ment was positively impacted by the integration of panalpina, 
which expanded the footprint of the division in asia, the  
middle east and south america. 
the pandemic had an overall negative impact on the activity, 
especially the first half of 2020, but as mentioned, the im-
pact was different from industry to industry. 
gross profit totalled dkk 5,369 million in 2020 (2019: dkk 
4,969 million). growth for the year was 11.5%. 
the division achieved a gross margin of 36.8% in 2020 
against 34.5% in 2019. the improvement reflects higher 
productivity in warehouses and higher utilisation of capacity. 
during 2020, the performance on certain low-margin con-
tracts and sites improved or the contracts were terminated.

financial and non-financial performance
the improved gross margin is also a result of the ongoing 
consolidation, both of warehouses and it infrastructure. in  
recent years, the division has inaugurated several new, large 
warehouses and vacated smaller and less efficient facilities. 
the new warehouses often involve automation of processes 
enabling higher productivity.  
ebit before special items totalled dkk 1,161 million in 2020 
(2019: dkk 1,013 million), and growth came to 18.8%.
growth in ebit before special items was driven by the higher 
gross profit and lower cost base due to the covid-19 cost- 
saving initiatives, which supported ebit growth in the second 
half of 2020. the growth in earnings was highest in europe, 
and the division also achieved improved results in apac. 
the conversion ratio was 21.6% in 2020 against 20.4% last 
year, and the operating margin saw a similar improvement. 
the improved margins reflect the division’s cost discipline and 
continuous focus on consolidation and operational excellence.
net working capital amounted to dkk 775 million at the end 
of 2020 and was on level with last year. 
 
return on invested capital was 10.0% for 2020, also on level 
with last year.
strategic and operational highlights 
the panalpina integration was finalised in 2020, in line with 
plans. panalpina strengthened the division’s global footprint 
and contributed positively to the activity level in 2020. 
the growth in e-commerce accelerated in 2020 and dsv 
solutions has taken part in this development. handling the 
large volumes and seasonal peaks in online sales require 
strong and standardised processes, and automation of ware-
houses often plays an important role. during 2020 we have 
progressed with several automation projects, including auto-
store, automated ground vehicles and goods-to-man. 
the acquisition of prime cargo at the end of 2020 will add to our 
e-commerce competences, initially in the nordic region, and we will 
continue to focus on developing our competences in this market. 
in 2020, we initiated or completed the construction of several 
new warehouses and continue to work with strategic road 
maps for all regions ensuring that we have a strong base for 
organic growth and can offer attractive solutions for our  
customers.    
with our dsv smarter storage concept, we offer storage so-
lutions to private customers. the project is still only a pilot in 
denmark, but we plan to add new storage facilities in the 
coming years. 
focus areas in 2021
we expect a continued recovery of the markets in 2021 and 
hope to see an increase in activity levels among our customers.
we will continue several existing projects; new warehouses  
will be added, warehouse automation projects continue, and 
we will continue the work on our bi-platform (business in telli-
gence), making the data we use for internal optimisation avail-
able for customers.

risk 
management
risk governance structure
as a global freight forwarder, we are exposed to a variety of risks inher-
ent to our business operations. managing these risks is an integrated 
part of our management activities.
our risk management framework is based on structured risk identifica-
tion, analysis and reporting processes providing the basis for risk assess-
ments and subsequent initiation of relevant mitigation actions.
our flat organisational structure facilitates fast escalation and timely re-
sponse to issues that may have a material impact on the group’s earn-
ings and financial and strategic targets.
the board of directors is responsible for the group’s risk management 
strategy and the overall framework for identifying and mitigating risks. the 
audit committee supervises compliance with the established framework.
the executive board is responsible for the day-to-day risk management 
processes as well as the continuous development of the group’s risk 
management activities.
risk management process
our risk management process is structured into two parallel tracks:
 
1.  operational risk management – comprising continuous handling of vari-
ous identified risks resulting from our normal day-to-day operations;
2.  strategic risk management – addressing key risks and the more  
strategic mid to long-term risk scenario in which we operate.
operational risk management
every week, the executive board and senior management receive re-
ports on risks and other operational matters of importance from across 
the group. the report includes information on risk mitigation actions  
undertaken. 
the operational risk reporting forms the basis of the executive board’s 
day-to-day risk management activities and serves as input for the  
re gular reporting to the board of directors and the audit committee. 
the consolidated weekly report is distributed to managers across the or-
ganisation to create awareness of risks and prevent potential incidents. 
strategic risk management
the operational risk management process is followed up annually by a 
strategic risk assessment, focusing on identifying and mapping the key 
risks of the group. 
the assessment is based on input from the operational risk management 
process, and from an extensive risk survey involving a large number of 
key employees across functions, departments and regions.
the key risks are addressed by the executive board and assigned to risk 
owners within the group, ensuring that relevant preventive measures are 
implemented. in line with the established framework, the key risks are 
reported to the audit committee and the board of directors.

key risk analysis 2020
the latest analysis of the group’s internal and external strate-
gic risks was carried out in q4 2020.
the analysis reconfirmed the existing six overall key risk areas 
identified in previous years which may have a significant im-
pact on the group’s earnings, financial position and achieve-
ment of other strategic objectives should they materialise. 
in 2020, commercial risk – the risk of failure to execute on our 
organic growth strategy has been added to the list of key risks.
the results of the risk analysis are presented in the risk map 
and described on the following pages. the indicated likelihood 
of occurrence and worst-case yearly ebit impact are based 
on our best estimates, after mitigating strategies, but are  
associated with uncertainty.  
the risk from climate changes
climate changes impact our industry and we monitor the po-
tential impact closely, but currently do not consider this a key 
risk for the group. climate changes create a series of business 
risks – e.g. due to extreme weather events or increased costs 
for emitting greenhouse gases. emission of greenhouse gases 
is a material factor in our industry and can lead to higher 
transport costs in the future. 
an increase in the transport costs will ultimately be passed on 
to the shippers and may be negative for economic growth, but 
climate changes can also offer business opportunities; we have 
set ambitious targets for reducing emissions and we will offer  
a range of sustainable logistics services to our customers.

it systems, networks and related processes are crucial to our day-to-
day operations – from the delivery of our core logistics services to our 
analytic capabilities and reporting to the financial markets.
this makes us vulnerable to system outages, cyberattacks and failed it 
implementation.
furthermore, we rely on the scalability of our systems, continuous inno-
vation and improvement of our it landscape to be able to offer competi-
tive services that meet our customers’ expectations, improve our pro-
ductivity and respond to new business opportunities as they arise. our 
current road way forward project is a good example of a strategic it 
project. 
mitigation strategies
consolidation, centralisation and standardisation of our systems and pro-
cesses are cornerstones of our it strategy. this strategy also applies to 
acquired companies, which we move to our operational and administra-
tive it platforms as quickly as possible, only retaining systems that add 
additional value and which are not duplicated by our existing systems.
our group it department oversees it risks globally. in cooperation with 
the rest of the organisation, group it undertakes the implementation and 
operation of uniform systems, standards and controls, the decommis-
sioning of redundant systems and oversees the coordinated reporting on 
operational status, security risks, etc.
we focus on rolling out centrally managed solutions worldwide to reduce 
the number of software and hardware applications in use. this allows for 
central management and monitoring of platforms, master data, control 
systems and security functions.
the executive board always sponsors strategic it projects, ensuring that 
relevant resources are allocated to the projects and that the projects are 
progressing as planned or relevant actions are taken. 
risk assessment 2020
the panalpina acquisition in 2019 meant taking over a standalone 
business with separate data centres, it systems and processes. until 
panalpina was fully moved to the dsv it platform, this implied a period 
with two separate it frameworks and an increased risk exposure in 
both operations and cybersecurity. 
during 2020, the panalpina operations have successfully been moved 
onto the dsv it platform and the majority of the old panalpina sys-
tems closed down, reducing last year’s heightened exposure level. 
furthermore, we have experienced stable performance from our it and 
security systems throughout 2020. this has been achieved whilst si-
multaneously handling the added challenges of setting up large parts of 
our organisation to work from home as a consequence of the 
covid-19 pandemic. 
by the end of 2020, the overall it risk exposure of the group is back at 
a pre-acquisition level. 
risk description
an economic recession, e.g. triggered by geopolitical events or a  
pandemic, will directly impact our activity level and consequently our  
financial results.
similarly, protectionist measures enacted by the major world economic 
powers will have a negative impact on overall economic growth, al-
though restrictions may be counterbalanced to some extent by increas-
ing domestic activities and demand for custom clearance and other 
logistics services.
finally, changing industry and consumer patterns leading to lower global 
trade volumes – e.g. as a consequence of increasing environmental 
awareness – is something we follow closely, although it must be noted 
that we have yet to see any real impact of this on our business.
mitigation strategies
to diversify our geographical exposure, we have for several years fo-
cused on organic and acquisitive growth outside europe, which histori-
cally has been our main market.
we combine this strategy with a continued focus on staying true to our 
asset-light business model and with a high attention to process and cost 
optimisation. 
our asset-light approach implies that the majority of our terminals, 
warehouses and operational equipment are leased on short to medi-
um-term contracts, with the average duration closely monitored to ac-
commodate capacity requirements.
this allows us to quickly adapt to any potential slowdown in individual 
markets. we have a history of stable earnings margins, even in periods of 
declining freight volumes.
risk assessment 2020
the global economic recession triggered by the covid-19 pandemic, 
continued frictions between the world’s major economic powers and 
the brexit process have been high on the agenda for 2020 and will 
likely remain so for some time to come. 
our company has successfully navigated through the global economic 
downturn in 2020, and the full-year results were higher than expected 
when the year started. this confirms the strength of our scalable business 
model and our organisation’s ability to react quickly to market changes.
due to our more diversified regional exposure, larger scale and com-
mercial opportunities gained with the panalpina acquisition, we believe 
our business to be less vulnerable to macroeconomic risks now com-
pared to before the acquisition. 
looking past the momentary effects of covid-19 – the macroeco-
nomic risk exposure of the group has been reduced in the risk assess-
ment for 2020.

employees are a vital resource to dsv panalpina. 
our business depends on highly qualified management teams and em-
ployees with technical and operational qualifications at all organisational 
levels who are capable of handling situations out of the ordinary and 
jointly contributing to the group’s financial results.
failure to attract new talents or retaining existing, experienced key em-
ployees can potentially have long-term consequences for the opera-
tional, strategic and financial development of the group.
mitigation strategies
to retain and attract the right colleagues, we strive to ensure that our 
company is an attractive place to work.
across the organisation, we aim to offer an attractive working environ-
ment to all employees. this includes a good and safe physical environ-
ment in offices and warehouses, user-friendly it systems, and emphasis 
on a healthy psychological environment, through good leadership, trans-
parency and mutual respect.
we have established a performance culture based on employee empow-
erment enabling our employees to influence their everyday work life.  
additionally, we offer clear career advancing opportunities to talented 
employees.
we drive this strategy through several initiatives undertaken by both the 
local management teams and by our group hr department. examples 
include our updated inclusion and diversity policy, employer branding 
activities and talent development programmes. 
risk assessment 2020
factoring in the reorganisations related to the dsv and panalpina inte-
gration, our overall employee turnover rate remained stable in 2020 
and on par with previous years. still, hiring and retaining the right peo-
ple in certain parts and/or geographic areas of our business remains a 
challenge.
the panalpina acquisition in 2019 led to concerns about key-employee 
retention as a consequence of the restructuring and reorganisation 
process. however, with the integration now behind us, we can conclude 
that we have been able to retain the required key employees from both 
organisations to a satisfactory degree. 
at the end of 2020, exposure to employee-related risks is therefore 
less of a concern compared to the year before.  
risk description
at all levels of our organisation and in all the countries we do business, 
we are committed to honest and ethical business practices and comply-
ing with all relevant regulations. 
as a result of our global operations, we are subject to extensive national 
and international regulatory requirements. in particular, regulation relat-
ing to tax, customs, vat, data privacy and competition law continue to 
increase in scope and complexity. trade embargoes impacting interna-
tional transports is another area undergoing continuous changes.
cases of non-compliance may carry a long-term impact on our public 
reputation, which may negatively impact relationships with our custom-
ers and other stakeholders. additionally, cases of non-compliance may 
lead to fines, claims etc. for the group, our management and employees.
mitigation strategies
the tone at the top in dsv panalpina is very clear: “we do not deal in 
compliance” is a mantra which is well-known throughout the organisa-
tion. the high standards are set not only to safeguard the company and 
its employees, but simply because we believe it is the right thing to do  
as a global citizen.
our internal procedures, systems and employee training programmes  
are designed to ensure conformity with relevant legislation and our  
code of conduct.
our compliance framework is integrated into our business processes, 
containing clear guidelines on how to identify compliance-related issues 
and how to act accordingly. in addition, communicating and creating 
awareness of relevant topics is high on our agenda, enacted through 
regular news updates, global newsletters, webcasts, and internal  
conferences.
significant compliance-related risks are monitored and managed from 
group level in close cooperation with the local business units.
risk assessment 2020
following the trend from previous years, regulatory requirements con-
tinue to expand in scope and complexity within areas such as interna-
tional taxation and transfer pricing, gdpr (data privacy) and goods/
country restrictions. 
last year’s acquisition of panalpina added further to this complexity as 
the acquisition implied taking over new business activities, which, until 
fully integrated, implied an increased risk of non-conformance with ex-
isting compliance processes. 
with a structured effort across the organisation, we have managed to 
successfully integrate the panalpina business into our compliance 
framework. 
therefore – while regulatory complexity remains high – the finalisation 
of the panalpina integration implies that the compliance risk exposure is 
back at a low level.

risk description
growth through acquisitions is fundamental to our corporate strategy, 
and the current dsv panalpina network is to a large extent a result of 
past strategic acquisitions.
acquisitions always entail a risk of unsuccessful integration of the ac-
quired company, which could result in cost synergies, strategic advan-
tages and economies of scale being delayed or not fully realised.
furthermore, deciding on and carrying out the wrong acquisition may be 
costly and take up valuable resources that could have been spent on 
other potential acquisition candidates.
mitigation strategies
we have a history of successful integration of acquired companies and 
realisation of expected synergies. this rests on several factors. first of 
all, we stress the importance of any potential acquiree matching our 
business model. during the due diligence process, we make sure to in-
volve the right people from our organisation, considering all vital aspects 
of the business.
our it, reporting and operational systems are designed to be scalable 
and to accommodate effective integration. this means that we are able 
to integrate acquired companies quickly.
large integrations are headed by an integration board, and the activities 
are organised into work streams (operational, commercial, financial, it, 
legal, tax, etc.). the work streams systematically report on the progress 
and risks during the entire process. the integration of operational activi-
ties is anchored and headed by local management teams based on guid-
ance from group management. local ownership ensures that acquired 
activities are well integrated.
risk assessment 2020
the acquisition of panalpina in 2019 was the largest and most signifi-
cant acquisition in the history of dsv, triggering a moderate increase in 
m&a risk reflecting the theoretical possibility of the acquisition failing. 
the integration is now behind us, and both our systems and organisation 
have stood the test. the integration has been finalised according to plan 
and at lower cost than initially expected. the combined dsv panalpina 
group has successfully navigated through the first part of the covid-19 
pandemic whilst still delivering all-time high financial results.  
for these reasons, the overall m&a risk exposure has been lowered in 
the group risk assessment for 2020.
risk description
as with most industries, the freight forwarding business is undergoing 
gradual changes – both in terms of technological developments and the 
competitive landscape. this development is driven by both existing play-
ers and new entrants to the market.
currently, digitisation and automation of processes (quoting, booking, 
tracking, reporting and billing) are the most significant developments in 
the freight forwarding industry. these developments imply an opportu-
nity to optimise workflows and increase productivity, while also providing 
higher levels of service and product offerings to our customers. 
failure to keep up, adapt to and utilise these new technological opportu-
nities will lead to gradual long-term loss of market share and earnings.
mitigation strategies
our overall mitigation approach is centred on monitoring of the logistics 
market, technologies, customer offerings and other processes that could 
potentially impact the way we do business. as highlighted in the techno-
logical trends section (page 14), we see new technologies as opportuni-
ties, not threats, and we are open to new ideas.
we focus on developing our services, systems and operational proce-
dures to ensure that we have a strong and competitive product offering 
that fulfils our customers’ requirements and enables us to remain price 
competitive. the aim of our it strategy is to ensure that we can continue 
to benefit from our scale and global network in the future (as a classic 
freight forwarder), while increasing our digital competences and utilise 
the benefits of technology.
an indirect impact of new technologies and changes in the competitive 
landscape is that some of the basic freight forwarding services are be-
coming increasingly commoditised, leading to increasing price pressure. 
to compensate for this, we continuously seek to increase the scope of 
value-added services towards our customers.
risk assessment 2020
failure to adapt the existing dsv panalpina business model to new 
technologies, services or other related business opportunities remains a 
risk that we do not take lightly.
however, even though new technologies and related new ways of do-
ing business continue to emerge, we are still to see new innovations 
that will have the potential to impact our core business in any signifi-
cant way in the foreseeable future.
likewise, we feel comfortable with our current technological initiatives, 
keeping us competitive and on a par with the industry development.
consequently, the potential financial impact and likelihood of tech-
nology risks occurring remain unchanged from last year.

with the acquisition of uti worldwide in 2016 and panalpina in 2019, 
the group has grown significantly in less than five years, increasing both 
revenue and number of employees by more than 100%. 
our network and market position have been strengthened, but the 
growth carries several challenges; retaining focus on customers and op-
erational excellence and maintaining a strong commercial collaboration 
across the globe. in short, we must protect the ‘dsv-dna’ as we grow. 
if we fail to adapt to the changes, our ability to execute on our organic 
growth strategy will be impaired and the long-term financial results of 
the group will be lower. 
mitigation strategies
managing this risk is anchored with the executive board and the group 
executive committee. in this forum, strategic initiatives are aligned and 
cross-selling opportunities are explored. it is also part of the agenda of 
the executive committee to discuss and resolve any cooperation issues 
across the organisation. 
through regular business reviews with all the operational companies,  
top management ensures that each country is aligned with the group’s 
strategy and policies. the business reviews include evaluation of financial 
performance, market situation, organisation, local strategic initiatives, etc.  
while we hold on to a culture with local empowerment at country level, 
we have added strong central functions over the years to support 
growth, not least with large, global customers. this includes our global 
commercial organisation, which focuses on key account management, 
competences within key industry verticals and our digital interaction 
with customers. 
risk assessment 2020
as expected, our ability to achieve organic growth was reduced in 
2020, due to our focus on the integration of panalpina, and we  
estimate that we have lost some market share in air & sea. 
with the integration behind us, we are now in a good position to get 
back on the organic growth path in the coming years. this is in line with 
the development we saw after the integration of uti worldwide and 
previous transactions. 
management will continue to focus on the issue to ensure that our  
organisation is efficient, motivated and works closely together.

governance
management structure
together, the board of directors and the executive board form the gov-
erning body of dsv panalpina. the ultimate authority rests with the 
shareholders in general meeting.
the board of directors supervises and outlines the overall vision, strategy 
and objectives of the group’s business activities.
the executive board is responsible for the execution of the strategy and 
objectives set, the overall day-to-day management of the group and 
furthermore contributes essential input to the work of the board of  
directors.
the board of directors has established audit, nomination and remunera-
tion committees to perform various preparatory tasks relating to key  
areas of the board’s responsibilities.
the allocation of responsibilities between the board of directors  
and the executive board is defined by the rules of procedure.
division management is responsible for the day-to-day management  
of the operational activities of the divisions, supported by centralised 
group functions.
board of directors
composition
in accordance with the company’s articles of association, the board of 
directors must comprise at least five and not more than nine directors. 
directors are elected for a term of one year, and new directors are elect-
ed according to the applicable rules of the danish companies act.
in 2020, robert s. kledal retired from the board, and niels smedegaard 
was elected new member. niels smedegaard joins the board with exten-
sive management experience from positions held within the shipping, 
logistics and airline industries.
competencies of the board
the composition of the board of directors is intended to ensure the  
diversity of the board’s competency profile and that the board is able  
to perform its duties effectively. overboarding is also taken into con-
sideration when evaluating the board composition.
current competencies required of the board include knowledge of the 
transport sector, international commercial experience and experience in 
strategy, m&a, risk management, it, human resources and accounting. 
see page 37 for a description of the directors’ competencies and  
experience.
board of directors self-evaluation
once every year, the board of directors performs an overall self-eva-
luation focusing on the composition and competencies of the board  
and the results achieved. in this regard, diversity, overboarding, internal 
management cooperation, succession planning and focus areas for the 
coming year are also con sidered.
the chairman of the board is in charge of the self-evaluation process. 
when completed, the self-evaluation report is presented to and dis-
cussed by the board.

the dsv panalpina remuneration policy is available at dsv.com/en/  
about-dsv/corporate-responsibility/policies/remuneration-policy
remuneration report
remuneration of the board of directors and executive board is reported 
on separately in the dsv panalpina remuneration report. the report is 
prepared in accordance with section 139b of the danish companies act 
and section 4.2.3 of the danish recommendations on corporate govern-
ance and is available at dsv.com/en/about-dsv/corporate-responsibility/
governance/remuneration-reports
report on corporate governance cf. section 107b 
of the danish financial statements act
in managing dsv panalpina, the board of directors actively applies the 
latest recommendations on corporate governance issued by the danish 
committee on corporate governance.
the board applies the recommen dations as inspiration for setting up 
management structures, tasks and procedures and acting in accordance 
with the principal intentions of the recommendations. the board regularly 
assesses its procedures based on the recommendations.
for 2020, dsv panalpina has opted to partly derogate from one of the 
47 recommendations (3.5.1 regarding use of external assistance for the 
annual evaluation of the board of directors), but otherwise fully abides by 
the codex. the board of directors expects to be in full compliance with 
the recommendations during next year.   
adherence to the recommendations, including reporting on internal con-
trols and risk management systems applied as basis for the financial re-
porting process, is reported on in the statutory report on corporate 
governance available at dsv.com/en/about-dsv/corporate-responsibility/
governance/governance-report
the result of the self-evaluation conducted in 2020 did not give rise 
to any significant remarks and validated the appropriateness of the 
current board composition. as such, the board is considered to have  
the right competencies supporting the long-term value creation for our 
shareholders and is considered independent in accordance with the  
danish recommendations on corporate governance.
 
board meetings
the board of directors held nine ordinary and two extraordinary board 
meetings in 2020. the meeting agenda is set according to the annual 
 cycle of the board, thus ensuring that the strategic and operational policy 
framework of the group is reviewed and up to date.
besides the work laid down in the annual cycle, the work of the board 
in 2020 mainly focused on the integration of panalpina and adapting 
the business to the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic.
the meeting attendance of the board members in 2020 is highlighted 
in the table below. 
board committees 
the three committees assist the board of directors within each their area 
of responsibility and evaluate and assess the material used for decisions 
by the board of directors, thereby ensuring the best possible preparation 
and focus on each topic before decisions are made.
the rules of procedure of the three committees are available at dsv.com/
en/about-dsv/corporate-responsibility/governance/board-committees
remuneration of the board of directors and the executive board
remuneration policy
remuneration of the board of directors and the executive board is carried 
out in accordance with the dsv panalpina remuneration policy as adopted 
by the annual general meeting. the intention of the remuneration policy is 
to ensure that dsv panalpina is always able to attract and retain a qualified 
management team, to align management and shareholder interests and to 
incentivise the long-term value creation of the company.
at the 2020 annual general meeting, a revised remuneration policy was 
approved. the remuneration policy was updated to comply with new  
requirements of the danish companies act and with the intention of  
simplifying the company’s existing remuneration practices.

rarily suspended on 16 march 2020. following the strong 
financial results and cash flow of the group, a new share buy-
back programme was launched on 29 october 2020. the 
purpose of the share buyback programmes is to accommo-
date the exercise of share options under incentive sche mes 
and to adjust the capital structure in accordance with the  
financial targets.

the annual report of dsv panalpina a/s comprises the consolidated fi-
nancial statements of dsv panalpina a/s and its subsidiaries.
the board of directors considered and approved the 2020 annual re-
port of dsv panalpina a/s on 10 february 2021. the annual report will 
be submitted to the shareholders of dsv panalpina a/s for approval at 
the annual general meeting on 15 march 2021.
basis of measurement
all amounts in the annual report are stated in danish kroner (dkk) and 
rounded to the nearest million. the annual report has been prepared un-
der the historical cost convention with the exception of derivative finan-
cial instruments and acquisition opening balances, which are measured at 
fair value. non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of 
their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. the accounting 
policies described in the notes have been applied consistently for the fi-
nancial year and for the comparative figures.
changes in accounting policies
all amendments to the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) 
effective for the financial year 2020 have been implemented as basis for 
preparing the consolidated financial statements and notes to the state-
ments.
none of the implementations has had any material impact on the state-
ments or notes presented. 
management judgements and estimates
in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes 
various accounting judgements and estimates that affect the reported 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and notes to the 
statements. these are based on professional experience, historical data 
and other factors available to management. 
by nature, a degree of uncertainty is involved when carrying out these 
judgements and estimates, hence actual results may deviate from the 
assessments made at the reporting date. judgements and estimates are 
continuously evaluated, and the effects of any changes are recognised in 
the relevant period. 
the primary financial statements items for which more significant ac-
counting estimates are applied are listed below: 
• contract assets and accrued cost of services (note 3.4)
• provisions (note 3.8)
• tax (note 5.2)
additional description of management judgements and estimates made 
are described in the relevant notes.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the parent company (dsv 
panalpina a/s) and all subsidiaries over which dsv panalpina a/s exer-
cises control. entities in which the group directly or indirectly controls at 
least 20%, but not more than 50%, of the voting power are accounted 
for as associates and measured using the equity method. investments 
with negative net asset values are recognised at dkk 0.
the consolidated financial statements are prepared based on uniform 
accounting policies in all group entities. consolidation of group entities  
is performed after elimination of all intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses.
basis of 
preparation
the 2020 annual report of dsv 
panalpina a/s has been prepared in 
accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by 
the international accounting standards 
board (iasb) and in accordance with ifrs 
as endorsed by the european union and 
further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act.

foreign currency
functional currency
a functional currency is determined for each group entity. the functional 
currency is the currency used in the primary financial environment in 
which the individual group entity operates.
foreign currency translation
on initial recognition, foreign currency transactions are translated into 
the functional currency at the exchange rate at the transaction dates. 
foreign currency translation differences between the exchange rates  
at the transaction date and the date of payment are recognised in the 
income statement under financials. 
monetary items denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the 
exchange rate at the reporting date. the difference between the ex-
change rates at the reporting date and the transaction date or the ex-
change rate used in the latest annual report is recognised in the income 
statement under financials. 
foreign currency translation differences arising on the translation of 
non-monetary items, such as investments in associates, are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income.
 
recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
on preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the income 
statements of entities with a functional currency other than dkk are 
translated at the average exchange rate for the period, and balance sheet 
items are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date. 
foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the equity of for-
eign entities and on translation of receivables considered part of net  
investment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of income state-
ments from the average exchange rate for the period to the exchange 
rate at the reporting date are also recognised in other comprehensive  
income. adjustments are presented under a separate translation reserve 
in equity.
presentation
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method based on 
operating profit before amortisation, depreciation and special items. the 
cash flow statement cannot be derived directly from the balance sheet 
and income statement.
materiality in financial reporting
in preparing the annual report, management seeks to improve the in-
formation value of the consolidated financial statements, the notes to 
the statements and other measures disclosed by presenting the informa-
tion in a way that supports the understanding of the group’s perfor-
mance in the reporting period. 
this objective is achieved by presenting fair transactional aggregation 
levels on items and other financial information, emphasising information 
that is considered of material importance to the user and making rele-
vant rather than generic descriptions throughout the annual report. 
all disclosures are made in compliance with the international financial 
reporting standards, the danish financial statements act and other rel-
evant regulations, ensuring a true and fair view throughout the annual 
report.
presentation of items and subtotals
the presentation of items and subtotals is based on separate classifica-
tion of material groups of similar items. in the income statement, income 
and expense items are classified based on the ‘nature of expense’ 
method in accordance with ias 1. furthermore, the use of special items 
is applied to improve the transparency and understanding of the group’s 
financial statements by separating the core performance of the group 
from exceptional items. for a definition and reconciliation of group re-
sults before and after special items, please see note 2.7 special items.
new accounting regulations
the iasb has issued a number of new standards and amendments  
not yet in effect or endorsed by the eu and therefore not relevant for 
the preparation of the 2020 consolidated financial statements. dsv 
panalpina expects to implement these standards when they take effect.
none of the new standards issued are currently expected to have any 
significant impact on the group’s financial statements when imple-
mented.

chapter 2
profit for 
the year
this chapter includes disclosures on 
components of consolidated profit for the 
year. the consolidated profit is based on 
the combined results of our three 
operating segments – air & sea, road and 
solutions – as described in the following.
reference is also made to the comments 
on the financial performance of the group 
and the divisions in management’s 
commentary.
 
  accounting policies
operating segments are defined by the operational and management 
structure of dsv panalpina, which is derived from the types of services 
we deliver and our geographical presence on the world market. as such, 
our operating segments reflect our divisional and group reporting used 
for management decision-making.
operating segments
our business operations are carried out by three divisions, forming the 
basis of our segment reporting.
air & sea 
the air & sea division provides air and sea freight services across the globe.
road 
the road division provides road freight services across europe, north 
america and south africa.
 
solutions 
the solutions division offers contract logistics services, incl. warehousing 
and inventory management, across the globe.
measurement of earnings by segment
our business segments are measured and reported down to operating 
profit before special items. segment results are accounted for in the 
same way as in the consolidated financial statements. 
segment income/expenses and assets/liabilities comprise the items di-
rectly attributable to the individual segment as well as the items that 
may be allocated to the individual segment on a reliable basis.
income and expenses relating to group functions, investing activities, 
etc. are managed at group level. these items are not included in the 
statement of segment information, but are presented under ‘non- 
allocated items and eliminations’.
2.1 segment information 
financial position of business segments
assets and liabilities are included in the segmental reporting to the  
extent they are used for the operation of the segment. 
assets and liabilities that cannot be attributed to any of the three seg-
ments on a reliable basis are presented under ‘non-allocated items and 
eliminations’.
geographical information 
dsv panalpina operates in most parts of the world and has activities  
in more than 80 countries, which are divided into the following geo-
graphical regions:
• emea: europe, middle east and africa
• americas: north and south america
• apac: asia, australia and the pacific
revenue and non-current assets are allocated to the geographical areas 
according to the country in which the individual consolidated entity is 
based. the corporate headquarter of dsv panalpina is located in denmark, 
which is included in the emea segment. dsv panalpina business is based 
on transactions in our global network rather than in individual countries 
or regions. therefore, goodwill is not allocated to regions.
intersegment transactions are made on an arm’s length basis.
major customers
dsv panalpina is not reliant on any major customers, as no single exter-
nal customer exceeds 5% of combined group revenue.

2.2 revenue
 
  accounting policies
revenue comprises freight forwarding services, contract logistics and 
other related services delivered in the finan cial year. 
revenue from services delivered is recognised in accordance with the 
over-time recognition principle following the satisfaction of various mile-
stones as the performance obligation is fulfilled towards the customer. 
our main services comprise air, sea, road and solutions services as de-
scribed in the following.
air services 
air services comprise air freight logistics facilitating transportation of 
goods across the globe. air services are reported within the air & sea  
reporting segment. air services are characterised by short delivery times 
as most air transports are completed within a few days. 
sea services
sea services comprise sea freight logistics facilitating transportation of 
goods across the globe. sea services are reported within the air & sea 
reporting segment. sea services are characterised by longer delivery 
times, averaging one month depending on destination.  
road services
road services comprise road freight logistics facilitating transportation of 
goods by road networks mainly in europe, the us and south africa. road 
services are reported within the road reporting segment. road services 
are characterised by short delivery times as most road transports are 
completed within a few days. 
solutions services
solutions services comprise contract logistics, incl. warehousing and in-
ventory management across the globe. solutions services are reported 
within the solutions re porting segment. solutions services are charac-
terised by very short delivery times, happening almost instanta neously 
as agreed actions under the customer contract are carried out.
 
general recognition principles
revenue from services delivered are recognised based on the price 
specified in the contract with the customer. revenue is measured ex-
cluding vat and other tax collected on behalf of third parties, and any 
discounts are offset against the revenue. incremental costs of obtaining  
a contract with a customer are not recognised as an asset but as an  
expense when incurred due to the short delivery times. 
trade receivables are recognised as services delivered are invoiced to the 
customer and are not adjusted for any financing components as credit 
terms are short – typically between 14 and 60 days – and the financing 
component therefore insignificant. where services delivered have yet to 
be invoiced and invoices on services received from hauliers have still to 
be received, contract assets and accrued cost of services are recognised 
at the reporting date. 
revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations are not dis-
closed following the practical expedient of ifrs 15.
revenue also comprises income from sale of property projects in the 
form of sale of land and buildings acquired, constructed and held for sale 
in the ordinary course of business. 
revenue from property projects is recognised at a point in time in the 
reporting segment to which it relates when control of and legal title to 
the property has been transferred to the customer. revenue is recog-
nised based on the price specified in the contract with the customer, and 
the consideration is due upon transfer of the legal title. delivery times on 
property projects are typically 8-18 months.
if the property is leased back after completion, the right-of-use asset 
arising from the leaseback is recognised at the proportion of the previous 
carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained by 
dsv panalpina. as such, any gain or loss recognised only corresponds to 
rights transferred to the buyer.

2.8  financial income and expenses
  accounting policies
special items are used in connection with the presentation of profit or 
loss for the year to distinguish consolidated operating profit from excep-
tional items, which by their nature are not related to the group’s ordinary 
operations or investment in future activities.
special items comprise: 
•  restructuring costs (incl. covid-19 initiatives), impairment costs, 
etc. relating to fundamental structural, procedural and managerial  
reorganisations as well as any related gains or losses on disposals; 
•  transaction and restructuring costs relating to the acqui sition and  
divestment of enterprises. 
special items reconcile to the income statement items as specified  
in the table below:
  accounting policies
financial income and expenses include interest, share of associates’ 
profit/loss, foreign currency gains and losses and impairment of securi-
ties, payables and foreign currency transactions as well as amortisation 
of financial assets and liabilities, including finance lease obligations. fur-
thermore, realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial 
instruments that cannot be classified as hedging contracts are included.
interest income includes interest on financial assets measured at amor-
tised cost of dkk 248 million (2019: dkk 129 million).
interest expenses include interest on financial liabilities measured at 
amortised cost of dkk 912 million (2019: dkk 779 million).

chapter 3
operating 
assets and 
liabilities
this chapter includes notes disclosures on 
the group’s invested capital that forms the 
basis of our business activities. invested 
capital represents the group’s property, 
plant and equipment, intangible assets and 
net working capital in the form of operating 
assets and liabilities.
invested capital is structured based on our 
asset-light business model, including our 
focus on minimising funds tied up in work-
ing capital to optimise the generation of 
available free cash flow. invested capital 
also comprises significant intangible assets 
mainly relating to acquired goodwill from 
business combinations carried out over  
the years.
  accounting policies
goodwill
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment at least annu-
ally together with other non-current assets of the group.
impairment testing is performed for each cash-generating unit to which 
consolidated goodwill is allocated, as defined by our divisional manage-
ment and operational structure. the cash-generating units thereby fol-
low our divisional structure: air & sea, road and solutions.
goodwill is written down to its recoverable amount through the income 
statement if lower than the carrying amount.
the recoverable amount is determined as the present value of the dis-
counted future net cash flow from the cash-generating unit to which the 
goodwill relates. in calculating the present value, discount rates are ap-
plied reflecting the risk-free interest rate with the addition of risks relat-
ing to the individual cash-generating units, such as geographical and fi-
nancial exposure.
other non-current intangible assets, property,  
plant and equipment
the carrying amount of other non-current assets is tested for impair-
ment at least once a year in connection with the impairment test of 
goodwill. if the tests show evidence of impairment, the asset is written 
down to the recoverable amount through the income statement if lower 
than the carrying amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of the 
fair value of the asset less the expected costs to sell and its value in use.
the value in use is calculated as the present value of expected future 
cash flows from the asset or the division of which the asset forms part.
3.1 impairment testing
  management judgements and estimates
for goodwill impairment testing, a number of estimates are made on the 
development in revenues, gross profits, operating margins, future capital 
expenditures, discount rates and growth expectations in the terminal pe-
riod. these are based on an assessment of current and future develop-
ments in the three cash-generating units and on historical data and as-
sumptions of future expected market developments, including expected 
long-term average market growth rates.
material value drivers affecting the future net cash flows of the three 
cash-generating units are:
air & sea
the air & sea division operates globally, so developments in the global 
economy and world trade therefore have a material impact on the divi-
sion’s future net cash flow. developments in gross profit per shipment, 
cost management initiatives and development in internal productivity 
(number of shipments per employee) also affect the division’s cash flow.
road
the road division mainly operates on the european market, which means 
that the division’s future net cash flow is affected by the growth rate in 
this region. developments in gross profit per shipment, including truck 
and terminal utilisation rates, cost management initiatives and devel-
opment in internal productivity (number of shipments per employee) 
also affect the division’s cash flow.
solutions
the solutions division operates globally, so developments in the global 
economy and world trade therefore have a material impact on the divi-
sion’s future net cash flow. developments in warehouse lease costs and 
costs of related services, utilisation of warehouse facilities, cost manage-
ment initiatives and development in internal productivity (number of or-
der lines per employee) also affect the division’s cash flows.

3.1 impairment testing — continued
the expected future net cash flow is based on budgets and business 
plans approved by management for the year 2021 and projections  
for subsequent years up to and including 2025. from 2025 onwards, 
dsv panalpina expects the growth rate to remain in line with the  
expected long-term average growth rate for the industry.

impairment test 
goodwill was tested for impairment at 31 december 2020.  
the tests did not result in any impairment of carrying amounts.
the assumptions used, including a sensitivity analysis, are stated in the fol-
lowing. the pre-tax discount rate is calculated in accordance with ias 36.
the sensitivity analysis assesses the impact of changes in cash flows and 
discount rates on the impairment test results. the analysis concluded 
that even negative changes, which are unlikely to occur, will not result in 
impairment of goodwill in any of the three cash-generating units.
sensitivity analysis
the sensitivity analysis shows the lowest possible growth rate or highest 
possible discount rate in percentage points by which the assumptions 
used can change before goodwill becomes impaired.
other non-current intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
other non-current assets were also tested for impairment indications 
together with goodwill at 31 december 2020. no indication of 
impairment was identified in connection with these tests.

3.2 intangible assets
  accounting policies
goodwill
only goodwill arising from business combinations is recognised in the fi-
nancial statements. goodwill is measured as the difference between the 
total of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the value of 
non-controlling interests and any equity investments previously held in 
the acquiree, compared to the fair value of identifiable net assets on the 
date of acquisition. 
goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment at least annually. 
customer relationships
on initial recognition, customer relationships identified from business 
combinations are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. subse-
quently, customer relationships are measured at fair value less accumu-
lated amortisation and impairment losses. 
customer relationships are amortised over a period of eight years using 
the diminishing balance method.

computer software and software in progress
computer software bought or developed for internal use is measured at 
the lower of cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses 
and the recoverable amount. cost comprises payments for the software 
and other directly attributable expenses of preparing the software for its 
intended use. 
after commissioning, software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 
its expected useful life. the amortisation period is 1-10 years.

3.3 property, plant and equipment
  accounting policies
land and buildings and other plant and operating equipment are meas-
ured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
the cost comprises the acquisition price and other directly attributable 
expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use. the present value 
of estimated expenses for dismantling and disposing of the asset as well 
as restoration expenses are added to the cost if such expenses are rec-
ognised as a provision. material borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the construction of the individual asset are also added to cost. 
if the individual components of an asset have different useful lives, each 
component will be depreciated separately.
the cost of self-constructed assets comprises direct and indirect costs 
for materials, components, subcontractors, wages and salaries. costs for 
self-constructed assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment 
in progress on an ongoing basis until the assets are ready for use.
subsequent costs, such as partial replacement of property, plant and 
equipment, are included in the carrying amount of the asset in question 
when it is probable that such costs will result in future economic benefits. 
the carrying amount of the replaced parts is derecognised from the  
balance sheet and recognised in the income statement.

3.4  contract assets and accrued 
costs of services
3.6  leases
3.5 inventories
depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful lives of the assets. the expected useful lives on the overall asset 
categories are as follows:
•  terminals and administration buildings: 40-60 years
•  other buildings and building elements: 10-25 years
•  technical plant and machinery: 6-10 years
•  other plant and operating equipment: 3-8 years
•  land is not depreciated
the basis of depreciation takes into account the residual value of assets 
and is reduced by any impairment losses. the residual value is calculated 
on the date of acquisition and reassessed once a year. depreciation will 
be halted if the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset.
assets are transferred to assets held for sale if it is highly probable that 
their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than 
through continuing use.
assets held for sale, which amounted to dkk 110 million at 31 decem-
ber 2020 (2019: dkk 135 million), are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. the net gain is included 
in other operating income.
  management judgements and estimates
judgement is applied in determining the depreciation period and future 
residual value of the assets recognised and is generally based on histori-
cal experience. reassessment is done annually to ascertain that the de-
preciation basis applied is still representative and reflects the expected 
life and future residual value of the assets.
  accounting policies
contract assets and accrued costs of services include accrued revenue 
and accrued costs from freight forwarding services, contract logistics 
and other related services in progress at 31 december 2020. 
contract assets are recognised when a sales transaction fulfils the crite-
ria for revenue recognition, but no final invoice has yet been issued to the 
customer for the services delivered. 
accrued costs of services are estimated and recognised when supplier 
invoices relating to recognised revenue for the reporting period have yet 
to be received.
  management judgements and estimates
at the close of accounting periods, significant estimates are applied in 
assessing services in progress, including accrual of income and pertaining 
direct costs. these estimates are based on experience and continuous 
follow-up on services in progress relative to subsequent invoicing.
  accounting policies
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
the cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, processing and 
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition. 
write-downs of inventories to net realisable value are recognised as di-
rect costs in the income statement.
  accounting policies
whether a contract contains a lease is assessed at contract inception. 
for identified leases, a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liabil-
ity are recognised on the lease commencement date. 
upon initial recognition, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost cor-
responding to the lease liability recognised, adjusted for any lease pre-
payments or directly related costs, including dismantling and restoration 
costs. the lease liability is measured at the present value of lease pay-
ments of the leasing period discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease contract. in cases where the implicit interest rate cannot be 
determined, an appropriate incremental dsv panalpina borrowing rate is 
used. in determining the lease period extension, options are only included 
if it is reasonably certain they will be utilised.
at subsequent measurement, the right-of-use asset is measured less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any 
remeasurements of the lease liability. 
depreciation is carried out following the straight-line method over the 
lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset, whichever is 
inventories mainly consist of land and buildings under construction held 
for the purpose of sale in the ordinary course of business (property pro-
jects). in total, dkk 1,169 million relating to property projects was rec-
ognised as an expense in 2020 (2019: dkk 1,255 million).

shortest. the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the ef-
fective interest method and adjusted for any remeasurements or modifi-
cations made to the contract. 
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognised for low value 
lease assets or leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. these are 
recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. any service elements separable from the lease contract are also 
accounted for following the same principle. 
extension options are only included in the lease term if extension of the lease 
is reasonably certain. the majority of extension and termination options held 
are exercisable only by the group and not by the respective lessor.
management judgements and estimates
in accounting for lease contracts, various judgements are applied in de-
termining right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. judgements include 
assessment of lease periods, utilisation of extension options and applica-
ble discount rates.

right-of-use assets classified as land and buildings mainly relate to leases 
of warehouses, terminals and office buildings, whereas assets recognised 
as other plant and operating equipment mainly relate to leases of trailers, 
trucks, company cars, forklifts, it hardware and other office equipment. 
land and building leases normally have a lease term of up to ten years, 
whereas leases of other plant and operating equipment normally have a 
lease term of up to five years. 
land and buildings may include extension options with the intention of 
securing flexibility in the lease – however, any leasing period beyond the 
normal ten years expected at the initiation of the lease will normally be 
reflected in the contractual lease term agreed.

3.7 pension obligations
  accounting policies
pension obligations relating to defined contribution plans, under which 
the group pays regular pension contributions to independent pension 
funds, are recognised in the income statement for the period in which 
they are earned. contributions payable are recognised in the balance 
sheet under other current liabilities.
in regards to defined benefit plans, an actuarial valuation of the present 
value of future benefits payable under the plan is made once a year. the 
present value is calculated based on various assumptions, including the  
future development in wage/salary levels, interest rates, inflation and mor-
tality. the present value is only calculated for benefits to which the employ-
ees have become entitled during their employment with the group. the 
actuarial calculation of the present value less the fair value of assets under 
the plan is recognised in the balance sheet under pension obligations. pen-
sion costs for the year are recognised in the income statement based on 
actuarial estimates and the financial outlook at the beginning of the year.
differences between the calculated development in pension plan assets 
and liabilities and the realised values are recognised in other comprehen-
sive income as actuarial gains or losses.
changes in benefits payable for employees’ past services to the com-
pany result in an adjustment of the actuarial calculation of the present 
value, which is classified as past service costs. past service costs are 
charged to the income statement immediately if the employees have al-
ready earned the right to the adjusted benefits. otherwise, they will be 
recognised in the income statement over the period in which the em-
ployees earn the right to the adjusted benefits.
  management judgements and estimates
in determining pension obligations, management makes use of external 
and independent actuaries as basis for the estimates applied in measuring 
the obligations. the actuarial assumptions used in the valuations vary from 
country to country owing to national, economic and social conditions.
pension obligations
of these obligations, dkk 863 million relates to unfunded pension obli-
gations (2019: dkk 1,076 million) and dkk 356 million relates to partly 
funded obligations (2019: dkk 418 million).
total pension costs for the year
in 2020, net costs of dkk 621 million relating to the group’s pension 
plans were recognised in the income statement (2019: dkk 569 million) 
and break down as follows:

pension plan assets
development in the fair value of pension plan assets breaks down as follows:
dsv panalpina expects to contribute dkk 55 million to defined benefit 
plan assets in 2021 (2020: dkk 64 million). the composition of the 
pension plan assets is as follows:
sensitivity analysis
the following table illustrates the change in the gross obligation relating 
to defined benefit plans from a change in the key actuarial assumptions. 
the analysis is based on fairly probable changes, provided that the other 
parameters remain unchanged.
significant pension plans
the most significant defined benefit plans of the group relate to europe, 
with germany representing 59% (2019: 55%) and sweden 27% (2019: 
19%) of the total net obligation of dkk 1,219 million (2019: dkk 1,494 
million). no other countries have individual defined benefit plans of  
significance. the plan in sweden is a final pay scheme, which covers all  
salaried employees born in or before 1978 and is based on a collective 
labour agreement. salaried employees born in or after 1979 are covered 
by a defined contribution plan. 
the plan in germany covers both salaried and hourly workers. under this 
plan, employees earn a fixed amount for each year in service. the plan 
has been closed for new employees since 1994.

3.8 provisions
  accounting policies
provisions are recognised when, due to an event occurring on or before 
the reporting date, the group has a legal or constructive obligation and it 
is probable that the group will have to give up future economic benefits 
to meet the obligation.
provisions are measured on the basis of management’s best estimate of 
the anticipated expenditure for settle ment of the relevant obligation and 
are discounted if deemed material.
  management judgements and estimates
management continually assesses provisions, including contingencies and 
the likely outcome of pending and potential legal proceedings. the out-
come of such proceedings depends on future events, which are, by  
nature, uncertain. 
when considering provisions involving significant estimates, opinions and 
estimates by external legal experts as well as existing case law are applied 
in assessing the probable outcome of material legal proceedings etc.
provisions 
provisions have not been discounted as the effect thereof is immaterial. 
provisions are expected to be settled within two years in all material respects.
restructuring costs
restructuring costs relate mainly to the integration of acquirees and the 
restructuring plans previously announced, which consist mainly of termi-
nation benefits and costs under terminated leases.

chapter 4
capital 
structure and 
finances
this chapter includes disclosures on the fi-
nancial basis and exposures of the group’s 
activities derived by our capital structure and 
net working capital.
the capital structure is linked to our long-
term financial target of a gearing ratio below 
2.0 x ebitda before special items and the 
principles for capital allocation. 
in order of priority, the free cash flow is used 
to reduce the group’s net interest- bearing 
debt in periods when the gearing ratio ex-
ceeds the target, for investments and busi-
ness combinations, and for share buybacks or 
distribution to the company’s shareholders.
 
  accounting policies
share capital
at year-end, the share capital of dsv panalpina a/s amounted to 230 
million shares with a nominal value of dkk 1 each.
shares consist of only one share class and include no special rights, pref-
erences or restrictions. all shares are fully paid up.

capital structure
the capital structure of dsv panalpina is intended to ensure financial 
stability for the purpose of reducing the company’s cost of capital and 
maintaining sufficient financial stability to reach its strategic objectives.
the gearing ratio was 1.3 at 31 december 2020 (2019: 1.8). the 
target gearing ratio is below 2.0 x ebitda, but may exceed this level 
following significant acquisitions. 
capital allocation
the group aims to spend its free cash flow in the following order of priority:
1.  repayment of net interest-bearing debt in periods when the financial 
gearing ratio is above target;
2.  value-adding investments in the form of acquisitions or development 
of the existing business;
3.  distribution to the company’s shareholders by means of share 
buybacks and dividends.
net interest-bearing debt 
the group reduced its net interest-bearing debt by dkk 1,385 million  
in 2020. net interest-bearing debt can be specified as follows:

  accounting policies
the financial liabilities of the group are divided into four financing cate-
gories: bank loans and credit facilities, issued bonds, lease liabilities and 
other financial liabilities.
bank loans and other borrowings and loans obtained through the issuance 
of bonds are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction expenses.  
subsequently, the financial liability is measured at amortised cost, corre-
sponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest method,  
4.2  capital structure and capital 
allocation — continued
4.3 financial liabilities
so that the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is rec-
ognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. lease liabili-
ties are described in further detail in note 3.6.
other liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which, in all essentials, 
corresponds to the net realisable value.

distribution to the company’s shareholders
in 2020, the group spent dkk 5,031 million on share buyback and dkk 
588 million on dividends distributed (2019: dkk 4,888 million and dkk 
423 million, respectively). it is proposed to distribute a dividend of dkk 
4.00 per share for 2020 (2019: dkk 2.50).  
cash and capital restrictions
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and short-term liquid 
assets that are readily convertible to cash. of total cash and cash 
equivalents, dkk 930 million (2019: dkk 1,447 million) are subject

the ultimate parent company in denmark (dsv panalpina a/s).
insurance collaterals 
insurance collaterals constitutes security for outstanding insurance 
contracts sold to customers by dsv insurance. the amount is regulated 
and measured in accordance with laws and regulations issued by the 
danish financial supervisory authority.

commitments and amounts drawn on long-term credit facilities at 31 december 2020:
the group’s financial liabilities fall due as follows:
4.4 financial risks
liquidity risk 
the cash readiness of the group is ensured through short and long-term 
credit facilities from the main banks of the group and through the issu-
ance of bonds. the purpose of issuing bond loans is to diversify the group’s 
long-term debt, making the group less dependent on bank loans. 
the group’s bank and bond loans are subject to standard clauses, accord-
ing to which the group’s debt must be repaid in case of a change of con-
trol. the long-term credit facilities with banks are furthermore subject to 
one covenant. the covenant relates to the gearing ratio of the group 
and is reported on every quarter. the covenant has not been breached 
in 2020. 
the total duration of the group’s long-term loan commitments and the 
amounts drawn on its credit lines at 31 december 2020 are shown in 
the accompanying table. furthermore, a maturity analysis has been pro-
vided based on contractual cash flows, including estimated interest pay-
ments. the amounts have not been discounted and as such do not rec-
oncile directly to the balance sheet.
foreign currency risk
due to its global activities, the group is exposed to exchange rate fluc-
tuations to a certain extent. dsv panalpina seeks to eliminate foreign 
currency risks by hedging currency exposures centrally via the group’s 
treasury department. the risk exposure is managed on a net basis, pri-
marily by using foreign exchange forward contracts. 
the group’s foreign subsidiaries are not affected where trading income 
and costs are denominated in the local functional currency. this applies 
to a large part of the group’s subsidiaries. furthermore, a large propor-
tion of the income and expenses of the group are denominated in eur, 
and the total foreign currency risk is therefore limited.

4.4 financial risks — continued
the group is also exposed to foreign currency risks, partly on the trans-
lation of debt denominated in foreign currency other than the functional 
currency and partly on the translation of net investments in enterprises 
with a functional currency other than dkk. the former risk affects profit 
before tax. however, where debt is classified as hedging of net invest-
ments in foreign subsidiaries, fair value adjustments are recognised di-
rectly in equity under other comprehensive income. on recognition of 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries, the group is exposed to a trans-
lation risk when the profit or loss and equity of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into dkk at the reporting date based on the average rates of 
exchange and the closing rates. the need to hedge the parent’s net in-
vestments in subsidiaries is assessed on a regular basis. it is group policy 
to reduce net investments in group subsidiaries on an ongoing basis by 
distributing the subsidiaries’ profits as dividends. 
the group hedges booked external net currency positions and currencies 
with larger expected short-term operational cash flows for up to six 
months. at year-end 2020, 80% of expected six-month cash flows in 
usd were hedged. 
as hedge accounting is only applied to a limited extent, and we do not 
hedge currency exposure related to intra-group balances with no under-
lying cash flow impact, significant changes in currency rates, especially 
chf/dkk and usd/dkk, will result in more fluctuations in reported fi-
nancial items. unhedged intra-group balances at 31 december are high-
lighted in the main currency exposures table to the right. 
in general, the group does not hedge eur positions as it expects that the 
official danish fixed exchange-rate policy against the eur will continue.
the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exposures shows the effect 
of a 5% change in average exchange rates for the year on profit/loss 
(ebit) and the effect of a 5% change in year-end closing rates on other 
comprehensive income. the calculation method applied in the sensitivity 
analysis is unchanged compared to previous years.

4.4 financial risks — continued
interest rate risk
the group’s interest rate risk relates to the long-term floating-rate loans 
raised by the parent. these loans are partly converted to fixed rate loans  
by using interest rate swaps with a duration of up to 120 months. the 
group’s loans and credit facilities break down as shown on the pre vious page.
at year-end 2020, 81% (2019: 73%) of group borrowings were secured
either through fixed-rate loans or other hedge transactions. the duration 
of hedges relating to net borrowings of the group was 88 months (2019: 
34 months).
the weighted average interest rate on the group’s loans, credit facilities
and interest rate hedging was 1.3% at the end of 2020 (2019: 1.6%).
a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce profit for the
year by dkk 9 million (2019: dkk 15 million) and increase/reduce other
comprehensive income by dkk 12 million (2019: dkk 30 million), based 
on average net interest-bearing debt for 2020. the calculation method 
applied in the sensitivity analysis is unchanged compared to previous years.
credit risk
the group’s credit risk mainly relates to trade receivables.
the group is not dependent on particular customer segments or any spe-
cific customers, and all customers are subjected to individual credit assess-
ments and credit limits in accordance with the group’s credit policy. as a 
result, the credit risk of the group is generally considered insignificant. 
the group mainly hedges credit risks through the use of credit insurance.
for a limited number of customers, the group uses non-recourse fac-
toring. at the end of 2020, non-recourse factoring amounted to dkk 
1,407 million (2019: 1,402 million).
dsv panalpina is exposed to counterparty credit risk when entering into 
derivative financial instruments. in order to reduce this risk, dsv panalpina 
only enters into derivative financial instruments with the existing banks 
of the group whose credit ratings from standard & poor’s are long-term 
a or higher. 
as a general rule, the group only makes short-term deposits with banks 
rated short-term a-2 or higher by standard & poor’s and/or p-2 or 
higher by moody’s.
impairment of trade receivables
impairment of trade receivables are assessed on an ongoing basis and  
insurance policies taken out for the majority of these. 
at 31 december 2020, credit insurances amounted to dkk 15,163  
million, corresponding to 78% of total trade receivables (2019: dkk 
10,010 million or 55%). 
loss allowances for impaired trade receivables are provided for following 
an expected credit loss model. the model includes uninsured trade receiv-
ables and also factors in any own risk on insured receivables. expected 
credit loss at 31 december 2020 is presented in the following table:

4.5 derivative financial instruments
  accounting policies
derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date and are 
measured at fair value. positive and negative fair values are included in 
other current re ceivables or other current payables in the balance sheet. 
positive and negative fair values are only offset if the group has a right 
and an intention to settle several financial instruments net (by means of 
settlement of differences). fair value is determined based on generally 
accepted valuation methods using available observable market data.
when entering into contracts for financial instruments, an assessment is 
made of whether the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, including 
whether the instrument hedges recognised assets and liabilities or net 
investments in foreign entities. the effectiveness of recognised financial 
instruments is assessed on a monthly basis, and any in effectiveness is 
recognised in the income statement.
fair value changes which are classified as and fulfil the criteria for recog-
nition as a fair value hedge are recognised in the income statement to-
gether with changes in the value of the part of the asset or liability that 
has been hedged.
fair value changes in the part of the derivative which is classified as and 
qualifies for recognition as a future cash flow hedge and which effectively 
hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item are recognised in 
other comprehensive income as a separate hedging reserve.
when the underlying hedged item is realised, any gain or loss on the 
hedging transaction is transferred from equity and recognised together 
with the hedged item. 
fair value changes that do not meet the criteria for treatment as hedging 
instruments are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement 
under financials.

foreign currency risk hedging
the group mainly uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge  
foreign currency risks. the main currencies hedged are cny and usd. 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are used as fair value hedges  
of currency exposures relating to external balance sheet assets and  
liabilities as well as expected short-term operational cash flows. 
a gain on hedging instruments of dkk 76 million was recognised in the 
income statement for 2020 (2019: a loss of dkk 78 million). in the 
same period, a loss of dkk 1,131 million was recognised relating to  
assets and liabilities (2019: a loss of dkk 110 million). the net loss  
in 2020 primarily relates to unhedged intercompany positions.
interest rate risk hedging
the group has obtained long-term loans on a floating rate basis, implying 
that the group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations.
the group mainly uses interest rate swaps to hedge future cash flows 
relating to interest rate risks. thereby, floating-rate loans are converted 
to fixed-rate financing. 
the weighted average effective interest rate for existing interest rate in-
struments used as hedges of long-term loans was 0.8% at the reporting 
date (2019: 0.9%).

4.6 earnings per share
fair value hierarchy by category
dsv panalpina has no financial instruments measured at fair value  
based on level 1 input (quoted active market prices) or level 3 input 
(non-observable market data).
all financial instruments are measured based on level 2 input (input other 
than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly). 
derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of currency and interest rate derivatives is determined 
based on generally accepted valuation methods using available obser-
vable market data. calculated fair values are verified against comparable 
external market quotes on a monthly basis. 
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
the carrying value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost  
is not considered to differ significantly from fair value. 
 
trade receivables, trade payables and other receivables
receivables and payables pertaining to operating activities and with 
short churn ratios are considered to have a carrying value equal to  
fair value.

dsv panalpina annual report 2020

  accounting policies
when accounting for business combinations, the acquisition method is 
applied in accordance with ifrs 3.
acquirees are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date of acquisition. the date of acquisition is the date on which dsv 
panalpina obtains control of the company. entities disposed of are recog-
nised in the consolidated financial statements until the date of disposal. 
the date of disposal is the date on which dsv panalpina surrenders con-
trol of the company.
the consideration transferred as payment for the acquiree consists of 
the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities incurred to former owners 
of the acquiree and equity instruments issued. contingent considerations 
dependent on future events or the performance of contractual obliga-
tions are also recognised at fair value and form part of the total consid-
eration transferred. fair value changes in contingent considerations are 
recognised in the income statement until final settlement.
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are 
measured at fair value at the date of acquisition by applying relevant valua-
tion methods. identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they are sepa-
rable or arise from a contractual right. deferred tax is recognised for identi-
fiable tax benefits existing at the date of acquisition and from the per spec-
tive of the new combined group in compliance with local tax legislation.
the excess of the total consideration transferred, value of non-con-
trolling interests and the fair value of any equity investments previously 
held in the acquiree over the total identifiable net assets measured at fair 
value are recog nised as goodwill.
 
if measurement of the identifiable net assets is uncertain at the date of 
acquisition, initial recognition is done based on provisional amounts. 
measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts may be 
done for up to 12 months following the date of acquisition. the effects 
of cross-period measurement period adjustments are recognised in equity 
at the beginning of the financial year, and comparative figures are restated. 
after the end of the measurement period, goodwill is no longer adjusted. 
transaction costs inherent from the acquisition are recognised in the in-
come statement when incurred.
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of an ac-
quiree whose functional currency differs from the presentation currency 
of the group are translated into the functional currency of the foreign  
entity using the exchange rate ruling at the date of acquisition.
other than cross-period measurement period adjustments, comparative 
figures are not adjusted when acquiring or disposing of entities.
  management judgements and estimates
in applying the acquisition method of accounting, estimates are an inte-
gral part of assessing fair values of several identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, as observable market prices are typically not 
available.
valuation techniques where estimates are applied typically relate to de-
termining the present value of future uncertain cash flows or assessing 
other events in which the outcome is uncertain at the date of acquisition. 
more significant estimates are typically applied in accounting for prop-
erty, plant and equipment, customer relationships, trade receivables, de-
ferred tax, debt and contingent liabilities. as a result of the uncertainties 
inherent in fair value estimation, measurement period adjustments may 
be applied.
acquisitions and disposals
no material enterprises, non-controlling interests or activities were ac-
quired or divested in 2020.

5.1  acquisition and disposal of entities — continued
5.2  tax
in 2019, dsv acquired panalpina welttransport (holding) ag (panalpina)  
via a public exchange offer. no other material acquisitions or divestments 
were made in 2019.
panalpina was one of the world’s leading providers of supply chain solu-
tions with its core services comprising air freight, ocean freight, and 
logistics and manufacturing. panalpina generated revenues of approxi-
mately chf 6 billion in 2018 and operated a global network with some 
500 offices in more than 70 countries and 14,000 employees world-
wide. the acquisition substantially strengthened the air & sea division, 
which became one of the largest providers globally with close to 3 mil-
lion containers (teus) and more than 1.7 million tonnes of air freight 
transported yearly. 
consideration transferred
the consideration transferred for the shares in panalpina was made in 
dsv equity instruments by offering 2.375 ordinary dsv shares for one 
panalpina share. a total of 55,526,507 dsv shares were exchanged at a 
fair value of dkk 35,270 million based on the acquisition date share 
closing price of dkk 635.20 on nasdaq copenhagen.
the total consideration transferred amounted to dkk 35,829 million. 
adjusted for the fair value of cash and cash equivalents acquired of dkk 
1,975 million, the net consideration amounted to dkk 33,854 million.
in 2020, dkk 118 million was recognised as measurement period ad-
justments to the acquisitional opening balance. for further details, please 
refer to note 5.1 in the dsv panalpina annual report 2019.

  accounting policies
current tax
current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the balance sheet as 
tax calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on 
taxable income for previous years and for prepaid tax. 
tax for the year
tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax on profit or loss for 
the year, interest expenses related to pending tax disputes and adjust-
ments to previous years, including adjustments due to tax rulings. 
tax for the year is recognised in the income statement, unless the tax 
expense relates directly to items included in other comprehensive in-
come or equity.
deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised based on temporary differences between the 
carrying amount and the tax value of assets and liabilities. no recognition 
is made of deferred tax on temporary differences relating to amortisation 
or depreciation of goodwill, properties and other items if disallowed for 
tax purposes, except at the acquisition of enterprises, if such temporary 
differences arose on the date of acquisition without affecting the results 
or the taxable income. in cases where it is possible to calculate the tax 
value according to different taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on 
the basis of the planned use of the asset or the settlement of the liability.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards, are 
recognised as other non-current assets at the expected value of their 
utilisation, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by offsetting 
deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. 
deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are offset if the enterprise has a le-
gally enforceable right to set off current tax liabilities and tax assets or 
intends either to settle current tax liabilities and tax assets on a net basis 
or to realise the assets and liabilities simultaneously. 
72 
dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
consolidated financial statements 2020
deferred tax is adjusted for elimination of unrealised intra-group gains 
and losses. deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax 
rates of the relevant countries that will be effective under current legis-
lation at the reporting date on which the deferred tax is expected to ma-
terialise as current tax.

deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards are 
recognised if it is assessed that there will be sufficient future taxable in-
come against which the temporary differences and unutilised tax losses 
can be utilised. this assessment is based on budgets and business plans 
for the following years, including planned business initiatives. 
deferred tax assets are tested annually and are only recognised if likely 
to be utilised.
when considering tax and duties disputes, management applies signifi-
cant estimates of the likely outcome based on the knowledge available 
of the actual substance of the disputes, including opinions and estimates 
by external tax experts and case law, if available. the resolution of dis-
putes may take several years, and the outcome is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.

5.3 share option schemes
  accounting policies
dsv panalpina’s share option schemes are equity-settled, measured at 
the grant date and recognised in the income statement as staff costs over 
the vesting period. the offsetting item is recognised directly in equity.
the value of employee services received during the vesting period in  
exchange for share options granted corresponds to the fair value of the 
share options at the date of granting. 
the fair value of the options granted is determined based on the black  
& scholes valuation model. the assumptions used in the valuation takes 
into account the terms and conditions applicable to the options granted 
and management’s expectations of the various parameters on which the 
valuation model is based.
on initial recognition, an estimate is made of the number of share op-
tions that the employees are expected to earn. the estimated number of 
share options is adjusted subsequently to reflect the actual number of 
share options earned. 
the estimated volatility is based on historical data over the preceding 
three years adjusted for any unusual circumstances during the period. 
the valuation of the share options granted in 2020 and 2019 is based 
on the assumptions disclosed in the following table:

5.3 share option schemes — continued
share option schemes
dsv panalpina has launched incentive share-based payment schemes 
with the purpose of motivating and retaining senior staff and members 
of the executive board.
retention is motivated by requiring continued service for a period cover-
ing the vesting period as a minimum. the schemes are also intended to 
align the interests of employees and shareholders. 
all active schemes entail a three-year vesting period and a two-year ex-
ercise period. in case of a change of control, all outstanding share options 
will vest. exercise prices are set based on the quoted market prices lead-
ing up to the date of granting. the share options can be exercised by 
cash purchase of shares only. the obligation relating to the schemes is 
partly covered by the company’s treasury shares.
share options are granted pursuant to the procedures laid down in the 
group’s remuneration policy applicable in the relevant year.
a total of 2,378 employees held share options at 31 december 2020 
(2019: 2,010 employees). 
total costs recognised in 2020 for services received, but not recognised 
as an asset amounted to dkk 134 million (2019: dkk 117 million). 
the average share price for options exercised in the financial year was 
dkk 795.3 per share at the date of exercise (2019: dkk 619.1 per 
share).

the group had the following balances with associates at 31 december:
contingent liabilities
  accounting policies
contingent liabilities comprise possible obligations which have not yet 
been confirmed, are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably, but which, 
if realised, may result in a drain on the group’s resources. obligations are 
recognised in the financial statements only to the extent that the criteria 
for recognising a provision is met.
  management judgements and estimates
management applies judgements in assessing the existence of contin-
gent liabilities on an ongoing basis and in this regard considers if the 
criteria for recognising a provision is met. 
these judgements may involve advice from external experts, legal  
advisors, etc.
contingent liabilities 2020
as an international transport service provider, the group is regularly in-
volved in tax and vat disputes, legal proceedings or inquiries from com-
petition authorities. management believes that the cases currently iden-
tified will have no material impact on the financial position of the group.
a detailed disclosure of individual contingent liabilities is considered  
impracticable and has therefore not been included in the notes to the  
financial statements.
security for debt

guarantees to authorities, suppliers, etc.

described in the ‘auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements’ section of our report.  
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international 
ethics standards board for accountants’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and the additional requirements applicable  
in denmark. we have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  
accordance with the iesba code.  
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services re-
ferred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided. 
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of dsv panalpina a/s on 9 march 2017 
for the financial year 2017. we have been reappointed annually by share-
holder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of four 
years including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 
2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
revenue recognition, contract assets and accrued cost of services
the group’s revenue consists primarily of services, i.e. shipments of goods 
between destinations, which by nature is rendered over a period of time. the 
determination of timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the appli-
cation of the group’s accounting policies and terms in the customer contracts.
we focused on this area because the process of accruing for services ren-
dered around the balance sheet date (contract assets and accrued cost of 
services) is complex and dependent on relevant it controls in certain oper-
ational systems as well as management estimates, including methods and 
data applied and assumptions made by management. in addition, we fo-
cused on this area because of the significance of revenue and as revenue 
comprises a substantial number of transactions, including with different 
characteristics depending on which business segment the revenue relates to.
reference is made to notes 2.2 and 3.4 in the consolidated financial 
statements.
how our audit addressed the key audit matter:
our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the  
accounting policies for revenue recognition applied by management and 
assessing compliance with applicable financial reporting standards. 
we tested relevant internal controls, including it controls, concerning the 
timing of revenue recognition and evaluated whether these were designed 
in line with the group’s accounting policies and were operating effectively.
for revenue, contract assets and accrued cost of services, we examined 
reports concerning services in progress and challenged the assumptions 
made by management in this regard. 
moreover, we selected a sample of revenue transactions during the year 
and traced these to underlying evidence to ensure accuracy and existence. 
in addition, we applied data analysis in our testing of revenue transactions 
in order to identify and assess transactions outside the ordinary trans-
action flow. 
deferred tax assets and income tax positions
the group operates in many territories and is, consequently, subject to 
local laws and cross-border transfer pricing legislation, which complicates 
the group’s tax matters. 
86 
dsv panalpina annual report 2020 
statements
the group also carries significant deferred tax assets on the balance sheet 
that consist primarily of tax on provisions made at the balance sheet date 
and tax loss carryforwards. the utilisation of tax assets are, inherently, 
uncertain as they are dependent on the financial development of business 
activities in certain countries and regions. 
we focused on this area because the valuation of deferred tax assets and 
income tax positions is complex and dependent on management esti-
mates, including management’s applied model, data and assumptions. 
reference is made to note 5.2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter:
our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the 
group’s accounting policies and valuation models within the tax accounting 
area and assessing compliance with applicable financial reporting standards.
we also assessed management’s process for identifying and assessing 
complex income tax transactions as well as deferred tax assets that might 
not be recoverable. 
we tested provisions made in the tax accounting. as part of this, we re-
viewed correspondence with tax authorities and discussed methods and 
data applied as well as assumptions made by management. in doing so, 
we used our internal corporate tax specialists. 
moreover, we tested management’s assessment of the recoverability of 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differ-
ences and tax loss carryforwards on the basis of internal forecasts of fu-
ture taxable income, and evaluated the assumptions made by manage-
ment in this connection.
statement on management’s commentary
management is responsible for management’s commentary.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s com-
mentary, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsi bility 
is to read management’s commentary and, in doing so, consider whether 
management’s commentary is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s commentary includes 
the disclosures required by the danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s  
commentary is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatement in management’s commentary.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(‘ifrs’) as issued by the international accounting standards board (‘iasb’) 
and in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the eu and further require-
ments in the danish financial statements act, and for such internal con-
trol as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for  
assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management  
either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that in-
cludes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
the additional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional require-
ments applicable in denmark, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. 
we also: 
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, for-
gery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  
internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in  
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effec-
tiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s internal control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the rea-
sonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made  
by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the parent compa-
ny’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a mate-
rial uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audi-
tor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or,  
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclu-

sions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the 
group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the finan-
cial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial in-
formation of the entities or business activities within the group to ex-
press an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are re-
sponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independ-
ence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial statements, we performed procedures 
to express an opinion on whether the annual report of dsv panalpina a/s 
for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the filename 
dsvp-2020-12-31 is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance 
with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the  
european single electronic format (esef regulation) which includes  
requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in xhtml 
format and ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies 
with the esef regulation. this responsibility includes:
•  the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format;
•  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, including ex-
tensions to the esef taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements 
in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged us-
ing judgement where necessary;
•  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the consolidated 
financial statements presented in human-readable format; and
•  for such internal control as management determines necessary to en-
able the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the 
esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual 
report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report 
that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent of procedures se-
lected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the esef 
regulation, whether due to fraud or error. the procedures include:
•  testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format;
•  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging process 
and of internal control over the tagging process;
•  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the consolidated 
financial statements;
•  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl elements 
selected from the esef taxonomy and the creation of extension elements 
where no suitable element in the esef taxonomy has been identified;      
•  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements  
in the esef taxonomy; and
•  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consolidated  
financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of dsv panalpina a/s for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file name dsvp-2020-
12-31 is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation.

parent company financial statements 2020
1. accounting policies
as the parent company of the dsv panalpina group, the financial state-
ments of dsv panalpina a/s are separate financial statements disclosed 
as required by the danish financial statements act. the separate financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting 
standards board (iasb) and in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the 
eu and further requirements of the danish financial statements act. the 
accounting policies of the parent company are identical with the accounting 
policies for the consolidated financial statements, except for the following:
dividends from investments in subsidiaries
dividends from investments in subsidiaries are recognised as income in 
the parent company’s income statement under financial income in the fi-
nancial year in which the dividends are declared.
investments in subsidiaries in the parent company’s financial statements
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost. if there is any indication 
of impairment, investments are tested for impairment as described in the 
accounting policies applied by the group. if the cost exceeds the recover-
able amount, the investment is written down to this lower value.
currency translation
foreign currency adjustments of balances considered part of the total net 
investment in enterprises which have a functional currency other than 
danish kroner (dkk) are recognised in the income statement of the  
parent company under financials.
 
2. changes in accounting policies
all amendments to the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) ef-
fective for the financial year 2020 have been implemented as basis for pre-
paring the parent company financial statements and notes to the statements. 
none of the implementations has had any material impact on the state-
ments or notes presented.
3. management judgements
for the preparation of the annual report of dsv panalpina a/s, manage-
ment makes various accounting judgements that affect the reported 
amounts and disclosures in the statements and in the notes to the finan-
cial statements. these judgements are based on professional judgement, 
historical data and other factors available to management. by their na-
ture, judgements include a degree of uncertainty and actual results may 
therefore deviate from the judgements made at the reporting date. 
judgements are continuously evaluated, and the effect of any changes  
is recognised in the relevant period. accounting judgements considered 
significant in the preparation and understanding of the financial state-
ments of the parent company includes the following:
investments in subsidiaries
management assesses annually whether there is an indication of impair-
ment of investments in subsidiaries. if so, the investments will be tested 
for impairment in the same way as group goodwill, involving various esti-
mates on future cashflows, growth, discount rates, etc. at 31 december 
2020 and 2019, no impairment indicators were identified.
4. new accounting regulations
the iasb has issued a number of new standards and amendments not yet 
in effect or endorsed by the eu and therefore not relevant for the prepa-
ration of the 2020 parent company financial statements. these standards 
and amendments are expected to be implemented when they take effect. 
none of the new standards or amendments issued are currently expected 
to have any significant impact on the parent company financial state-
ments when implemented.
