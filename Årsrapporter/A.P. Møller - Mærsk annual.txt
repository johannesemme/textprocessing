a.p. moller - maersk is an integrated container logistics company, connecting and 
simplifying trade to help customers grow and succeed. with a dedicated team of 
over 80,000 employees, operating in 130 countries, we go all the way to enable 
global trade for a growing world. a.p. moller - maersk comprises four business 
segments with the consolidated key results presented below.
note: 2018 presented as if ifrs 16 had been implemented in 2018, for comparison purposes. for 2016 and 2017, lease liabilities are not included in net interest-bearing debt. 
consequently, comparatives for ebitda and net interest-bearing debt for the period 2016-2017 are not comparable with the period 2018-2020.
revenue increased by usd 850m, despite lower volumes in ocean and 
gateway terminals due to the negative impacts from covid-19.
net interest-bearing debt decreased by usd 2.4bn, mainly driven by 
increased free cash flow, partly offset by share buy-back, dividends  
and acquisitions.
relative co2 efficiency improved 2.5% (year-over-year) compared to 
2019 driven by both technical and operational improvement initiatives. 
1  percentage improvement in energy efficiency operational indicator (eeoi)  
relative to 2008 baseline. a more exact calculation was implemented in 2020,  
and comparison figures have been restated.
free cash flow increased by usd 2.3bn, reflecting a continued capital 
discipline and higher cash flow from operating activities, lower gross 
capex and a continued high cash conversion.
ebitda increased by usd 2.5bn, with improvements across all segments 
and with ocean improving the most by usd 2,1bn.

highlights
 progressing on the strategy
the transformation towards becoming the  
global integrator of container logistics accelerated 
in 2020 and all transformation metrics improved 
further. the metrics relate to growing the 
a.p. moller - maersk logistics business and improve 
earnings in infrastructure and logistics, while gen-
erating free cash flow to ensure a strong balance 
sheet and to create value for the shareholders of 
a.p. moller - maersk.
a.p. moller - maersk significantly improved the free 
cash flow and generated a cash return on invested 
capital of 16.6% (10.0%), based on stronger cash 
flow from operations, lower gross capex and 
slightly lower invested capital.
infrastructure and logistics revenue (excl. freight 
forwarding) increased to usd 9.4bn (usd 9.2bn), 
mainly due to increased revenue in logistics from 
warehousing and distribution, due to acquisitions, 
and supply chain management despite headwinds 
from gateway terminals, given impacts from 
covid-19.
significant improvement  
in profitability 
revenue increased to usd 39.7bn (usd 38.9bn) 
and the continued focus on a tight cost con-
trol, profitability and stronger rates led to a 
44% increase in ebitda to usd 8.2bn and a 
margin of 20.7% (14.7%). the strong improve-
ment was mainly driven by strong cost savings 
in ocean focusing on agile capacity deploy-
ment, lower bunker costs and an increase in 
short-term freight rates. logistics & services 
improved ebitda 110%, supported by margin 
optimisation in intermodal and increased prof-
itability in warehousing and distribution facil-
ities in north america, mainly driven by acqui-
sitions. gateway terminals reported an 8.3% 
improvement in ebitda despite of a 3.6% 
decline in volume, as a result of lower costs.
ebit improved to usd 4.2bn (usd 1.7bn) 
reflecting an improvement in the margin to 
10.5% (4.4%), while underlying profit was 
usd 3.0bn (usd 546m).
 guidance for 2021
a.p. moller - maersk expects earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisa-
tion (ebitda) in the range of usd 8.5-10.5bn, 
before restructuring and integration costs 
and free cash flow above usd 3.5bn. 
the outlook for 2021 is subject to uncertain-
ties related to covid-19, bunker fuel prices 
and freight rates given the uncertain macroe-
conomic conditions.
free cash flow improved due to  
significantly higher earnings and  
reduced capex
following the strong earnings development 
and a cash conversion ratio of 95% (104%), cash 
flow from operating activities was usd 7.8bn 
(usd 5.9bn). capex was usd 1.3bn (usd 2.0m), 
and free cash flow was usd 4.6bn (usd 2.3bn).
capex discipline remains a key focus area, 
reflected in the accumulated capex guidance 
of usd 4.5-5.5bn for 2021-2022.
 digital momentum
2020 has been a year that has reinforced the 
customer interest for a.p. moller - maersk’s 
digital offerings. maersk spot continued 
to gain significant traction during the year 
and the use of the maersk app increased by 
300%. twill has increased weekly volumes 
which was 13 times larger compared to the 
same period the previous year and new dig-
ital solutions such as maersk flow, neonav 
and the transformation management sys-
tem platform in the logistics business were 
launched to further enhance customer expe-
rience and engagement.
logistics & services ebitda (excl. freight for-
warding and restructuring costs) improved to 
usd 470m (usd 221m) as a result of margin 
optimisation in intermodal and warehousing 
and distribution, supported by the acquisition 
of performance team, a us-based warehousing 
and distribution company, as well as kgh cus-
toms services, a leading specialist in trade and 
customs services management in europe.
return on invested capital (roic), last twelve 
months, increased significantly to 9.4% (3.1%), 
as earnings were strong and invested capital 
decreased slightly. the underlying return on 
invested capital increased to 9.6% (3.2%).

message from the chairman  
and the ceo
real momentum as strategy  
delivers tangible results
the transformation of a.p. moller - maersk from 
a diversified conglomerate to a focused and inte-
grated global logistics company is well under way.
a.p. moller - maersk today offers a broad and 
global portfolio of logistics products from ocean 
and air transport to inland transportation, ware-
housing and distribution – including cold stor-
age, customs services and lead logistics prod-
ucts, such as supply chain management services 
and e-com fulfilment, as well as container port 
 services and towage.
our strategy is built on three core elements: 
firstly, we offer our customers end-to-end digi-
tally enabled transport and logistics services that 
help them manage their supply chains, sell their 
products globally, and source from the most com-
petitive suppliers worldwide. for us to deliver 
superior value to our customers, we have built our 
land-based logistics and service offerings in a way 
that seamlessly integrates with our strong, leading 
and sustainable ocean business. this enables us 
to leverage the commercial synergies inherent in 
selling land-based logistics services to our 70,000 
customers in our ocean business.

a.p. moller - maersk annual report 2020
message from the chairman and the ceo
directors’ report
secondly, we are leveraging the financial and 
operational synergies between our ocean busi-
ness and our terminals business for lower cost as 
well as higher productivity and asset utilisation. 
owning and operating container ports enables us 
to control our global transhipment hubs that are 
crucial for the reliability and cost effectiveness of 
our ocean network. 
and thirdly, we are building competitive advantage 
through technology. we are digitising the interac-
tion with our customers while offering unique dig-
ital products and leveraging maersk.com, which is 
one of the biggest b2b transaction platforms in 
the world. we are standardising, automating and 
digitising our core processes as well as our assets, 
such as ships, containers, warehouses and ports, 
to manage fuel cost and improve visibility in sup-
ply chains, while lowering the overall cost base.
disciplined execution enables us  
to perform and transform
since we embarked on our transformation to 
become the global integrator of container logis-
tics, we have executed the strategy consistently 
and with discipline. despite a backdrop of weak 
trade growth, ongoing trade tensions, geopoliti-
cal uncertainty and a pandemic in 2020, we have 
improved our financial performance while we 
transformed our business.
we achieved good results in a year with extraordi-
nary demand fluctuations due to covid-19, which 
led from a sharp oversupply of capacity in q1 to a 
shortage of vessels and equipment in the second 
half as demand rebounded, leading to a signifi-
cant increase in short-term freight rates. we leave 
2020 with a strong balance sheet which enable us 
to both increase payouts to our shareholders and 
fund the transformation that will enable the long-
term growth of the company.
the work we have done over the past five years to 
improve the performance of our ocean business 
delivered solid results in 2020. our acquisition of 
hamburg süd in 2017, our focus on cost, and our 
disciplined approach to capex were all contribut-
ing factors to the delivery of excellent results and 
strong cash flow in 2020. in parallel, we developed 
new, unique products such as maersk spot, which 
offers loading guarantee, easy online booking and 
a fixed price for our short-term customers.
our logistics & services business delivered excel-
lent margin growth in 2020 and good revenue 
growth, mainly through acquisitions. we restruc-
tured further to reduce cost and develop end-
to-end products. we began the implementation 
of new technology platforms and recruited new 
leadership and logistics experts globally. our 
logistics & services business grew revenue to 
almost usd 7bn with competitive margins and 
a sound foundation to accelerate growth in the 
coming years. 
in terminals, we have executed a turnaround since 
2016 and the business has shifted its focus from 
developing new terminals to becoming a world-
class terminal operator. results and cash genera-
tion have steadily improved, also in 2020, despite 
lower volumes. due to strong cost performance 
across all segments, we now have an infrastruc-
ture business with resilient returns.
continuing the transformation
at the annual general meeting in 2020, we 
announced three metrics to track progress on  
our strategic transformation. during 2020, we  
progressed well despite challenging market 
conditions:
• cash return on invested capital (croic), last 
twelve months, increased to 16.6% (10.0%), due 
to stronger cash flow from operations, lower 
gross capex, and lower invested capital.
• infrastructure and logistics revenue (excl. 
freight forwarding) increased to usd 9.4bn (usd 
9.2bn), mainly due to the acquisition of perfor-
mance team, a leading us-based warehousing 
and distribution company, only partly offset by 
lower revenue in gateway terminals because of 
the impacts from covid-19.
• logistics & services ebitda (excl. freight for-
warding) improved to usd 470m (usd 221m) as 
a result of margin optimisation in intermodal 
and supported by the acquisition of perfor-
mance team.
roic, which is the overall return ambition of 
a.p. moller - maersk increased to 9.4% compared  
to 3.1%, driven by significantly improved earnings.
strategic milestones strengthen  
integrated offering
in 2020, we finished the restructuring of our 
ocean and logistics & services businesses into 
one, integrated and simplified organisation to 
enable further improvements in the customer 
experience and end-to-end service delivery. 
“ since we embarked on our trans-
formation to become the global 
integrator of container logistics, 
we have executed the strategy 
consistently and with discipline.“
“ we have improved our 
financial performance 
while we transformed 
our business.“

a.p. moller - maersk annual report 2020
message from the chairman and the ceo
directors’ report
the safmarine brand and damco’s air and lcl 
(less than container load) offerings were inte-
grated into the maersk brand to enhance cus-
tomer access to the global offering, while damco’s 
ocean freight forwarding business has closed from 
1 january 2021.
in april 2020, we acquired performance team, 
and in september, we closed the deal on kgh 
customs services, a leading specialist in trade and 
customs services management in europe. both 
companies are logistics experts within their fields, 
customer feedback is positive, and we have added 
important capabilities and immensely strengthened 
our logistics offering and geographical footprint. 
on the digital side, we have benefited from our 
early investments in digitisation and seen a huge 
uptake on maersk.com and the maersk app, as 
customers have embraced the digital space even 
more this year on the back of the pandemic.
our customers also appreciate the predictability, 
reliability and ease that maersk spot offers. the 
online booking solution has grown exponentially 
from 20% of short-term volume in the last four 
weeks of 2019 to 51% in the same period of 2020 
under the maersk brand. twill, an online service 
for small and medium-sized businesses, has also 
experienced immense growth this year. in 2020, 
more than 2,500 new customers booked on twill 
with volumes exceeding 100,000 ffe, represent-
ing a 13 fold year-over-year growth.
 
in the terminal space, our pier 400 terminal in los 
angeles is progressing on a multi-year automation 
programme and has carried out the first commer-
cial, fully automated moves in the third quarter. 
digitising our assets enables speed, operational 
ease, safer operations and lower cost.
building competitive advantage  
from technology
technology and digitisation of our industry are 
key to the transformation at a.p. moller - maersk. 
through technology, we are offering new prod-
ucts, connecting and simplifying the customer 
experience and enabling more efficient operations 
and utilisation of assets. we want to build sustain-
able, competitive advantage through the follow-
ing focus areas:
firstly, we are building new digital platforms, 
which enable integrated offerings, standardisation 
and automation. in particular, tradelens, which is 
an open and neutral supply chain platform jointly 
developed with ibm, continues to gain momen-
tum as new customers, partners, and suppliers 
onboard. the tenants of this platform are already 
benefiting from increased visibility of events in 
their supply chains and reduced costs from having 
access to a digital bill of lading.
secondly, we are strengthening our investment 
in internet of things (iot) and automation of our 
terminals to drive better management of our 
physical assets and efficiencies in our operations. 
in particular, we are building a roadmap to har-
ness near real-time data from devices in our ves-
sels, containers and terminals and drive intelli-
gent decision making in our operations and for 
our customers.
thirdly, we are committed to leveraging data as a 
discrete and differentiating asset that will offer 
data products, such as visibility, and democratise 
access to data to serve our customers better.
our technology roadmap is enabled through a 
common and scalable enterprise architecture, 
a cloud-first strategy, and continued investment 
in digital cyber security. this is made possible 
through focused efforts to insource high-value 
it-capabilities to develop one of the leading it 
 organisations in the industry.
our response to a global emergency
the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact the 
world. as a global company and industry leader, we 
have remained focused on protecting our employ-
ees, supporting our customers and contributing to 
the societies we are part of by keeping goods flow-
ing throughout the pandemic – ensuring essential 
food, protective equipment and medical supplies.
our colleagues at sea, in our ports and at our 
warehouses have been in the eye of the storm. 
they have kept the world’s goods moving by 
showing up to work every day. in particular, our 
colleagues at sea have contributed by taking 
longer shifts on board than anyone would have 
imagined. our single biggest challenge has been 
to relieve our seafarers after their tour has ended, 
“ technology and digitisation  
of our industry are key 
to the transformation at 
a.p. moller - maersk.”
due to travel restrictions, closed borders and the 
constant change of local regulations and require-
ments. by the end of the year, we had succeeded in 
relieving due crew members from our vessels and 
bringing them home to their families and friends.
on shore, we have taken extraordinary measures 
to protect our workers at ports, warehouses and 
other frontline locations. our office-based col-
leagues have shown their resilience by adapting 
to working from home to the extent possible, and 
we have done our outmost to support this change, 
mentally and physically.
amid a pandemic that has large impacts on supply 
chains, customers need flexible and robust solu-
tions. with our integrated approach, we are sup-
porting their end-to-end logistics needs, while con-
trolling the most central assets and offering alter-
native solutions as borders close, air traffic stops 
and roads are blocked.

unwavering commitment  
to sustainability
sustainability continues to be at the top of our 
agenda, and we are fully committed to our ambi-
tion of reducing co2 emissions as we continue to 
work towards carbon neutrality in 2050. our cus-
tomers are supporting the ambition and demand-
ing responsible transportation of their goods so 
they can limit their own footprint, and this expec-
tation is also reflected among our investors.
in 2020, we updated our sustainability priorities. 
our key focus areas reached a level of maturity 
where they are now fully integrated into our busi-
ness practices.
decarbonising logistics is the one commitment 
where we can make the greatest contribution to 
climate action. in june 2020, the a.p. møller foun-
dation established the mærsk mc-kinney møller 
center for zero carbon shipping to take the next 
step to develop new fuel types and technologies 
together with a group of likeminded global indus-
try leaders.
 
the centre is a non-profit, independent research 
centre that will work across the entire shipping 
sector with industry, academia and authorities  
to find real-life solutions.
 
we would like to thank the a.p. møller foundation
for making this possible thereby demonstrating 
the essence of our shared values and strong lead-
ership in the efforts towards reducing the indus-
try’s carbon emissions to zero by 2050.
in addition, we remain committed to our broader 
sustainability agenda, including our role in multi-
plying the benefits of trade, contributing to halving 
food loss and improving the ship recycling industry. 
we are proud of the progress made so far and 
remain committed to all our stakeholders to be  
an innovative and responsible global integrator  
of container logistics.
2021 – continuing to perform while  
we complete the transformation
in 2021, we will continue to focus on growing our 
landside logistics, expanding our product portfolio 
to all relevant markets and increasing cross-selling 
and upselling to our customers to deliver profita-
ble, organic growth. in addition, we expect to con-
tinue to acquire capabilities and growth platforms, 
particularly within warehousing and distribution, 
air freight as well as customs services to further 
strengthen our integrated product offerings.
in ocean, our focus will be on developing our 
existing products further as well as adding new 
and unique products to our portfolio. we will 
remain focused on optimising our network and 
cost structure to ensure we stabilise earnings 
and deliver good, sustainable returns in our 
largest business.
in terminals, our focus continues to be on improv-
ing the operating performance of our portfolio of 
ports, financially and operationally. we will drive 
further synergies with our ocean business, com-
plete our automation project in los angeles and 
our construction project for a new terminal in 
abidjan, ivory coast, and mature plans for future 
growth in our portfolio, including automation.
thank you for your continued support
on may 1, we welcomed our new cfo and member 
of the executive board, patrick jany. patrick brings 
solid financial experience and a proven record of 
managing cost discipline and profitable growth 
through m&as and innovation. we are also happy 
to welcome blythe s. j. masters to the board of 
directors. blythe has added critical capabilities 
to the board with her international outlook and 
experience within financial services and tech-
nology, having extensive knowledge in start-ups, 
platforms and blockchain.
“ we are fully committed to our  
ambition of reducing co2 emissions 
as we continue to work towards 
carbon neutrality in 2050.”
we would like to thank our 80,000 colleagues 
deeply for their truly extraordinary efforts to keep 
trade moving under such challenging conditions.
in times of increased uncertainty, open supply 
chains and free global trade is more relevant than 
ever. we remain optimistic about society’s ability 
to recover and committed to building on the 
strong business momentum and foundation that 
has now been established as we enter another 
transformative year for a.p. moller - maersk.

financial review
a.p. moller - maersk reported an ebitda of usd 8.2bn, and usd 8.3bn excluding 
restructuring and integration costs, compared to the original guidance of around 
usd 5.5bn given in february 2020, and in line with the upgraded ebitda expec-
tations announced in november 2020. the increase in ebitda of usd 2.5bn was 
mainly driven by improved earnings in ocean, led by lower cost from agile capac-
ity deployment and lower bunker cost, as well as increased freight rates. logistics 
& services more than doubled its ebitda, while terminals & towage proved their 
resilience by maintaining profitability despite a strong impact from the pandemic. 
free cash flow increased significantly supported by strong cash flow from opera-
tions and continued capital discipline, and as a result, net interest-bearing debt 
has been significantly reduced and a second share buy-back launched.

financial and operational performance
a.p. moller - maersk reported a revenue of usd 
39.7bn (usd 38.9bn) with an increase in ocean of 
usd 393m with negative effects from covid-19 
on loaded volumes predominantly in q2 offset by 
higher short-term rates and a strong rebound in vol-
umes q4. in logistics & services revenue increased 
by usd 632m, driven by warehousing and distri-
bution including performance team acquired in 
april 2020, and air freight forwarding. terminals 
& towage and manufacturing & others reported a 
decrease in revenue of usd 141m and usd 122m, 
respectively, negatively impacted by covid-19.
ebitda increased by 44% to usd 8.2bn (usd 5.7bn) 
with increases in all segments, primarily in ocean by 
usd 2.1bn, driven by higher revenue and a lower cost 
base mainly due to agile capacity deployment com-
bined with a lower bunker price and consumption. 
this was also supported by the exceptional situation 
with demand surge leading to bottlenecks in the sup-
ply chain and equipment shortage experienced in the 
second half of 2020. logistics & services delivered 
a strong increase of 110% or usd 238m, driven by 
acquisitions and profitability increases in intermodal, 
air freight and warehousing and distribution. the 
impact from foreign exchange rates was negligible.
ebit was usd 4.2bn (usd 1.7bn), positively impacted by 
the improved ebitda, and the net result from the sale 
of containers, vessels and facilities, partly  offset by 
impairments du to the market environment in 2020.
return on invested capital (roic), last twelve months, 
increased to 9.4% (3.1%), as earnings improved sig-
nificantly and invested capital was slightly reduced.
financial expenses, net, amounted to usd 879m 
(usd 758m), positively impacted by lower gross 
debt, more than offset by negative foreign

exchange rate impacts and costs relating to pre-
payment of borrowings. 
tax decreased to usd 407m (usd 458m). the 
effective tax rate decreased as a larger proportion 
of profit before tax was earned in the ocean seg-
ment, subject to tonnage taxation.
net profit was usd 2.9bn (loss of usd 44m) due 
to significant improvement in operating earnings, 
while the result for discontinued operations in 2019 
negatively impacted the net loss of usd 553m due 
to a fair value adjustment with maersk drilling 
being demerged on 2 april 2019.
the underlying net profit after financial items 
and tax was usd 3.0bn (usd 546m), due to the 
improved operational performance.
cash flow from operating activities was usd 7.8bn 
(usd 5.9bn), positively impacted by an increase in 
ebitda of usd 2.5bn, a decrease in tax paid of usd 
77m, offset by negative change in net working cap-
ital of usd 239m (positive usd 476m), leading to a 
cash conversion of 95% (104%).
gross capital expenditure (capex) was usd 1.3bn 
(usd 2.0bn), and lower than guidance of usd 1.5bn 
due to lower investments in all segments.
free cash flow was usd 4.6bn (usd 2.3bn), posi-
tively impacted by higher cash flow from operat-
ing activities and lower gross capex, but partly 
offset by higher increased lease payments.
cash flow from borrowings was negative usd 1.9bn 
(negative usd 1.5bn), due to repayments of usd 
3.2bn, partly offset by usd 1.3bn of new funding, 
which was driven by precautions taken due to 
covid-19 in q2.
contractual capital commitments totalled usd 1.7bn 
(usd 1.7bn), of which usd 1.3bn is related to commit-
ments towards terminal concession grantors. strong 
commitment to capital discipline and free cash flow 
generation continue to be a key strategic focus.
capital structure, issue of bonds  
and credit rating
net interest-bearing debt decreased to usd 9.2bn 
(usd 11.7bn), as free cash flow of usd 4.6bn was 
partly offset by share buy-back of usd 806m, divi-
dends of usd 520m including dividend to non-con-
trolling interest, acquisitions of usd 425m, and a 
net increase in lease liabilities of usd 170m. net 
interest-bearing debt excluding lease liabilities 
decreased to usd 485m (usd 3.1bn).
a.p. moller - maersk remains investment grade-rated 
and holds a baa3 (positive) rating from moody’s and 
a bbb (positive) rating from standard & poor’s.
total equity was usd 30.9bn (usd 28.8bn), mainly due 
to a net profit of usd 2.9bn and addition of non-con-
trolling interest of usd 288m partly offset by div-
idends of usd 520m and share buy-back of usd 
806m, resulting in an equity ratio of 55.0% (52.1%).
the liquidity reserve of usd 11.0bn (usd 10.5bn), 
composed of liquid funds of usd 4.8bn excluding 
restricted cash (usd 3.8bn) and undrawn revolving 
credit facilities of usd 6.2bn (usd 6.6bn).
the ordinary dividend of dkk 150 per 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s share of nominally dkk 
1,000 (in total equal to usd 430m) declared at the 
annual general meeting on 23 march 2020 was 
paid on 26 march 2020. of the dkk 150, dkk 75 
was related to the underlying profit of the finan-
cial year 2019, and dkk 75 was related to gain 
from the sale of total s.a. shares.
the board of directors proposes an ordinary divi-
dend to the shareholders of dkk 330 per share of 
dkk 1,000 (dkk 150 per share of dkk 1,000) cor-
responding to 35% of underlying net result as 
per the company’s dividend policy of distributing 
between 30-50% of the underlying net result to 
shareholders in dividend.
the proposed dividend payment represents an 
ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% (1.6%), based on the 
maersk b share’s closing price of dkk 13,595 as of 
30 december 2020. payment is expected to take 
place on 26 march 2021.
share buy-back
the share buy-back programme initiated in 
q2 2019 was concluded on 24 july 2020 and 
a.p. moller - maersk has repurchased usd 1.5bn 
worth of shares.
on 1 june 2020, the cancellation of 156,977 
a shares and 627,938 b shares was completed 
we have a strong balance sheet and
are committed to remaining investment
grade-rated.
from our business model
corresponding to 3.77% of the total share capital 
in a.p. moller - maersk.
in november 2020, the board of directors decided 
to initiate a new share buy-back programme of dkk 
10bn (around usd 1.6bn) and the programme will 
run from december 2020 over a period of up to 
15 months.
this will conclude the distribution associated with 
the sale of maersk oil and any further distribution 
to shareholders will come from the continuing busi-
ness activities.
during q4, a.p. moller - maersk bought back 10,306 
a shares and 41,232 b shares worth dkk 673m 
(around usd 110m).
at 31 december 2020, a.p. moller - maersk owns  
a total of 119,176 a-shares and 505,281 b-shares  
as treasury shares, corresponding to 3.47% of the 
share capital.

full-year guidance  
for 2021
given the current outlook and high degree of uncer-
tainty related to the continued impact from covid-19 
on the economic growth and global demand patterns, 
a.p. moller - maersk expects for the full-year 2021: 
• underlying ebitda in the range of usd 8.5-10.5bn 
compared to usd 8.3bn in 2020
• underlying ebit in the range of usd 4.3-6.3bn 
compared to usd 4.2bn in 2020
• free cash flow (fcf) above usd 3.5bn compared 
to usd 4.6bn in 2020.
as part of the full-year guidance for 2021, 
a.p. moller - maersk expects the current exceptional 
situation with the demand surge leading to bottle-
necks in the supply chain and equipment shortage, 
which contributed by approximately usd 1.5bn to 
ebit in 2020, to continue in q1 and normalise there-
after. consequently, a.p. moller - maersk expects 
profitability in q1 2021 to be above q4 2020.
ocean is expected to grow in line with the global 
container demand at an expected 3-5% in 2021, 
with the highest growth seen in the first half-year.
for the years 2021-2022, the accumulated capex  
is still expected to be usd 4.5-5.5bn.
sensitivity guidance
financial performance for a.p. moller - maersk for the full year 2021 depends on several factors 
and is subject to uncertainties related to covid-19, bunker fuel prices and freight rates given the 
uncertain macroeconomic conditions.
all else being equal, the sensitivities for the full year 2021 for four key assumptions are listed in 
the table below:

market update
the global economy sharply deteriorated in the spring and early summer of 2020 as 
a direct consequence of the covid-19 led country lockdowns. since then, a moderate 
recovery occurred as countries partially reopened and households and businesses 
were supported by fiscal transfers. however, the pandemic entered a second wave 
towards the end of 2020, which adds to the downside risk in early 2021. social dis-
tancing and country lockdowns weighed more heavily on consumptions of services 
than on goods consumption, which supported a faster recovery of container trade 
compared to the broader economy, and at the end of 2020, global container 
volumes were higher than at the end of 2019. dynamics in economic activity, trade 
and demand patterns will be highly dependent on the further development of the 
covid-19 pandemic also in 2021 with the roll-out of a vaccine during the year.
goods demand recovered quickly  
during country lockdowns
as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pan-
demic, household salary income declined in 2020. 
while a substantial part of the income loss was 
compensated by extensive supporting fiscal pro-
grammes and monetary policy in many countries, 
total consumption demand suffered, some parts 
of consumption more than others (chart 1). the 
country lockdowns in h1 and the subsequent social 
distancing and travel restrictions led to a collapse 
in services consumption. at the same time, con-
sumers spent a larger part of their income on 
physical goods such as electronics and furniture 
on the back of the protected disposable income 
and pent-up demand. this pattern coincided with 
a surge in e-commerce. consequently, the fall in 
goods demand became much less pronounced 
than in services demand.
this development was most noticeable in the us. 
despite the ongoing partial lockdown, us per-
sonal disposable income rose by 6.3% in 2020, 
due to fiscal support through the cares act to 
tackle economic implications of covid-19. the act 
included recovery rebates and extra unemploy-
ment insurance benefits. however, a good part 
of the higher incomes was set aside as extra sav-
ings, and total us consumption decreased by 
around 4.6% in 2020. the consumption decline 
was entirely driven by services down by 7.3%, 
while goods consumption increased by 3.8%. the 
increase in us goods consumption drove up con-
tainer demand in h2. in fact, north american con-
tainer imports were 24% higher at the end of 2020, 
compared to the end of 2019. a similar division of 
growth between goods and services consumption 
was recorded in europe, although european 
covid-19 restrictions were tougher and the 
increase in goods demand was more muted.
going forward, it is highly uncertain if goods 
consumption will continue to drive up con-
tainer demand. the support from higher house-
hold income may diminish as unemployment has 
remained high and consumer confidence is well 
below pre-covid-19 levels. moreover, a continua-
tion of the massive fiscal support is uncertain in 
the near-term, particularly in the us, if political 
gridlock prolongs decision making. finally, house-
holds’ appetite for services, such as travelling, 
could initially take up a larger share of the wallet 
than usual if a vaccine becomes widely available 
and countries reopen later in 2021.

ocean market update
global container trade declined in 2020, follow-
ing the covid-19 pandemic. growth improved to 
around 5% in q4 2020, but the sharp contraction 
in q2 led to a full-year negative growth of 2%, con-
siderably weaker than in 2019. the 2020 slowdown 
reflected the broad-based crisis across all the 
main economies, although the h2 2020 recovery 
was faster than projections made during spring. 
the second wave of covid-19 weighs on the early 
part of 2021, while the roll-out of an effective vac-
cine could have a positive impact on h2 2021. 
effective supply growth was contained during the 
year, as the industry adjusted fleet capacity to the 
deteriorating demand, and market fundamentals 
were broadly balanced. however, a significant 
demand rebound in the us and partially in europe 
together with extensive equipment shortages drove 
up freight rates in h2, and freight rates increased 
by 18% compared to 2019.
covid-19 and container demand
container trade growth on the east-west trades 
declined by 2% in 2020 (table 1). european import 
growth from asia was heavily impacted by the 
covid-19 pandemic in h1 and declined by 13%, first 
by lockdowns in china and later by lockdowns in 
europe. the subsequent recovery in h2 was not 
strong enough to offset the initial decline. north 
american container imports from asia also declined 
in h1 by 9.5%, but inventory restocking and a sig-
nificant spike in us goods consumption fuelled by 
a housing boom and fiscal stimulus lifted full year 
import growth to around 4% in 2020. asian imports 
from the us and europe (east-west backhaul) 
showed a moderate decline during most quarters

north-south container trade dropped sharply in 
2020. latin american imports decreased by 9%, 
reflecting strong negative impact from covid-19 in 
all major economies in the region. african imports 
decreased by 5%. finally, intra- regional trades 
recorded a milder downturn, as mainly intra-asia 
with around 0% growth in 2020 proved fairly 
resistant to the global crisis.
as a covid-19 vaccine becomes widely available 
during 2021, there is reason to believe that con-
tainer demand will grow, possibly by 3-5% in 2021.

directors’ report
particularly q2 2021 will likely be high compared 
to q2 2020 when country lockdowns were at their 
peak. however, there is substantial uncertainty 
about the container demand outlook in 2021. 
the strong goods demand that supported con-
tainer volumes in 2020 could partially reverse if 
spending on services makes up for lost ground in 
2021. moreover, the continuation of adequate fis-
cal transfers in 2021 is uncertain. finally, labour 
markets remain under pressure, and unemploy-
ment rates are still significantly higher than 
before the pandemic broke out. upside potential 
mainly stems from further inventory restocking 
and a very fast and effective broadly distributed 
covid-19 vaccine that stimulates broad-based 
recovery in labour markets, incomes, and busi-
ness investment.
container fleet supply
the global container fleet stood at 24m teu at the 
end of 2020, 3% higher than at the end of 2019. 
deliveries amounted to 856k teu (135 vessels) 
and mainly entered the fleet in h2. 205k teu were 
scrapped, with most deletions occurring in q2 when 
container demand declined sharply. idling totalled 
1% (311 teu) of the fleet at the end of 2020. the 
idle fleet had increased extensively in the beginning 
of the year as the container industry adjusted the 
active fleet to the very weak demand (chart 2). as 
demand recovered in q3, the idle fleet was swiftly 
reactivated. effective capacity declined 3% in 2020 
(chart 2). 1,148 teu were ordered in 2020, corre-
sponding to orderbook-to-fleet ratio of 11% at the 
end of the year. according to alphaliner, the nomi-
nal global container fleet will grow by 4% in 2021.

last part of 2020.
bunker prices
towards the end of 2019, the industry’s switch 
to 0.5% sulphur fuel oils amid a tight and nerv-
ous market pushed low sulphur fuel oil prices 
higher. high sulphur fuel oil prices in singapore 
and rotterdam hence declined by 33% and 29% 
from 2019 to 2020, respectively, as market sup-
ply and demand dynamics calmed and the pan-
demic spread worldwide, averaging usd 273/
tonne and usd 248/tonne in 2020. similarly, low 
sulphur fuel oil prices fell by 34% and 37% in sin-
gapore and rotterdam from 2019 to 2020, aver-
aging usd 371/tonne and usd 329/tonne, respec-
tively. lower sulphur 0.1%s marine gasoil prices 
followed the downwards trend as it dived 35% 
to usd 390/tonne in singapore and 35% to usd 
367/tonne in rotterdam in 2020 over 2019. fuel 
oil prices have not fallen as drastically as the rest 
of the refined oil products in light of the demand 
destruction from the global pandemic and are 
supported by the strong and robust container 
shipping industry.
singapore strengthened its position as the 
world’s largest bunker port, with its total bunker 
sales increasing by an impressive 5% in 2020 amid 
a global pandemic and economic downturn. bun-
ker prices have experienced an extremely vola-
tile period last year at the crux of the covid-19-in-
duced pandemic. the difference between the low 
sulphur 0.5% fuel oil and high sulphur 3.5% fuel 
oil spread, also known as the hi5, plunged drasti-
cally since the start of the year, but there are signs 
that the spread may pick up in 2021 with singa-
pore continuing to be the more active pricing cen-
tre followed by rotterdam. a.p. moller - maersk 
expects further volatility in the fuel prices in major 
trading regions through mid-2021 during this 
uncertain period.
terminals and logistics &  
services market update
the other transport and logistics markets were in 
broad terms impacted by the dynamics and mar-
ket drivers that steered the ocean industry, above 
all the covid-19 pandemic. according to drewry, 
port throughput volumes decreased by 2.1% in 
2020, with ports in most regions recording nega-
tive growth rates. in line with projections for ocean 
trade, global port throughput growth is expected 
to grow significantly in 2021. the container 
port industry continues to combat structural 
challenges stemming from the cascading of large 
container vessels, reinforced carrier alliances and 
capacity increases in many ports.
the large shifts in global trade volumes in 2020 
also impacted the broader logistics segment. 
while the deterioration of trade and country 
lockdowns in h1 led to a volume decline in most 
segments, the subsequent recovery, above all in 
the us, supported volume activity in the freight 
forwarding market. the air forwarding market 
additionally gained from increased e-commerce 
trading during the lockdowns.

freight rates
freight rates, as measured by the china composite 
freight index (ccfi), were on average 18% higher 
in 2020 compared to 2019 (chart 3). while global 
supply and demand was broadly balanced, the 
unprecedented demand pick-up on key headhaul 
trades such as asia-us in h2 2020 together with 
vessel and equipment shortages and bottlenecks 
across the entire supply chain supported freight 
rates. asia to us west coast freight rates increased 
by 28%, and asia to us east coast rose by 18%. 
freight rates also increased on the asia to north 
europe trades, albeit at a more moderate pace of 
13%, but strengthened by 23% from asia to med-
iterranean europe. uncertainties relating to the 
strength of container demand continue to pose a 
risk to the developments of freight rates in 2021, 
including the normalisation of the situation with

  creating a portfolio of  
end-to-end products/services
an important element of the global integrator 
strategy is to strengthen the logistics product port-
folio, notably on the landside by improving and 
innovating existing products, as well as acquiring 
capabilities and product offerings through acquisi-
tions. in 2020, a.p. moller - maersk strengthened 
its product offering to customers along the end-
to-end value chain.
on 1 april, a.p. moller - maersk closed the acqui-
sition of performance team, a us-based ware-
housing and distribution company, which, com-
bined with the 2019 acquisition of vandegrift, a 
us-based customs services company, has meant a 
significant strengthening of the land-based logis-
tics services to us customers. on 2 september, 
a.p. moller - maersk closed the acquisition of kgh 
customs services, a sweden-based pan-european 
customs services provider, hereby enhancing the 
end-to-end offering to customers with european 
imports and exports. these acquisitions were 
part of a general upgrade and improvement of 
a.p. moller - maersk’s logistics & services busi-
ness, which through the year grew ebitda to usd 
470m or more than twice the size of 2019.
the ocean product offering was also strength-
ened through 2020 as the maersk spot product, 
launched in q2 2019, was rolled out globally and 
with its superior offering of transparent price and 
equipment guarantee, it saw strong uptake with 
customers. by the end of 2020, the spot prod-
uct made up 51% of the total loaded short-term, 
volumes under maersk brand (excl. sealand and 
hamburg süd), and is well under way to becom-
ing a.p. moller - maersk’s primary offering in the 
short-term market.
despite the subversive effects of covid-19 on the lives and business of 
a.p. moller - maersk employees and customers alike, the disciplined 
and consistent strategy execution continued and delivered tangible 
results through the year. financial performance improved markedly, 
and previous year’s efforts to improve customer service in general and 
digitisation in particu lar paid off. through outstanding efforts from its 
front line per sonnel, not least from its seafarers, a.p. moller - maersk 
took pride in being able to sustain its global operation and keep global 
supply chains moving throughout the pandemic.

2020 marked the fourth year of a.p. moller - maersk’s  
transformation from a conglomerate to the global integrator 
of container logistics.

a.p. moller - maersk annual report 2020
strategy
our business
directors’ report
with the launch of maersk flow in q3 of 2020, 
a.p. moller - maersk is now offering a digital supply 
chain management tool for mid-size customers to 
improve their supply chain performance through 
better visibility and control of their shippers, car-
riers and shipments. this marked the entry into a 
customer segment a.p. moller - maersk has earlier 
struggled to serve well and which was extra chal-
lenged by the supply chain disruptions caused by 
the covid-19 pandemic.
maersk neonav, launched in december 2020, 
have significantly upgraded a.p. moller - maersk’s 
capabilities in the supply chain planning and 
orchestration areas. with maersk neonav, 
a.p. moller - maersk is among others able to con-
nect customers’ demand data with data on inven-
tories and cargo flows and thus optimise these 
parts of the supply chain in near real time, leading 
to very significant value realisation. this innovative 
new product has been well received by customers 
with large, global supply chains and is currently 
in the implementation phase with two very large 
customers.

  seamless 
customer engagement
adding more products is fundamental towards 
becoming the global integrator of container 
logistics, but equally important is the ability to 
combine these products into tailored customer value 
propositions, and more effectively serve the cus-
tomers’ needs, notably through digital solutions. the 
covid-19 situation accelerated a.p. moller - maersk’s 
customers’ need for digital engagement and ser-
vices, and a.p. moller - maersk benefited from pre-
vious investments into its technology stack, includ-
ing maersk.com and other online offerings.
twill, a solution dedicated for small and medium- 
sized ocean customers, ended the year with weekly 
bookings in excess of 6,000 ffe, which was more 
than 13 times the weekly volumes compared to the 
same period the previous year. in july, a new digital 
offering, maersk flow, was introduced for small and 
medium-sized customers and partners to take control 
of their supply chain from factory to market. in octo-
ber, a new cloud-based supply chain management 
platform was launched, aimed at larger customers 
with complex supply chains. the new platform will 
replace a.p. moller - maersk’s existing offering and 
provide more integrated services and solutions, high 
levels of automation, self-service opportunity, as well 
as improved analytical functionalities.
another important platform and enabler of digitisa-
tion is tradelens, the open and neutral supply chain 
platform underpinned by blockchain technology, 
which a.p. moller - maersk is developing jointly with 
ibm. in october, the world’s second and third largest 
container carriers, msc and cma-cgm, announced 
that they were integrated onto tradelens. this 
means that tradelens now covers more than 50% 
of the global ocean market. the other parts of the 
tradelens ecosystem also grew in 2020 and now 
covers more than 120 ports/terminals, 24 customs 
authorities, and a growing inland presence.
from an organisational perspective, 
a.p. moller - maersk simplified its organisation in 
ocean and logistics further by streamlining the 
frontline organisation and integrating and clos-
ing down the safmarine and damco brands. fur-
thermore, a.p. moller - maersk initiated a re-or-
ganisation of the headquarter technology and 
commercial functions into a number of plat-
forms, each delivering dedicated business and 
customer outcomes. this reorganisation marked 
a further integration of digital technology into 
the a.p. moller - maersk organisation and enables 
faster and more agile development of new prod-
ucts and services, as well as a quicker and more 
effective modernisation of legacy technology.
customer satisfaction was impacted by the disrup-
tive effects of covid-19, but is now again increas-
ing and has remained strong with key customers 
throughout the year.

case: performance team
on 1 april 2020, a.p. moller - maersk closed 
the acquisition of performance team, which 
has further strengthened the capabilities of 
a.p. moller - maersk as an integrated container 
logistics company offering customers end-to-end 
services.
the integration of performance team’s engi-
neered solutions and distribution centre capabil-
ities to retail, wholesale and direct to consumer 
services with maersk warehousing & distribu-
tion0s regional network in the us and canada is 
progressing according to plan. in a time where 
transparency and resilience in supply chains have 
been increasingly important for customers, the 
extended offering of increased flexibility and 
value adding services have contributed signifi-
cantly to the growth of logistics & services with 
a revenue of usd 398m and an ebitda of usd 
59m. looking ahead into 2021, our focus will be on 
driving commercial synergies and cross-selling to 
maersk ocean customers as part of the integrated 
container logistics strategy.
transformation metrics
 
to measure the strategic transformation 
towards becoming the global integrator 
of container logistics and the ability of 
a.p. moller - maersk to create shareholder 
value, three metrics are tracked besides 
the overall roic target (see table).
on the back of the improvement in 
profitability and positive cash flow 
generation during 2020, positive 
developments were seen across all 
transformation metrics.
cash return on invested capital (croic), 
last twelve months, increased to 16.6% 
(10.0%), due to stronger cash flow from 
operations, lower gross capex and 
slightly lower invested capital.
infrastructure and logistics revenue 
(excl. freight forwarding) increased to 
usd 9.4bn (usd 9.2bn), mainly due to the 
increased revenue in logistics from ware-
housing and distribution and supply chain 
management, only partly offset by lower 
revenue in gateway terminals because of 
the impacts of covid-19.
logistics & services ebitda (excl. freight 
forwarding and restructuring costs) 
improved to usd 470m (usd 221m) due 
to margin optimisation in intermodal and 
warehousing and distribution, supported 
by the acquisition of performance team 
in april, as well as kgh customs services 
in september.

  superior delivery network 
end-to-end
the bedrock of the strategy of a.p. moller - maersk 
is a superior delivery network end-to-end, which 
delivers on fundamental needs for getting goods 
to the right place, at the right time, at the right 
price, with minimum environmental impact.
the covid-19 pandemic stressed the global sup-
ply chains to a degree never experienced before. 
a.p. moller - maersk takes pride in being able to 
continue to serve its customers’ global trans-
portation needs and supply chains throughout 
the year under very difficult circumstances. 
a.p. moller - maersk was never closed for business.
the many challenges caused by the pandemic 
and the related volatility in supply and demand 
emphasised the strength of having operational 
control over the critical parts of the global logis-
tics supply chains. a.p. moller - maersk was able to 
leverage its operational control of vessels, ware-
houses, and terminals and co-developed new 
innovative solutions and products with customers 
in response to the disruptions. the main customer 
problems typically related to speed and/or flexi-
bility of the supply chain, and examples of new 
solutions were storage in transit, dedicated air 
charters, and seaborne e-commerce solutions.
“ having premium assets in  
warehousing and distribu-
tion in 2020 was vital to meet  
unprecedented cus to mer 
demand and keep pace  
with ecommerce growth.”

can you tell me a bit about  
your business?
» isaac h. grainger & son ltd. is a 150-year-old 
manufacturing company based outside birming-
ham in the uk. we manufacture metal products 
for raised access flooring, which is the type of 
floor you’re standing on in your office so that you 
can plug your computers into the floor or install 
air conditioning rather than cables coming down 
the wall. we manufacture this product in the uk 
and in india, and it’s used around europe.
what are your biggest pain points when  
it comes to transport and logistics?
» to manufacture the full flooring system, we 
need to ship products from the uk to spain and 
from india to the uk and spain. that’s where 
seamless, door-to-door shipping becomes very 
important. 
» we’re not a huge customer that ships thousands 
of containers and has a fixed contract. we order 
containers as we need them, and the biggest issue 
for us has been reliability as we operate with a 
door-to-door policy. this means that if a customer 
wants a container, we need to tell them the cost 
of the product, the transportation cost and the 
arrival date. the biggest problem has been to get a 
price as this could take as long as two weeks via an 
agent or freight forwarder. the delivery was also 
very hard to track and manage when it wasn’t on a 
vessel. twill solved these problems.

lutely critical as we’re known for producing prod-
ucts with fairly short notice. the customers don’t 
care if we manufacture in the uk or in india, they 
just want their product delivered to the construc-
tion site on time. 
how far can platforms such as twill take 
you in overcoming these challenges?
» the platform is very useful. if i log into twill today, 
i should be able to, let’s say ship a container in ten 
days’ time from india to our factory outside madrid, 
spain, by checking the available ships and the price.
» if our factory manager in india says we’re able 
to ship a bit earlier, i can do this via the platform 
rather than having to call someone and wait for 
confirmation. this flexibility is very important 
to us because we save time and hassle. shipping 
should be like amazon, that’s the standard these 
days. twill knows who you are, you make your 
booking, get confirmation and my guys in india can 
log in and talk to their twill contact locally – it’s a 
smooth system. 
» our specialty is not logistics. in the past, we spent 
10-15% of our time chasing logistics. our specialty 
is manufacturing steel products and that’s where i 
want to spend my time. that’s why i’m enthusiastic 
about twill as there wasn’t anything like it when it 
came. it’s like amazon for shipping.

sustainability
in an unprecedented year of pandemic, sustainability remained  
at the top of the agenda of a.p. moller - maersk and core to the  
its values. efforts on decarbonisation are being intensified while 
integrating sustainability even further into business strategy.
our commitments 
on decarbonisation
a.p. moller - maersk’s sustainability efforts have 
matured over the last decade with increasing 
ambitions matching the maturity of the field 
and the expectations of leading customers. 
a.p. moller - maersk wants to take responsibility  
in line with the company’s values and commit-
ments, and to assume a leadership position on 
global issues where the competencies and lever-
age are sufficient to make a real difference.
in 2020, this approach led to a review of the 
sustainability strategy, customer expectations, 
climate scenarios and transition pathways. 
as a result, ambitions on sustainability are 
being intensified with decarbonisation as the 
single-most important strategic sustainability 
imperative, and further integrating sustainability 
priorities in a.p. moller - maersk’s global inte-
grator strategy.
continued acceleration of expectations from 
key stakeholders for companies to manage 
their impact on sustainability was seen in 2020. 
the financial community is asking companies 
to demonstrate credible decarbonisation plans 
that align with the paris agreement’s 1.5 target 
across the full supply chain, considering the 
physical effects of climate change and securing 
a viable business for the future.
this is true not only for a.p. moller - maersk, but 
for customers as well, as they convert the finan-
cial sector demands on their business, and the 
opportunities they see for carbon-neutral prod-
ucts in the consumer market, into requirements 
for a.p. moller - maersk to deliver a decarbonised 
supply chain solution. today, 90 of the 200 most 
important customers have set or are in the process 
of setting ambitious science-based or zero carbon 
targets covering their supply chain.
furthermore, lawmakers – particularly the eu – 
are moving rapidly on legislation related to sus-
tainability, also on issues beyond climate change 
and decarbonisation. for example, the eu is enact-
ing the taxonomy on sustainable activities, which 
through demands on the financial community will 
push requirements for transparency and reliable 
data on to other sectors, and it is expected to intro-
duce mandatory requirements for companies to 
conduct social and environmental due diligence 
in their supply chains.

a new level of integration
the approach of a.p. moller - maersk and this land-
scape of expectations were driving forces behind 
the decision to fully integrate sustainability into 
business activities, which was announced at the 
end of 2019. to fully deliver on sustainability as 
a strategic imperative, responsibilities must be 
embedded in the business and owned by business 
leaders. governance and organisational struc-
tures that correspond with this decision have been 
established, including a dedicated decarbonisa-
tion function.
decarbonising logistics
as an industry leader and with the resources avail-
able at hand, a.p. moller - maersk has an obligation 
to do what it can to get to a carbon-neutral fleet 
as fast as possible, and to help customers decar-
bonise global supply chains end-to-end.
vessel decarbonisation is beyond comparison the 
area with the greatest direct impact. the majority 
of efforts and investments in the near future will 
be on decarbonising ocean activities, as this holds 
the potential for the greatest impact and market 
leadership that enables setting the direction for 
an entire industry. however, expanding customer 
offerings in line with being the global integrator 
also makes it necessary to identify how the end-
to-end supply chain can be decarbonised.
 
sustainability priorities for the global integrator 
strategy were defined in 2020: enabling sustaina-
ble trade by decarbonising logistics, sustainability 
in our end-to-end offerings and responsible busi-
ness practices. taking leadership on decarbonisa-
tion of logistics is the single-most important stra-
tegic sustainability priority for a.p. moller - maersk, 
as decarbonisation of the fleet is the area beyond 
comparison with the greatest potential for impact. 
furthermore, a.p. moller - maersk aims to increase 
focus on sustainability in end-to-end offerings 
in response to the increased responsibility and 
opportunity to manage supply chain risks for cus-
tomers as part of its global integrator business 
strategy. commitments on inclusive trade, food 
loss and ship recycling are now fully owned and 
driven in the line of business. responsible business 
practices continue to form the strong foundation 
including solid governance structures, accounta-
bility and transparency on policies, commitments 
and performance across sustainability issues.
a.p. moller - maersk’s business activities  enable 
open, inclusive and sustainable global trade, and 
the company continues to actively engage in the 
global debate through advocacy, projects and 
partnerships. even more importantly still more 
elements are being added to the products and ser-
vices offered that can ease the access of smes 
to participate in and benefit from global trade. 
a.p. moller - maersk’s work on helping to halve 
food loss during transportation is run as an inte-
grated part of the cold chain logistics business of 
a.p. moller - maersk, focusing on developing and 
scaling solutions to connect and integrate cus-
tomers’ cold chains. this area now covers several 
hundred customers across nearly 50 countries. 
investments made by the company’s venture arm, 
maersk growth, also contribute to the overall sus-
tainable development goal of reducing food loss.
the decarbonisation strategy spans across three 
complementary pathways:
building a market for carbon-neutral 
 shipping
building on customers’ increasing momentum, 
integration of a new commercial strategy on sus-
tainability began, aiming to respond to and aid 
customers on their decarbonisation journey.
one key feature in this is the maersk eco delivery 
product. launched in 2019, it remains one of only 
a few options for carbon-neutral shipping on the 
global market so far. read more about the product

importantly, this product demonstrates that the 
commoditised freight market is open for price 
differentiation. driven by the end-consumers’ 
increased willingness to pay for sustainability, and 
growing climate urgency, this represents a solid 
contribution to the development of a business 
model for decarbonised logistics and transport. 
a multi-tier value proposition has been developed, 
as a way to respond to relevant customer needs 
aligned with their maturity and ambition level for 
carbon reductions, and building stronger ties and 
partnerships with the group of customers who 
also have ambitious decarbonisation strategies.
 
technology: the future of fuels
in the past two years extensive analyses of the 
available technology and fuel options for net-
zero operations have been conducted. based on 
this work, four primary pathways are being pur-
sued, as seen in the table.
in response to the increased urgency of deliv-
ering on decarbonisation, a.p. moller - maersk’s 
position is that the right thing to do is to leap-
frog to pure net-zero vessel technology with-
out any transitional technologies.
 
 
fuel transformation involves the entire supply 
chain, and part of the work consists of overcoming 
barriers to progress, including scaling fuel produc-
tion and associated technology, lack of fuel infra-
structure and safety related issues, while manag-
ing the impact on company profitability.
policies: the need for broad-based action
the final piece of the decarbonisation strategy 
relates to the policy frameworks established to 
further this process. policies must not only secure 
that lowest performers are held accountable, but 
also that first movers are rewarded for the risks 
taken on behalf of the whole industry.
with very few exceptions the political and thus leg-
islative debate is currently not moving fast enough 
to fulfil its role. a.p. moller - maersk advocate for 
more ambitious targets in the international mari-
time organization (imo) and for lawmakers to build 
incentive structures that reward first movers and 
remove a share of the financial risk related to decar-
bonisation. there is a risk that regulators are out  
of sync with the progress and development pushed 
by industry, which would be to no one’s benefit.
 
at regional level, there is no doubt that shipping 
will be part of the eu emissions trading system 
within a few years. however, this needs to be done 
with the objective of actually lowering shipping 
emissions and with a view to supporting an inter-
national greenhouse gas (ghg) reduction agree-
ment, while still supporting modal shift of cargo 
to sea, which will remain the most sustainable 
way of transporting large quantities of cargo.
frontline heroes stuck at sea
enabling global trade has been 
a.p. moller - maersk’s finest task for decades. in 
extraordinary circumstan ces, due to the covid-19 
pandemic, a.p. moller - maersk employees across 
the world have gone to extraordinary lengths 
during 2020 to keep goods moving freely from 
the start of the pandemic.
a.p. moller - maersk’s executive leadership 
established that the company’s focus during the 
covid-19 crisis would be on three priorities: pro-
tecting our people, supporting our customers, and 
helping society get through the crisis.
everyone’s safety was sought to be ensured by 
enabling employees to work from home wherever 
possible, providing personal protection equipment, 
and changing procedures to allow for adequate dis-
infection of equipment in for example port termi-
nals. the greatest challenge has been for seafarers.
normally, a crew member stays on a vessel from 
two to six months. the maritime labour conven-
tion states that crews can spend a maximum of 11 
months on board. these norms were broken in 2020, 
as crew changes were made impossible by restric-
tions on entry to countries and travel restrictions. 
at its highest point, more than 2,500 out of 6,000 
colleagues could not be relieved of their duties.
the challenge was brought to the highest levels at 
the un and imo as well as to legislators and ngos, 
and agreements with governments, airlines, airport 
operators, hotels and port authorities were estab-
lished to enable crews to have essential worker sta-
tus and safely travel to and from major port hubs 
with major international airports, including spe-
cial a.p. moller - maersk charter flights. company 
quarantine safe centres were created in strate-
gic locations as well as hubs for local quarantine in 
high volume areas. these measures helped seafar-
ers reach their destination and by the end of the year 
overdue crew members were relieved.

to help society in the fight against the pandemic, the 
capabilities and partnerships of a.p. moller - maersk, 
including the logistics emergency team, were 
put to use to support communities, countries and 
regions. the company also endorsed a world eco-
nomic forum charter in support of safe and sus-
tainable distribution of covid-19 vaccines globally. 
a.p. moller - maersk is heavily involved in develop-
ing a global plan for distribution of vaccines, with 
planning for large-scale distribution beginning in 
the summer of 2020, including the establishment 
of a global logistics partnership with covaxx to 
distribute up to a billion doses of the covaxx vac-
cine worldwide in 2021.
safety differently
integrating the updated approach to safety across 
the company continued with positive examples 
of progress and true mitigation of risks to human 
health through new processes of collaboration 
and deliberation.
in 2020, the safety organisation was reorganised 
to reinforce that a.p. moller - maersk has one and 
only one safety strategy, which is implemented 
and enforced equally across the company. the 
new central safety and resilience team creates 
a strong pool of resources and tools, including 
implementation support available at all levels 
across the company. in this way, the integrated 
company that a.p. moller - maersk is becoming is 
being matched and mirrored, assuring custom-
ers that when they leave their supply chain obli-
gations in the hands of a.p. moller - maersk, the 
capacity for safe operations is in place.
deeply regrettable, one person lost his life while 
performing tasks under a.p. moller - maersk 
management, when a roofer working for a con-
tractor fell as scaffolding collapsed after being hit 
by a crane that tipped. this tragic event reinforces 
the company’s commitment to working more 
with suppliers on safety and sustainability issues.
commitment to responsible  
ship recycling
four years after the first a.p. moller - maersk 
vessel landed in a ship recycling yard in alang, 
india, an impact study clearly demonstrated very 
significant improvements in safety, environ-
ment, workers’ conditions and access to health 
in the wider community. the ambition is to cre-
ate responsible ship recycling opportunities that 
are also commercially viable for the ship owners 
and changing the ship recycling industry at the 
same time.
 
 
the prospect of broad, sustained change is, how-
ever, challenged. no yards from the alang area 
– despite collaboration with the eu commission 
and investments over the past two years – have 
yet been included in the eu list of yards outside 
the oecd that can be legally used for recycling 
of ships registered in eu countries. in addition, a 
new legislative barrier has arisen, because legisla-
tion has come into force that prohibits exporting 
of hazardous waste from a list of oecd countries 
to developing (non-oecd) countries, which some, 
including the eu commission, are applying to ves-
sels for recycling. this has currently stalled the 
alang yard applications and now awaits an inter-
nationally negotiated resolution of this regulatory 
challenge.
this situation is highly detrimental to the deve-
lopments in alang, as well as to ship owners. 
a.p. moller - maersk’s position, based on thorough 
legislative analysis, is that there are legal options 
available to the eu, and the company is engaging 
with a multitude of stakeholders to find both a 
short and long-term solution to this gridlock.
a further challenge is that within the next few 
years, even larger vessels than today will be near-
ing end of life and ready for recycling, but these 
vessels will be too large for many of the yards 
offering financially viable solutions.
because the work in alang documents that 
responsible ship recycling is possible outside 
yards in oecd countries, a.p. moller - maersk’s 
ambition for the work on ship recycling has 
changed from radically changing the industry, 
starting in alang, to creating opportunities for 
responsible ship recycling globally.
imo 2020 conversion successful
from january 2020, the imo’s 0.5% global cap on 
the content of sulphur in fuels came into effect. 
the enforcement mechanism for this legislation is 
a ban on carrying non-compliant fuels on vessels, 
except for vessels where scrubbers are installed to 
clean exhaust gasses.
the main concern in the years leading up to 
the cap taking effect was uneven enforcement. 
while the level of control is not as stringent as 
a.p. moller - maersk would prefer, there is no indi-
cation that compliance is lacking. oil market shares 
are a useful proxy for this, and it appears that the 
low-sulphur fuel uptake is at the expected level.
a.p. moller - maersk has installed open-loop 
scrubbers on a share of the vessels as a risk man-
agement measure, as the price gap between heavy 
fuel oil and low-sulphur fuel was expected to be 
significant. the use of scrubbers remains a dis-
cussion point and no independent, global survey 
of the effects of scrubbers has yet been produced 
to support global legislation. increasingly, legis-
lation is being implemented regionally, for exam-
ple in the eu and in some us states and australia, 
requiring vessels to shut off the scrubber system 
when entering near-coastal waters and switch to 
low-sulphur fuel.
the a.p. moller - maersk 2020 sustainability 
report provides more information about the work 
and progress on sustainability priorities. for an

our customers, and helping society to  
get through the crisis.

risk management
risk management at a.p. moller - maersk is strategically focused 
and designed to contribute to the achievement of the company’s 
business objectives in the medium-term and to ensure the  
longevity of the company in the long-term.
a.p. moller - maersk is accelerating its transforma-
tion to become the global integrator of container 
logistics. the transformation success hinges on the 
ability to perform and transform at the same time 
through deployment of critical change levers such 
as technology, processes and people. it is essential 
that risks inherent to the business activities and 
risks associated with the transformation are man-
aged well to keep the potential financial and reputa-
tional impact of such risks within acceptable levels.
with a defined roadmap in place for the trans-
formation, the risks associated with the 
transformation at its current stage are largely 
execution risks relating to, e.g., customer service 
levels, technology roadmap, market risks for 
the ocean segment, growth capabilities for the 
logistics & services segment, and people capa-
bilities. these risks require active management 
and monitoring as described in the 2021 key risk 
analysis described below.
a.p. moller - maersk is exposed to a variety of risks 
in the conduct of its business and execution of its 
strategy. a.p. moller - maersk has a well-established 
enterprise risk management (erm) process to 
 the coronavirus (covid-19) 
the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact the 
global economy and the world’s supply chains. the 
global demand growth for containers contracted by 
around 2% in 2020, albeit with large fluctuations in 
demand during the year. overall, a.p. moller - maersk 
was able to manage the impact on demand through 
tight cost and agile capacity deployment.
after the initial steep disruption of demand in the 
first quarter, a strong and unexpected recovery in 
the demand for containerised goods during a period 
where services remained curtailed, implied an extreme 
challenge to cope with in terms of cost and capacity 
management.
as a.p. moller - maersk manages its way through  
the pandemic, three objectives continue to guide 
its decisions: protecting its employees, serving its 
customers by keeping its global network and ports 
operating, and helping societies fight the virus.
proactive risk management, deployment of effective 
crisis and business continuity management, and a 
strong resolve from employees ensure that so far, the 
operational impact of covid-19 has been minimised.
one of the biggest covid-19 challenges for 
a.p. moller - maersk has been performance of crew 
changes for the vessels, mainly due to prevailing restric-
tions. a.p. moller - maersk proactively addressed this 
serious issue through collaboration with governments, 
airlines, airport operators, hotels, and port authorities, 
and use of special a.p. moller - maersk charter flights.
the pandemic continues to impact the transportation 
and logistics industry operationally and financially. 
it is difficult to predict the business impact in 2021, 
which will depend wholly on the duration of the pan-
demic and the resulting lockdowns of countries and 
economies globally, as well as on the associated 
changes in demand patterns.

identify, assess and respond to key risks that can 
threaten a.p. moller - maersk’s ability to achieve 
its business objectives. the process is integrated 
into strategy review, business planning and per-
formance management.
each year, risks are identified and assessed follow-
ing a comprehensive process covering the enter-
prise and the individual brands. the enterprise 
risks identified are validated for relevance and sig-
nificance by senior business leaders. finally, the 
executive leadership team reviews the risks and 
decides the key risks to the strategy and the busi-
ness plan.
the executive leadership team appoints a risk 
owner for each key risk to oversee the manage-
ment of the risk, including the preparation and 
execution of mitigation action plans. once the 
plans for the management of the risks are final-
ised, the progress and effect of such plans are 
monitored by the executive leadership team and 
the audit committee in designated and regular 
sessions. where the progress of mitigating actions 
is falling behind schedule, or where mitigating 
actions are not achieving the effect they were 
designed to have, corrective actions are taken.
the erm process for 2021 was carried out in the 
second half of 2020. it identified ten key risks that 
may have a significant impact on the business 
plan, including on earnings, financial position and 
achievement of other strategic objectives.
2021 key risk analysis
the key risks to achieving the a.p. moller - maersk 2021-2025 business plan,  
the assessment of each risk, and the mitigation strategies deployed are described  
in the following.
during 2020, a.p. moller - maersk has worked sys-
tematically on mitigating key risks shown in the 
annual report 2019 to further reduce residual 
risk levels. among other things, the risk reduc-
tions achieved in 2020 imply that risks relating to 
imo 2020 low sulphur fuel, cost excellence in ocean, 
and the apm terminals transformation are not per-
ceived to be among key risks into 2021. also, the 
risk relating to standardisation of core processes is 
now included in the technolo gy roadmap risk. resid-
ual risk levels of continuing risks and new risks by 
december 2020 are depicted on the heatmap above.

risk description
a.p. moller - maersk’s strategy to 
become a global integrator of con-
tainer logistics hinges on the ability to 
deliver a superior service level to cus-
tomers. a.p. moller - maersk needs to 
deliver operationally on the service 
level promised to customers in order 
to build long-term trust and brand 
reliability.
a.p. moller - maersk’s growth strategy 
is dependent on its ability to trans-
form its digital foundation. if there 
is serious delay or failure to modern-
ise tech nology, execute the tech nology 
roadmap, and standardise core busi-
ness processes, there is a risk that 
maersk is unable to orchestrate value 
and stable revenue streams via its 
technology platforms.
as a.p. moller - maersk becomes 
increasingly digitalised, more devices 
and control systems are connected 
online resulting in a wider technology 
surface across the information tech-
nology and operational technology 
infrastructure, which could be compro-
mised. should a successful cyber attack 
materialise, operational disruption and/
or data breaches may occur.
although there have been signs of 
structural improvements in the ocean 
segment, there is still a non-negligible 
risk that the ocean industry could 
again become financially challenged 
in another downturn cycle.
the business of a.p. moller - maersk 
requires many of the employees and 
other external contractors to work in 
high-risk locations both in terms of 
frontline operations as well as in terms 
of working in geographical areas with 
elevated risk.
2021 risk assessment
the delivery promise introduced as 
part of the integrator strategy is key 
to building customer trust and thereby 
retaining strong brand reputation of 
a.p. moller - maersk. not being able to 
deliver operationally can weaken the 
foundation of the a.p. moller - maersk 
global integrator strategy.
a.p. moller - maersk has made pro-
gress on its technology roadmap 
and standardisation of its core busi-
ness processes. however, since 
a.p. moller - maersk is expanding 
into new business areas, the busi-
ness processes and workflows are 
complex, and the current it land-
scape is fragmented, it is likely that 
a.p. moller - maersk will see some 
delays, as it progresses the road map.
following the cyberattack in 2017 sev-
eral measures to improve cyber security 
have been implemented. however, as 
the external threat continues to develop, 
a cyberattack could still occur leading 
to financial losses, loss of customer 
confidence, reputational damage, 
regulatory sanctions for data breaches, 
and/or operational accidents.
another downturn of the ocean indus-
try over the coming years could become 
a distraction to a.p. moller - maersk’s 
strategy execution and hamper its 
ability to invest. if the risk materialises, 
a.p. moller - maersk may be forced to 
focus on improving its short-term 
financial performance.
a.p. moller - maersk has over the years 
continued to have accidents, some of 
which have unfortunately had very 
serious and even fatal outcomes. this 
not only causes business disruption 
and affects a.p. moller - maersk’s name 
and reputation, but more importantly 
brings into focus the duty of care 
towards people.
mitigation strategies
a.p. moller - maersk is permanently 
improving its business processes and 
systems to deliver on the new delivery 
promises. in addition, the service levels 
are continuously monitored for swift 
actions to mitigate adverse develop-
ments, and business continuity strat-
egies are designed and rolled out to 
withstand operational disruptions.
a.p. moller - maersk has prioritised 
technology modernisation, stand-
ardisation of core business processes 
and development of data as a differ-
entiating asset. to achieve the right 
customer and business outcomes, 
a.p. moller - maersk is transforming 
the engagement model between tech-
nology and business platform owners 
to drive greater cross functional col-
laboration and accountability.
current mitigation includes a cyber 
security programme, business continuity 
plans, and cyber-risk insurance. the 
initial three-year cyber security program 
was completed in 2020. the next phase 
to further mitigate the threat associated 
with the enhanced digital interface with 
customers is already underway.
a.p. moller - maersk has limited levers 
to impact the overall demand for 
container shipping. however, multiple 
mitigation strategies exist, such as 
closely monitoring supply and demand, 
de-commoditising products and ser-
vices, focus on cost leadership, and 
growing logistics & services to reduce 
the exposure to ocean volatility.
a new safety & resilience function 
has been established to combine 
knowledge and expertise in this area, 
have a unified strategy around the 
topic, embed the strategy through 
a leader-led approach across the 
organisation and through manage- 
ment of critical risks.

risk description
a key driver to long-term logistics 
& services growth is the expansion 
of product and people capabilities 
through successful mergers & acquisi-
tions (m&a). acquiring new capabilities 
is a prerequisite to serve customers end-
to-end, and a.p. moller - maersk will 
need to make acquisitions in the com-
ing years.
decarbonisation is becoming a business 
necessity and a license to operate. it is 
critical for a.p. moller - maersk to decar-
bonise the end-to-end supply chain at a 
speed that meets customers’ and inves-
tors’ expectations. primary focus is the 
decarbonisation of own emissions.
delivering a digitally trans-
formed business model as part of 
a.p. moller - maersk’s global inte grator 
strategy requires right balance of 
capabilities and skills at all levels in 
the organisation.
it is imperative for a.p. moller - maersk 
to conduct its business in compli-
ance with legislation and regulatory 
standards. the regulatory landscape 
is becoming increasingly complex, and 
a.p. moller - maersk could be hit by a 
major compliance case in respect of 
violations of anti-corruption laws, anti-
trust regulations, and/or international 
sanctions.
the a.p. moller - maersk culture is 
strong with many elements that must 
be retained. these strong cultural ele-
ments were critical in getting through 
the cyberattack in 2017 and most 
recently in the covid-19 pandemic, but 
there is a need to change and adapt 
parts of this culture and to further 
enhance employee engagement to sup-
port the transformed business model.
2021 risk assessment
some of the acquisitions may be sub-
stantial, and if a.p. moller - maersk fails 
to integrate one or more of these, it will 
create a risk to successfully execut-
ing the a.p. moller - maersk inte grator 
strategy.
a.p. moller - maersk has made a com-
mitment of carbon neutrality by 2050. 
with increasing demand from custom-
ers and investors, a.p. moller - maersk 
needs to further innovate sustainable 
supply chain solutions and accelerate 
its decarbonisation initiatives.
a.p. moller - maersk made good pro-
gress in acquiring new and diverse 
capabilities and skills, especially for 
logistics & services and technology. 
still, the strategy execution could 
be hampered if the right balance of 
capabilities and skills are not main-
tained at all levels of the organisation.
in respect of corruption, 
a.p. moller - maersk operates in high-
risk geographies and high-risk sectors 
(e.g. the terminals and logistics ser-
vices sectors). a.p. moller - maersk is 
the largest container carrier and in an 
industry with many industry coopera-
tion agreements. a.p. moller - maersk 
thereby naturally has the attention of 
com petition authorities globally.
most notably, customer centricity is 
a cultural attribute, which must be 
honed to a different level than today. 
another element that must be further 
cultivated is the ability to work across 
functions with shared ownership and 
accountability for outcomes.
mitigation strategies
a post-merger integration office has 
been established to develop and man-
age integration processes and embed 
learnings. integration capabilities have 
been upskilled through external sourc-
ing. further actions are planned to 
develop seamless transition between 
acquisition and integration activities, 
with clear accountabilities and busi-
ness ownership.
in 2020, a strategic review of climate 
scenarios and transition pathways was 
conducted with the conclusion that 
climate action is a strategic imperative 
for a.p. moller - maersk. consequently,  
a new decarbonisation function has 
been launched in 2021 to further 
embed and accelerate the decarbon-
isation agenda, including coordinat-
ing the efforts to reduce the climate 
impact of operations and developing 
relevant customer offerings.
a.p. moller - maersk capability frame-
work was established to define key 
organisational capabilities to support 
strategic goals. further actions are in 
progress to build/buy competencies 
through functional and leadership pro-
grammes and targeted recruitment 
campaigns.
a.p. moller - maersk has a robust com-
pliance programme for anti-corruption, 
competition law and economic sanc-
tions, and export controls designed to 
fulfil the global requirements and many 
initiatives are in place to improve focus 
and emphasis on compliance awareness 
and training.
actions were launched to assess and 
address employee engagement levels 
on a more frequent basis. further ini-
tiatives will be launched to further 
strengthen the a.p. moller - maersk 
behaviours and elevate the company 
culture.

ocean revenue was usd 29.2bn (usd 28.8bn) with nega-
tive effects from covid-19 on loaded volumes, predomi-
nantly in q2, offset by the effects of higher freight rates. 
ebitda increased to usd 6.5bn (usd 4.4bn), yielding an 
ebitda margin of 22.4% (15.4%). profitability improved in 
2020 as a result of higher rates, lower costs and timely 
responses to changing market conditions where agile 
capacity deployment was executed to meet both mid-year 
global demand downturn and demand surges towards the 
end of the year. the average loaded freight rate increased 
by 7.9% due to short-term rate increases, and total oper-
ating costs decreased by 5.8% from improved cost man-
agement, higher utilisation and lower bunker cost.
ocean has actively deployed capacity to accom-
modate the significant demand fluctuations by 
withdrawing in h1 and increasing in h2, which 
helped mitigate the worsened schedule reliability 
caused by the global supply chain disruptions to 
service ocean customers best possible.
maersk spot gained significant momentum in 
2020 and, measured on the last four weeks in 
2020, accounted for 51% (20%) of total loaded 
short-term volume under the maersk brand.
logistics & services reported a revenue of usd 7.0bn (usd 
6.3bn), driven by increasing revenue in warehousing and 
distribution including performance team, air freight for-
warding and supply chain management, offset by decrease 
in intermodal and sea freight forwarding. gross profit grew 
to usd 1.6bn (usd 1.2bn) reflecting a gross profit margin 
of 23% (20%) with margins improving throughout the year. 
the improvement was supported by margin optimisation 
in especially intermodal and warehousing and distribution 
and effects from the acquisition of performance team, 
partially offset by lower margins in supply chain manage-
ment. ebitda increased to usd 454m (usd 216m).
the combined warehousing and distribution, and 
customs services presence has increased with the 
integration of performance team in north america 
and kgh customs services in europe.
air freight forwarding and less container load (lcl) 
products was integrated into maersk logistics and 
services to complement the end-to-end offering 
effective as of october. the damco brand was 
discontinued.
terminals & towage reported an increased ebitda of usd 
1.2bn (usd 1.1bn), despite revenue decreased by 3.6% to 
usd 3.8bn (usd 3.9bn). in gateway terminals, revenue 
decreased with lower volumes due to covid-19. ebitda 
increased to usd 989m (usd 913m), mainly driven by con-
solidation of pipavav, india, and cost savings partly off-
set by lower volumes. the decrease in volumes of 3.6% 
was driven by lower volume of 1.2% from the ocean seg-
ment and 4.9% from external customers. towage reported 
a revenue of usd 681m (usd 695m), with an ebitda of usd 
216m (usd 205m), mainly due to lower costs, aligned to 
the strategic growth initiatives launched in 2019.
all terminals remained operational through - 
out the covid-19 pandemic. the new terminal  
in vado, italy, began operations in q1 and the 
terminal in tema, ghana, ramped up during 2020.
towage signed new contracts and negotiated 
extensions to existing contracts. operations 
were updated with new locations and planned 
exit of others.
manufacturing & others revenue decreased to usd 1.3bn 
(usd 1.4bn) while ebitda increased to usd 165m (usd 
136m). maersk container industry ebitda increased to 
usd 77m (usd 29m), which was the strongest financial 
year of its core marine reefer business. maersk supply 
service ebitda decreased to usd 21m (usd 28m), reflect-
ing lower activity offset by cost reductions. for other 
businesses, revenue was usd 415m (usd 484m), and 
ebitda was usd 66m (usd 80m).
maersk container industry saw higher star cool unit 
sales compensating for lost star cool integrated 
production in q1 due to covid-19 and achieved the 
highest ever third-party unit bookings total.
maersk supply service was awarded several 
contracts in the north sea and africa for its 
integrated solution service.

revenue was usd 29.2bn (usd 28.8bn), with a 
decrease in volumes to 12,634k ffe (13,296k 
ffe) as a result of covid-19, more than offset by 
improved freight rates, which increased to 2,000 
usd/ffe (1,853 usd/ffe).
despite restructuring cost from strategic changes 
announced in q3, ebitda increased by 48% to usd 
6.5bn (usd 4.4bn), driven by higher revenue and a 
lower cost base mainly due to agile capacity deploy-
ment combined with a lower bunker price and con-
sumption. as a result of this, the ebitda margin 
increased by 7.0 percentage points to 22.4%.
at the heart of the integrator strategy, ocean enables trade through 
strategic brands and digital channels providing customers the flex-
ibility and stability needed to manage and simplify end-to-end sup-
ply chains. operating the largest container ship fleet in the world, 
ocean carries more than 12 million forty-foot-equivalent units per 
annum, split approximately 45/55 between long-term and short-
term contracts calling over 300 ports around the world.

volumes were 5.0% lower at 12,634k ffe 
(13,296k ffe) due to covid-19, predominantly 
in q2, mainly due to decreases in east-west and 
north-south trades. the decrease in east-west 
was driven by europe and middle east trades, 
while north america saw higher volumes in h2 
2020. the decrease in north-south was driven 
by the weak demand across latin america, africa 
and oceania trades. total headhaul decreased 
by 4.3%, mainly for latin america, europe and 
middle east, while total backhaul decreased 
by 6.3%.
the average loaded freight rate increased  
by 7.9% to 2,000 usd/ffe (1,853 usd/ffe), 
driven by an increase of 14.1% on east-west 
supported by strong demand, vessel and 
equipment shortages and bottlenecks across 
the entire supply chain. on north-south the 
average freight rates increased by 7.8%, driven 
by headhaul increase in latin america and 
africa combined with higher backhaul rates in 
oceania. the rate increases on east-west and 
north-south trades were partly offset by lower 
rates on intra- regional trades driven by a 7.0% 
decrease in intra-americas rates. the average 
loaded freight rate was positively impacted by 
mix effects from relatively higher headhaul 
volumes especially in north america and neg-
atively affected by developments in foreign 
exchange rate and the bunker price change. 
the average loaded freight rate at fixed bunker 
increased by 9.8%.
freight revenue was usd 24.9bn (usd 24.5bn), 
while other revenue was flat at usd 4.3bn (usd 
4.3bn). adjusted for the foreign exchange rate 
effects, the freight revenue increased by 2.4%.
unit cost at ebit level (based on a fixed bunker price)
 unit cost fixed at 450 usd/tonne 
unit cost at fixed bunker price was 1.0% above 
2019, despite a reduction in total operating costs. 
unit cost was driven by lower volumes, offset 
partially by improved bunker efficiency and for-
eign exchange rate effects. compared to 2019, 
the unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 1.6% 
adjusting for the foreign exchange rate effects.

total operating costs decreased by 5.8% to usd 
22.9bn (usd 24.3bn), impacted by lower volumes, 
lower fuel costs and agile capacity manage-
ment, as well as favourable impact from devel-
opment in foreign exchange rates and lower con-
tainer-related costs. network costs excluding bun-
ker costs decreased by 5.7%, mainly due to agile 
capacity deployment through the covid-19, lead-
ing to a high utilisation, and lower port costs due 
to reduced calls. adjusting for the positive impact 
from the developments in foreign exchange rates, 
the operating costs decreased by 5.2%. based on 
the lower cost base, container handling cost, bun-
ker cost and sg&a and other cost decreased their 
share of total costs, while network costs, exclud-
ing bunker increased slightly. 
total unit cost decreased by 0.7% to 1,909 usd/
ffe (1,922 usd/ffe), driven by a decrease in fuel 
cost caused by a 6.9% lower consumption and a 
decreased average bunker price of 9.7%, equal 
to 40 usd/tonne. the combined effect of lower 
average prices and lower consumption resulted in 
a total bunker cost decrease of 16% to usd 3.8bn 
(usd 4.6bn). out of the total decrease, usd 0.5bn 
was due to the lower average bunker price, with 
the remaining decrease due to lower consump-

moving the market with maersk eco delivery
a core element of the strategy to decarbonise 
shipping is to develop and commercialise prod-
ucts that reduce the carbon footprint of cus-
tomer supply chains. in 2019, a.p. moller - maersk 
was the first to launch a carbon-neutral solution 
for ocean transport, maersk eco delivery, based 
on sustainable biofuel from waste sources such 
as used cooking oil. it provides direct carbon sav-
ings, not carbon offsets, by ensuring that for any 
maersk eco delivery container transport, enough 
sustainable biofuel will be purchased and used in 
the a.p. moller - maersk network to neutralise the 
carbon emissions that would have occurred using 
standard fuel. these co2 savings are allocated to 
the customer and verified by the roundtable on 
sustainable biomaterials.
in 2020, customer uptake of maersk eco delivery 
exceeded expectations. so far, around ten major 
customers have chosen to purchase this car-
bon-neutral emissions transport solution, and 
this number is expected to increase. conversa-
tions with customers on the possibility of con-
verting all their shipments to the maersk eco 
delivery product are ongoing. while this is very 
promising, it represents a small share of the 
total amount of containers transported by 
a.p. moller - maersk, and we need much more 
customer demand to scale net-zero emissions 
offerings and enable a transition to full decar-
bonisation.

compared to 2019.
unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 1.0% to 
1,973 usd/ffe (1,954 usd/ffe), driven by lower 
volumes, somewhat offset by improved bunker 
efficiency and development in foreign exchange 
rates. adjusting for the positive impact from the 
developments in foreign exchange rates, the unit 
cost at fixed bunker increased by 1.6%.
the average nominal capacity of 4,081k teu 
decreased by 1.2% due to agile capacity develop-
ment executed to meet mid-year global demand 
downturn, which has since increased with demand 
surges towards the end of the year. there were 
no vessels in the newbuilding programme at the 
end of q4, and the fleet consisted of 301 owned 
and 405 chartered vessels, of which 99k teu or 
2.4% of the fleet were idle (12 vessels), mainly due 
to repairs, scrubbers retrofitting, and capacity 
adjustments.
ocean continued to deliver on its strategy with a rigorous 
focus on servicing customers and limit the negative impact 
from disruptions to their supply chains during the covid-19 
outbreak. q2 saw a significant decrease in volumes and major 
changes to the fleet were applied to adjust capacity to the 
impact of global lockdown of economies. from q3, unex-
pected pick-up in demand on some routes resulted in strong 
pricing dynamics, with bottlenecks and space access com-
bined with vessel and equipment shortages becoming a chal-
lenge for most customers. additional flexibility was provided, 
focusing on long-term customers to cater for additional 
demand, despite the strong short-term freight rate market, 
while adding extra capacity to accommodate volumes.
in h2, strategic changes were announced in order to further 
enhance the customer experience and end-to-end service 
delivery. safmarine will no longer be marketed as a separate 
brand, as a.p. moller - maersk and safmarine have converged, 
both focusing on building a customer-centric culture with 
digital interactions. while continuing to meet customers as 
two separate brands with a differentiated service model, the 
front offices of a.p. moller - maersk and hamburg süd will 
come closer together into more customer- centric teams.
 
maersk spot, launched in q2 2019 offering transparent 
prices and loading guarantee, gained significant momen-
tum in 2020, growing its share of loaded short-term vol-
umes consistently. on a four-week average basis, maersk 
spot volumes at year-end were 51% of the total loaded 
short-term volumes under a.p. moller - maersk brand (excl. 
sealand and hamburg süd).

logistics & services is the core growth element of 
a.p. moller - maersk’s’ integrator strategy: logistics & services seek to 
fulfil more of the customers’ needs at every step of their supply chain 
through the integrated logistics offerings. key offerings, all enabled

revenue increased by 10% to usd 7.0bn (usd 
6.3bn), driven by increasing revenue in ware-
housing and distribution, including performance 
team, air freight forwarding and intermodal, off-
set by decrease in sea freight forwarding. gross 
profit grew to usd 1.6bn (usd 1.2bn) with a gross 
profit margin of 23% (20%), driven by the contin-
ued focus on profitable business and margin opti-
misation in intermodal and increased profitabil-
ity in warehousing and distribution facilities in 
north america, specifically driven by performance 
team. despite restructuring cost of usd 40m from 
the discontinuation of the damco brand, ebitda 
increased to usd 454m (usd 216m) with an ebitda 
margin of 6.5% (3.4%), driven by the margins opti-
misation and focus on profitability.
volumes in supply chain management increased 
by 7.5% to 77,023 kcbm (71,664 kcbm). intermodal 
volumes decreased by 3.9% to 3,640k ffe (3,789k 
ffe) due to impact from covid-19 in the first three 
quarters of the year, while volumes have recovered 
in q4. volumes in air freight forwarding declined 
by 13% to 138k tonnes (158k tonnes) and declined 
by 16% in sea freight forwarding to 401k teu (475k 
teu), impacted by covid-19 and the discontinua-
tion of the damco brand.

directors’ report
the revenue in supply chain management 
improved by 12% to usd 961m (usd 861m), while 
revenue in intermodal decreased by 6.7% to usd 
2.7bn (usd 2.9bn), mainly due to lower volumes.
in supply chain management gross profit 
increased by 2.9% to usd 350m (usd 340m), due 
to a bounce back in kcbm volumes in h2, while 
h1 saw a decrease in volumes due to covid-19. 
profitability improved in intermodal, driven by 
the ongoing margin optimisation and better cor-
ridor mix with an increase in gross profit of 75% 
to usd 296m (usd 169m). the operational effi-
ciencies are mainly achieved by focus on higher 
margin corridors and lower cost from less imbal-
ance between import and export in north america, 
west central asia and europe.
in air freight forwarding, revenue was up 61% to 
usd 780m (usd 485m) and gross profit was up 
66% to usd 88m (usd 53m). profitability increased 
despite a volume decrease, driven by the continued 
high rates in asia pacific, where urgent air freight 
solutions were developed during the covid-19 
pandemic.
other services revenue and gross profit increased, 
driven by positive contribution from warehous-
ing and distribution including the activity from 
performance team in north america with a rev-
enue of usd 398m and an ebitda of usd 59m. 
this is a result of a significant turnaround of the 
us based sites during 2020. while increased han-
dling volume was a positive contributing factor, 
the combined effect of automation investment in 
sorters and the deployment of operation excel-
lence expertise acquired via per formance team 
heavily contributed to strong profitability in the 
core us facilities, notably santa fe, southgate, and 
sumner. the customs house broker age activity was 
the integration of damco’s air freight and less container load 
(lcl) products into the maersk logistics and services prod-
ucts to complement the end-to-end offering was effective as 
of 1 october. the damco brand was discontinued.
the agreement to acquire performance team, was signed 
in february with start in april. the acquisition more than 
doubles the combined warehousing and distribution pres-
ence in the north america region, bringing enhanced scale 
and expertise for the combined customers.
kgh customs services was acquired in september. the 
acquisition increases the combined number of clearances by 
five times in the europe region, allowing for a larger foot-
print and enhanced ability to service customers end-to-end.
the product offering has expanded by adding maersk 
cargo insurance to the portfolio, a product that protects 
customers’ goods against physical loss or damage. further, 
in support of the global integrator vision, a new product 
called maersk flow was launched in july. it is a digital solu-
tion which provides small and medium sized customers 
and their partners with everything they need to take con-
trol of their supply chain from factory to market.
work has progressed on the new supply chain management 
platform and the new transportation management system 
platform for intermodal, to enhance the scope, quality and 
efficiency of the services offered to customers, thereby con-
tributing to an end-to-end integrated offering.

port terminals contribute  
to decarbonisation
apm terminals consumes 
73% of the electricity used by 
a.p. moller - maersk. to sustain 
leader ship on decarbonisation and 
to match customer needs and stake-
holder demands, a.p. moller - maersk 
is working to identify ways in which 
emissions across all scopes – directly 
from operations, emissions related to 
the purchase of energy, and emissions 
in the value chain – can be tackled as 
part of the company’s decarbonisa-
tion efforts. decarbonisation of port 
terminals will be one of the elements 
contributing to achieve this goal.
in january 2020, the green gate-
way gothenburg was launched as 
a showcase for decarbonisation 
of existing terminals. switching to 
renewable electricity to power the 
cranes and offices, biogas for heating, 
and using biodiesel made from recy-
cled waste vegetable oils in mobile 
equipment, the gothenburg terminal 
reduced its co2 emissions by 88%.
ways to eliminate the last 12% of 
emissions are being pursued with ter-
minal customers to provide a fully co2 
neutral container handling service.
other paths to decarbonisation of 
the energy supply for ports are being 
tested as well, with solar projects in 
pipavav, india, and aqaba, jordan, grid 
optimisation trial projects in two fur-
ther sites, and further switches to 
renewable electricity in the european 
and us terminals in 2021.

financial and operational performance
towage reported a revenue of usd 681m (usd 
695m), mainly impacted by lower rate per tug job as 
well as volume decreases due to negative covid-19 
impact, partly offset by increased activity in europe 
with the acquisition of port towage amsterdam, 
as well as increased activity in brazil and ramp-up 
of activities in tangier med ii, morocco.
currency impact was negligible for the full year. 
ebitda increased to usd 216m (usd 205m), 
mainly due to lower costs, partly offset by one-
offs such as restructuring costs in australia.
harbour towage activities measured by the num-
ber of tug jobs increased by 2.5%, driven by positive 
impact from the full consolidation of port towage 
amsterdam from beginning of 2020, partly offset 
by lower activity in australia, the uk and scandi-
navia, mainly due to covid-19. the americas and the 
asia, middle east and africa regions had increased 
activities compared to 2019.
during 2020, a five-year harbour towage contract was 
signed for nacala port, mozambique, which started opera-
tions in q3 2020, and operations in bremerhaven, germany, 
were expanded with mooring services. furthermore, eight 
contract extensions were secured across the regions, 
including a 10-year extension of the marine service contract 
in sakhalin, russia, a five-year extension with egyptian lng, 
a five-year extension in point tupper, canada, a five-year 
extension of the ship assist contract in st. eustatius, and 
various contract extensions in oman, australia, argentina, 
and brazil. in q4, preparations were made to start opera-
tions in emden, germany, in january 2021, and in australia, 
a plan was implemented to exit the port in geelong and sig-
nificantly reduce the workforce in port jackson.
also, the strategic growth initiatives launched in 2019 
have progressed throughout the year together with projects 
focusing on crew optimisation and general cost reductions.

to organise and conduct board of directors meet-
ings in the most relevant and efficient manner, 
the board of directors has established an annual 
wheel in cooperation with the executive board. 
the annual wheel outlines the main themes and 
topics for each ordinary board of directors meet-
ing and areas on which the executive board is 
expected to report as well as matters for delibera-
tion or approval by the board of directors  
members. the annual wheel ensures that all rele-
vant topics are covered during the year, e.g. strategy, 
people and capabilities, transparency and com-
pliance and risk.
board evaluation
during september 2020, an externally facilitated 
board evaluation process was conducted, among 
others covering the cooperation between the board 
of directors and the executive board, the chair-
man’s role, the board’s and board committees’ work 
and an assessment of board capabilities relative 
to those best supporting the company’s strategy. 
all members of the board of directors participated 
in the evaluation and provided input via question-
naires, thus forming the basis of a comprehensive 
evaluation report. the results were discussed in 
plenary sessions by the board of directors, and 
agreed improvements were implemented. 
main conclusions and outcome  
of the board evaluation
the board’s work has undergone a positive de vel-
op ment in 2018-2020 by improving dynamics, 
engagement and the level of challenges and spar-
ring offered by and among the board of directors 
and the executive board. the board evaluation con-
firmed the alignment on the top strategic issues 
and continued focus on priorities and transparency. 
the results and conclusions from the annual board 
evaluation, form the basis for the nomination com-
mittee’s considerations and continued search for 
future candidates to the board of directors.
board composition
based on the strategy to move from a con glom-
er ate to a focused transportation and logistics 
company, the board initiated a process to define 
the board composition of the future. as part of 
core values
constant care
take care of today, actively prepare 
for tomorrow
humbleness
listen, learn, share, give space  
to others
uprightness
our word is our bond
our employees
the right environment for the  
right people
our name
sum of how we live the values and 
how we are perceived

directors’ report
the board evaluation 2018, key competencies and 
areas of experience and expertise required on 
the board were identified to be: shipping, trans-
port and logistics, it/digital/tech and e-commerce, 
business transformation, innovation and entre-
preneurship, asset heavy industries, finance and 
accounting, risk management, global leadership 
and board service in stock listed companies.
consequently, the nomination committee initiated 
a search for board candidates with relevant addi-
tional competencies to complete the board’s over-
all, collective capabilities. at the annual general 
meeting in 2019, bernard l. bot and marc engel 
were elected members of the board of directors 
bringing competencies within global transport and 
logistics. at the annual general meeting in 2020, 
blythe s. j. masters was elected, bringing compe-
tencies within financial services, technology, start-
ups and blockchain.
diversity
when assessing the composition of the board, 
the nomination committee also considers diver-
sity and setting of the target for the underrepre-
sented gender on the board of directors in accor-
dance with the danish company’s act § 139c. in 
2019, the board of directors re-adopted the target 
for the underrepresented gender on the board of 
directors: three female board members elected by 
the general meeting if the board consists of less 
than 12 members and four female board mem-
bers elected by the general meeting if the board 
consists of 12 or more members. the target has to 
be met by end 2023. as the board consists of ten 
members of which three are female the target is 
currently met. the board will continuously assess 
whether the target set in 2019 is still ambitious. 
the company keeps focus on driving diversity both 
on managerial levels and on the board. 
further information on diversity can be found in 
the company’s sustainability report. 
disclosure regarding change of control
the eu takeover bids directive, as partially imple-
mented by the danish financial statements act, 
requires listed companies to disclose information 
that may be of interest to the market and poten-
tial take-over bidders, in particular in relation to 
disclosure of change-of-control provisions.
 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s discloses that the group in 
the ordinary course of business has agreements 
with business partners which could be terminated 
in case of a change of control. however, given the 
ownership structure of a.p. moller - maersk, the 
risk is considered to be very remote.
recommendations for corporate  
governance
as a danish listed company, a.p. møller - mærsk a/s 
must comply with or explain deviations from the 
‘recommendations for corporate governance’ 
implemented by nasdaq copenhagen in the rules 
for issuers of shares and section 107b of the 
danish financial statements act. 
the board of directors has prepared a statement 
on corporate governance for the financial year 
2020. this statement includes a description of 
the company’s approach to the recommendations 
in the ‘recommendations for corporate gover-
nance’. reporting on compliance with the corpo-
rate governance recommendations can be found 
on http://investor.maersk.com/corporate-gov-

the main elements of the company’s 
internal control and risk management 
systems in connection with its financial 
reporting
the company’s risk management and internal con-
trols in connection with its financial reporting are 
planned to reduce the risk of errors and omissions 
in the financial reporting.
control environment
the board of directors, the audit committee 
and the executive board regularly assess mate-
rial risks and internal controls in connection with 
the company’s financial reporting process. the 
audit committee has a supervisory responsi bility 
and reports to the entire board of directors. the 
responsibility for the everyday maintenance of 
an efficient control environment in connection 
with the financial reporting rests with the exec-
utive board. the management of the brands and 
business units are responsible for ensuring an 
efficient control environment for the respective 
brand or business unit.
based on the applicable rules and regulations, the 
board of directors and the executive board pre-
pare and approve the general policies, procedures, 
and controls in significant areas in connection with 
the company’s financial reporting.
the starting point is a clear organisational struc-
ture, clear chains of command, authorisation and 
certification procedures, and segregation of duties 
as well as adequate accounting and consolidation 
systems, including validation controls.
in addition, the company has set up policies, man u-
als, and procedures within relevant areas in connec-
tion with its financial reporting. the policies, manu-
als, and procedures are updated on an ongoing basis.
risk assessment and management
at least once a year, as part of the risk assess-
ment, the board of directors, the audit commit-
tee and the executive board undertake a general 
identification and assessment of risks in connec-
tion with the financial reporting, including the 
risk of fraud, and consider measures to be imple-
mented to reduce or eliminate such risks. 
decisions on measures to reduce or eliminate 
risks are based on an assessment of materiality 
and probability of errors and omissions.
control activities
specific control activities have been defined for 
each significant brand and business unit.
the performance of such control activities is 
mon i tored on brand and business unit level 
as well as on a corporate level. this monitor-
ing includes controller reports with follow-up 
on findings and recommendations as well as an 
annual statement of rep re sen tation from man-
agement of the most significant brands and 
business units.
information and communication
the board of directors is overall responsible for 
the company having information and report-
ing systems in place to ensure that its financial 
reporting is in conformity with rules and regula-
tions. for this purpose, the company has set out 
detailed requirements in policies, manuals, and 
procedures and a global consolidation system 
with related reporting instructions has been 
implemented. also, risk and control catalogues 
have been established and collated for all sig-
nificant brands and business units as well as for 
corporate functions.

2020 has been a strong year for a.p. moller - maersk despite the 
ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. the remuneration of the 
executive board members for the financial year 2020 reflects a solid 
year with strong financial results and a satisfying progress towards the 
strategic transformation, whilst the remuneration to the members of 
the board of directors remains unchanged from the previous year.
the following sections set out key elements of the remuneration policy 
(‘policy’), and the total remuneration awarded to the members of board 
of directors and the executive board for 2020.
remuneration policy at a glance
the policy supports the business needs by enabling 
an appropriate total remuneration package that has 
a clear link to business strategy and aligns with share-
holder interests.
the objectives of the policy are to:
• ensure appropriate total remuneration: the remu-
neration design and decisions are guided by market 
practice in europe, reflected in the remuneration 
components offered and the total remuneration 
value provided.
• link to business strategy: the policy supports the 
business plan and the need for executive leaders to 
focus on delivering an on-going progress to achieve 
the company’s strategic goals, reflected in a combi-
nation of short and long-term incentive components.
• align with shareholder interest: the policy is designed 
to support the delivery of strong financial and oper-
ational results over time, which ultimately grow 
shareholder value.
board of directors members serving on the board 
committees or performing ad hoc work beyond 
the normal responsibilities receive an additional 
fee. this does not apply to the chairman where the 
fixed annual fee is all inclusive.
executive board 
the remuneration of the executive board mem-
bers consists of a fixed base salary, which is inclu-
sive of company pension contribution and car, 
short-term incentive as well as the long-term 
incentive components.
the remuneration structure is intended to drive a 
‘reward for performance’ culture by aligning indi-
vidual reward to company performance and share-
holder value creation. the individual remuneration 
level is set and reviewed based on peer companies 
of similar size and complexity to ensure they 
remain comparable and fit for the business.
total remuneration 2020
the table shows the total remuneration awarded 
to members of the board of directors and the 
executive board in aggregate from 2016 to 2020, 
as set out in note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements.
further information regarding the share-based 
payments is detailed in note 11 of the consolidated 
financial statements as calculated under ifrs2. 
this is different in both reporting and methodol-
ogy in the company’s remuneration report 2020 
which is available at the company’s website on: 
https://investor.maersk.com/remuneration.
the current policy applies to members of the 
executive board and the board of directors and 
was adopted at the company’s annual general 
meeting in 2020.
board of directors 
the members of the board of directors receive a 
fixed annual fee which is differentiated based on 
the role:
• the chairman receives a fixed amount inclusive of 
committee work and all other additional duties
• ordinary board members receive a fixed amount 
and the vice chairman receives fixed multiples 
thereof.

share price development
the maersk b share price increased by 41% to dkk 
13,595 from its closing price at the end of 2019 of 
dkk 9,608. by comparison, the benchmark indices 
msci world transportation and omxc25 increased 
by 5% and 34%, respectively. the maersk b share 
price reached its highest price of dkk 14,115 on 
18 december 2020, and its lowest price of dkk 
5,034 on 19 march 2020. the total market value of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s was usd 43bn at the end 
of 2020. the positive development of the share 
price was driven by a very strong financial perfor-
mance in the second half of the year, as demand 
picked up faster than anticipated after the first 
lockdown related to the pandemic outbreak in the 
early days of 2020. the sudden uptick in demand 
led to a significant increase in freight rates during 
the third quarter. the continued focus on the cost 
base and agile capacity deployment, coupled with 
the higher freight rates lead to improved finan-
cial performance and a total of three earnings 
upgrades after having suspended the guidance  
in march 2020. 
share capital
a.p. moller - maersk shares are listed on nasdaq 
copenhagen and are divided into two classes: 
a shares with voting rights and b shares without 
voting rights. each dkk 1,000 a share entitles the 
holder to two votes. 
the a.p. møller - mærsk a/s share capital amounts 
to nominally dkk 20,031,947,000, divided between 
10,599,401 a shares of nominally dkk 1,000 and 
9,432,546 b shares of nominally dkk 1,000. 
ownership
the total number of registered shareholders 
increased by 3,000 to around 76,000 during 2020. 
shareholders with more than 5% of share capital 
or votes held 53% of the share capital, while the 20 
largest institutional shareholders together owned 
around 16% of the total share capital and 37% 
adjusted for the free-float. danish retail investors 
decreased their ownership slightly from 11% to 10% 
of the total share capital since the end of 2019.
after an extraordinary year with great volatility in the share price, 
the share price ended the year 41% higher than last year, implying 
a total shareholder return of 45% for 2020. the board of directors 
in a.p. møller - mærsk a/s proposes an ordinary dividend of dkk 
330 per share corresponding to a dividend payout of 35%.

own shares
a.p. moller - maersk holding of own shares com-
prised 3.12% of the share capital at the end of 
2020, cf. note 11 in the consolidated financial 
statements.
dividend 
the dividend policy is an annual pay-out ratio 
of 30-50% of underlying net result, adjusted 
for gains, impairments and restructurings, to be 
implemented from the financial year 2020.
in the medium-term and during the strategic 
phase of transforming the company to become 
a global integrator of container logistics, the 
annual pay-out ratio should be expected at the 
low to midpoint of the range.
distribution to shareholders will take place 
through dividends potentially combined with 
share buy-backs, and the annual pay-out ratio and 
distribution will be decided from an evaluation

directors’ report
of the outlook, cash flow, capital expenditures for 
organic use and merger and acquisition transac-
tions and investment grade rating.
the board of directors proposes an ordinary div-
idend to the shareholders of dkk 330 per share 
of dkk 1,000 (dkk 150 per share of dkk 1,000). 
the proposed dividend payment represents an 
ordinary dividend yield of 2.4% (1.6%) and 35% of 
the net underlying profit, based on the maersk 
b share’s closing price of dkk 13,595 as of 30 
december 2020. payment is expected to take 
place on 26 march 2021.
capital structure
the capital structure ensures that 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s at all time has sufficient 
financial flexibility to meet the strategic and 
growth objectives and to maximise the return to 
our shareholders.
in terms of capital allocation, a strict capex dis-
cipline is applied with an accumulated capex 
guidance for 2021-2022 of usd 4.5-5.5bn.
the target is to have an average maturity of the 
debt portfolio, excluding the impact of leases, of 
at least four years, and that the total amount of 
debt maturities within a calendar year should not 
exceed usd 3bn, within the next three full calen-
dar years.
share buy-back
in q2 2019, the board of directors decided to exer-
cise its authority to buy back shares of up to dkk 
10bn (around usd 1.5bn) over a period of up to 15 
months.
the share buy-back programme was concluded on 
24 july 2020 and a.p. moller - maersk has repur-
chased usd 1.5bn worth of shares, of which usd 
98m was repurchased in q3 2020. on 1 june 2020, 
the cancellation of 156,977 a-shares and 627,938 
b-shares was completed corresponding to 3.77% 
of the total share capital in a.p. moller - maersk.
in november 2020, the board of directors decided 
to initiate a new share buy-back programme of up 
to dkk 10bn (around usd 1.6bn) and a maximum of 
1.79 million shares to be acquired over a period of 
up to 15 months. 
the share buy-back will be carried out in several 
phases. the first phase of the share buy-back 
programme of dkk 3.3bn (around usd 500m) is 
expected to run from 1 december 2020 until april 
2021. the remaining part of the programme will 
be initiated after approval by the annual general 
meeting in march 2021 of the proposed prolonga-
tion of the authority to acquire own shares.
by the end of 2020, a total of 119,176 a shares and 
505,281 b shares was owned by the company, cor-
responding to 3.12% of the share capital.

driving our long-term value creative strategy, we 
apply the following principles for capital allocation. 
• we invest in maintenance and replacement in 
all our businesses
• we invest in growing particularly our logistics 
and services operations, both organically and 
inorganically
• we are committed to maintaining our invest-
ment grade rating
• we target a dividend pay-out between 30-50% 
of underlying net profit and aim at distributing 
excess cash to shareholders primarily via share 
buy-backs if the outlook permits.
funding strategy
a.p. moller - maersk’s focus is on long-term debt 
in order to minimise the ongoing refinancing risk 
and secure a solid capital structure over the busi-
ness cycle. similarly, the aim is to avoid high con-
centrations of debt maturing within the same year. 
we aim at having a diversified debt portfolio, based 
on funding from debt capital markets, commercial 
bank debt, export credit agencies, ship financing 
institutions, and from multilateral agencies.

the decision to initiate a new share buy-back pro-
gramme is supported by the strong earnings and 
free cash flow generation seen in 2020, which 
has led to further deleveraging of the company 
and improved credit metrics in line with invest-
ment grade rating. 
the new programme is in alignment with previously 
announced intention to distribute a material part 
of the value of shares received in total s.a. (value 
usd 4.5bn) as part of the sale of maersk oil, sub-
ject to maintaining investment grade rating. with 
the announced new share buy-back programme 
the total distribution from the sale of the shares in 
total s.a. will be around usd 3.4bn or around 75% 
of the initial value of the shares received.
the share buy-back is carried out with the 
purpose to adjust the capital structure of 
a.p. moller - maersk. shares which are not used  
for hedging purposes for the long-term incen tive 
programmes will be proposed cancelled at the 
annual general meetings in 2021 and 2022. 
no shares may be bought back at a price exceed-
ing the higher of i) share price of latest independ-
ent trade, and ii) the highest current independent 
bid at nasdaq copenhagen at the time of trading.
the maximum number of a and b shares that may 
be purchased on each trading day may not exceed 
25% of the average daily trading volume of a and 
b shares, respectively, on nasdaq copenhagen or 
other regulated markets, on which the purchase is 
carried out over the last 20 trading days prior to 
the date of purchase.
a and b shares will be acquired in a 20/80 split 
reflecting the current trading volumes of the two 
share classes.

table 6.2 and table 6.3
impairment analysis
the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is 
determined based on the higher of its value in use or fair 
value less cost to sell. the value in use is calculated us-
ing certain key assumptions for the expected future cash 
flows and applied discount factor.
the cash flow projections are based on financial budgets 
and business plans approved by management. in nature, 
these projections are subject to judgement and estimates 
that are uncertain, though based on experience and ex-
ternal sources where available. the discount rates applied 
reflect the time value of money as well as the specific 
risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e. project and/
or country-specific risk premium. further, any uncertain-
ties reflecting past performance and possible variations 
in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are 
generally reflected in the discount rates.
goodwill impairment test
the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to 
the following operating segments and cash-generating 
units based on the management structure.
the most significant goodwill amount relates to the 
logistics & services segment, where the impairment test 
is based on the estimated value in use from five-year busi-
ness plans where the volume and margin growth assump-
tions reflect current market expectations for the relevant 
period. a discount rate of 7.2% (8.7%) has been applied.
the impairment test for the ocean segment is based on 
the estimated value in use from five-year business plans 
and a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the 
expected economic growth of 2% p.a. in both 2020 and 
2019. a discount rate of 7.0 (7.7%) has been applied.
the key assumptions for terminals & towage’s value cal-
culations are container moves, revenue and cost per move 
and discount rate. the cash flow projections cover the con-
cession period and extension options where deemed likely 
that they will be exercised. the growth rates assumed re-
flect current market expectations for the relevant period.

table 8.1 and table 8.2
as part of the group’s activities, customary leasing agree-
ments are entered, especially regarding the chartering 
of vessels and leasing of containers and other equip-
ment. in some cases, the leasing agreements comprise 
purchase options exercisable by the group and options 
for extending the lease term. the group also enters into 
arrangements that provide the right-to-use some existing 
infrastructure or land as required to carry out the termi-
nal business.
 
to optimise lease costs during the contract period, the 
group sometimes provides residual value guarantees 
in relation to equipment leases. at the end of 2020, the 
expected residual values were reviewed to determine 
if these reflect the actual residual values achieved on 
comparable assets and expectations about future prices. 
at 31 december 2020, usd 354m (usd 489m) is expected 
to be payable and is included in the measurement of the 
lease liabilities.
leases to which a.p. moller - maersk is committed but for 
which lease term has not yet commenced have an undis-
counted value of usd 557m (usd 481m). they comprise of 
approx. 64 contracts commencing in 2021 and 2022.
 
certain terminal concession agreements contain variable 
payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e. 
number of containers handled, or depend on an index, or 
a combination hereof. such payments are recognised in 
the income statement in the period in which the condition 
that triggers those payments occurs.
lease liabilities are disclosed in note 13 and note 16.

table 10.1, table 10.2 and table 10.3
there have been no discontinued operations in 2020.
 
discontinued operations in 2019 included maersk drilling 
up to the demerger in april 2019, which concluded the 
separation of the energy-related businesses. the results 
of the discontinued operations are presented in one sepa-
rate line in the 2019 income statement, balance sheet and 
cash flow statement.
 
in the consolidated financial statements in 2019, the 
results for maersk drilling are classified under discontin-
ued operations with a net loss of usd 553m in 2019. total 
cash flow from the discontinued operations was usd 0m 
(positive usd 372m).
assets held for sale in 2020 largely relate to two terminals 
reported as held for sale within terminals & towage and 
one terminal within ocean.
the terminal in ocean was transferred to assets held for 
sale in 2019, and an impairment of usd 62m has been 
made against the asset in 2020, being the difference be-
tween carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
maersk drilling activity
on 2 april 2019, maersk drilling was demerged and listed 
separately.
period ended 2 april 2019
a.p. moller - maersk recognised a loss of usd 553m for
the maersk drilling activity, mainly due to a negative fair
value adjustment of usd 628m. the cash flow from the 
demerger is summarised in table 10.3.
the fair value of the new listed company of usd 3.4bn 
resulted in a negative fair value adjustment of usd 628m 
being recognised in q1 2019. measurement of the fair 
value of the disposal group was categorised as level 1 in 
the fair value hierarchy, as measurement was based on 
observable market data.

all shares are fully issued and paid up.
one a share of dkk 1,000 holds two votes. b shares have 
no voting rights.
adoption of resolutions regarding changes to the com-
pany’s articles of association or increase or write-down 
of the share capital requires that at least two-thirds of 
the a share capital at the general meeting shall be rep-
resented by persons entitled to vote and that at least 
two-thirds of the votes cast shall be cast in favour of the 
adoption of the resolution.
apart from a resolution for the dissolution of the com-
pany, other resolutions at the general meetings are passed 
by simple majority, as long as legislation does not require 
particular voting majority. reference is made to the com-
pany’s articles of association. in the event of an increase 
of the company’s share capital, the shareholders in the 
given share class shall have a pre-emptive right to sub-
scribe for a proportionate share of the capital increase.
at the annual general meeting of a.p. møller - mærsk a/s 
on 23 march 2020, the shareholders decided on the can-
cellation of treasury shares, whereby the share capital was 
decreased. on june 2, 2020, the company’s share capital 
was reduced from nominally dkk 20,816,862,000 with 
nominally dkk 784,915,000 in total, divided into 156,977 
a shares and 627,938 b shares of dkk 1,000 to nominally 
dkk 20,031,947,000 by cancellation of own shares.
the capital decrease took place at a premium at a price 
of dkk 761.57 and dkk 809.51 for a and b shares, respec-
tively, cf. section 188(2) of the danish companies act, cor-
responding to the average price at which the shares have 
been repurchased. the amount from the capital decrease 
has been paid out to the company as owner of the shares 
as the amount was transferred from the company’s capi-
tal reserves to the free reserves.
table 11.2
the dkk 10bn share buy-back programme announced on 
24 may 2019 was thereby concluded on 24 july 2020.
on 18 november 2020, a.p. møller - mærsk a/s decided to 
initiate a share buy-back programme of up to dkk 10bn 
(around usd 1.6bn) and a maximum of 1.79 million shares 
to be acquired over a period of up to 15 months.
the share buy-back programme is initiated pursuant to 
the authorisation granted to the board of directors by 
the annual general meeting in 2019, which entitled the 
company to acquire treasury shares at a nominal value 
not exceeding 15% of the share capital at the market 
price applicable at the time of acquisition with a devia-
tion of up to 10%.
the first phase of the programme will run from 1 december 
2020 up to 29 april 2021. the shares to be acquired will be 
limited to a total market value of dkk 3.3bn. a maximum of 
158,586 a shares and 620,270 b shares can be acquired in 
the first phase of the buy-back programme.
the share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to 
adjust the capital structure of a.p. moller - maersk. shares 
which are not used for hedging purposes for the long-
term incentive programmes will be proposed cancelled 
at the annual general meetings in 2021 and 2022.
a.p. moller - maersk has appointed skandinaviska enskilda 
banken (‘seb’) as lead manager. seb will execute the pur-
chase of shares on behalf of a.p. moller - maersk within 
the announced limits and will make all share purchase 
decisions independently and without the involvement of 
a.p. moller - maersk.
no shares may be bought back at a price exceeding 
the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade 
and ii) the highest current independent bid at nasdaq 
copenhagen at the time of trading.
the maximum number of a and b shares that may be pur-
chased on each business day may not exceed 25% of the 
average daily trading volume of a and b shares, respec-
tively, on nasdaq copenhagen or other regulated markets, 
on which the purchase is carried out, over last 20 trading 
days prior to the date of purchase.
disposals of own shares are related to the share option 
plans and the restricted shares plan.

of dkk 3,123m equivalent to usd 468m). payment of divi-
dends is expected to take place on 26 march 2021.

at 31 december 2020, there is dilution effect on earnings 
per share of the 66,971 (0) issued share options while there 
is no dilution effect on earnings per share of the 21,459

table 12.1
restricted shares plan
the restricted shares plan was introduced in 2013, and 
grants have been awarded to employees on a yearly basis 
since 2013. beginning in 2018, grants have also been 
awarded to members of the executive board.
the transfer of restricted shares is contingent upon  
the employee still being employed and not being under 
notice of termination and takes place when three years 
have passed from the time of granting. for members of 
the executive board the vesting period is five years.
the members of the executive board as well as other em-
ployees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting 
period. special conditions apply regarding illness, death 
and resignation as well as changes in the company’s capital 
structure, etc. a part of a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ holding of 
own b shares will be used to meet the company’s obliga-
tions in connection with the restricted shares plan.
the fair value of restricted shares (a.p. møller - mærsk a/s 
b shares) granted to 96 (92) employees and five (five) 
members of the executive board was usd 7m (usd 7m) at 
the time of grant.
the fair value per restricted share at the time of grant 
is dkk 5,975 (dkk 8,668), which is equal to the volume 
weighted average share price on the date of grant, i.e. 
1 april 2020.
the payroll expense related to the restricted shares plan 
is usd 6m (usd 5m).
on 1 april 2020, the restricted shares originally granted 
in 2017 were settled with the employees. the weighted 
average share price at that date was dkk 5,975.
the average remaining contractual life for the restricted 
shares as per 31 december 2020 is 1.8 years (1.7 years).

share option plans
in addition to the plan described above, a.p. moller - maersk 
has share option plans for members of the executive 
board and other employees. each share option granted 
is a call option to buy an existing b share of nominal dkk 
1,000 in a.p. møller - mærsk a/s.
the share options are granted at an exercise price cor-
responding to 110% of the average of the market price 
on the first five trading days following the release of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ annual report. exercise of the 
share options is contingent upon the option holder still 
being employed at the time of exercise. the share options 
can be exercised when at least three years and no more 
than six years (seven years for share options granted to 
employees not members of the executive board) have 
passed from the time of grant. special conditions apply 
regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes 
in the company’s capital structure, etc.
the share options can only be settled in shares. a part of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ holding of own b shares will be 
used to meet the company’s obligations in respect of the 
share option plans.
the fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of 
the executive board and 89 (75) employees was usd 4m 
(usd 9m) at the time of grant.
the payroll expense related to the share option plan is 
usd 5m (usd 5m).
the weighted average share price at the dates of exercise 
of share options was dkk 12,389. no share options were 
exercised during 2019.
the average remaining contractual life as per 31 december 
2020 is 5.1 years (5.2 years) and the exercise price for out-
standing share options is dkk 8,670 (dkk 9,057).
1 average exercise prices were reduced following the 
demerger of maersk drilling. 
 
 
 
table 12.3
the fair value per option granted to members of the 
executive board is calculated at dkk 625 (dkk 1,782) 
at the time of grant, based on black & scholes’ option 
pricing model. the fair value per option granted to em-
ployees not members of the executive board is calcu-
lated at dkk 697 (dkk 1,914) at the time of grant based 
on the same option pricing model.

table 14.1
as employer, the group participates in pension plans 
according to normal practice in the countries in which the 
group operates. generally, the pension plans within the 
group are defined contribution plans, where contributions 
are recognised in the income statement on an accrual 
basis. a number of entities have defined benefit plans, in 
which retirement benefits are based on length of service 
and salary level. to a limited extent, these defined benefit 
plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.
pension and medical plans which, as part of collective 
bargaining agreements, have been entered into with other 
enterprises, known as multi-employer plans, are treated 
as other pension plans. such defined benefit plans are 
treated as defined contribution plans when sufficient in-
formation for calculating the individual enterprises’ share 
of the obligation is not available.
in 2021, the group expects to pay contributions total-
ling usd 16m to funded defined benefit plans, usd 27m 
in 2020.
table 14.2
the majority of the group’s defined benefit liabilities are 
78% in the uk and 12% the us. all of the plans in the 
uk and the majority of the plans in the us are funded. 
although all of the uk plans are now closed to new 
entrants, active members in the two largest plans con-
tinue to accrue new benefits. the smaller uk plans are 
all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains 
in some of the plans.
overall, the plans have an average duration of 15 years 
and approximately 56% of the obligation is in respect of 
pensioner members.
as well as being subject to the risks of falling interest 
rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset 
returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, 
the group is also subject to the risk of higher than ex-
pected inflation. this is because many pension benefits, 
particularly in the uk plans, increase in line with inflation,  
although some minimum and maximum limits apply.

table 14.3
rates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality 
investigations, and in line with market practice an allow-
ance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. 
the group assumes that future improvements will be in 
line with the latest projections of 1.25% for all uk plans.
table 14.4
the liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are 
the group’s best estimate of future experience bearing 
in mind the requirements of ias 19.
 
the group’s plans are funded in accordance with applicable 
local legislation. in the uk, each plan has a trustee board 
that is required to act in the best interests of plan mem-
bers. every three years, a formal valuation of the plan’s 
liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the 
plan is in deficit, the trustees agree with the group or the 
sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.
 
in 2020, the trustees of one of the uk plans, maersk 
retirement benefit scheme (mrbs), entered into an in-
surance contract to provide further security for all future 
benefit payments and annual increases to which members 
are entitled under the scheme. following this mrbs buy-in 
transaction, over 70% of the uk liabilities are now covered 
by insurance policies. therefore, movement in the liabilities 
due to change in assumptions would equally impact the 
assets value related to the buy-in policies, resulting in a 
reduced movement in the overall balance sheet position.
the expected contributions to the uk plans for 2021 are 
usd 11m (usd 23m in 2020) of which usd 9m (usd 20m in 
2020) is deficit recovery contributions. in most of the uk 
plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies 
may be returned to the group. however, the merchant 
navy ratings pension fund (mnrpf), and the merchant 
navy officers pension fund (mnopf) contributions paid 
by the group are not refundable in any circumstance and 
the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any 
agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of defi-
cit determined using the group’s assumptions. in 2020 
an adjustment of usd 3m (usd 2m) was applied in this 
respect.

other than the insurance contracts and a small proportion 
of other holdings, the plan assets held by the group are

multi-employer plans
under collective agreements, certain entities in the 
group participate together with other employers in de-
fined benefit pension plans as well as welfare/medical 
plans (multi-employer plans). in general, the contribu-
tions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or 
cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.
for the defined benefit pension plans, the group has joint 
and several liabilities to fund total obligations. while the 
welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans 
funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. in 2020, the group’s 
contributions to the pension and welfare/medical plans 
are estimated at usd 91m (usd 83m) and usd 277m (usd 
295m), respectively. the contributions to be paid in 2021 
are estimated at usd 92m for the pension plans and usd 
279m for the welfare/medical plans.
no reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes’ 
obligations and plan assets to individual employer par-
ticipants. for the pension plans where the group has an 
interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all 
employers amounts to usd 0.3bn (usd 0.7bn). this net 
obligation is based on the most recent available financial 
data from the plan’s trustees, calculated in accordance 
with the rules for such actuarial calculation in us gaap. 
the deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate 
increased contributions in the future. welfare/medical 
plans are ‘pay as you go’, and form a part of the group’s 
us collective bargain agreements. they cover a limited 
part of employees’ medical costs as occurred.

table 16.1
the group derivatives are presented at fair value in 
the balance sheet. 
 
the group’s activities are exposed to a variety of 
financial risks:
• market risks, i.e. currency risk, interest rate risk  
and oil price risk
• credit risk
• liquidity risk.
the group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks 
to minimise the potential adverse effects on the group’s 
financial performance. the group uses derivative financial 
instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
risk management is carried out by a central finance 
department under policies approved by the board of 
directors. the finance department identifies, evaluates 
and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the 
group’s entities.
market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such 
as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect 
the group’s profit or the value of its holdings of financial 
instruments. the sensitivity analyses in the currency risk 
and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of 
financial instruments at 31 december 2020.
the sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate 
risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of 
net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the 
debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign 
currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in 
place at 31 december 2020. furthermore, it is assumed 
that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have 
a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the 
same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.
the sensitivity analyses in table 16.5 show the effect on 
profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in ex-
change rates and interest rates.
table 16.2
hedges comprise primarily currency derivatives, interest 
rate derivatives and oil price hedges, which are further 
described in the following sections.

table 16.3
currency risk
the group’s currency risk relates to the fact that while 
income from ocean activities is denominated mainly in 
usd, the related expenses are incurred in both usd and 
a wide range of other currencies such as eur, cny, dkk, 
hkd, sgd and cad. as the net income is in usd, this is 
also the primary financing currency. income and expenses 
from other activities, including terminals & towage, are 
mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the 
group’s exposure to these currencies.
the main purpose of hedging the group’s currency risk is 
to hedge the usd value of the group’s net cash flow and 
reduce fluctuations in the group’s profit. the group uses 
various financial derivatives, including forwards, option 
contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. 
the key aspects of the currency hedging policy are:
• net cash flows in other significant currencies than 
usd are hedged using a layered model with a 
12-month horizon
• significant capital commitments or divestments in 
other currencies than usd are hedged
• most non-usd debt is hedged, however, depending 
on the asset-liability match and the currency of the 
generated cash flow.
currency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs 
and investments/divestments, and are recognised when 
the hedged exposure occurs in the income statement or 
the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively.
there is not any proxy hedging for the currency risk hedg-
ing, and therefore the economic relationship between the 
hedged exposure and the hedge is high. effectiveness is 
measured with critical terms match approach according 
to ifrs 9.
hedges of future revenue and operating costs matures 
within a year. there are no hedges of investments at the 
end of 2020 (2019: mature within a year).
for hedges related to operating cash flows and invest-
ments, a gain of usd 95m in 2020 (gain of usd 48m) is 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash 
flow hedge reserve amounts to a gain of usd 109m at 
31 december (gain of usd 14m). for hedges where the 
cost of hedging is applied, the forward points are rec-
ognised in other comprehensive income and transferred 
with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction 
occurs. the cost of hedging reserve amounts to usd 0m 
(usd 0m). ineffectiveness related to hedge of acquisition 
amounts to a gain of usd 3m (usd 0m).
table 16.4
besides the designated cash flow hedges in table 16.3, the 
group enters into derivatives to hedge currency exposures 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting. these derivatives 
are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
table 16.5
the group’s sensitivity to an increase in the usd exchange 
rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which 
the group is exposed is estimated to have the following 
impact in table 16.5.
the sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial 
instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet 
date and are thus not an expression of the group’s total 
currency risk.

interest rate risk
the group has most of its debt denominated in usd, but 
part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies 
such as eur, nok, gbp and jpy. the group strives to 
maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest 
rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.
the hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a du-
ration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate 
swaps. the duration of the group’s debt portfolio is 2.1 
years (2.2 years) excluding ifrs 16 leases.
a general increase in interest rates by one percentage point 
is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before 
tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. 
usd 39m and positively by approx. usd 30m, respectively, 
(positively by approx. usd 11m and negatively by approx. 
usd 14m, respectively).
this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular 
foreign currency rates, remain constant.
the hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross- 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps. the hedging is 
a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging, 
and cash flow hedging.
due to buy-back of issued bonds in 2020, ineffectiveness 
from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income state-
ment with a loss of usd 12m (loss of usd 4m).
the hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the 
nature of the economic relationship between the exposure 
and the hedge. the source of ineffectiveness is the credit 
risk of the hedging instruments. for hedges where the 
cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is 
recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time 
effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity 
amounts to 0. if the hedged transaction is prepaid, the 
change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss 
as ineffectiveness. the cost of hedging reserve amounts 
to a gain of usd 6m (gain of usd 6m).
1 currency element of the cross-currency swaps is not 
designated into the hedge relationship and is recog-
nised in financial items.

oil price risk
the majority of the group’s trading of commodity prod-
ucts is related to inventory stocks of crude oil and bunker 
oil, as the products are bought in large quantities and 
stored for processing and resale. the oil price risk arising 
from these oil price exposures is mitigated by entering 
into commodity derivative agreements. the overall risk 
limit is set in the group’s risk policy, defining a maximum 
net open position for the group. the sensitivity of the 
consolidated net open position is calculated daily on a 
one day value-at-risk (var) with a confidence level of 
95% and 255 days of historical observations. the group 
var limit is usd 6m, and position as of 31 december 2020 
of usd 3m (usd 3m). due to the use of portfolio hedg-
ing, the group does not use hedge accounting for these 
hedges. all gains and losses regarding these hedges are 
recognised in other income or other cost on a net basis, 
due to the nature of the hedging model.

table 16.9 and table 16.10
credit risk
trade receivables
the group has exposure to financial and commercial 
counterparties but has no particular concentration of 
customers or suppliers. to minimise the credit risk, finan-
cial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and 
financial institutions. adequate security is required for 
commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for 
financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.
the group applies the simplified approach to providing 
the expected credit losses prescribed by ifrs 9, which 
permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision 
for all trade receivables. to measure the expected credit 
losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on 
shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. 
in accordance with ifrs 9, not due trade receivables 
have also been impaired.
approximately 89% (67%) of the provision for bad debt 
is related to trade receivables overdue by more than 
one year.
other financial assets at amortised cost
other financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans 
receivable, finance lease receivables and other receiva-
bles. these financial assets are considered to have low 
credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated 
based on 12 months of expected losses is considered 
immaterial. the financial assets are considered to be low 
risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term.
table 16.11
liquidity risk
the group’s objective is to maintain a liquidity profile 
in line with an investment grade credit rating. capital is 
managed for the group. the equity share of total equity 
and liabilities was 55.0% at the end of 2020 (52.0% end 
of 2019).
for information about cash and bank balances in coun-
tries with exchange control or other restrictions, see text 
to the consolidated cash flow statement.
based on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of 
specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the 
current investment profile, the group’s financial resources 
are deemed satisfactory.
the average term to maturity of loan facilities in the group 
was about five years (about five years at 31 december 
2019).
further information about capital structure and funding 
strategy can be found on pages 60-62.
1 liquidity reserve is defined as undrawn committed 
revolving facilities with more than one year to expiry, 
securities, term deposits and cash and bank balances, 
excluding securities and balances in countries with 
exchange control or other restrictions.

it is of great importance for the group to maintain a 
financial reserve to cover the group’s obligations and 
investment opportunities and to provide the capital 
necessary to offset changes in the group’s liquidity due 
to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
the flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing 
prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by 
focusing on the release of capital and following up on 
the development in working capital.

table 17.2
financial instruments measured at fair value
financial instruments measured at fair value can be 
divided into three levels:
level 1 —  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  
for identical assets or liabilities,
level 2 —  inputs other than quoted prices included 
within level 1 that are observable for the  
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices)  
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and
level 3 —  inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data.
fair value of listed securities is within level 1 of the fair 
value hierarchy. non-listed shares and other securities are 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
fair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable 
market data as of the end of the reporting period. a minor 
amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of 
the fair value hierarchy.
fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily 
based on the present value of expected future cash flows.
a reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not 
estimated to affect the group’s profit or equity signifi-
cantly.
financial instruments carried at amortised cost
fair value of the short-term financial assets and other 
financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not mate-
rially different from the carrying amount. in general, fair 
value is determined primarily based on the present value 
of expected future cash flows. where a market price was 
available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy. fair value of the remaining borrowing 
items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and is 
calculated based on discounted future cash flows.

the group is involved in a number of legal cases, tax and 
other disputes. some of these involve significant amounts 
and are subject to considerable uncertainty. management 
continuously assess the risks associated with the cases 
and disputes, and their likely outcome. it is the opinion 
of management that, apart from items recognised in the 
financial statements, the outcome of these cases and 
disputes are not probable or cannot be reliably estimated 
in the term of amount or timing. the group does not ex-
pect these to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.

acquisitions during the year 2020
performance team llc
on 1 april 2020, the group acquired 100% of the shares 
in performance team llc, a us-based warehousing and 
distribution company, to further strengthen its capabili-
ties as an integrated container logistics company, offering 
end-to-end supply chain solutions to its customers.
taking control of performance team llc has positioned 
a.p. moller - maersk among north america’s leading ware-
house and distribution providers with 56 warehouses for 
customers and accelerates the company’s regional logis-
tics and services model.
the total enterprise value of usd 622m consisted of a 
total purchase price of usd 317m on a cash and debt-free 
basis and acquired lease liabilities of around usd 305m. 
the purchase price mainly relates to fixed assets and 
customer list. the lease liabilities have been adjusted in 
accordance with ifrs 16 from the last communication.
the goodwill of usd 95m is attributable to workforce and 
commercial/operational synergies between performance 
team and a.p. moller - maersk and is deductible for tax 
purposes.
from the acquisition date to 31 december 2020, perfor-
mance team llc contributed with a revenue of usd 398m

if the acquisition had occurred on 1 january 2020, the im-
pact on the group’s revenue would have been usd 512m. 
the net profit contributed to the group would have been 
minor.
the accounting for the business combination is consid-
ered provisional at 31 december 2020 due to certain

gujarat pipavav port ltd
the group had a stake of 43.01% in gujarat pipavav port 
ltd (gppl) and treated the entity as an associated com-
pany. on 9 june 2020, the group obtained the majority of 
seats on the board of directors of gppl, thereby obtain-
ing control of the entity.
the acquisition consists of net assets of usd 540m at fair 
value of which usd 240m is terminal rights and non-con-
trolling interest of usd 308m, offset by the derecognition 
of associate company of usd 182m. a gain of usd 45m 
was recognised for disposing gppl as an associate, and the 
cumulative translation reserve loss of usd 61m related to 
the associate was also recycled to profit/loss. liquid funds 
acquired amounted to usd 92m. on the date of acquisi-
tion, the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded 
the listed share price, therefore, the transaction has been 
reported as the bargain purchase. the gain from bargain 
purchase has been reported at usd 46m.
from the acquisition date to 31 december 2020, pipavav 
terminal contributed positively to the results with a 
revenue of usd 59m. if the acquisition had occurred 
on 1 january 2020, the impact on the group’s revenue 
would have been usd 95m.
the accounting for the business combination is consid-
ered provisional at 31 december 2020.
dovana holdings ab (kgh customs service group)
on 1 september 2020, the group acquired 100% of the 
shares in dovana holding ab, kgh customs services, a 
leading sweden-based specialist in trade and customs 
services management in europe, further enhancing its 
capabilities as an integrated container logistics company, 
offering end-to-end supply chain solutions to its global 
customers.
the total enterprise value of usd 294m consisted of a 
total purchase price of usd 288m on a cash and debt-free 
basis and acquired lease liabilities of around usd 6m.
out of the purchase price of usd 288m, debt of usd 
100m has been deducted, and discounted maximum earn-
out of usd 45m has been added to arrive at the usd 
233m in aggregate purchase consideration as reported.
the goodwill of usd 172m is mainly attributable to 
the synergies between kgh customs services and 
a.p. moller - maersk. 
from the acquisition date to 31 december 2020, 
kgh customs services contributed positively to the 
results. if the acquisition had occurred on 1 january 
2020, the impact on the group’s revenue would have 
been usd 91m.
the accounting for the business combination is consid-
ered provisional at 31 december 2020 due to certain 
contingencies, indemnities, etc.
in addition to the above acquisitions, there has been 
a small acquisition in terminals & towage and therefore 
the total of all acquisitions sums up to usd 425m.
for the year 2020, total acquisition cost for the 
acquisitions recognised in the income statement

basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements for 2020 for 
a.p. moller - maersk have been prepared on a going con-
cern basis and in accordance with the international finan-
cial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and 
additional danish disclosure requirements for listed com-
panies. the consolidated financial statements are also 
in accordance with ifrs as issued by the international 
accounting standards board (iasb).
the consolidated financial statements of 
a.p. moller - maersk are included in the consolidated 
financial statements of a.p. møller holding a/s.
the accounting policies are consistent with those applied 
in the consolidated financial statements for 2019, except 
for the changes to the accounting standards that were ef-
fective from 1 january 2020 and were endorsed by the eu.
ixbrl reporting
from 2020, a.p. møller - mærsk a/s is required to file 
the annual report in the new european single electronic 
format (esef) and the annual report in 2020 is therefore 
prepared in the xhtml format that can be displayed 
in a standard browser. the primary statements in the 
consolidated financial statements are tagged using 
inline extensible business reporting language (ixbrl). 
the ixbrl tags comply with the esef taxonomy, which 
is included in the esef regulation and developed based 
on the ifrs taxonomy published by the ifrs foundation. 
where a financial statement line item is not defined in the 
esef taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been 
created. extensions are anchored to elements in the esef 
taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.
the annual report submitted to the danish financial 
supervisory authority consists of the xhtml document 
together with certain technical files, all included in a file 
named apmm-2020-12-31.zip.
change to reportable segments
as part of the refinement of a.p. moller - maersk’s seg-
ment structure to further align with internal management 
structure and demarcation between the reportable seg-
ment activities, a number of changes have been made. 
the main changes involve moving the maersk oil trading 
activity to the ocean segment from manufacturing & 
others, and the intermodal activity in hamburg süd to 
logistics & services from ocean.
comparison figures for note 1 have been restated as if the 
changes had been implemented in 2019. the reportable 
segments are disclosed below. 
a number of changes to accounting standards are effec-
tive from 1 january 2020 and endorsed by the eu:
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8: definition of material
• amendments to ifrs 3: business combinations.
a.p. moller - maersk follows the guidelines in the above 
amendments, and the implementation did not change the 
accounting policies.
consolidation
the consolidated financial statements comprise the 
parent company a.p. møller - mærsk a/s, its subsidiaries 
and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified 
as joint operations.
subsidiaries are entities controlled by 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s. control is based on the power to 
direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, 
or right, to variable returns arising from it. in that connec-
tion, relevant activities are those that significantly affect 
the investee’s returns. control is usually achieved by 
directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling 
more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, 
such as agreements on management control.
joint arrangements are entities in which 
a.p. moller - maersk, according to contractual agree-
ments with one or more other parties, has joint control. 
the arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the 
contracting parties’ rights are limited to net assets in 
the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the 
parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.
entities in which a.p. moller - maersk exercises a signifi-
cant but non-controlling influence are considered associ-
ated companies. a significant influence is usually achieved 
by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of 
the voting rights. agreements and other circumstances 
are considered when assessing the degree of influence.
consolidation is performed by summarising the financial 
statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, 
including the proportionate share of joint operations, 
part-owned vessels and pool arrangements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with a.p. moller - maersk’s 
accounting policies. intra-group income and expenses, 
shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains 
on intra-group transactions are eliminated. unrealised 
gains on transactions with associated companies and 
joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to 
a.p. moller - maersk’s ownership share. unrealised losses 
are eliminated in the same way, unless they indicate 
impairment.
non-controlling interests’ share of profit/loss for the 
year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of 
a.p. moller - maersk’s profit and equity respectively, but 
shown as separate items.
foreign currency translation
the consolidated financial statements are presented in 
usd, the functional currency of the parent company. in the 
translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, 
associates or joint arrangements with functional curren-
cies other than usd, the total comprehensive income is 
translated into usd at average exchange rates, and the 
balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the 
balance sheet date. exchange rate differences arising from 
such translations are recognised directly in other compre-
hensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.
the functional currency varies from business area to 
business area. for a.p. moller - maersk’s principal shipping 
activities, the functional currency is typically usd. this 
means, among other things, that the carrying amounts 
of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are main-
tained in usd from the date of acquisition. for other 
activities, including container terminal activities and 
land-based container activities, the functional currency  
is generally the local currency of the country in which 
such activities are performed, unless circumstances 
suggest a different currency is appropriate.
transactions in currencies other than the functional cur-
rency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
date of the transaction. monetary items in foreign curren-
cies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated 
at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. foreign 
exchange gains and losses are included in the income 
statement as financial income or expenses.
segment information
the allocation of business activities into segments reflects 
a.p. moller - maersk’s character as an integrated container 
logistics business and is in line with the internal manage-
ment reporting. the reportable segments are as follows:

handling, documentation services, container services as 
well as container storage.

the reportable segments do not comprise costs in 
a.p. moller - maersk’s corporate functions. these func-
tions are reported as unallocated items.
revenue between segments is limited, except for the 
terminals & towage segment, where a large part of the 
services is delivered to the ocean segment as well as the 
sale of containers from maersk container industry to the 
ocean segment. sales of products and services between 
segments are based on market terms.
income statement
revenue for all businesses is recognised when the per-
formance obligation has been satisfied, which happens 
upon the transfer of control to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods 
and services.
revenue from shipping activities is recognised over time 
as the performance obligation is satisfied, including 
a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the 
balance sheet date. invoiced revenue related to an esti-
mated proportion of remaining voyage time and activi-
ties at the destination port is deferred. number of days 
of a voyage, as a percentage of the total number of days 
a voyage is estimated to last, is considered as a close ap-
proximation of percentage of completion. detention and 
demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the 
time of the customer’s late return or pick-up of contain-
ers. retrospective volume rebates provided to certain 
customers which give rise to variable consideration are 
based on the expected value method and allocated to 
ocean freight revenue.
revenue from terminal operations and towing activities is 
recognised upon completion of the service. in container ter-
minals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing 
and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed 
on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as reve-
nue during the construction.
revenue from most freight forwarding activities is recog-
nised over time.
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the 
transfer of control to the buyer.
share of profit/loss in associated companies and joint ven-
tures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share 
of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. the item also 
comprises any impairment losses for such investments 
and their reversal.
tax comprises an estimate of current and deferred in-
come tax as well as adjustments to previous years of 
those. income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of 
corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. in addi-
tion, tax comprises tonnage tax. tonnage tax is classified 
as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. 
tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent 
that it arises from items recognised in the income state-
ment, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions 
that have been eliminated in the consolidation.
earnings per share are calculated as the 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ share of the profit/loss for the 
year divided by the number of shares (of dkk 1,000 each), 
excluding a.p. moller - maersk’s holding of own shares. 
diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilution 
effect of share-based compensation issued by the parent 
company.
statement of comprehensive income
other comprehensive income consists of gains and losses 
not recognised in the income statement, including ex-
change rate adjustments arising from the translation from 
functional currency to presentation currency, fair value 
adjustments of other equity investments (at fvoci), cash 
flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as 
well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, 
etc. a.p. moller - maersk’s share of other comprehensive 
income in associated companies and joint ventures is 
also included.
on disposal or discontinuation of an entity, 
a.p. moller - maersk’s share of the accumulated exchange 
rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a 
non-usd functional currency is reclassified to the income 
statement. accumulated value adjustments of equity 
instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value 
through other comprehensive income will remain in 
equity upon disposal.
other comprehensive income includes current and de-
ferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised 
in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.
balance sheet
intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. amortisation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets. intangible assets regarding ac-
quired customer relationships and brand names are am-
ortised over a useful life of 15 and 20 years, respectively. 
it software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.

for container terminals operated under certain restrictive 
price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to 
collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. 
the cost includes the present value of minimum payments 
under concession agreements and the cost of property, 
plant and equipment constructed on behalf of a grantor 
of a concession. the rights are amortised from the com-
mencement of operations over the concession period.
property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less ac-
cumulated depreciation and impairment losses. deprecia-
tion is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the useful lives at an estimated residual value. 
the useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:
ships, etc.
20-25 years 
containers, etc.
12 years 
buildings
10-50 years
terminal infrastructure
10-20 years or  
concession period,

plant and machinery, cranes  
and other terminal equipment
5-20 years
other operating equipment,  
fixtures, etc.
3-7 years 
estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed 
on a regular basis.
the cost of an asset is divided into separate components, 
which are depreciated separately if the useful lives of the 
individual components differ. dry-docking costs are recog-
nised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and 
depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.
the cost of assets constructed by a.p. moller - maersk 
includes directly attributable expenses. for assets with 
a long construction period, borrowing costs during the 
construction period from specific as well as general 
borrowings are attributed to cost. in addition, the cost 
includes the net present value of estimated costs of re-
moval and restoration.
right-of-use assets: the group mainly leases vessels, con-
tainers, concessions arrangements and real estate prop-
erty. lease contracts for vessels and containers are typ-
ically made for fixed periods of about five years but may 
have extension options as described below. concession 
arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on 
an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and 
conditions.
leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a cor-
responding leases liability at the date on which the leased 
asset is available for use by the group. the right-of-use 
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful 
life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
intercompany leases will continue to be presented ac-
cording to ifrs 8 – segment reporting, as operating 
leases in accordance with the old lease standard, ias 17.
impairment losses are recognised when the carrying 
amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the 
higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less 
costs of disposal. goodwill is attributed to cash-generat-
ing units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
tested for impairment if there is an indication of impair-
ment. however, annual impairment tests are carried out 
for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet 
in use.
assets are held for sale, when the carrying amount of an 
individual non-current asset, or disposal groups, will be re-
covered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. assets are classified as held for 
sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, 
when the activities are available for immediate sale in their 
present condition, and when the activities are expected to 
be disposed of within 12 months. liabilities directly asso-
ciated with assets held for sale are presented separately 
from other liabilities.
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of car-
rying amount immediately before classification as held 
for sale and fair value less costs to sell, and impairment 
tests are performed immediately before classification 
as held for sale. non-current assets are not depreciated 
or amortised while classified as held for sale. measure-
ment of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities 
is unchanged.
investments in associated companies and joint ventures are 
recognised as a.p. moller - maersk’s share of the equity 
value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. 
goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated 
companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject 
to an impairment test together with the investment as a 
whole. impairment losses are reversed to the extent the 
original value is considered recoverable.
equity instruments, etc., including shares, bonds and sim-
ilar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair 
value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market 
price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for 
non-listed securities. fair value adjustments from equity 
investments at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (fvoci) remain in equity upon disposal. dividends 
are recognised in the income statement.
inventories mainly consist of bunker, containers (manu-
facturing), spare parts not qualifying for property, plant 
and equipment, and other consumables. inventories are 
measured at cost, primarily according to the fifo method. 
the cost of finished goods and work in progress includes 
direct and indirect production costs.
loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, 
plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. for loans and other receivables, write-down is 
made for anticipated losses based on specific individual 
or group assessments. for trade receivables, the loss al-
lowance is measured in accordance with ifrs 9 applying 
a provision matrix to calculate the minimum impairment. 
the provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due 
receivables.
equity includes total comprehensive income for the year 
comprising the profit/loss for the year and other com-
prehensive income. proceeds on the purchase and sale of 
own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised 
in equity.
the translation reserve comprises a.p. moller - maersk’s 
share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising 
on translation from functional currency into presentation 
currency. the reserve for other equity investments com-
prises accumulated changes in the fair value of equity 
investments (at fvoci), net of tax. reserve for hedges 
includes the accumulated fair value of derivatives qualify-
ing for cash flow hedge accounting, net of tax, as well as 
forward points and currency basis spread.
equity-settled restricted shares and share options allocated 
to the executive employees of a.p. moller - maersk as part 
of a.p. moller - maersk’s long-term incentive programme 
are recognised as staff costs over the vesting period at 
estimated fair value at the grant date and a corresponding 
adjustment in equity. cash-settled performance awards 
allocated to employees below executive levels as part of 
a.p. moller - maersk’s long-term incentive programme are 
recognised as staff costs over the vesting period and a 
corresponding adjustment in other payables.
at the end of each reporting period, a.p. moller - maersk 
revises its estimates of the number of awards that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting condi-
tions and service conditions. any impact of the revision is 
recognised in the income statement with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity and other payables.
provisions are recognised when a.p. moller - maersk has a 
present legal or constructive obligation from past events. 
the item includes, among other things, legal disputes, 
provisions for onerous contracts, unfavourable contracts 
acquired as part of a business combination, as well as 
provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents 
under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the us. 
provisions are recognised based on best estimates, and 
are discounted where the time element is significant and 
where the time of settlement is reasonably determinable.
pension obligations are the net liabilities of defined ben-
efit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for 
note 23 significant accounting policies – continued

amounts in usd million  
the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling require-
ments. plans with a funding surplus are presented as net 
assets on the balance sheet. the defined benefit obliga-
tions are measured at the present value of expected fu-
ture payments to be made in respect of services provided 
by employees up to the balance sheet date. plan assets 
are measured at fair value. the pension cost charged to 
the income statement consists of calculated amounts for 
vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement of 
gains or losses, etc. interest on plan assets is calculated 
with the same rates as used for discounting the obliga-
tions. actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other com-
prehensive income.
pension plans where a.p. moller - maersk, as part of col-
lective bargaining agreements, participates together with 
other enterprises – so called multi-employer plans – are 
treated as other pension plans in the financial state-
ments. defined benefit multi-employer plans, where suf-
ficient information to apply defined benefit accounting 
is not available, are treated as defined contribution plans.
deferred tax is calculated on temporary differences be-
tween the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities. deferred tax is not recognised for differences 
on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at 
the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable 
profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a 
business combination. in addition, no deferred tax is rec-
ognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when 
a.p. moller - maersk controls the timing of dividends, and 
no taxable dividends are currently expected. a deferred 
tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.
financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less 
transaction costs. subsequently, the financial liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective inter-
est method, whereby transaction costs and any premium 
or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the 
term of the liabilities. fixed interest loans subject to fair 
value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost 
with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged inter-
est component. liabilities in respect of leases are meas-
ured at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable 
to determine, or else at a.p. moller - maersk’s incremental 
borrowing rate.
lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value 
of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted 
using the incremental borrowing rate.
the following lease payments are included in the net 
present value:
• fixed payments (including in-substance fixed  
payments), less any lease incentives receivable
• variable lease payments that are based on an index  
or a rate
• amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under 
residual value guarantees
• the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is 
reasonably certain to exercise that option, and pay-
ments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the 
lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.
payments associated with short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis 
as an expense in profit/loss.
extension and termination options in lease contracts 
are included in contracts, where a.p. moller - maersk will 
probably exercise the options. these terms are used to 
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing 
contracts. in determining the lease term, management 
considers all facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or 
not exercise a termination option. extension options 
(or periods after termination options) are only included 
in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to 
be extended or not terminated. most of the extension 
and termination options held are exercisable only by 
a.p. moller - maersk and not by the respective lessor. this 
assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a signif-
icant change in circumstances occurs which affects this 
assessment, and which is within the control of the les-
see. where a.p. moller - maersk will probably exercise spe-
cific purchase options, those options are included in the 
measurement of the lease liability with corresponding 
right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset’s useful 
life rather than lease term.
lease payments are discounted at the implicit interest 
rate, to the extent this can be determined, otherwise 
discounted using incremental borrowing rates (ibrs). 
a.p. moller - maersk’s ibr reflects the group’s credit risk, 
leased amount and contract duration, as well as the 
nature and quality of the asset’s security and economic 
environment in which the leased assets operate. to de-
termine the ibr, where possible, a.p. moller - maersk uses 
recent third-party financing received by the individual 
lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect 
changes in financing conditions since that financing 
was received. where such financing is not available, 
a.p. moller - maersk uses a build-up approach that starts 
with a risk-free interest rate adjusted by credit risk and 
specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geo-
graphical risks, etc.
subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amor-
tised cost with each lease payment allocated between 
the repayment of the liability and financing cost. the 
finance cost is charged to the income statement over  
the lease period using the ibr that was used to discount 
the lease payments.
derivative financial instruments
derivative financial instruments are recognised on the 
trading date and measured at fair value using generally 
acknowledged valuation techniques based on relevant 
observable swap curves and exchange rates.
the effective portion of changes in the value of derivative 
financial instruments designated to hedge highly proba-
ble future transactions is recognised in other comprehen-
sive income until the hedged transactions are realised. at 
that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred 
to the items under which the hedged transactions are rec-
ognised. the effective portion of changes in the value of 
derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value 
of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised 
in the income statement together with changes in the fair 
value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attrib-
uted to the hedging relationship. currency basis spread 
and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and 
deferred in equity.
the ineffective portion of hedge transactions and 
changes in the fair values of derivative financial instru-
ments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are 
recognised in the income statement as financial income 
or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, 
and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and for-
ward freight agreements.
cash flow statement
cash flow from operating activities includes all cash 
transactions other than cash flows arising from invest-
ments and divestments, received dividends, principal 
payments of loans, instalments on lease liabilities, paid 
and received financial items and equity transactions. 
capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a non-
cash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing 
costs are included in cash flow from financing.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank bal-
ances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities 
form an integral part of a.p. moller - maersk’s cash man-
agement.
business combinations and disposal of subsidiaries
upon acquisition of new entities, the acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair 
value at the date when control was achieved using the 
acquisition method. identifiable intangible assets are 
recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can 
other wise be separately identified. the difference be-
tween the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair 
value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as 
goodwill. contingent consideration is measured at fair 
value and any subsequent changes to contingent consid-
eration are recognised as other income or other costs in 
the income statement. transaction costs are recognised 
as operating costs as they are incurred.
when a.p. moller - maersk ceases to have control of 
a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is 
re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is 
recognised in the income statement as a gain/loss on the 
sale of non-current assets. the difference between sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is 
recognised in the income statement including fair value of 
note 23 significant accounting policies – continued

amounts in usd million  
contingent consideration at the time of sale. contingent 
consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes 
recognised in the income statement.
the effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling 
interests without changes in control is included directly 
in equity.
discontinued operations and assets held for sale
discontinued operations represent a separate major 
line of businesses disposed of or in preparation for sale. 
the results of discontinued operations are presented 
separately in the income statement, and the cash flows 
from discontinued operations are presented separately 
in the cash flow statement with restatement of compar-
ative figures.
assets and liabilities held for sale from discontinued 
operations are presented as separate items in the bal-
ance sheet with no restatement of comparative figures. 
elimination between continuing and discontinued oper-
ations is presented to reflect continuing operations as 
post-separation, which entails the elimination of interest, 
borrowing, dividends and capital increases.
assets and liabilities from discontinued operations and 
assets held for sale, except financial assets, etc., are 
measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately 
before classification as held for sale and fair value less 
cost to sell, and impairment tests are performed imme-
diately before classification as held for sale. non-current 
assets held for sale are not depreciated.
new financial reporting requirements
a.p. moller - maersk has not yet adopted the following 
accounting standards/requirements:
ifrs 17 - insurance contracts
ifrs 17: an analysis of the impact is being assessed and 
is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the 
implementation date.
other changes to ifrs are not expected to have any 
significant impact on recognition and measurement.
note 23 significant accounting policies – continued
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
requires management, on an ongoing basis, to make 
judgements and estimates and form assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts. management forms its 
judgements and estimates based on historical experience, 
independent advice and external data points, as well as 
on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances.
in certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including 
ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute 
those plans or to settle claims that are raised against 
a.p. moller - maersk, is highly uncertain. therefore, as-
sumptions may change, or the outcome may differ in 
the coming years, which could require a material upward 
or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities. this note includes the areas in which 
a.p. moller - maersk is particularly exposed to a material 
adjustment of the carrying amounts as at the end of 2020.
significant accounting judgements
determination of cash-generating units
judgement is applied in the definition of cash-generating 
units and in the selection of methodologies and assump-
tions for impairment tests.
the determination of cash-generating units differs for 
the various business areas. ocean operates its fleet of 
container vessels and hub terminals in an integrated 
network. consequently, the ocean activities are tested 
for impairment as a single cash-generating unit. in addi-
tion, the intermodal activities reported under logistics & 
services are included in the ocean cash-generating unit 
for impairment testing to apply consistency between 
the asset base and related cash flows. in logistics & 
services, apart from intermodal, each main product is 
defined as a cash-generating unit. in gateway terminals, 
each terminal is considered individually in impairment 
tests, except when the capacity is managed as a port-
folio. towage groups vessels according to type, size, etc. 
in accordance with the structure governing manage-
ment’s ongoing follow-up. projected cash flow models 
are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair 
value is deemed lower than value in use. external data is 
used to the extent possible, and centralised processes, 
involving corporate functions, ensure that indices or 
data sources are selected consistently while observing 
differences in risks and other circumstances. current 
market values for vessels, etc. are estimated using 
acknowledged brokers.
operations in countries with limited access  
to repatriating surplus cash
a.p. moller - maersk operates worldwide, and in this 
respect, has operations in countries where access to 
repatriating surplus cash is limited. in these coun-
tries, management makes judgements as to whether 
these cash positions can be recognised as cash or cash 
equivalents.
significant accounting estimates
aspects of uncertainty
in its assumption setting, management deals with dif-
ferent aspects of uncertainty. one aspect of uncertainty 
is whether an asset or liability exists, where the assess-
ment forms the basis for recognition or derecognition 
decisions, including assessment of control. another as-
pect is the measurement uncertainty, where management 
makes assumptions about the value of recognised assets 
and liabilities. these assumptions concern the timing 
and amount of future cash flows, and the risks inherent 
in these.
impairment tests
the outcome of impairment tests is subject to estimates 
of the development of freight rates, volumes, bunker 
prices and discount rates. 
the future development in freight rates is an uncertain 
and significant factor impacting especially the ocean 
segment, whose financial results are directly affected by 
fluctuations in container freight rates. freight rates are 
influenced by both regional and global economic environ-
ment and trade patterns, as well as by industry-specific 
trends in respect of capacity supply and demand. the long-
term economic consequences of covid-19 are still un-
known and could cause a shift in freight rates or volumes.
the future development in the oil price is an uncertain 
and significant factor impacting accounting estimates 
across a.p. moller - maersk, either directly or indirectly. 
the ocean segment is directly impacted by the price of 
bunker oil, where the competitive landscape determines 
the extent to which the development is reflected in the 
freight rates charged to the customer. apm terminals is 
indirectly impacted by the oil price as terminals located 
in oil-producing countries, e.g. nigeria, angola, egypt, 
russia and brazil, are indirectly impacted by the develop-
ment in oil prices and the consequences on the countries’ 
economies, which not only affect volume handled in the 
terminals, but also exchange rates.
a.p. moller - maersk carries goodwill of usd 968m 
(usd 637m).
in ocean, the cash flow projection is based on forecasts as 
per q3 2020, covering plans for 2021-2025. management 
has applied an assumption of growth in volumes, pressure 
on freight rates and continued cost efficiency. the im-
pairment test continues to show headroom from value in 
use to the carrying amount. management is of the opinion 
that the assumptions applied are sustainable.

amounts in usd million  
in terminals & towage, management assesses impair-
ment triggers and based on these, estimates recoverable 
amounts on the individual terminals. for apm terminals’ 
interest in global port investments, being the share of 
equity and significant intangible assets acquired, manage-
ment assesses the recoverable amount of its interest on 
an ongoing basis. uncertain variables in the estimate are 
the economic outlook, local competition, effect on vol-
umes, operating expenses and discount rate. the carrying 
amount of the investment may not be sustainable in the 
next few years if markets develop significantly adversely 
compared to current expectations. estimates of recov-
erable amounts were also prepared for other terminals 
where decreasing volumes triggered impairment tests. 
key sensitivities are expected volumes, local port rates, 
concession right extensions as well as discount rate. the 
impairment tests showed headroom from fair value less 
cost of disposal and value in use calculations compared to 
carrying amount for all terminals in continued use. there-
fore, no impairment was recognised in 2020 (usd 0m in 
2019) related to terminals in markets with challenging 
commercial conditions. for assets held for sale, usd 62m 
was recognised in impairments. continued economic de-
terioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in 
certain oil-producing countries can potentially put pres-
sure on carrying amounts of individual terminals.
reference is made to notes 6 and 7 for information 
about impairment losses, recoverable amounts and dis-
count rates.
amortisation, depreciation and residual values
useful lives are estimated based on experience. manage-
ment decides from time to time to revise the estimates 
for individual assets or groups of assets with similar char-
acteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance 
and repair, technical development and environmental 
requirements. please refer to note 23 for the useful lives 
typically used for new assets.
residual values are difficult to estimate given the long lives 
of vessels, the uncertainty as to future economic condi-
tions and the future price of steel, which is considered 
the main determinant of the residual price. generally, the 
residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of 
the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. the long-
term view is prioritised to disregard, to the extent possible, 
temporary market fluctuations, which may be significant.
provisions for pension and other employee benefits
for defined benefit schemes, management makes assump-
tions about future remuneration and pension changes, 
employee attrition rates, life expectancy, inflation and 
discount rates. when setting these assumptions, manage-
ment takes advice from the actuaries performing the 
valuation. the inflation and discount rates are determined 
centrally for the major plans on a country-by-country basis. 
all other assumptions are determined on a plan-by- plan 
basis. refer to note 14 for information about key assump-
tions and the sensitivity of the liability to changes in 
these assumptions.
plan assets are measured at fair value by fund adminis-
trators.
provision for legal cases, disputes, uncertain tax positions etc.
management’s estimate of the provisions regarding le-
gal cases and disputes, including disputes on taxes and 
duties, is based on the knowledge available on the actual 
substance of the cases and a legal assessment of these. 
the resolution of legal disputes, through either negotia-
tions or litigation, can take several years to complete and 
the outcome is subject to considerable uncertainty.
a.p. moller - maersk is engaged in a number of disputes 
with tax authorities of varying scope. appropriate pro-
visions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have 
been made where the probability of the tax position being 
upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. 
claims, for which the probability of a.p. moller - maersk’s 
tax position being upheld is assessed by management to 
be at least 50%, are not provided for. such risks are in-
stead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area, 
and country risk provisions and uncertain tax liabilities 
are recognised where the aggregated probability of the 
tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.
deferred tax assets
judgement has been applied in the measurement of 
deferred tax assets with respect to a.p. moller - maersk’s 
ability to utilise the assets. management considers the 
likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business 
plans and recent financial performances of the individual 
entities. net deferred tax assets recognised in entities 
having suffered an accounting loss in either the current or 
preceding period amount to usd 87m (usd 98m) for con-
tinuing operations, excluding entities participating in joint 
taxation schemes. these assets mainly relate to unused 
tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated 
during the construction of terminals, where taxable prof-
its have been generated either in the current period or are 
expected within a foreseeable future.
vessel-sharing agreements 
(cost-sharing arrangements)
vessel-sharing agreements in shipping require that some 
vessels are committed towards specific service routes. 
the committed vessel’s capacity is then shared with one 
or more container shipping providers in proportion to 
each party’s contribution to the joint service service on 
multi-year agreements. in practice, it is not always possi-
ble to provide tonnage precisely as agreed in the sharing 
arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes 
place on the basis of relative capacity over/under utilised 
on a mutually agreed cycle. at a.p. moller - maersk, these 
capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs 
incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at 
that time.

activities comprise holding of shares in subsidiaries and 
associated companies, as well as funding, procurement 
and cash management.

subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised 
at cost, cf. note 19, less impairment losses, and in the 
income statement, dividends from subsidiaries and 
associated companies are recognised as income.
the net profit for the year was usd 601m (loss of usd 
10m). the main difference is financial expenses as 2019 
was impacted by impairment loss on the maersk drilling 
holding a/s demerger. furthermore, reversal of provi-
sions, etc. reduces operational costs compared to 2019.
cash flow from operating activities was negative usd 
76 (negative usd 368). total assets amounted to usd 
40.5bn (usd 38.3bn) and total equity was usd 24.1bn

share option plans
in addition to the plan described above, the company has 
share options plans for members of the executive board 
and other employees. each share option granted is a call 
option to buy an existing b share of nominal dkk 1,000 in 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s.
the share options were granted at an exercise price cor-
responding to 110% of the average of the market price 
on the first five trading days following the release of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ annual report. exercise of the 
share options is contingent on the option holder still be-
ing employed at the time of exercise. the share options 
can be exercised when at least three years and no more 
than six years (seven years for share options granted to 
employees not members of the executive board) have 
passed from the time of granting. special conditions 
apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as 
changes in the company’s capital structure, etc.
the share options can only be settled in shares. a part of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s’ holding of own b shares will be 
used to meet the company’s obligations in respect of the 
share option plans.
the fair value of awards granted to five (five) members of 
the executive board and 89 (75) employees was usd 4m 
(usd 9m) at the time of grant. 
the payroll expense related to the share options plan is 
usd 1m (usd 1m). 
the weighted average share price at the dates of exercise 
of share options was dkk 12,389. no share options were 
exercised during 2019.
the average remaining contractual life as per 31 decem-
ber 2020 is 5.1 years (5.2 years) and the exercise price for 
outstanding share options is dkk 8,670 (dkk 9,057).
1 at the time of grant.
2 average exercise prices were reduced following the  
demerger of maersk drilling in 2019.
table 9.3
the fair value per option granted to members of the 
executive board is calculated at dkk 625 (dkk 1,782) at 
the time of grant based on black & scholes’ option pricing 
model. the fair value per option granted to employees not 
members of the executive board is calculated at dkk 697 
(dkk 1,914) at the time of grant based on the same option 
pricing model.

table 12.1
the company’s activities expose it to a variety of  
financial risks:
• market risks, i.e. currency risk and interest rate risk 
• credit risk
• liquidity risk.
the company’s overall risk management programme 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and 
seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the 
company’s financial performance. the company uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk 
exposures.
risk management is carried out by a central finance 
department under policies approved by the board of 
directors. the finance department identifies, evaluates 
and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the 
company’s entities.
market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such 
as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect 
the company’s profit or the value of its holdings of finan-
cial instruments. the sensitivity analyses in the currency 
risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of 
financial instruments at 31 december 2020.
the sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate 
risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of 
net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of 
the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in 
foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge desig-
nations in place at 31 december 2020. furthermore, it is 
assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensi-
tivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates 
results in the same absolute movement as a decrease 
in rates.
the sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and 
equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates 
and interest rates.
table 12.2
hedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and in-
terest rate derivatives, which are further described in the 
following sections.

table 12.3
currency risk
the company’s currency risk arises primarily from its 
treasury activities where financing is obtained and pro-
vided in a wide range of currencies other than usd such 
as eur, gbp and nok.
the main purpose of hedging the company’s currency 
risk is to hedge the usd value of the company’s net cash 
flow and reduce fluctuations in the company’s profit. 
the company uses various financial derivatives, including 
forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to 
hedge these risks. the key aspects of the currency hedg-
ing policy are as follows:
• net cash flows in other significant currencies than usd 
are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month 
horizon
• significant capital commitments or divestments in 
other currencies than usd are hedged
• most non-usd debt is hedged, however, depending on 
the asset-liability match and the currency of the gen-
erated cash flow.
table 12.4
the company enters into derivatives to hedge currency 
exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
these derivatives are classified as fair value through 
profit or loss.
an increase in the usd exchange rate of 10% against 
all other significant currencies to which the company is 
exposed is presented in the table.

table 12.5 
sensitivity table
the sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial 
instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet 
date and are thus not an expression of the company’s 
total currency risk.
interest rate risk
the company has most of its debt denominated in usd, 
but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other curren-
cies such as eur, nok, gbp and jpy. the company strives 
to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest 
rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks. 
the hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a du-
ration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate 
swaps. the duration of the company’s debt portfolio is 2.1 
years (2.2 years) excluding ifrs 16 leases. 
a general increase in interest rates by one percentage 
point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit 
before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by 
approx. usd 151m and positively by approx. usd 96m, re-
spectively (positively by approx. usd 192m and positively 
by approx. usd 127m, respectively).
this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particu-
lar foreign currency rates, remain constant. 
the hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross- 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps. the hedging is 
a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging 
and cash flow hedging.
due to buy-back of issued bonds in 2020, ineffectiveness 
from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income state-
ment with a loss of usd 12m (loss of usd 4m).
the hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the 
nature of the economic relationship between the expo-
sure and the hedge. the source of ineffectiveness is the 
credit risk of the hedging instruments. for hedges where 
the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread 
is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time 
effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity 
amounts to 0.

if the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis 
spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffective-
ness. the cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of 
usd 6m (gain of usd 6m).
the borrowing interest levels is specified in table 12.6
table 12.6 
credit risk
the company has substantial exposure to financial and 
commercial counterparties but has no particular con-
centration of customers or suppliers. to minimise the 
credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major 
customers and financial institutions, adequate security 
is required for commercial counterparties, and credit 
limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial 
counterparties.
financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receiv-
able, lease receivables, and other receivables. these are 
all considered to have low credit risk and thus the im-
pairment provision calculated based on 12 months of ex-
pected losses is considered immaterial. the financial as-
sets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk 
of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its 
contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s applies the simple approach to 
providing the expected credit losses prescribed by ifrs 9, 
which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss pro-
vision for all trade receivables. to measure the expected 
credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based 
on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past 
due. in accordance with ifrs 9, also non-due trade receiv-
ables have been impaired. 
other financial assets at amortised cost include loans to 
subsidiaries. as of 31 december 2020, the loans amount 
to usd 17.2bn (usd 20.7bn) and are considered to have 
a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be 
recognised during the period is limited to 12 months of 
expected losses. the credit risk has not increased sig-
nificantly since the initial recognition and is considered 
low based on the investment grade credit rating for the 
group and consequently the financial strength of the 
major subsidiaries within the group. prior years’ loan 
write-down balance on maersk supply service a/s loan 
receivables remains recognised in 2020, while maersk 
container industry a/s loan is settled.
table 12.7 
liquidity risk
it is of great importance for the company to maintain a 
financial reserve to cover the company’s obligations and 
investment opportunities and to provide the capital 
necessary to offset changes in the company’s liquidity 
due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.
the flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to on-
going prioritisation and optimisation, among other things 
by focusing on the release of capital and following up on 
the development in working capital.

table 13.2
financial instruments measured at fair value
financial instruments measured at fair value can be 
divided into three levels:
level 1 –  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities
level 2 –  inputs other than quoted prices included 
within level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
level 3 –  inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data.
fair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair 
value hierarchy. non-listed shares and other securities 
fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
fair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable 
market data as of the end of the reporting period.
fair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily 
based on the present value of expected future cash 
flows. a reasonably possible change in the discount 
rate is not estimated to affect the company’s profit 
or equity significantly.
financial instruments carried at amortised cost
fair value of the short-term financial assets and other 
financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not mate-
rially different from the carrying amount. in general, fair 
value is determined primarily based on the present value 
of expected future cash flows. where a market price was 
available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.
fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy. fair value of the remaining borrowing 
items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is 
calculated on the basis of discounted interests and in-
stalments.
after separating the drilling activities in 2019, the 
company holds no property, plant and equipment.
pledges 
vessels and containers, etc., owned by subsidiaries with 
a carrying amount of usd 0.7bn (usd 1.4bn) have been 
pledged as security for loans of usd 0.3bn (usd 0.6bn).

secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the 
offshore facilities in denmark by issuance of a declaration. 
the company assesses the risk of economic outflows due 
to this secondary liability as very remote.
guarantees amount to usd 0.3bn (usd 0.4bn). thereof, 
usd 0.3bn (usd 0.4bn) is related to subsidiaries. the 
guarantees are not expected to be realised, but they can 
mature within one year.
except for customary agreements within the company’s 
activities, no material agreements have been entered 
into that will take effect, change or expire upon changes 
of the control over the company.
the company is involved in a number of legal cases, tax, 
and other disputes. some of these involve significant 
amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty. 
management continuously assess the risks associated 
with the cases and disputes, and their likely outcome. it is 
the opinion of management that, apart from items recog-
nized in the financial statements, the outcome of these 
cases and disputes are not probable or cannot be reliably 
estimated in the term of amount or timing. the company 
does not expect these to have a material impact on the 
financial statements.
tax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends. through 
participation in joint taxation scheme with a.p. møller 
holding a/s, the company is jointly and severally liable 
for taxes payable, etc. in denmark.

the financial statements for 2020 for 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s have been prepared on a going 
concern basis and in accordance with the international 
financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the 
eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for 
listed companies. the consolidated financial statements 
are also in accordance with ifrs as issued by the inter-
national accounting standards board (iasb).
the accounting policies of the company are consistent 
with those applied in the financial statements for 2019, 
apart from the fact that the company in december 2019 
elected to early adopt the amendments to ifrs 9, ias 
39 and ifrs 7 included in iasb’s project ‘interest rate 
benchmark reform’.
the accounting policies are furthermore consistent with 
the accounting policies for the group’s financial state-
ments (note 23 in the consolidated financial statements) 
with the following exceptions:
• shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are 
measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount
• dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies 
are recognised as income at the time of declaration 
unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary
• no segment information is disclosed
• value of granted share options, restricted shares and 
performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is 
expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. at the 
time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount 
with a.p. møller - mærsk a/s and the counter posting is 
made in equity. at the time of exercising, the proceeds 
are included in the company’s equity.
new financial reporting requirements
the company has not yet adopted the following 
accounting standards/requirements:
ifrs 17 – insurance contracts
ifrs 17: an analysis of the impact is being assessed  
and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead 
of the implementation date.
other changes to ifrs are not expected to have any 
significant impact on recognition and measurement.
note 19 significant accounting policies
when preparing the financial statements of the company, 
management undertakes a number of accounting esti-
mates and judgements to recognise, measure and classify 
the company’s assets and liabilities. 
estimates that are material to the company’s financial re-
porting are made on the basis of, inter alia, determination 
of impairment of financial non-current assets including 
subsidiaries and associated companies (including assets 
held for sale) and recognition and measurements of pro-
visions. reference is made to notes 4, 6 and 11.
management assesses impairment indicators for invest-
ments in subsidiaries and associated companies and 
determines recoverable amount generally consistent 
with the assumptions described in notes 6, 7 and 24 of 
the consolidated financial statements.
the accounting estimates and judgements are described 
in further detail in note 24 of the consolidated financial 
statements.

ments and the parent company financial statements

and fair view of the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and 
of the results of the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s operations and cash flows for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and further requirements in 
the danish financial statements act. 
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-
form report to the audit committee and the 
board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and 
parent company financial statements of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s for the financial year 
1 january to 31 december 2020 comprise income 
statement and statement of comprehensive 
income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, state-
ment of changes in equity and notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies for the 
group as well as for the parent company. collec-
tively referred to as the ‘financial statements’.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with inter-
national standards on auditing (isas) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. 
our responsibilities under those standards and 
requirements are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial state-
ments section of our report
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the international ethics standards board 
for accountants’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. we have 
also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited 
non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of 
regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided.
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s on 12 april 2012 for the 
financial year 2012. we have been reappointed 
annually by shareholder resolution for a total 
period of uninterrupted engagement of nine 
years including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most signifi-
cance in our audit of the financial statements for 
2020. these matters were addressed in the con-
text of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.

revenue recognition
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
recognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the 
variety of different revenue streams within the segments. 
we focused on this area due to the significance of amounts involved and because 
recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, and judgements 
made by management originating from different customer behavior, market con-
ditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments. further, the volume 
of transactions and extent of different revenue streams require various it setups 
to ensure correct revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inher-
ent risk to the revenue recognition process. 
reference is made to notes 1 and 23 in the consolidated financial statements.
our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue rec-
ognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting 
standards. 
we tested the it setups supporting the revenue recognition as well as relevant inter-
nal controls and management’s monitoring of internal controls. 
we used data analytics on selected revenue streams and performed substantive pro-
cedures over invoicing and relevant contracts in order to assess the accounting treat-
ment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue. further, we tested 
timing to ensure that the revenue is recognised in the correct financial year.
recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
the most significant risks in relation to management’s assessment of the recov-
erability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment relate to the 
definition of cash-generating units (cgus), identification of cgus with indicators 
of impairment and, where relevant, the estimate of the fair values less costs to 
sell and the values in use, including determination of key assumptions. 
bearing in mind the generally long-lived nature of the assets, the most critical 
assumptions in estimating the future cash flows are management’s long-term 
outlook for freight and terminal rates, volume growth, bunker price and capital 
expenditures as well as determining the discount rates. 
we focused on this area, as the carrying amounts are significant and because 
management is required to exercise considerable judgement because of the 
inherent complexity in estimating the fair values less costs to sell or the values 
in use. 
reference is made to notes 7 and 23, 24 in the consolidated financial statements.
in addressing the risks, we considered the appropriateness of the defined cgus within 
the businesses. we examined the methodology used by management to assess the car-
rying amount of property, plant and equipment assigned to cgus, and the process for 
identifying cgus that required impairment testing to determine compliance with ifrs 
as adopted by the eu.
we performed detailed testing for the assets where indicators of impairment were 
identified. for those assets, we reviewed management’s testing of the fair values less 
costs to sell or the values in use, including analysed the reasonableness of key assump-
tions in relation to the ongoing operation of the assets. 
we corroborated management’s estimates of future cash flows and challenged whether 
these are appropriate in respect of key assumptions, such as freight and terminal rates, 
volume growth, bunker price and capital expenditures. 
we used our internal valuation specialists to independently challenge the discount 
rates. in calculating the discount rates, the key inputs used were independently sourced 
from market data, and we assessed the methodology applied. 
further, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant fair value less cost to sell 
and value in use models prepared by management.
statement on directors’ report
management is responsible for directors’ report 
(pages 3-62, 142-143 and 149, respectively). 
our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover directors’ report, and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read directors’ 
report and, in doing so, consider whether directors’ 
report is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether directors’ report 
includes the disclosures required by the danish 
financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, in our view, 
directors’ report is in accordance with the consol-
idated financial statements and the parent com-
pany financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in directors’ report.
management’s responsibilities for  
the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
138
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s annual report 2020
independent auditor’s report
financials
in preparing the financial statements, manage-
ment is responsible for assessing the group’s 
and the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, mat-
ters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the group or the par-
ent company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
the additional requirements applicable in denmark 
will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements. 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain pro-
fessional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
• identify and assess the risks of material mis-
statement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropri-
ate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s 
and the parent company’s internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of account-
ing policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of man-
agement’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s and the par-
ent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. if we conclude that a material uncer-
tainty exists, we are required to draw atten-
tion in our auditor’s report to the related dis-
closures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opin-
ion. our conclusions are based on the audit evi-
dence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. however, future events or conditions 
may cause the group or the parent company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, struc-
ture and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the underly-
ing transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the enti-
ties or business activities within the group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated finan-
cial statements. we are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with govern-
ance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance 
with a statement that we have complied with rele-
vant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applica-
ble, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
we describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclo-
sure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reason-
ably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial statements we 
performed procedures to express an opinion on 
whether the annual report of a.p. møller - mærsk a/s  
for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 
2020 with the filename apmm-2020-12-31.zip is 
prepared, in all material respects, in compliance 
with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic for-
mat (esef regulation) which includes require-
ments related to the preparation of the annual 
report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an annual 
report that complies with the esef regulation. 
this responsibility includes:
• the preparing of the annual report in xhtml 
format;
• the selection and application of appropriate 
ixbrl tags, including extensions to the esef 
taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to ele-
ments in the taxonomy, for all financial infor-
mation required to be tagged using judgement 
where necessary;
• ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged 
data and the consolidated financial statements 
presented in human-readable format; and
• for such internal control as management 
determines necessary to enable the preparation 
of an annual report that is compliant with the 
esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assur-
ance on whether the annual report is prepared, 
in all material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation based on the evidence we have 
obtained, and to issue a report that includes our 
opinion. the nature, timing and extent of proce-
dures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
departures from the requirements set out in the 
esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error. 
the procedures include:
• testing whether the annual report is prepared  
in xhtml format;
• obtaining an understanding of the company’s 
ixbrl tagging process and of internal control 
over the tagging process; 
• evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tag-
ging of the consolidated financial statements;
• evaluating the appropriateness of the com-
pany’s use of ixbrl elements selected from 
the esef taxonomy and the creation of exten-
sion elements where no suitable element in 
the esef taxonomy has been identified;
• evaluating the use of anchoring of extension 
elements to elements in the esef taxonomy; 
and
• reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the 
audited consolidated financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of 
a.p. møller - mærsk a/s for the financial year 
1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file 
name apmm-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in 
all material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation.
