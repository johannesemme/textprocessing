deliver on our promise to consumers  
and shareholders.

niels frederiksen
president and ceo
this growth sustained for the rest of the year and we 
were able to present strong results during 2020 with 
organic growth in net sales of 6.6%, an organic ebitda 
growth	of	14%	and	strong	free	cash	flow	before	acqui-
sitions of dkk 1,394 million. 
the	continued	strong	cash	flow	is	testament	to	the	
strength of our business which allows us to propose 
an ordinary dividend payment of dkk 6.50 per share 
to our shareholders and launch a share buy-back 
programme with a value of up to dkk 600 million. the 
programme	follows	the	completion	of	the	first	share	
buy-back programme ever in scandinavian tobacco 
group with a total value of dkk 300 million which was 
completed in february 2021. on the back of the 2020 
results, we will distribute above dkk 930 million in to-
tal to shareholders. we continue to regularly evaluate 
our total cash distribution to ensure alignment with 
our	financial	performance	and	the	investment	needs	
of the business.
rolling towards 2025
in the course of 2020, we completed the transfor-
mational programme fuelling the growth which 
since its launch in late 2018 has professionalised and 
modernised our group and increased overall cost 
efficiency	and	operational	performance.	we	managed	
to complete the programme and reach the dkk 250 
million run rate savings target one year ahead of time.  
in addition, the integration of agio cigars, which is 
the largest acquisition in the history of the group, is 
on	track	to	deliver	the	expected	synergies	and	firmly	
establish scandinavian tobacco group as a leading 
company in our industry. 
another key milestone in 2020 was the internal 
presentation and launch of our updated strategy – 
rolling towards 2025. the strategy renews and revises 
the vision and sets a clear strategic direction for the 
group	for	the	next	five	years	with	five	focused	must-
win	battles	and	a	set	of	defined	new	values	to	support	
us in being our very best.
rolling towards 2025 is the natural next step in the 
development and professionalisation of scandinavian 
tobacco group. it cements our focus on cigars and 
will ultimately enable us to become a larger company, 
to grow ebitda and to create outstanding cash gen-
eration to support our continued growth and for our 
shareholders. 
optimistic about the future
looking forward to 2021, we remain optimistic about 
the opportunities for scandinavian tobacco group 
in the future despite challenging market conditions. 
our new strategy unites our employees behind a new 
purpose and sets a clear direction for how to achieve 
our vision of becoming the undisputed, global leader 
in cigars. based on the strong business performance 
in 2020 and the passion and perseverance of our  
employees, we have the prerequisites to create  
further value for our shareholders.
we	would	like	to	offer	a	sincere	thank	you	to	every	
employee in scandinavian tobacco group for their 
dedication and hard work in steering the organisation 
through a turbulent and dramatic year and to our 
shareholders and customers for their continued trust 
in our company.
letter from chairman and ceo
020 was marked by covid-19,  
and the societal and economic  
disruption brought on by the  
global pandemic left no one or no 
business untouched. for scandinavian 
tobacco group, it presented signifi-
cant challenges to most aspects of the 
group’s operations but none more  
important than keeping our 11,000  
employees safe. 
overall, scandinavian tobacco group responded 
effectively	to	covid-19	and	swiftly	put	measures	in	
place to keep our people safe, to serve our consumers 
and to maintain business operations. the strength 
and resilience of our business, in combination with 
the dedication of our employees who worked  
tirelessly and took responsibility to navigate the 
company through the crisis, enabled us to weather 
the storm so far and emerge stronger. 
strong performance 
as authorities across the world implemented measures 
to	contain	and	fight	the	spread	of	the	corona	virus	 
early	in	the	year,	we	suspended	our	financial	guidance	
due to lack of transparency on consumer behaviour 
and consumption. however, tobacco consumption 
proved resilient and later in the year, we reintroduced 
and raised our guidance as a consequence of strong 
growth in the consumption of handmade cigars in the 
us and online sales that were higher than expected.

extraordinary growth
overall tobacco consumption proved resil-
ient against the covid-19 pandemic and 
changes in consumer behaviour resulted in 
extraordinary growth in the consumption 
of handmade cigars in the us. on the back 
of this, the group’s 2020 results yielded ex-
traordinarily strong organic ebitda growth 
and	free	cash	flow	before	acquisitions.
fuelling the growth 
in 2020, the transformational programme 
fuelling the growth was completed and 
the dkk 250 million run rate savings target 
was reached one year ahead of time. since 
2018, the programme has contributed to 
the professionalisation and modernisation 
of  the group and has increased overall 
cost	efficiency	and	operational	perfor-
mance. 
optimising production 
footprint
in april, the group announced a restruc-
turing of its operational footprint and the 
intended closure of production facilities 
in eersel and duizel, the netherlands and 
moca, the dominican republic. in addition 
the closure of the facility in tucker, georgia 
was completed in november.
integration of agio cigars
since completing the largest acquisition in 
the history of the group in january, work 
has progressed as planned on integrating 
agio cigars into the group. the com-
mercial integration is complete and the 
remaining integration is expected to be 
completed by the end of 2022.
stable market share
the integration of agio cigars has 
supported the group’s market share 
in core european machine-rolled cigar 
markets. the combined market share of 
the largest european markets has stayed 
stable at 33.1% since the acquisition.

fuelling the growth
aunched in 2018, fuelling the 
growth was a group-wide trans-
formational programme aiming to 
increase commercial competitiveness, 
gross margins and operational cost effi-
ciency and savings. 
the implementation of fuelling the growth was com-
pleted faster than anticipated in 2020. this resulted 
in improved operational performance, increased cost 
efficiency	and	faster	than	expected	net	savings.	by	the	
end of 2020, the programme's overall run rate savings 
target was met.
focusing on commercial initiatives, cost reduction and 
cash	flow	improvement,	fuelling	the	growth	has	been	
important to all aspects of the business. with a new 
organisation and operating model improving compet-
itiveness	and	with	a	persistent	focus	on	efficiency	and	
costs, the programme has been a key component in 
l
the execution of the strategy. further,  it will facili-
tate	efficiency	progress	going	forward	and	support	
execution on the new strategy rolling towards 2025. 
the intention of fuelling the growth to support the 
financial	ambition	of	a	3-5%	annual	average	organic	
ebitda growth has been more than achieved. 
financial impact 
implementation of fuelling the growth will incur 
costs (special items) up to a level of dkk 250 million. 
in 2020, special items were dkk 5 million and in 2018-
2020 they were dkk 219 million.
fuelling the growth was expected to deliver net 
savings of approximately dkk 250 million with a 
full-year	run	rate	effect	by	the	end	of	2021.	almost	the	
full programme target was reached by the end of 2020 
and approximately 20% of the net savings will impact 
the 2021 results.

weather the storm 
ew anticipated the speed and  
severity with which covid-19 
would change lives fundamentally 
and create unprecedented challenges  
for businesses during 2020. 
as the pandemic spread across the world and forced 
the lockdown of countries and closure of borders, 
stores	and	offices	and	restricted	manufacturing,	
distribution and travel, scandinavian tobacco group 
dedicated	all	efforts	to	navigate	and	mitigate	these	
extraordinary challenges. and thanks to the dedica-
tion, skills and hard work of employees around the 
world we can look back on one of the most chal-
lenging years in the history of scandinavian tobacco 
group and proudly say that we kept our employees 
safe, while continuing to serve our customers and 
maintaining	effective	business	operations.	
ingenuity, discipline and dedication
through ingenuity, discipline and dedication disrup-
tions to the global production network were kept to 
a minimum despite lockdowns, curfews and travel 
restrictions. across all sites increased health and 
safety	precautions	were	swiftly	implemented	and	
with our industry leading precautions our facility in 
honduras	was	the	very	first	to	receive	approval	to	
reopen following the month long national quarantine 
in march 2020. and despite these challenges, output 
of handmade cigars improved by up to 80% across the 
production network. 
covid-19 induced changes to consumer behaviour 
were most pre dominant in north america, where 
employees on the road, in warehouses and call 
centres changed gears to handle the very strong surge 
in demand for handmade cigars. on top, the team 
built three cigars international super stores in texas 
and florida and held the largest cigar industry and 
consumer appreciation event in the world online as 
we	conducted	virtual	cigarfest	2020	with	cigar	aficio-
nados from across the us calling in. 
 
in europe, the integration of agio cigars - the largest 
acquisition in the history of the group - has been 
largely	unaffected	by	the	pandemic	and	is	progress-
ing as planned resulting in growth in market share 
in key markets. also, the national, regional and local 
lockdowns across markets in europe, have encouraged 
the emergence of new digital solutions to connect with 
customers and consumers that the group’s sales force 
will be exploring and leveraging in years to come. 
resilient business and employees 
the	covid-19	pandemic	left	no	individual	or	business	
untouched in 2020 – and will continue to cause 
significant	challenges	to	many	aspects	of	the	group’s	
operations, including the supply chain and route to 
market in 2021. however, based on the demonstrat-
ed resilience of the business and employees in the 
past year and the group’s continued diligent and 
successful	mitigation	efforts,	we	are	confident	that	we	
will be able to move our business forward and deliver 
on our promise to our consumers and customers in a 
covid-19 impacted 2021.

the group’s us retail expansion 
reached	a	significant	milestone	
with the opening of three cigars 
international super stores in texas and 
florida. scandinavian tobacco group

refuelling the online busi-
ness 
the ongoing modernisation of the us 
online platforms continued and 
contributed to growth in the online 
channel. the transformation is expected 
to be completed by the end of 2021 and 
will provide a better shopping experience 
for the growing number of active 
customers. 
increased cigar production 
the covid-19 pandemic increased 
demand for handmade cigars in the us. 
in response, the group expanded its 
handmade cigar production facilities 
and was able to increase the number of 
handmade cigars by up to 80%.
record shipping
the us online business has seen 
extraordinary growth due to the 
covid-19 pandemic. a new monthly 
record was set in june as almost 
420,000 orders were shipped out of the 
warehouse in bethlehem, pennsylvania.

rolling towards 2025
in the course of 2020, we conducted a review of scandinavian  
tobacco group’s corporate strategy. the result was a new  
updated strategy – rolling towards 2025 -  which was presented to 
the group’s 11,000 employees at the end of the year.
 
rolling towards 2025 is the natural next step in the develop-
ment and professionalisation of scandinavian tobacco group.
the strategy renews and revises the group’s ambition and vision 
-	and	sets	a	clear	direction	for	the	next	five	years	with	five	 
focused	must-win	battles	and	a	set	of	defined	values	to	support	
us in being our very best.
rolling towards 2025 cements our focus on cigars and will 
ultimately enable us to become a larger company, to grow  
ebitda and create outstanding cash generation for ourselves 
and our shareholders.

crafters of rituals
our strategy
rganised around a vision of being 
the undisputed, global leader in 
cigars, rolling towards 2025 will 
allow scandinavian tobacco group to 
become a stronger, more simplified and 
more attractive company to work for 
and do business with.
sharpened focus 
for over 250 years, scandinavian tobacco group has 
been	maker	of	rituals.	we	have	honed	our	craft	to	
make rituals: premium products and experiences to 
our	consumers	embedded	by	textures,	flavours,	and	
aromas. 
past achievements have brought the group to where 
it is today and will serve as a guide forward. however, 
in order to grow and outperform competitors in an 
industry with declining volumes, we continually 
need to sharpen our strategic focus on the products, 
processes and consumer experiences that really make 
a	difference.	
our new strategy rolling towards 2025 will do 
exactly that.

m&a agenda
n january 2020, scandinavian  
tobacco group acquired agio 
cigars, a leading european manu-
facturer of machine-rolled cigars. the 
purchase price was dkk 1,559 million 
and the acquisition reinforced the 
group’s strong market positions in key 
machine-rolled markets like france, 
the netherlands, belgium, italy and 
spain. with the acquisition, group net 
sales grew by 15%. 
the acquisition represents an investment in the 
future of the scandinavian tobacco group and is an 
important step in the transformation of the com-
pany	as	it	builds	a	more	competitive	and	profitable	
business with a powerful brand portfolio, strong 
market positions and robust supply chains.
new organisational structure 
as part of the integration and to increase speed to 
market and unlock synergies, the group’s organ-
isational structure was changed in may when the 
number of commercial divisions was reduced from 
four to three. the former smoking tobacco and ac-
cessories division was integrated into two new di-
visions, leaving scandinavian tobacco group with 
three commercial divisions: north america online 
& retail division, north america branded & rest of 
world division and europe branded division.  
furthermore, to improve capacity utilisation and 
reduce production unit costs, two production facilities 
in the netherlands and one facility in the dominican 
republic are planned to close and production to be 
moved to other production facilities. 
financial impact
the combination of scandinavian tobacco group 
and agio cigars is expected to deliver substantial cost 
synergies within sales & marketing, production and 
back	office	functions.	when	full	integration	has	been	
completed by the end of 2022, it is assumed that the 
acquisition will deliver net synergies at the level of 
dkk 225 million with a positive impact in scandina-
vian tobacco groupi´s ebitda margin before special 
items of more than 2 percentage points.  
total special costs until the end of 2022 are expected 
to be at the level of dkk 555 million including dkk 105 
million in non-cash impairments.
i
founded in 1904 the company was based  
in the netherlands with approximately 3,200 
full-time employees and annual net sales  of 
approximately dkk 1 billion. the company 
had a strong cigar portfolio including key 
brands such as mehari´s, panter and balmoral 
– and strong market positions in  
the netherlands, belgium, france,  
italy and spain.

oneprocess
new erp system
s part of the ongoing moderni-
sation and professionalisation 
of the company, scandinavian 
tobacco group will in the coming years 
invest significantly in updating the 
group’s enterprise resource planning 
(erp) system. 
the project is called oneprocess and our current 
12	different	erp	legacy	systems	will	be	replaced	by	
one new global erp system. sap proved to be the 
optimal platform in regards to functionality, solu-
tion footprint and best practice and has therefore 
been chosen as scandinavian tobacco group’s 
future erp system.
the implementation of oneprocess will commence 
at	the	end	of	2021.	until	then	a	clarification	phase	
will ensure the scope, prepare the organisation for 
the project and create the foundation to ensure 
the success of the oneprocess transformation. the 
final	implementation	road	map	will	be	prepared	
during 2021 while full erp implementation is 
expected in 2024.
opportunities and risks 
oneprocess	represents	a	significant	business	
transformation - and a new global erp system will 
be a key enabler for strategy execution and will 
strengthen	our	ability	to	deliver	growth	and	profit-
ability in a declining market. it will harmonise and 
simplify core business processes, improve quality 
of global master data and create a robust compliance 
and control environment in an industry with ever 
expanding regulations. furthermore, a higher degree 
of	digitalisation,	process	simplification	and	automa-
tion will provide the group with an improved basis for 
entering into further market consolidations.
there are inherent risks in erp system implementa-
tion.	disruptions,	delays	or	deficiencies	in	the	transi-
tion, design and implementation of the new system 
can	have	adverse	effect	on	the	group’s	business.	how-
ever, risk mitigation will be a priority throughout the 
project and several actions are taken to ensure risk 
mitigation. the choice of an experienced implemen-
tation partner with a proven track record and change 
management focus (deloitte), a project governance 
with strong commitment from senior management 
and	a	thorough	clarification	phase	will	all	contribute	
to reduce the risk of the project and create optimal 
conditions for a successful implementation. 
financial impact
the investment in the new erp system represents the 
largest it investment in the history of scandinavian 
tobacco group and is expected to be in the range of 
dkk 280-340 million from 2021-2024. the majority of 
investments are to be incurred in 2022 and 2023. 
once fully implemented, a new erp system will 
significantly	improve	it	infrastructure	compliance,	
enhance the group’s ability to faster integrate acquisi-
tions and yield annual savings. 
erp applications are the key enabler - the it backbone - in supporting an 
organisation’s processes. it is used to manage and integrate business critical 
processes and data within all aspects of an organisation, including commer-
cial,	production,	supply	chain	and	finance.	any	change	to	such	applications	
has	significant	impact	across	the	organisation.

n 2020 north america online & 
retail accounted for 33% of group 
net sales and 28% of ebitda before 
special items. the product category 
handmade cigars accounted for 81% of 
divisional net sales.
volume development for handmade cigars in the 
division is driven by direct to consumer sales which in 
return is driven by the total handmade cigar market 
development and our market share performance. the 
total market for handmade cigars is estimated long-
term to be declining by 1% per year, but on the back of 
the covid-19 pandemic consumption increased in 2020. 
the expansion of cigars international’s super store 
network progressed as planned with the opening of 
the	second	texas	store	in	fort	worth	in	july,	the	first	
florida store in lutz in september and the second 
florida store in tampa in october. with the three 
new	openings	the	first	phase	of	the	retail	expansion	
has	been	finalised.	a	further	expansion	of	the	retail	
network is being evaluated based on the experienc-
es from the existing stores. overall, the retail super 
stores lounges were negatively impacted by the 
covid-19 restrictions across the us in 2020. 
divisional net sales increased by 16.2% to dkk 2,662 
million during the year composed by a 18.9% positive 
organic net sales growth and a negative exchange rate 
effect	of	2.7%.	the	organic	development	was	driven	
by	a	significant	positive	contribution	in	the	online	
channel from all product categories, but in particular 
handmade cigars. 
ebitda before special items increased by 46.3% to 
dkk 517 million with an ebitda margin before special 
items of 19.4% (15.4%). the margin improvement 
is	driven	by	scale	benefits,	lower	promotional	and	
marketing expenses with the competitive pressure 
remaining	low	as	well	as	continued	benefits	from	cost	
efficiencies	and	optimisations.

gars accounted for 28% of divisional net 
sales, handmade cigars for 26%, smok-
ing tobacco for 23% and accessories & 
cma (contract manufacturing) for 23%.
organic net sales growth in the year was driven by a 
strong development in handmade cigars and smoking 
tobacco. as many consumers around the world were 
working from home and thereby having more 
smoking opportunities, the total consumption of 
several product categories increased. 
while demand for handmade cigars from the online 
channel continues to be strong, the reopening of the 
brick and mortar retail channel in the us impacted 
total sales volumes positively during the second half 
of	the	year	following	a	significant	negative	impact	in	
the second quarter when retail stores closed across 
the country. 
 
in smoking tobacco, the structural declining market 
trend	has	been	offset	by	consumers	having	more	
smoking	occasions.	in	particular,	fine-cut	tobacco	
realised strong volume growth.
 
net sales increased by 3.8% to dkk 2,527 million 
during the year composed by a 0.4% positive organic 
net sales growth, a 6.2% impact from acquisitions and 
a	negative	exchange	rate	effect	of	2.8%.	the	organic	
development	was	driven	by	a	significant	increase	in	
volumes of handmade cigars and a positive growth in 
smoking tobacco driven by the us and norway, which 
in	return	was	offset	against	a	significant	negative	
contribution from global travel retail. 
ebitda before special items increased by 6.4% to 
dkk 813 million with an ebitda margin before special 
items of 32.2% (31.4%). the margin improvement 
was realised with an unchanged gross margin and an 
improved opex ratio which decreased due to lower 
sales	and	marketing	spending	and	general	efficiency	
improvements.

continued	its	structural	decline	after	a	weaker	trend	
during	the	first	half	of	the	year	following	the	early	
phases of the covid-19 pandemic. however, the im-
pact in segments like border trading and tourist areas 
continues to be profound. preparations are underway 
for further lockdowns and restrictions during 2021. 
for the division, the organic growth in net sales was 
supported by market share performance and pricing 
in machine-rolled cigars and positive developments in 
smoking tobacco in germany and denmark.
the integration of agio cigars progresses according to 
plan	with	the	commercial	integration	being	finalised	
and total savings of approximately dkk 80 million 
being realised during the year. the combined market 
share of machine-rolled cigars in the largest european 
markets (france, belgium, the netherlands, the uk, 
germany, spain and italy) has stayed stable at 33.1% 
since the acquisition. france delivered good progress 
just as market shares improved in belgium, the neth-
erlands and spain.  
net sales increased by 41.4% to dkk 2,817 million 
during the year composed by a 2.3% organic net sales 
growth and a 38.6% positive impact from the acqui-
sition of agio cigars. the organic development was 
driven by a stable contribution from machine-rolled 
cigars and by positive growth in primarily smoking 
tobacco.
ebitda before special items increased by 22.5% 
to dkk 581 million with an ebitda margin before 
special items of 20.6% (23.8%). excluding a fair value 
adjustment of inventories related to the acquisition of 
agio cigars of dkk 62 million, the margin was 22.8% 
with the decline being a result of the consolidation of 
agio cigars.

dkk 2,572 million (dkk 2,640 million) as a higher level

increase in inventories was a combination of the agio

inventories.
cash flow 
cash	flow	from	operating	activities	increased	to	
dkk 1,585 million (dkk 1,300 million) driven by the

working capital of dkk 294 million in 2020 compared 
to a positive change in 2019 of dkk 101 million. the 
development	is	primarily	driven	by	a	positive	effect

dividend
for	the	financial	year	2020,	the	board	of	directors	pro-
poses a dividend of dkk 6.50 per share corresponding 
to a pay-out ratio of 95.9% (81.6%). 
fuelling the growth 
the programme launched in 2018 was aimed to deliver 
operational improvements with expected full-year run 
rate net savings of approximately dkk 250 million by 
the end of 2021. net savings have been realised faster 
than originally expected as more than 80% of total 
net savings have been realised in the 2020 results. the 
programme is still expected to incur total costs (special 
items) of up to a level of dkk 250 million. dkk 5 million 
have been expensed in 2020 totalling dkk 219 million 
in the period 2018-2020 and the remaining amount of 
up to around dkk 31 million is expected to be expensed 
in 2021. 
as of the end of 2020 we will no longer make quarterly

shareholder return policy
the board of directors continuously evaluates the 
distribution of excess capital to shareholders
based on a comparison of the projected leverage 
ratio against a target of 2.5x with the leverage ratio 
calculated as net interest bearing debt (nibd)/ebit-
da before special items.
the board of directors’ objective is to distribute 
excess capital by way of dividends and/or share
buy-backs with an ambition of annual growth in 
ordinary	dividend	payments.	this	ambition	reflects
our	financial	targets	of	annual	organic	ebitda	
growth	and	free	cash	flow	improvements.
the	group	maintains	the	flexibility	to	temporarily	
exceed the target leverage ratio in connection with
dividend distribution, acquisitions or investments. 
our capital distributions will always take into 
account potential acquisitions and other liquidity 
needs.

developments and the ambitions are supplemented 
by a detailed annual guidance.
earnings
we aim to continuously deliver average annual

2021 guidance
financial ambitions and 2021 guidance
he uncertainty related to the  
severity and length of the covid-19 
pandemic, the possibility of further 
government restrictions and overall  
impact on consumer behaviour continues 
to decrease visibility into business  
performance in 2021.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact business 
performance in most of our markets and may have 
significant	implications	for	consumer	behaviour	and	
overall tobacco consumption. given this outlook, our 
guidance for 2021 is:
earnings
we expect to generate organic ebitda growth of more 
than 7% for the full year 2021. organic growth in net 
sales is expected to increase in 2021 with consump-
tion of handmade cigars in the us expected to remain 
strong with positive growth continuing, especially in 
the	first	half	of	the	year.	for	the	group,	organic	ebit-
da growth is also expected to be driven by additional 
savings from the integration of agio cigars of about 
dkk	70-80	million	and	full	year	effect	of	fuelling	the	
growth. 
organic ebitda growth is expected to be strongest in 
the	first	and	second	quarter	of	the	year,	while	nega-
tive in the third quarter based on a very strong third 
quarter in 2020 and then return to positive growth in 
the fourth quarter.
free cash flow
based on the projected earnings growth, we expect 
the	group´s	free	cash	flow	before	acquisitions	to	
exceed	dkk	1,000	million.	the	free	cash	flow	before	
acquisitions is expected to be impacted by relatively 
high investments in operational footprint and digita-
lization initiatives as well as a negative impact from 
payables in the level of dkk 150 million.
adjusted earnings per share
the adjusted eps is expected to increase more than 
10% (from dkk 9.78 in 2020) including a positive 
impact from the share repurchases of about dkk 
0.4 per share and a negative impact from currency 
developments.
assumptions
financial performance for scandinavian tobacco 
group for the full year 2021 rests on several assump-
tions and is subject to uncertainties related to the 
covid-19 pandemic. the key assumptions related to 
the covid-19 pandemic are:
•   the positive impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 
demand for handmade cigars in north america is 
expected to continue into q1 and q2 and normalize 
thereafter	on	a	level	higher	than	pre-pandemic	levels
•   the convergence to the online channel in the us is 
sustainable through-out 2021
•   in europe, we are assuming that most restrictions 
will	be	lifted	before	the	summer	season	and	the	
categories to return to their long-term structural 
development

key	financial	assumptions	are:
•   organic growth in net sales are expected to increase 
with positive organic growth in north america 
online & retail and in north america branded & rest 
of world, whereas europe branded is expected to 
deliver slightly negative organic net sales growth 
due to loss of a distribution contract
•   special items are expected to be approximately dkk 
90 million related to the integration of agio cigars
•			financial	expenses,	excluding	currency	effects,	are	
expected at dkk 105-115 million
•			the	effective	tax	rate	is	expected	to	be	in	the	range	
of 21-22%
•   working capital is expected to deliver a slight posi-
tive net contribution
•   capital expenditure is expected at dkk 410 million 
including dkk 35 million relating to erp project 
(oneprocess) and dkk 90 million in relating to 
changes in the production footprint
•   guidance and assumptions are based on current ex-
change rates. a 5% change in the usd/dkk exchange 
rate would impact net sales by approximately 2.5 
percentage points and ebitda by approximately 2.0 
percentage points
•  no contribution or expenses related to potential 
acquisitions are included
2020 realised
the organic ebitda growth was 14% as a conse-
quence of strong growth in the consumption of hand-
made cigars in the us and higher online sales. this is 
in line with the guidance provided in december 2020. 
free	cash	flow	before	acquisitions	was	somewhat	
higher due to timing of payables.

regulation
obacco products are subject to 
extensive regulation. the tobacco 
products themselves, as well as the 
labelling, packaging, marketing,  
display, sale and consumption of tobacco 
products are generally regulated, and in 
many markets operators in the manufac-
turing and sale of tobacco products have 
an obligation to file with the authorities 
information on their products and ingre-
dients and available research related to 
the health aspects of these. 
standardised consumer packaging and prohibitions on 
the display of tobacco products at the points of sale are 
examples of regulation introduced by some countries 
in recent years. scandinavian tobacco group expects 
the development with increasing regulation to con-
tinue. we monitor the regulatory developments, and 
via national and international trade associations we 
engage with stakeholders to support evidence-based 
and reasonable regulation that takes into account the 
different	characteristics	of	the	various	tobacco	product	
categories;	it	is	not	always	a	“one	size	fits	all”	approach	
that	leads	to	the	best	regulation.	regulation	offers	risks	
for our industry, as it adds complexity and costs, but 
it	also	offers	opportunities	for	scandinavian	tobacco	
group,	because	often	scale	and	agility	are	important.	
we believe, we have both.
online sales of tobacco products are subject to a 
requirement by the individual states that the seller 
collects the sales tax applicable in the state where 
the customer is residing. two states have enacted 
regulation to have out-of-state retailers also collect and 
remit state excise tax on tobacco products, and more 
states are expected to implement similar regulation 
over time.
regulatory developments in europe
in the european union, the so-called tobacco products 
directive sets the framework for most regulation of 
tobacco products. one element is the so-called “track-
and-trace”	regime	that	took	effect	in	may	2019	for	cig-
arettes	and	fine-cut	tobacco	and	is	scheduled	to	take	
effect	for	cigars	and	pipe	tobacco	in	may	2024.	each	
individual consumer package must be traceable from 
the manufacturer/importer to the last stop before the 
retailer. in the preparations for may 2024 scandinavian 
tobacco group expects to leverage the extensive expe-
rience gathered in connection with the implementation 
of	“track-and-trace”	in	our	fine-cut	tobacco	business.
the eu tobacco products directive will in the next few 
years undergo a statutory review. in the second half of 
2021, the european commission is expected to present 
a propos-
al for an 
updated 
version 
of the eu’s 
tobacco excise 
directive, which 
contains	definitions	of	
the various tobacco product 
categories for excise purposes and determines the 
structure and minimum levels of tobacco excise tax in 
the eu. another review scheduled for the second half 
of	2021	deals	with	a	specific	provision	in	a	directive	on	
cross-border acquisitions of excise goods by private 
individuals (“border trade”). the provision under re-
view contains the minimum guide levels that national 
authorities can set as a reference when determining if 
excise goods transported by a private individual from 
one member state to another should be considered 
as intended for the individual’s own use and thus not 
liable to excise duty in the member state where the 
goods are consumed.
the exact timing for completion of the above reviews 
and	the	effective	dates	for	the	potential	changes	are	
uncertain. 
with due consideration of the minimum excise levels 
and	definitions	of	the	eu	tobacco	excise	directive,	
each  member state sets its own tobacco excise rates. 
increases in excise rates are common and happened 
also in 2020. occasionally, the changes impact con-
sumer behaviour in the shorter or longer term. 
t
regulatory developments in the us
in the us, the fda has the regulatory responsibility for 
tobacco products, including cigars and pipe tobacco. 
the regulation of cigars and pipe tobacco, which was 
first	introduced	in	2016,	is	complex,	it	often	requires	
essential additional fda guidance and it involves great 
uncertainty	in	terms	of	the	specific	requirements	as	
well as timing. 
the	fda	has	in	recent	years	issued	draft	rules	and	
guidance documents covering several topics and asked 
for	comments	on	these,	including	flavoured	tobacco	
products and reduction of nicotine in tobacco products 
to	minimal/non-addictive	levels.	a	final	guidance	
issued	early	2020	removed	all	flavoured	e-cigarettes	
other	than	tobacco-	and	menthol	flavoured	e-ciga-
rettes	from	the	us	market,	while	flavoured	cigars,	
which were included in the original document, were 
not	affected.	however,	as	per	end	of	2020	two	us	states	
as well as several counties and cities have banned 
flavoured	tobacco	products,	including	cigars,	and	
flavoured	cigars	could	still	be	regulated	at	federal	level.	
however,	flavoured	cigars	sold	in	the	us	only	make	up	
a low single-digit percentage of scandinavian tobacco 
group’s	net	sales	and	profit.

implementation of erp system 
a project that aims to harmonise group processes and 
update the erp platform.
risk management
corporate matters
ur enterprise risk management is 
designed to identify and manage 
uncertainties and risks affecting 
the group in the global market place.  
we seek to identify, prioritise and  
manage key risks at all levels of the 
business to support the group in better 
decision making, proper allocation of  
resources and better and faster  
utilisation of opportunities that arise.
governance
the responsibility for the governance of risks lies 
with our board of directors. on behalf of the board of 
directors,	the	audit	committee	monitors	the	effective-
ness of our group's risk management and evaluates 
the design annually. the executive board manages 
the operational part of our risk management and our 
executive management ensures proper and complete 
reporting to the audit committee.
risk assessment process
scandinavian tobacco group operates with a 
framework including various principles that secure 
a structured and cross-functional approach to risk 
management. 
o
cyber risk  
cyber security threats are growing in number 
and sophistication.
regulation 
there is a strong regulatory focus on the tobacco 
industry - a trend that is expected to continue. 
total market development 
the total market for tobacco products is declining. although cigar vol-
umes have shown higher resilience than cigarettes in some of our markets. 
the markets for machine-rolled cigars and pipe tobacco are declining.
excise taxes 
excise tax rates are a major component of the 
retail price of tobacco products. 
the approach is a top-down facilitated process with 
the intent to identify risks and support risk man-
agement throughout the organisation, and ensure 
consistent follow-up and reporting on risks to the 
executive board during the year. to receive input from 
the organisation, a risk team works with key stake-
holders	across	the	business	to	ensure	an	effective	
assessment before presenting recommendations to 
the executive board. the executive board performs 
an annual risk assessment based on the impact and 
likelihood of a risk materialising. the process ensures 
that appropriate actions are taken to reduce, prevent 
or mitigate risks and to ensure that the group is trans-
parent and compliant in its external communication 
on these risks. 
the	main	risk	categories	identified	are	regulation,	
excise taxes, total market development, cyber risk and 
implementation of a new group enterprise resource 
planning	(erp)	system.	the	identified	financial	risks,	
including foreign exchange, interest rate, credit and 
liquidity risks can be found in note 4.2 on pages 82-85.

corporate matters
corporate matters
regulation
there is a strong regulatory focus on the tobacco industry. regulatory 
initiatives	could		affect	consumer	behaviour,	discourage	use	of	tobacco	
products,	control	new	product	development	and	place	significant	burdens	
on	the	tobacco	industry.	regulatory	initiatives	could	include	significant	
reporting obligations, bans on tobacco product displays, labelling require-
ments,	standardised	packaging	and	bans	on	certain	flavourings	as	well	
as restrictions on sale and consumption of tobacco products. regulatory 
changes could lead to increase in costs and increase in operational com-
plexity,	impact	the	ability	to	compete	and	differentiate	products,	erode	
brand values, reduce possibilities to launch new products and loss of sales 
and	profitability.	
mitigating actions
we engage with regulators and stakeholders to ensure proper insights 
and knowledge about our product categories and facilitate reasonable, 
transparent and balanced regulation. we have dedicated resources to 
monitoring	regulatory	initiatives	and	use	significant	resources	preparing	
for and implementing new and updated regulations.
we focus our sales in categories with mainly adult smokers, where the 
regulatory landscape seems more stable than for new tobacco product 
categories. also, we mainly focus on the non-aromatic segment for cigars 
which has been less exposed to regulatory focus than the aromatic 
segment.
mitigating actions
we continuously monitor potential changes to excise taxes for our 
product categories. we adjust prices to the extent possible to pass on the 
effect	of	excise	tax	increases	to	consumers,	if	the	market	conditions	allow.	
we actively participate in relevant industry associations and in collabora-
tion with trade industry partners, we engage in dialogue with regulators 
to limit the risk of market disruption based on excise tax alignment and 
excise tax changes. 
mitigating actions
we continuously monitor the market trends, collect market research data 
and perform forecasts to project market developments and trends. the 
trend analyses help us address adverse market conditions more promptly. 
we have a strong focus on portfolio and pricing strategies. we strive to gain 
market	shares	and	implement	price	increases	to	offset	the	negative	impact	
of declining markets. we aim at being present in all price points to remain 
relevant for the consumers if they change spending patterns. 
excise taxes
excise taxes are a major component of the retail price of tobacco products. 
this component can be changed by national governments and is actively 
used to increase tax revenue and to limit tobacco consumption. an align-
ment of excise tax rates across tobacco product categories could increase 
the excise tax and impact the consumer price of our products and negatively 
impact	our	sales	volumes	and	profitability.	increases	of	excise	taxes	imple-
mented unexpectedly and unusually high excise increases could limit our 
ability to pass on excise increases to consumers through price increases. it 
could	also	provide	us	limited	time	to	adjust	our	production	and	sales	efforts	
which	could	have	an	additional	adverse	effect	on	our	profitability	and	lead	
to lower consumer demand.
in two us states, remote sellers are required to collect excise tax. we expect 
an increase in the number of states requiring remote sellers to collect excise 
tax. this could lead to additional costs and complexity for our operations, 
affect	consumer	behaviour	and	impact	our	sales	volumes	and	profitability.
total market development
the total market for tobacco products is declining. although cigar 
volumes have shown higher resilience than cigarettes in some of our 
markets, the markets for machine-rolled cigars and pipe tobacco are also 
declining. with presence in approximately 100 markets around the world, 
we	have	a	high	degree	of	geographic	diversification.	still,	a	significant	and	
unexpected decrease in demand for tobacco products in one or more of 
our	core	markets	could	negatively	impact	our	net	sales	and	profitability.
for scandinavian tobacco group, the negative consequences of the 
covid-19 pandemic have so far been limited. however, it has resulted 
in decreased visibility on market development and consumer behaviour 
and	especially	the	longer	term	effects	on	consumer	behaviour	remain	
uncertain.

mitigating actions
our focus is on implementation of security policies, business continuity 
management, recovery plans and keeping our defences updated. we 
evaluate, monitor and test our cyber resilience and it enhancements – and 
we educate our employees in cyber security awareness.  
cyber risk
we operate in an environment with cyber security threats that are 
growing in number and sophistication. successful attacks might result 
in business disruption, production stops, loss of image, compromise 
of	customer	information	and	personal	data	and	direct	financial	loss.	
disruptions to our online retail business platforms resulting in these 
becoming unavailable to customers could impact our sales and 
profitability.	further,	if	our	business	platforms	were	unavailable,	it	could	
lead to supply chain and general business disruption and could keep us 
from	fulfilling	our	engagements	and	responsibilities	towards	customers	
and other parties.
implementation of erp system 
scandinavian	tobacco	group	will	in	the	coming	years	invest	significantly	
in	updating	the	group’s	erp	system.	this	represents	a	significant	business	
transformation and will strengthen our ability to deliver growth and 
profitability	in	a	declining	market.	further,	a	higher	degree	of	digitalisation,	
process	simplification	and	automation	will	provide	the	group	with	an	
improved basis for participating in further industry consolidation.
implementation	of	the	new	erp	system	requires	significant	resources	
and	affects	the	group's	whole	supply	chain	and	business	operations.	
disruptions,	delays	or	deficiencies	in	the	transition,	design	and	
implementation	of	the	new	system	could	have	adverse	effect	on	the	
group’s business. 
mitigating actions
senior management is committed to the project’s governance and is 
securing key resources across the organisation. also, the group has a 
structured and systematic approach to monitoring and tracking the 
status of large projects. risk mitigation will be a priority throughout the 
project and the choice of an experienced implementation partner with a 
proven track record and change management focus in combination with a 
thorough	clarification	phase	will	all	contribute	to	risk	mitigation.

corporate governance
corporate matters
candinavian tobacco group a/s is 
incorporated in denmark under 
danish law. since february 2016, 
the company’s shares have been public-
ly listed on nasdaq copenhagen.
the group’s corporate governance is based on the 
danish companies act, the danish financial state-
ments act, the international financial reporting stan-
dards (ifrs), the eu market abuse regulation, nasdaq 
copenhagen a/s’ rulebook for issuers of shares and 
its rules for issuers of bonds as well as the company’s 
articles of association among others. further, the 
danish recommendations on corporate governance 
are taken into account. 
the ultimate authority over the company is held by 
the shareholders who exercise their rights at general 
meetings. the annual report and amendments 
to the articles of association are approved by the 
general meeting which also elects members of the 
board of directors and the independent auditor. the 
general meeting exercises its powers pursuant to the 
provisions of scandinavian tobacco group’s articles 
of association which are available at st-group.com. 
in 2020, the annual general meeting was held on 26 
march. the minutes of the annual general meeting are 
available at investor.st-group.com.
as a publicly listed company, scandinavian tobacco 
group is required by law to report on its compliance 
with the danish recommendations on corporate 
governance, which can be found at corporategover-
nance.dk. reports on corporate governance must be 
presented by companies in accordance to the ‘comply 
or explain approach’, which means that a company 
may	choose	not	to	comply	with	a	specific	recommen-
dation and instead explain why it has chosen not to 
comply with the recommendation, and what it has 
chosen to do instead.
scandinavian tobacco group complies with the 
recommendations on corporate governance. a 
detailed overview can be found in scandinavian 
tobacco group’s 2020 statutory report on corporate 
governance. the report is available at st-group.com/
corporategovernance.pdf.
remuneration 
scandinavian tobacco group’s remuneration policy 
lays down the principles governing the remuneration 
of the board of directors and executive management, 
and it acts as a framework around which their con-
tractual terms and compensation are set, reviewed 
and managed in accordance with the danish compa-
nies act and the corporate governance recommen-
dations.
the overall objective of the remuneration policy is to 
enable the company to attract and retain high calibre, 
experienced	and	qualified	individuals	to	its	board	
of directors and executive management. further, 
the remuneration policy enables the company to 
incentivise the executive management to deliver the 
company’s strategic ambitions in a way which creates 
sustained shareholder value and reward the executive 
management appropriately for achieving core short-
term and long-term business goals while managing 
and growing the company to ensure its continued 
sustainability in a way which aligns with the interests 
of shareholders and stakeholders. the remuneration 
policy was reviewed in 2020 in the light of changes to 
the danish companies act and adopted at the annual 
general meeting on 26 march 2020. the remuneration 
policy can be found at st-group.com.
 
a detailed description of the main elements of the 
remuneration of the board of directors and the exec-
utive management and the remuneration paid in the 
financial	year	2020	is	included	in	the	2020	remunera-
tion report available at st-group.com.  
diversity and inclusion
the board of directors believes that members of the 
board should be elected based on their professional 
experience	and	qualifications,	but	also	that	diversity	im-
proves the quality of discussions and decision-making 
not only in the board of directors but in the group as a 
whole. diversity brings strength to our group. the board 
of directors has adopted the group’s diversity and  
inclusion policy, which is available at st-group.com.
the statutory report and description of the company’s 
activities to ensure relevant diversity at management 
levels, including a discription of the goals and objec-
tives and the progress made in achieving the objectives 
can be found in the company's 2020 csr report, which 
is available at st-group.com/csrreport.pdf.
disclosure regarding change of  
control
scandinavian tobacco group’s loan facilities at 
financial	institutions	and	issued	bonds	as	well	as	the	
investment in an associated company are subject to 
change of control clauses. 
in relation to the executive management, the current 
employment contract with the ceo states that within 
6-12	months	after	a	change	of	the	control,	the	ceo	
may terminate his employment, and he will be entit- 
led to 24 months remuneration and a proportional 
share of his buy-out payment as further described in 
the remuneration report. if the company should wish 
to	terminate	the	cfo	within	18	months	after	a	change	
of the control of the company, the cfo is according to 
her contract entitled to a notice of 24 months. 
scandinavian tobacco group 
complies with the danish 
recommendations on corporate 
governance. a detailed overview can 
be found in scandinavian tobacco 
group’s 2020 statutory report on 
corporate governance.

1.1
basis of preparation
section 1
the consolidated financial statements of scandinavian 
tobacco group have been prepared in accordance with 
the international financial reporting standards (ifrs), 
as adopted by the european union (eu) and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for listed companies 
and further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act.
recognition and measurement
the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost basis except when 
ifrs explicitly require the use of fair value. danish 
kroner is the group's presentation currency and the 
functional currency of the parent company. the 
principal accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently in the preparation of the consoli-
dated financial statements for all the years presented.
principal accounting policies
the group’s accounting policies are described in 
relation to the individual notes to the consolidated 
financial statements. considering all the accounting 
policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements, executive management regards 
the following as the most significant accounting 
policies for the recognition and measurement of 
reported amounts as well as relevant to an understand-
ing of the consolidated financial statements:
•  gross profit (net sales and cost of goods sold) (note 
2.1)
•  income and deferred income taxes (note 2.6)
•  intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
including impairment (notes 3.1 and 3.2)
•  inventories (note 3.4)
changes in accounting policies and 
disclosures
impact of new accounting standards
based on an assessment of new or amended and 
revised accounting standards and interpretations 
(‘ifrs’) issued by the international accounting 
standards board (iasb) and ifrs endorsed by the 
european union effective on or after 1 january 2020, it 
has been assessed that the application of these new 
ifrs has not had a material impact on the consolidat-
ed financial statements in 2020, and the group does 
not anticipate any significant impact on future periods 
from the adoption of these new ifrs. the group has 
adopted all new, amended and revised standards and 
interpretations. 
amendments to ifrs 3 'business combinations' and 
ifrs 9 'financial instruments' and ifrs 7 'interest rate 
benchmark reform' with effective date 1 january 2020 
have been implemented. the group has assessed the 
impact of the standards and determined that they did 
not have any significant impact on the annual report.
new or amended ifrs that have been issued 
but have not yet come into effect and have 
not been early adopted
the iasb has issued a number of new or amended and 
revised accounting standards and interpretations that
have not yet come into effect. it has been assessed that 
the application of these new ifrs will not have a 
material impact on future reporting periods.
reclassification
in 2020 the reportable segments were reduced from 
four to three segments by integrating and combining 
one of the previous segments into two of the other 
segments as well as partly reallocations between the 
segments. as part of this change from four to three 
reportable segments (see note 2.1) certain types of 
expenses have been realigned between markets within 
the new segments. alignment of the presentation of 
these expenses, which are now presented as customer 
discounts rather than costs, has led to reclassifications 
between the separate line items in the income 
statement. the comparison figures have been restated. 
the impact on the historical figures is stated below.

translation policies
transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rates at the dates of transaction. gains and 
losses arising due to differences between the transac-
tion date rates and the rates at the dates of payment 
are recognised in financial income and expenses in the 
income statement. 
receivables, payables and other monetary items in 
foreign currencies that have not been settled at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date. any differences between the 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the 
transaction date rates are recognised in financial income 
and expenses in the income statement.
income statements of foreign subsidiaries and associat-
ed companies are translated at transaction date rates 
or approximated average exchange rates. balance sheet 
items are translated at the exchange rates at the 
balance sheet date. exchange adjustments arising from 
the translation of the opening equity and exchange 
adjustments arising from the translation of the income 
statements at the exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date are recognised directly in equity.
other external costs
other external costs comprise expenses for premises, 
sales, marketing, distribution and bad debt allowance 
as well as office expenses, fee to statutory auditor, etc.
other income
other income consists mainly of items of a secondary 
nature to the core activities, including gains on the sale 
of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. 
basis of consolidation
subsidiaries are all entities (including structured 
entities) which the group controls. the group controls 
an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entitiy. enterprises in which the group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the votes and exercises 
significant influence but not control are classified as 
associated companies. at consolidation, items of a 
uniform nature are combined. elimination is made of 
intercompany income and expenses, shareholdings, 
dividends and accounts as well as of realised and 
unrealised profits and losses on transactions between 
the consolidated enterprises.
the parent company’s investments in the consolidated 
subsidiaries are set off against the parent company’s 
share of the net asset value of subsidiaries stated at the 
time of consolidation.
on the acquisition of subsidiaries, the difference 
between cost and net asset value of the enterprise 
acquired is determined at the date of acquisition after 
the individual assets and liabilities have been adjusted 
to fair value (the acquisition method). transaction costs 
relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries are not 
included in the value of the acquired assets. all acquisi-
tion-related costs are expensed in the period in which 
they incur. any remaining positive differences are 
recognised as goodwill in intangible assets in the 
balance sheet. goodwill is not amortised, but instead 
tested for impairment on an annual basis and when 
there is an indication of impairment.
positive and negative differences from enterprises 
acquired may, due to changes to the recognition and 
measurement of net assets, be adjusted until one year 
from the acquisition date. these adjustments are also 
reflected in the value of goodwill.

equity
proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the 
time of approval by the general meeting. dividend 
which is expected to be distributed for the year is 
disclosed in note 4.5.
the reserve for currency translation in the consolidated 
financial statements comprises foreign exchange 
differences arising from translation of financial 
statements of foreign enterprises from their functional 
currencies to the presentation currency of the group 
(danish kroner). 
 
when there is full or partial disposal of the net 
investment, the foreign exchange adjustments are 
recognised in the income statement.
the reserve for hedges includes the accumulated net 
change in the fair value of hedging transactions qualify-
ing for hedge accounting.
cost of acquisition and proceeds from sale of treasury 
shares are recognised in reserve for treasury shares. 
dividends received in relation to treasury shares are 
recognised in retained earnings.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement shows the group’s cash flows 
for the year broken down by operating, investing and 
financing activities, changes for the year in cash and 
cash equivalents as well as the group’s cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.
cash flow from operating activities is determined as 
the net profit/loss for the year adjusted for changes in 
working capital and non-cash operating items such as 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses and 
provisions. working capital comprises current assets 
less short-term debt excluding items included in cash 
and cash equivalents, prepaid tax and corporate tax 
liabilities.
cash flow from investing activities comprises cash 
flows from addition and disposals of intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, fixed asset investments, 
acquisition of entities, as well as dividends from 
associated companies.
cash flow from financing activities comprises cash 
flows from repayment of lease liabilities, other 
financing, the raising and repayment of long-term debt 
as well as payments to and from shareholders.
cash and cash equivalents comprises ‘cash at bank 
and in hand’.
the cash flow statement cannot be derived directly 
from the consolidated financial statements.
when preparing the group’s consolidated financial 
statements, management makes various accounting 
estimates, judgements and assumptions which form 
the basis of presentation, recognition and measure-
ment of the group’s assets and liabilities. accounting 
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. in some circumstances a change in 
the estimates may be necessary because of changes in 
the underlying assumptions.
estimation uncertainty
determining the carrying amount of some assets and 
liabilities requires judgements, estimates and 
assumptions concerning future events. 
the judgements, estimates and assumptions made are 
based on historical experience and other factors which 
management assesses to be reliable, but which by their 
very nature are associated with uncertainty and 
unpredictability. these assumptions may prove 
incomplete or incorrect, and unexpected events or 
circumstances may arise. 
the group is also subject to risks and uncertainties 
which may lead to actual results differing from these 
estimates, both positively and negatively. assumptions 
about the future and estimation uncertainty on the 
balance sheet date are described in the notes if there is 
a significant risk of changes that could result in material 
adjustments to the carrying amount of assets or liabili-
ties within the next financial year.
executive management regards the following areas to 
include the key accounting estimates and assumptions 
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements:
•  income and deferred income taxes (note 2.6)
•  goodwill (note 3.1)
•  trademarks (note 3.1)
•  property, plant and equipment (note 3.2)
•  inventories (note 3.4)
•  pension obligations (note 3.9)
• business combinations (note 5.1)
please refer to the specific notes for further information 
on the key accounting estimates and assumptions 
applied.
defining materiality
the consolidated financial statements are a result of 
processing large numbers of transactions and aggregat-
ing those transactions into classes according to their 
nature or function. when aggregated, the transactions 
are presented in classes of similar items in the consoli-
dated financial statements. if a line item is not individ-
ually material, it is aggregated with other items of a 
similar nature in the consolidated financial statements 
or in the notes. there are substantial disclosure require-
ments throughout the ifrs. management provides 
specific disclosures required by the ifrs unless the 
information is considered immaterial to the economic 
decision-making of the users of these financial 
statements or not applicable.

gross profit (net sales and cost of goods sold)
net sales
the group derives revenue from the transfer of goods at a point 
in time. revenue is measured at the fair value of the considera-
tion received or receivable and is recognised exclusive of vat, 
excise and net of discounts/rebates relating to the sale. revenue 
from our retail activities includes excise. revenue from external 
customers come from the sale of goods on the basis of 
wholesale, retail, online & catalogue and business to business.
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income 
statement when the control of the goods has been transferred 
to the customer. 
the group does not have any contracts where the period 
between the transfer of the goods to the customer and 
payment by the customer exceeds one year. as a consequence, 
the group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the 
time value of money.
cost of goods sold
cost of goods sold comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue 
for the year. cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct 
labour costs and indirect production costs such as 
maintenance  as well as operation, administration and 
management of factories.
segments
as a part of the groupʼs integration of agio cigars and in order 
to increase speed to market and unlock synergies, commercial 
resources are realigned in three new divisions. as of 2020, the 
reportable segments have been changed from four to three. 
this is to align to the new internal reporting structure, which is 
provided to the executive board. the executive board is 
considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
comparison figures for segments and categories have been 
restated.
the three new segments are:
division north america online & retail includes direct to 
consumer sales of all product categories sold via the online, 
catalogue and retail channel in north america. 
division north america branded & rest of world includes 
sales of all product categories to wholesalers and distributors 
that supply retail in the us, canada, australia, new zealand, 
international sales (norway, finland, switzerland, israel and 
russia), asia, global travel retail and contract manufacturing 
for third parties.  
division europe branded includes sales of all product 
categories to wholesalers and distributors that supply retail in 
germany, denmark, sweden, france, italy, belgium, the 
netherlands, luxembourg, spain, portugal, as well as the uk 
and ireland. 
operating expenses that are not directly inherent in the 
divisions are to some extent allocated to the divisions based on 
allocation keys defined by activities or other relevant 
components. certain costs relating to group functions are 
managed on group level. these items are not included in the 
reportable divisions and therefore reported as ʻgroup costsʼ.
depreciation, amortisation, impairment costs, special items, 
share of profit of associated companies, net of tax and financial 
items are not allocated to the different segments.
no operating segments have been aggregated to form the 
reported business segments.
no assets and liabilities are allocated to segments in the 
internal reporting.

policies
total non-current assets in denmark amount to  
dkk 1,871.8 milion (dkk 1,901.2 million).
geographic information
in the table above, sales to external customers are 
attributable to the country of the customers’ domicile, 
and in the table non-current assets are based on the 
country of the entities’ domicile. 
the group is domiciled in denmark. net sales from 
external customers in denmark amount to dkk 185.9 
million (dkk 180.7 million), and net sales from external 
customers outside denmark amount to dkk 7,820.0 
million (dkk 6,538.3 million). individual, material

remuneration of the board of directors 
and executive board
total fees to the board of directors and executive board 
amounted to dkk 79.4 million (dkk 53.4 million).
executive board
the remuneration of the executive board is assessed 
annually and among other factors compared to the 
remuneration level of similar international companies 
in terms of size, scale and complexity.    
the members of the executive board participate in the 
group’s long-term incentive programme (ltip) according 
to which the participants receive an annual grant of 
performance share units (psus). the ceo receives an 
annual grant of psus with a value at target performance 
corresponding to 40% of the annual base salary, whereas 
the cfo receives a grant of psus with a value at target 
performance corresponding to 30% of the annual base 
salary. in a maximum performance scenario the value at 
within 6-12 months after a change of the control or 
delisting of the company, the ceo may terminate his 
employment, and he will be entitled to 24 months 
remuneration, as if he had been terminated by the 
company. also, the ceo will be entitled to a 
proportional share of the below mentioned buy-out 
payment. if the company should wish to terminate the 
cfo within 18 months after a change of the control or 
delisting of the company, the cfo is entitled to a notice 
of 24 months.
in connection with the ipo of the company in 2016, a 
contractual early-retirement plan was abolished, and 
the ceo was granted a compensation. with this, the 
ceo is entitled to a buy-out payment split in three 
tranches, of which the last two, each of dkk 6.1m gross, 
are payable on 1 january  2021 and 2024, respectively,  
provided that the ceo continues to be employed in the 
same position in the company. if the ceo terminates 
his position or is terminated for breach of contract, the 
ceo is no longer entitled to the payments. if the 
employment is terminated by the company for a 
reason other than breach of contract by the ceo, or if 
the ceo terminates the employment due to breach by 
the company, the ceo will be entitled to a proportion-
ate share of any unpaid payments.
for the year 2020, the total cost of remuneration for the 
executive board amounts to dkk 72.7 million (dkk 46.9 
million.

the time of grant is 80% and 60%, of the base salary at 
the time of grant of the psus, respectively. other key 
management members (members of the executive 
board who are not members of the executive 
management) receive an annual grant of psus 
corresponding in value to 15-30% of their annual base 
salary at the time of the grant. in a maximum 
performance scenario, the value at the time of grant is 
30-60%, of the base salary at the time of grant of the 
psus. the value of the psus follows the trading value of 
scandinavian tobacco group a/s' shares during the 
three-year performance period. the shares, if any, to be 
allocated to each participant under the ltip following 
the performance period will be determined on the basis 
of the initial psus, with the addition of any dividend 
psus granted, adjusted by the performance in the 
performance period against the pre-defined kpi multipli-
er (between 0.0 and 2.0). for a further description of the 
share-based incentive programme please refer to note 
2.3.
the members of the executive board also participate in a 
short-term incentive programme (stip) according to which 
they may receive an annual target bonus of 25% with a 
potential bonus of up to 50% of the annual base salary for 
the ceo and a 25% target bonus with a potential bonus of 
up to 50% for the cfo. other members of the executive 
board may receive an annual target bonus of 25-30% with 
a potential bonus up to 50-60%. both the executive 
management member's bonus and the bonus for other 
executive board members are based on two parameters: 
organic ebitda growth and a cash-related kpi (free cash 
flow before acquisitions and special items). 
should the company terminate the individual 
employment contracts, members of the executive 
management  would generally have a right to 12-24 
months’ notice, and other executive board members 
would be entitled to 6-12 months’ notice/remuneration.

share-based payments
scandinavian tobacco group operates a number of equity- 
settled, share-based compensation plans.
the value of services received in exchange for granted 
performance-based share units (psus) is measured at fair 
value at the grant date and recognised in the income 
statement under staff costs over the vesting period with a 
corresponding increase in equity.
the fair value of granted psus is measured at the share price 
at grant date.
on initial recognition, an estimate is made of the number of 
psus expected to vest. the estimated number is subsequently 
revised for changes in the number of psus expected to vest 
due to non-market based vesting conditions.
share-based incentive programmes
scandinavian tobacco group has a long-term incentive 
programme (ltip) for members of the executive management
and members of senior management.
upon vesting, each psu entitles the holder to receive one 
share in scandinavian tobacco group at no cost.
the actual number of shares vesting may range between 0 and 
200% of the grant and is determined by a service period of 3
years and the achievement of certain performance indicators 
in the financial years 2020-2022 for the ltip 2020 (organic 
ebitda growth and cash conversion), 2019-2021 for the ltip 
2019 (organic ebitda growth and cash conversion), 2018-2020 
for the ltip 2018 (organic ebitda growth and cash conversion), 
and the financial years 2017-2019 for the ltip 2017 (organic 
ebitda growth and inventory reduction).
in march 2020, psus granted under the ltip 2017 were vested 
and the participants received shares in scandinavian tobacco 
group a/s at no cost. the shares received corresponded to 
50% of the grant, based on the actual achieved performance. 
the remaining granted psus were cancelled and the 
programme has lapsed.
under the ltip programme, new psus were granted to partici-
pants in 2020. this was the fifth grant following the ipo in 
2016.
prior to vesting, holders of psus are not entitled to any of the 
rights which shareholders hold, except from the right to
dividends which will be converted into additional psus (both 
ordinary and extraordinary dividends).
for a further description of the programme, please refer to 
note 2.2.

uncertain tax positions
as an international business the group is exposed to 
uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. the group's uncertain 
tax positions relate to cross-border transfer pricing, 
interpretation of new or complex tax legislation and tax 
arising on the valuation of assets. the assessment of 
uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant 
management judgement is required. this judgement is 
based on interpretation of legislation, management 
experience and professional advice.

*  effect of enacted change of tax rates in 2020 relates to the dutch corporate tax rate, which at 31 december 2019 was enacted to be 
reduced to 21.7% in 2021. late december 2020 it was enacted that the tax rate will stay at 25% going forward.
at 31 december 2020 the group has no unrecognised tax assets (dkk 0.0 million).
uncertain tax positions are considered separately and 
the most likely amount is the basis for the calculated 
provision. the judgements, methods and assumptions 
are unchanged from the previous year.
provisions arising from uncertain tax positions reflected 
in the calculation of tax assets and liabilities are 
included in current corporate tax liabilities. 
it is possible that amounts paid will be different from 
the amounts provided.

income taxes
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred 
tax including adjustments to previous years and changes in 
liability for uncertain tax positions. tax is recognised in the 
income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
any changes in deferred tax due to changes in tax rates are 
recognised in the income statement or in other comprehensive 
income depending on the original recognition.
current tax receivables and liabilities
current tax receivables and liabilities are recognised in the 
balance sheet at the amount calculated on the basis of the 
expected taxable income for the year and prior year 
adjustments. tax receivables and liabilities are offset if there is 
a legally enforceable right of set-off and an intention to settle 
on a net basis or simultaneously.
deferred tax assets and liabilities
deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differenc-
es between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and 
liabilities.
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax 
rates that will be effective under the legislation at the balance 
sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as 
current tax. in cases where the computation of the tax base 
may be made according to alternative tax rules, deferred tax is 
measured on the basis of the intended use of the asset and 
settlement of the liability, respectively.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryfor-
wards, are measured at the value at which the asset is expected 
to be realised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or 
by set-off against deferred tax liabilities.
accounting 
policies
management has made estimates in determining the liabilities 
for uncertain tax positions, deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities and the extent to which deferred tax assets are 
recognised. the group recognises only deferred tax assets if 
these tax assets can be offset against positive taxable income in 
the foreseeable future. the estimates are made on the basis of 
business plans for the forthcoming years.

impairment of intangible assets
the carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed on an 
annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment other than that expressed by amortisation. if so, 
an impairment test is carried out to determine whether the 
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount and the 
asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount.
key accounting 
estimates
the impairment test includes significant judgments made by 
management, such as assumption of projected future cash 
flows used in the valuation of the intangible assets. future 
events could cause management to conclude that impairment 
indicators exist and that intangible assets are impaired. any 
resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the 
financial condition and on the result of operations.
accounting 
policies
goodwill 
goodwill represents any cost in excess of identifiable net assets, 
measured at fair value, in the acquired company. goodwill is 
valued at acquisition value less any accumulated impairment 
losses. goodwill is tested annually, or upon indication, for 
impairment.
 
trademarks
trademarks are measured at cost less accumulated amortisa-
tion and less any accumulated impairment losses. strategic 
trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortised, but are 
reviewed annually for impairment. strategic trademarks are 
defined as trademarks of a sizeable significance measured on 
contribution and the trademarks have the potential to grow 
across geographies. other trademarks are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives determined on 
the basis of management’s experience with the individual 
trademarks. the amortisation period is typically in the range of 
5–25 years.
it software
it software is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and less any accumulated impairment losses. amortisation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives 
of the assets, which are 5 years. 
other intangible assets
other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and less any accumulated impairment losses. 
amortisation is based on cost reduced by any residual value 
and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful lives of the assets, which are 5–20 years.

share gains in europe branded, price increases in all divisions, a 
positive impact from the integration of agio, cost prices and 
opex development in line with current inflation level adjusted

goodwill impairment test
in the annual impairment test of goodwill, an estimate is made 
to determine how the enterprise will be able to generate 
sufficient positive net cash flow in the future to support the 
value of goodwill, trademarks and other net assets of the 
enterprise in question. for the purpose of the annual 
impairment test of goodwill, the costs and income in segment 
note 2.1 have been allocated to each cash generating unit 
based on either direct allocation or by using relevant 
allocation keys. the estimates of the anticipated future net 
cash flow are based on budgets, business plans as well as 
management’s projections for the coming years. contribution 
expectations are based upon projections made on the 
development in volume, average sales and cost prices as well 
as operating cost development for each market in each of the 
defined cash generating units.
key accounting 
estimates
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication of impairment. 
when carrying out the impairment test for goodwill, the 
group is seen as several cash generating units split 
according to the internal segment reporting. the 
carrying values of the individual cash generating units 
are compared to the values in use (discounted value of 
future cash flows). if the carrying values are higher, the 
difference is charged to the income statement. 
the values in use are calculated using a valuation 
model based on discounted expected future cash flows 
(dcf-model covering a five-year budget period) based 
on management’s projections.
when goodwill was tested for impairment in 2020 (and 
2019), the value in use exceeded the carrying value for 
the individual cash generating units and no basis for 
impairment was found.
when performing sensitivity analysis by increasing the 
discount rate by 1 percentage point or lowering the 
terminal growth by 1 percentage point, the value in use 
still exceeded the carrying value per segment.
ebitda growth in the budget period, terminal growth 
and discount rate constitute the key assumptions in 
calculating the value in use. the applied key 
assumptions, both overall as well as for each individual 
cash generating unit, are described in the following.
trademarks
the main part of the group’s trademarks is attributable 
to the merger between scandinavian tobacco group 
and swedish match in 2010 and the acquisition of lane 
ltd. in 2011. in connection with the merger and the 
acquisition, intangible assets were identified and 
measured at fair value at the date of the merger/
acquisition. strategic trademarks with indefinite useful 
lives are not amortised but are reviewed annually for 
impairment. other trademarks are amortised in a 
straight line over the expected useful lives.
the carrying amount of trademarks at 31 december 
2020 amounted to dkk 3,067.5 million (dkk 2,840.2 
million).

as announced on 23 april 2020 (company announce-
ment no. 10/2020), the organisational/management 
structure in scandinavian tobacco group was changed 
as part of the integration of agio cigars. to align 
financial reporting with the new organisational 
structure and to ensure consistency with internal 
management reporting, the group's external reporting 
structure has been revised from four to three divisions. 
please refer to note 2.1 for a description of the three 
new divisions.
as a consequence of the reorganised management and 
reporting structure, the composition of the group’s 
cash-generating units has changed and the units are 
now split according to the new segment reporting. in 
accordance with ias36, goodwill has been reallocated 
to the three new divisions by using a relative value 
approach.
as per 31 december 2020 the carrying amount of 
goodwill has been allocated to the identified cash-gen-
erating units according to the reportable segments as 
follows:

impairment test – trademarks with indefinite useful lives
in the annual impairment test of trademarks with indefinite 
useful lives, an estimate is made to determine how the 
trademarks will be able to generate sufficient positive net cash 
flow in the future to support the value of the trademark in 
question. the estimates of the anticipated future net cash flow 
are based on management’s projections for the coming years. 
contribution expectations are based upon projections made 
on the development in volume, average sales and cost prices 
for each trademark.
key accounting 
estimates
trademarks with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an 
indication of impairment. 
when carrying out the impairment test for trademarks 
with indefinite useful lives, each trademark is seen as a 
separate asset capable of generating cash flow. the 
carrying value of each trademark is compared to the 
values in use (discounted value of future cash flows). if 
the carrying value is higher, the difference is charged to 
the income statement. 
the value in use for each trademark is calculated by 
using a valuation model based on discounted expected 
future cash flows (multi-period excess earnings-method 
(“meem”) in an adapted form, covering a five-year 
budget period) based on management’s projections.
when trademarks with indefinite useful lives were 
tested for impairment in 2020 (and 2019), the value in 
use exceeded the carrying value for each of the individ-
ual trademarks and no basis for impairment was found. 
when performing sensitivity analysis by increasing the 
discount rate by 1 percentage point or lowering the 
terminal growth by 1 percentage point, the value in use 
still exceeded the carrying value for each individual 
trademark.
ebitda growth in the budget period, terminal growth 
and discount rate constitute the key assumptions in 
calculating the value in use.
management has used a discount rate (wacc after tax) 
between 7.6% and 24.5% (pre-tax wacc between 9.3% 
and 29.8%). the weighted average discount rate after 
tax is 9.5% (pre-tax 11.5%). the discount rates are 
based on the risk-free rate adjusted for the inherent risk 
for each individual trademark. terminal growth in 
ebitda is set between -5.0% and 1.0% and is based on 
adjusted historical development taking into account 
expected future development.
other trademarks (definite useful lives)
acquired trademarks that have been deemed to have 
definite useful lives are in general amortised over a 
period of 5–25 years. trademarks are tested for 
impairment when circumstances indicate that the value 
of a trademark is impaired.
in 2020, management did not identify any indications of 
impairment. 
in 2019, an impairment of dkk 5.3 million was 
recognised in the income statement. management did 
not identify any other indications of impairment.
it software
software comprises expenses for acquired software and 
expenses related to internally developed software. 
in 2020, a partly reversal of dkk 3.9 million of the 
impairment cost from 2019 was recognised in the 
income statement as some continued future usage for 
the it software was indentified.  
in 2019, an impairment of dkk 8.8 million was 
recognised in the income statement as part of 'special 
items'. management did not identify any other 
indications of impairment.
other intangible assets
other intangible assets mainly comprise acquired name 
rights, customer relations and distribution rights. 
during 2020, management did not identify any 
indications of impairment (same in 2019).

impairment
in 2019 impairment costs of dkk 92 million regarding 
the decision to close the group’s us production facility 
in tucker, georgia were recognised in the income 
statement as part of ‘special items’. the impairment 
relates to the factory buildings and machinery that will 
not be used after the closing. 
impairment
in 2020, impairment costs of dkk 106 million were 
recognised in the income statement. these costs are 
related to the decision to optimise the production 
footprint by closing three production sites. further, as 
part of the agio integration, excess capacity on 
machinery resulted in impairment costs. 
in 2020, a partly reversal of the impairment costs from 
2019 was recognised as the potential to sell land and 
buildings improved significantly as well as the utilisa-
tion of the machinery improved. impairment costs and 
reversals of impairment cost are recognised in 'special 
items' in the income statement.  
depreciation
all depreciation is recognised in the income statement 
in 2020 and in 2019.

cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly 
related to the acquisition up until the asset is ready for use.  
in the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises 
direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, 
components and sub-suppliers.

the group as a lessee
the group has entered into lease contracts for land, 
offices, warehouses, motor vehicles and other 
equipment utilised across the entire group. leases of 
land have lease terms up to 20 years, offices and 
warehouses generally have lease terms between three 
and ten years, while motor vehicles and other 
equipment generally have lease terms between three 
and five years. lease contracts that include extension 
and termination options are recognised based on the 
outcome of the lease term that is considered reasona-
bly certain at the commencement date. 
information on the corresponding lease liabilities is 
included in note 4.2 financial instruments and risks.

in 2020, the group had total cash outflows for leases of dkk 79.2 million (dkk 89.0 million). the group has entered 
into lease contracts at a value of dkk 114.8 million (dkk 40.0 million) that have not yet commenced. the group has 
extension options of a total value of dkk 24.3 million (dkk 24.0 million) that are not included in the recognised leases, 
as it is not considered reasonable certain that the group will exercise the options. 
impairment of property, plant and equipment
the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment other than that expressed by 
depreciation. if so, an impairment test is carried out to 
determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the 
carrying amount and the asset is written down to its lower 
recoverable amount. the impairment test includes significant 
judgments made by management, such as assumption of 
projected future cash flows used in the valuation.

at the inception of a contract, the group assesses whether the 
contract is, or contains, a lease. based on the contract the 
right-of-use asset and the lease liability are recognised at 
commencement of the lease. the initial measurement of the 
right-of-use asset is at cost and comprises the initial value of 
the lease liability and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date. the right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter period of the lease term 
or the useful life of the underlying asset. 
the lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value 
of lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date. lease payments include fixed payments and variable 
payments that depend on an index such as an inflation index 
as well as lease payments from an extension option that the 
group considers reasonably certain to be exercised. 
accounting 
policies
extension and termination options exist for a number of leases, 
particular for offices and warehouses. in determining lease 
terms, all facts and circumstances offering economic incentives 
for exercising extension options or not exercising termination 
options are taken into account. lease terms can be subject to 
changes following the occurrence of significant events or 
circumstances.
the group applies the recognition exemption to short-term 
leases and low-value leases.
impairment of right-of-use assets
the carrying amounts are reviewed on an annual basis to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment other 
than that expressed by depreciation. if so, an impairment test is 
carried out to determine whether the recoverable amount is 
lower than the carrying amount and the right-of-use asset is 
written down to its lower recoverable amount.

recognised as cost and included in ‘cost of goods sold’ amounted to dkk 3,500.9 million (dkk 2,973.1 million).
inventories are measured at the lower of cost under the fifo
method and net realisable value. the net realisable value of
inventories is calculated at the amount expected to be generat-
ed by sale in the process of normal operations with deduction
of selling expenses and costs of completion. the net realisable
value is determined allowing for marketability, obsolescence
and development in expected sales prices.
accounting 
policies
the cost of goods for resale, raw materials and consumables 
equals landed cost.
the cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the 
cost of raw materials, consumables and direct labour with 
addition of indirect production costs. indirect production costs 
comprise the cost of labour, maintenance and depreciation of 
the machinery, factory buildings, equipment and right-of-use 
assets used in the manufacturing process as well as costs of 
factory administration and management.

utilisation are incorporated correctly. changes in the 
parameters, assumed production yield and utilisation levels, 
etc. could have a significant impact on the cost price and, in 
turn, on the valuation of inventories and production costs.
furthermore, the estimated uncertainty in inventories is related 
to the write-down to net realisable value. inventories are written 
down in accordance with group policy, including individual 
assessment of inventories for possible losses due to obsoles-
cence.
trade receivables are measured in the balance sheet at 
amortised cost less provisions for expected credit losses. 
expected credit losses are determined by using the simplified 
expected credit loss model (ecl), which has the approach of 
assessing the lifetime expected credit loss. 
the ecls on trade receivables are estimated by using a matrix 
based on aging of customers, and includes both historical 
as well as forward-looking information. the estimation takes 
into account geography, past default experience, analysis of the 
debtor’s current financial position, factors that are specific to 
the debtors, general economic conditions in which the debtors 
operate and an assessment of the forecast direction of 
developments at the reporting date.

expected contribution next year 
expected contributions to post-employment benefit 
plans for the year ending 31 december 2021 amount to 
dkk 22.5 million.
defined contribution plans 
the group has certain obligations under defined 
contributions plans. contributions to these plans are 
determined by provisions in the respective plans. costs 
for defined contribution plans charged to the income 
statement for the year amount to dkk 63.7 million (dkk 
52.9 million).
defined benefit plans in primarily belgium,  
germany, france, indonesia, the dominican  
republic and the us
the group operates a number of defined contribution 
plans throughout the world. in a few countries, the 
group also operates defined benefit plans, which are 
effective in primarily belgium, germany, france, 
indonesia, the dominican republic and the us. the 
defined benefit plans for belgium total six different 
step-rate plans covering both blue and white collar 
employees and one offset defined benefit plan for 
managers. furthermore, a number of defined contribu-
tion plans with minimum guarantee (imposed by law) 
exists. these plans are insured but the guarantee given 
by the insurance company does not cover the full 
guarantee required under the pension law, why these 
are considered and treated as defined benefit plans. 
the defined benefit plans for germany cover 
employees who entered service before august 1991 and 
have since then been closed for new employees. the 
defined benefit plan in france is mandatory for all 
employees and has no minimum requirements for 
under a defined benefit plan, the amount of retirement benefit 
that will be received by an employee is defined with respect to 
period of service and final salary. the amount recognised in the 
balance sheet is the difference between the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date and the fair 
value of the scheme assets. 
the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. 
the service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees 
during the year is charged to operating profit. the costs for the 
year for defined benefit plans are determined using the project-
ed unit credit method. 
past service costs are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. 
all actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in full 
in the statement of other comprehensive income for the period 
in which they arise.
pension assets are only recognised to the extent that the group 
is able to derive future economic benefits such as refunds from 
the plan or reductions of future contributions. the group’s most 
significant defined benefit pension plans are financed by 
payments from group companies and by employees to funds 
which are independent of the group.

years of service with the company. the defined benefit 
plans for indonesia cover all employees in the form of 
severance and gratuity in accordance with labour 
regulation (labour law 13/2003). the defined benefit 
plans for the dominican republic are enacted by law 
and cover all employees with at least three months of 
service. the defined benefit plans in the us are 
non-qualified plans that cover a small group of inactive 
employee benefits which are paid out of corporate 
assets.
actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate is set per country with reference to high 
quality corporate bond yields of appropriate duration or 
government bond yields for countries where a deep market of
high quality corporate bonds is not available.
assumptions regarding future mortality experience are based 
on advice in accordance with published statistics and 
experience in each country.
contributions for defined contribution plans are reported as 
expenses in the income statement when they occur.
post-employment employee benefits
the group has defined benefit pension plans in a number of 
subsidiaries, through which the employees are entitled to 
post-employment benefits based on their pensionable income
and the number of years of service.
provisions for post-employment defined benefit plans are 
reported based on actuarial valuations. the group recognises 
the full amount of actuarial gains and losses in other 
comprehensive income, i.e. the net pension liability in the 
balance sheet includes all cumulative actuarial gains and losses.
the group does not plan for any new defined benefit plans.

*  the fair value of the financial liabilities is the present value of the expected future instalments and interest payments. the zero coupon 
interest rate for similar maturities is used as the capitalisation rate.
100% (100%) of the interest risk related to usd loan balance is hedged until 30 september 2022 by fixed interest swap contracts 
(maturing 30 september 2022).
borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transac-
tion costs incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.

financial risks  
and instruments
financial risks
financial risk management policy and 
strategy
the group manages financial risks based on financial 
strategies and policies approved by the board of 
directors.
as a general policy, the group is not allowed to engage 
in financial transactions or manage risk exposures that 
are not related to the underlying business driven risks, 
and consequently the group does not enter into any 
speculative transactions.
the group’s financial risks must be managed with the 
aim of protecting the value and financial stability of the 
group, taking into consideration the cost and account-
ing consequences of such transactions.
the risk management activities of the group are 
managed centrally by group treasury and primarily 
involve the following different financial risks.
foreign exchange risk
fluctuating currency rates influence the group’s 
reported income statement, balance sheet and value of 
future cash flows denominated in foreign currencies.
foreign exchange exposure in the group consists of two 
types of risk (a) translation risk and (b) transaction risk.
translation risk
translation risk arises from the translation of subsidiaries' 
income statement and net assets into dkk. the single 
most significant currency is usd.
the group does not hedge with financial contracts 
against translation effects, although borrowings in 
currencies other than dkk are used to partly mitigate 
translation risk.
transaction risk
transaction risk arises from cash flows in currencies 
other than the functional currencies of the group's 
subsidiaries. transaction risk is as a general rule not 
hedged with financial contracts as the impact from 
transaction risks is considered to be within the group's 
risk appetite. 
the group closely monitors the foreign exchange risk 
mainly related to the following currencies: usd, nok, 
sek, gbp, cad, aud, rub and idr. the group considers 
both dkk and eur as base currencies due to the 
historically fixed currency band between dkk and eur.
a 5% increase/decrease in the usd rate versus dkk and 
eur would impact net earnings before tax positively/
negatively by dkk 0.9 million (dkk 1.3 million) and 
impact other comprehensive income positively/
negatively by dkk 1.1 million (dkk 0.1 million) arising 
from financial assets and liabilities. the sensitivity 
analysis does not include financial assets and liabilities 
in the functional currency of the group's subsidiaries or 
translation risk from consolidation of income 
statement.
interest rate risk
fluctuating interest rates influence the group’s income 
statement, balance sheet and the present value of 
future cash flows resulting from changes in interest 
rates. the objective of actively managing the group’s 
interest rate exposure is to maintain the interest rate 
risk at a known and acceptable level and to minimise 
the group’s cost of borrowing requirements.
the group’s consolidated interest rate risk is measured 
at group level only.
the group has an active approach to managing the 
interest rate risk.

the types of interest rate risks are: cash flow risk, where 
future cash flows are uncertain due to future interest rate 
movements. fair value risk, where the value of the 
underlying asset or liability is impacted by the future 
interest rate level.
it is the aim of the group to hedge its known and certain 
interest rate exposures. cash flow risk is hedged while 
fair value risk is not hedged. therefore, the group only 
actively hedges the floating rate interest payments on 
long-term debt, meaning term loans with a maturity 
exceeding one year. the cash flow risk on these term 
loans is hedged up to 100%.
hedging instruments: hedging of the interest exposure is 
mitigated via financial derivatives where there is a direct 
economic relation to the underlying risk – interest rate 
fluctuations. the group therefore engages in interest 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps (ir swap) with the 
aim to hedge the cash flow risk arising from paying 
floating interest on underlying term loans. ir swap is an 
agreement where the group exchanges future payment 
flows from either floating rate denominated interest 
payments for a fixed rate interest payment for a given 
period or vice versa. thus by engaging in an ir swap, the 
group effectually exchanges its floating denominated 
interest payments to a fixed rate and thus mitigate the 
uncertainty regarding interest rate movements effect on 
loan payments. the group uses ir swap to fix the future 
interest rates via matching the floating interest on the 
loan in exchange for a fixed rate for the remainder of the 
hedged period. as long as the fixing rate and terms on 
the floating leg of ir swap and loan are the same the 
hedge will be 100% effective.
ineffectiveness in the hedge arises from deviations in 
underlying terms between the loan and ir swap. 
sources of ineffectiveness are mismatch in terms, such 
as a floor or cap on the interest in either the loan or 
hedge. in such cases, a mismatch in terms, will result in 
ineffectiveness which will impact the income statement 
as described under hedge accounting.
as at the balance sheet date, the group has interest rate 
swap agreements totalling a notional amount of eur 
225.0 million (eur 225.0 million) and usd 150.0 million 
(usd 150.0 million), which relate to bank loans.
ineffectiveness has impacted the income statement by a 
cost of dkk 16.8 million (dkk 4.7 million) and is related 
to the group's eur interest rate swaps, where the hedge 
relationship ended during 2020. assuming the current 
portfolio of swap contracts remains the same, an 
increase in the eur and usd rate of interest by one 
percentage point would impact (before tax) other 
comprehensive income positively by dkk 0.0 million 
(dkk 0.0 million) and dkk 15.7 million (dkk 51.9 million), 
respectively and a positive impact on the financial items 
of dkk 34.5 million (dkk 73.8 million).
credit risk
the group’s credit risk is primarily related to receivables, 
bank deposits and derivative financial instruments and 
can be divided into two main risk types.
operational credit risk
the group’s balance sheet at 31 december 2020 
included trade receivables with a net book value of dkk 
830.2 million (dkk 800.6 million), representing a gross 
receivable balance of dkk 845.8 million (dkk 817.3 
million) and a provision for expected credit losses of 
dkk 15.6 million (dkk 16.7 million), based on the 
expected credit loss model (ecl). the ecls on trade 
receivables are estimated by using a matrix based on 
aging of customers, and includes both historical 
as well as forward-looking information. the estimation 
takes into account geography, past default experience, 
analysis of the debtor’s current financial position, 
factors that are specific to the debtors, general 
economic conditions in which the debtors operate and 
an assessment of the forecast direction of develop-
ments at the reporting date.
the group’s net sales primarily comprise sales of 
tobacco to different distributors, retailers and direct to 
consumers. the group has historically experienced 
limited risk with regard to the solvency of its customers. 
as part of the group’s internal procedures regarding risk 
management, the operational credit risk relating to 
customers is monitored on a monthly basis. the group 
has no significant concentration of credit exposure as 
the exposure has been spread on a large number of 
creditworthy trading partners.
financial credit risk
financial credit risk management has the objective of 
minimising financial loss through a financial distress or 
the default of a financial counterparty whether due to 
the financial insolvency of the counterparty, the inabili-
ty of the counterparty to perform due to changed 
national legislation or any other circumstance.
the group’s exposure to counterparty risk is managed by 
establishing approved counterparty limits detailing the 
maximum exposure that the group is prepared to accept 
with respect to the individual counterparty.
in the event of bankruptcy among the lending banks, 
the group has in accordance with the danish 
bankruptcy act the right to offset cash deposits in the 
counterparty bank debt totalling dkk 0.0 million at 31 
december 2020 (dkk 0.0 million).
liquidity risk
the group ensures the availability of the required 
liquidity through a combination of cash management 
and uncommitted as well as committed credit facilities. 
to centralise and optimise liquidity the group utilises 
cash pooling in addition to intercompany lending and 
borrowing as well as currency swaps.
the group has a committed revolving credit facility of 
eur 450 million (eur 155.0 million) equally split 
between providers. the facility matures in 2025. the 
undrawn amount of the credit facility at 31 december 
2020 was eur 364.5 million (eur 155.0 million).
to reduce refinancing risk the group ensures that term 
loans and committed credit facilities are split between 
providers and that maturity dates are diversified. 
in addition, the group issued a rated eur 300 million 
bond in september 2020, maturing in 2025. the diversi-
fication of the debt portfolio reduces the refinancing 
risk of the group.
financial instruments measured at fair value are broken 
down according to the following measuring hierarchy:
level 1:   observable market prices of identical 
instruments.
level 2:   valuation models primarily based on 
observable prices or traded prices of 
comparable instruments.
level 3: 
 valuation models primarily based on 
non-observable prices.
the fair value of the group’s forward exchange 
contracts and other derivative financial instruments 
(interest rate and currency swaps) are considered a 
level 2 fair value measurement as the fair value is

hedging transactions
the net fair value as at 31 december 2020 of outstand-
ing derivative contracts was negative by dkk 43.8 
million (negative by dkk 31.7 million), all related to 
interest rate swaps. income statement was impacted by 
dkk 16.8 million (dkk 4.7 million) related to the ineffec-
tiveness of interest rate swaps. balances in the cash 
flow hedge reserve on equity for which hedge account-
ing is no longer applied amounted to zero (dkk 16.8 
million) as at 31 december 2020. the 2019 balances 
were expensed during 2020 as the hedge relationship 
ended. 
  
interest rate swaps have been used to hedge the 
floating rate on bank loans. as at the balance sheet 
date, the group has outstanding interest rate swaps 
with a notional amount of eur 225.0 million and usd 
150.0 million (eur 225.0 million and usd 150.0 million). 
the net fair value stated will be transferred from the 
reserve for hedging (other comprehensive income) to the 
income statement when the hedged transactions are 
realised.
other transactions
the group uses financial transactions which do not 
qualify as hedge accounting according to the ifrs. 
4.2 (continued)
financial risks  
and instruments
derivative financial instruments
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the 
balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at 
their fair values. positive and negative fair values of derivative 
financial instruments are classified as other receivables/
financial fixed assets and other liabilities, respectively.
changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments are 
recognised in the income statement unless the derivative 
financial instrument is designated and qualifies as hedge 
accounting, see below.
hedge accounting
changes in the fair values of financial instruments that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges of a recognised 
asset or a recognised liability are recognised in the income 
statement like changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or 
the hedged liability related to the hedged risk.
changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated and qualify as hedges of expected future 
transactions are recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income as regards the effective portion of the hedge. the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. if the 
hedged transaction results in an asset or a liability, the amount 
deferred in other comprehensive income is transferred from 
other comprehensive income and recognised in the cost of the 
asset or the liability, respectively. if the hedged transaction 
results in an income or an expense, the amount deferred in 
other comprehensive income is transferred from other 
comprehensive income to the income statement in the period 
in which the hedged transaction is recognised. the amount is 
recognised in the same item as the hedged transaction.

with effect from 2 january 2020, the group acquired 
100% of the shares in agio beheer b.v. (agio cigars) a 
leading european cigar company. the total considera-
tion transferred of eur 220 million was paid in cash. 
agio cigars
agio cigars is a leading european cigar company with a 
strong cigar portfolio including key brands such as 
mehari´s, panter and balmoral. the company was 
based in duizel, the netherlands and had approximate-
ly 3,200 full-time employees. agio cigars' annual net 
sales for 2019 were eur 133 million (dkk 995 million) 
with a net profit of eur 7 million (dkk 55 million). 
agio cigars has contributed with a strong product 
portfolio to the group and with important market 
positions in key european machine-rolled cigar 
markets. the acquisition will secure leading positions in 
france, belgium and the netherlands and significantly 
improve the position in key cigar markets such as spain 
and italy.
fair value of acquired net assets and recognised 
goodwill 
net assets have been adjusted to comply with the 
group's accounting policies and financial reporting 
requirements. the calculated goodwill relates to 
synergies from integrating agio cigars into the existing 
divisions 'europe branded' and 'north america branded 
& row' including optimisations within sales, marketing, 
procurement, workforce and manufacturing expertise.
transaction costs 
total transaction costs related to the acquisition
amount to dkk 27 million, of which dkk 5 million (dkk 
22 million) were recognised in 2020. transaction costs 
for 2020 are recognised by dkk 5 million (dkk 20 
million) in 'special items'. 
in 2019 dkk 2 million were recognised in the 'balance 
sheet' that subsequently was amortised during the 
financing period.
impact on consolidated income statement
the financial statements include net sales of dkk 971 
million from the acquisition for the period 2 january to 
31 december 2020. the disclosure of net profit is 
considered impracticable as the ongoing integration of 
agio cigars into the group has resulted in consolidated 
operating expenses including synergies, where an agio 
stand-alone result cannot be separated on a valid basis.
during 2020 impairment losses of dkk 35.2 million have 
been recognised in the income statement relating to 
property, plant and equiptment from the acquisition. 
the reason for the impairment losses is the group's 
changes in the production footprint where one of the 
acquired factories will be closed. 
the most significant assets acquired generally comprise goodwill, 
trademarks, tradenames, customer relations and inventories. as no 
active market exists for the majority of acquired assets, the fair 
value is based on management’s projections and estimates. the 
methods applied are based on the present value of future cash 
flows related to the specific asset. estimates of fair value are 
associated with uncertainty and may be adjusted subsequently.

the recognised goodwill is not tax deductible. 
to the provisional goodwill amount disclosed in the 
annual report of 2019 there have been minor changes 
based on the final measurement of required assets and 
the assumed liabilities.  
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. the cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measued at 
acquisition date fair value. 
acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included 
in "special items" in the income statement.
any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer 
is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. if uncertain-
ties exist at the acquisition date regarding identification or
measurement of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities or regarding the consideration transferred, initial 
recognition will take place on the basis of provisionally 
determined fair values. if identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are subsequently determined to
have a different fair value at the acquisition date from that first 
assumed, goodwill is adjusted up until 12 months after the 
acquisition date. thereafter no adjustments are made to 
goodwill, and changes in estimates of contingent consideration 
relating to business combinations are recognised under “other 
income and costs”.
goodwill is initially measured at cost. if the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the group reassesses whether it has correctly 
identified all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed, and 
the group reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. if the 
reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net 
assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, 
the gain is recognised in the income statement. after initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
 
for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to 
each of the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination.

from time to time the group faces legal claims and

from items recognised in the financial statements, the 
outcome of any of these legal claims and disputes is 
highly uncertain and/or cannot be reliably estimated in 
terms of amount or timing. the group does not expect 
any of the pending claims or disputes to have a 
material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.

staff costs
the item ‘investments in affiliated companies’ in the balance 
sheet includes the proportionate ownership share of the net 
asset value of the enterprises calculated on the basis of the fair 
values of identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition with 
deduction or addition of unrealised intercompany profits or 
losses and with addition of any remaining value of positive 
differences (goodwill) and deduction of any remaining value of 
negative differences (negative goodwill).
the total net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries is 
transferred upon distribution of profit to ‘reserve for retained 
earnings – equity method’ under equity. the reserve is reduced 
by dividend distributed to the parent company and adjusted 
for other equity movements in subsidiaries.
defined benefit pension plans
in relation to defined benefit plans, the company follows the 
requirements in the danish financial statements act (dated  
1 july 2015 for financial statements starting 1 january 2016), 
meaning that actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income instead of directly in the 
income statement. for the monetary impact, please refer to the 
statement of changes in equity and group note 3.9.
share-based payments
in relation to share-based payments, the provisions in ifrs 2 
have been adopted as the danish financial statements act 
does not regulate share-based payments settled via equity 
instruments, but only cash-settled share-based payments. 
derogation from the danish financial statements act for 
share-based payments means that the year’s cost for 
share-based payments is not recognised as a liability in the 
balance sheet, but directly in the statement of equity. for the 
monetary impact, please refer to the statement of changes in 
equity and note 2.
the parent company has prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with the provisions of the danish financial 
statements act (class d) and other accounting regulations for 
companies listed on nasdaq copenhagen.
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with ifrs. the accounting policies applied for the 
consolidated financial statements regarding recognition and 
measurement have also been applied for the parent company 
with the below exceptions.
no separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the 
parent company. please refer to the statement of cash flows for 
the group.
result of investments in affiliated companies, net of tax
the item ‘result of investments in affiliated companies, net of 
tax’ in the income statement includes the proportionate share 
of the profit for the year after tax less goodwill amortisation and 
certain trademark amortisations.
goodwill
goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimat-
ed useful life determined on the basis of management’s 
experience with the individual business areas. the maximum 
amortisation period is 20 years, the longest period applying to 
enterprises acquired for strategic purposes with a strong market 
position and a long earnings profile.
trademarks
trademarks are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life determined on the basis of management’s 
experience. the maximum amortisation period is 20 years, the 
longest period applying to strategic trademarks with a strong 
market position and a long earnings profile.
investments in affiliated companies
investments in affiliated companies are recognised and 
measured under the equity method.

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements for 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
impairment of goodwill and strategic trademarks with indefinite lives
the principal risks are in relation to management’s assessment of the future timing and amount of cash flows that are 
used to project the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill and strategic trademarks with indefinite lives. 
there are specific risks related to macroeconomic conditions and volatile earnings caused by volume decline, intensi-
fied competition and changed regulations in key markets.
management prepared a re-allocation of the value of the goodwill to the new operating segments based on the 
relative fair values  of the new operating segments as of 2020.
values for strategic trademarks with indefinite life are separately tested for impairment. 
bearing in mind the generally long-lived nature of the assets, the significant assumptions are management’s view of 
prices, volumes, discount rates and terminal growth rates as well as the judgement in defining and allocating costs to 
each of the cash-generating units (cgus).
we focused on this area, as there is a high level of subjectivity exercised by management in determining significant 
assumptions and estimating cash flows.
the key assumptions and accounting treatment are described in section 3.1 ‘intangible assets’ in the consolidated 
financial statements.
we assessed the new definition of the cgus and the re-allocation of goodwill, net assets and cash flows to the new 
operating segments. further, we obtained the impairment tests of goodwill and strategic trademarks with indefinite 
lives.  
we considered the appropriateness of management’s defined cgus within the business. we evaluated whether there 
were factors requiring management to change its definition. we examined the methodology used by management to 
assess the carrying amount of goodwill and strategic trademarks with indefinite lives assigned to cgus.
we challenged the significant assumptions for the cash flow forecasts applied by management. we also evaluated the 
appropriateness of the significant assumptions regarding prices, volumes, discount rates and terminal growth rates as 
well as assessed management’s sensitivity calculation across the cgus.
we assessed the impairment models applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant value-in-use 
models prepared by management and assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures. we made use of our internal 
valuation specialists in the audit.

independent auditor's report
independent auditor's report (continued)
management is responsible for management report.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management report, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management report and, in 
doing so, consider whether management report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management report includes the disclosures required by the danish financial 
statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management report is in accordance with the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial statements act. we did not identify any material misstatement in management 
report.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and further requirements in the 
danish financial statements act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with the danish financial statements act, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

independent auditor's report
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conduct-
ed in accordance with isas and the additional require-
ments applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstate-
ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s and the parent company’s internal 
control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. however, future events or conditions may cause 
the group or the parent company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. we are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communi-
cate with them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independ-
ence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. we describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extreme-
ly rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the

adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
