intro - alk at a glance
alk's business model
as a global allergy solutions company with a century of knowledge and expertise, alk 
helps people to take control of their allergies and their lives.
key resources
our people and culture: around 2,500 highly-skilled 
employees live our cultural beliefs every day in their 
work to help more people with allergy.
production/natural allergens: alk’s biological 
medicines are derived from natural resources, such 
as pollen, which it harvests, standardises and quality 
controls at its own facilities.
scientific knowledge: alk continuously applies its 
scientific knowledge to help people take control of their 
allergies and their lives.
sales and partnerships: in addition to its own sales 
organisation, alk partners for growth with leading 
specialty pharma companies worldwide. alk is present 
in 41 markets, either directly or via partnerships.
r&d: the completion of the tablet portfolio remains 
the primary focus of alk’s r&d efforts. in addition, 
the company is conducting research into innovative 
solutions for high-impact allergic conditions – such as 
food allergies.
value created
patients: alk’s tablet portfolio is helping to 
democratise ait by covering the most common 
respiratory allergies, and bringing new treatment 
options to people without easy access to allergy 
specialists. 
doctors: alk helps allergists to drive better access and 
outcomes for all ait-eligible patients, reaching out with 
support, disease information and treatment options.
our people: alk is committed to a sustainable working 
life and keeps a constant focus on being a safe place to 
work for motivated and satisfied employees. 
society: alk addresses profound societal challenges 
by producing medicines for the leading cause of 
lost productivity and lost work days. the company 
partners with payers and health authorities to 
advance registered, documented ait products and is a 
signatory of the united nations global compact.
our investors: alk works to create long-term value for 
its shareholders.
raw materials
allergenic source materials, such as grass 
pollen and house dust mites, are the main 
ingredients of our products. every year 
the company grows, collects or harvests 
several tonnes of allergens.
active pharmaceutical ingredient (api ) production
allergens undergo thorough analysis, standardisation 
and quality control, so that naturally occuring 
variations are minimised, ensuring quality and 
consistency in the finished products.
finished production
apis are purified, then formulated for 
subcutaneous injections, sublingual drops or 
sublingual tablets.
packaging and distribution
following careful quality control, 
the finished products are labelled, 
packaged and distributed.
through information resources, services 
and products, alk is working to support 
people with allergy early in their disease 
journey, smoothing the path to treatment.
people with allergies 
often endure a decade 
or more of symptoms 
before turning to ait.

the global initiative for asthma, 
gina, recommends sublingual 
ait as a treatment option in 
patients with house dust mite-
induced allergic asthma.
digital engagement 
through alk’s klarify digital platform, people with 
allergy are able to get information about their 
condition and seek treatment in greater numbers.

respiratory allergies can affect  
both the upper and lower  
respiratory tract.

megatrends shaping allergy
most common chronic  
disease in the world
~500m
people around the world are affected and 
consume products and services worth more 
than dkk 100 billion annually.
1 in 10 ait candidates  
receives treatment
~50m 
people with allergy are so seriously affected 
that they are potential candidates  
for treatment with ait, but fewer than 5m 
people receive treatment today.
climate change may 
increase number of people 
with severe allergy
climate change means longer pollen 
seasons and more people suffering from 
severe allergies. warmer weather is also 
causing ragweed to spread to new regions. 
shift towards  
evidence-based medicine
in europe, authorities, prescribers and 
payers are increasingly turning to registered 
and documented products to treat allergies. 
internet
the internet is the principal source of  
disease information for people with allergy: 
allergy is googled >100 million times a year.
complete tablet portfolio
>80%
of adults with respiratory allergic disease 
requiring ait are now covered by alk's 
portfolio of five slit-tablets which can be 
taken at home.
slit-tablets are  
the best documented  
ait treatments
since 2001, 23,000 people have taken part 
in alk’s clinical programmes. its tablets are 
now the best documented ait products in 
the world and are approved to the highest 
regulatory standards  
(fda, ema, pmda etc). 
allergy can  
lead to asthma
asthma is one of the world’s most common 
chronic childhood diseases. preventing the 
progression of allergy into asthma would 
represent a major health breakthrough for 
millions of children.
urbanisation
increasing migration to cities - especially 
in asia - will further drive the prevalence of 
allergies such that alk expects it to reach 
similar levels to europe and the usa.
biological products
alk's slit-tablets have been developed 
from natural ingredients and are 
strongly protected thanks to unique 
biological manufacturing processes and 
standardisation procedures.
alk’s allergy solutions
food allergy
if you are allergic to a specific food, exposure 
may trigger an acute allergic reaction - 
anaphylaxis - for which adrenaline auto-injectors 
are an effective rescue medication. in addition, 
recent advances in food ait hold promise of a 
better life for people with food allergy.
the covid effect
in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic and 
associated containment measures restricted the 
ability of people with allergy to visit clinics in many 
countries, increasing interest in telemedicine and 
home-based treatment options.

management’s review • annual report 2020 • alk
intro - megatrends shaping allergy
2020 represented the final year of alk’s strategic transformation, and our focus remained on the 
relentless execution of our goals. when we first announced this transformation, we said that we 
wanted to ‘fix and grow’ alk by cleaning up past issues and establishing strong foundations to 
support growth. what 2020 clearly demonstrated is that we have been able to deliver on both of 
those promises, as a refocused alk delivered 8% revenue growth while also proving resilient 
to an unprecedented global challenge, without which, growth would have been even stronger. 
revenue growth was fuelled in the large part by a further spectacular increase in sales from our 
tablet portfolio of 42%, with the newly launched itulazax® leading the way.
throughout the transformation period, we have consistently 
overperformed relative to our promises, exceeding the 
cumulative sales forecast for 2018-20 by more than dkk 
700 million, delivering ebitda that was ahead of target, and 
registering significantly improved cash flow that was more 
than dkk 700 million ahead of plan. the positive results are 
also there to see across our four areas of strategic focus:
tablets are now the undisputed growth engine of alk, 
delivering an average growth of 37% over three years 
(cagr). meanwhile, the addition of itulazax® to our range 
completed our mission to cover the five major most important 
respiratory allergies. in north america, we have established 
a new sales infrastructure and launched acarizax®/
odactra®, although long-standing financial disincentives 
for prescribers, and the impact of covid, have challenged 
commercial progress there. we have invested significantly to 
improve our patient engagement capabilities by developing 
our klarify digital ecosystem, which offers help and resources 
to the millions of people living with allergy so they can better 
understand and manage their condition. importantly, klarify 
also enables us to mobilise patients to seek diagnosis 
and treatment in greater numbers. in addition to all of the 
above, we have advanced our site specialisation strategy 
and significantly pruned our portfolio, while also enhancing 
manufacturing efficiency, quality, and robustness. together, 
these initiatives will secure long-term margin improvements.

intro - letter from the ceo
sustainable growth and profitability
having made the necessary, significant investments to 
transform alk, we are now entering the next phase of the 
company’s development, where we must carefully work 
to sustain long-term growth, while also returning alk to 
profitability.
our overall trajectory remains unchanged, because we are 
still convinced that the four priorities we established three 
years ago are the most critical to delivering future growth. 
moreover, maintaining this continuity of focus will allow us to 
build on the foundations that we have now established, using 
our progress in each of these areas as a springboard from 
which to drive further growth.
tablets will remain our primary growth driver for the 
foreseeable future, and effective life-cycle management 
will be important to supporting their continued strong 
performance. this means expanding into new countries 
– such as china, and extending coverage to new patient 
groups – including children. clearly, the us market still has 
largely untapped potential for alk and will require much 
creativity and persistence before it fulfils our expectations 
but, as in other parts of the world, if we support our efforts 
with an effective commercial strategy by expanding the reach 
of klarify and establishing a broader, scalable sales model, 
and we back that up with excellence and robustness within 
our organisation, there is much more that we can achieve with 
the assets already at our disposal. 
nevertheless, we have also taken care to incorporate 
initiatives that have the ability to accelerate our long-term 
development. projects that may not make a significant 
contribution immediately, but which offer even further growth 
opportunities over the next five-to-10 years – such as an 
expanded offering in anaphylaxis, an entry into food allergy 
treatment, and research into innovative new treatments 
for high-impact allergic conditions. if we repeat our recent 
success in each of these areas over the coming years, we 
will establish a much larger alk capable of continuously 
generating attractive shareholder returns.
the commitment of our employees has been instrumental 
to delivering on the very ambitious targets we set when 
the strategy was first announced, and everyone at alk 
can feel justifiably proud of the cultural and organisational 
transformation that they have contributed to over the past 
three years. moreover, the work we have done together to 
strengthen alk’s foundations has been critical to our ability 
to withstand the challenge of covid, in response to which, not 
only did our employees swiftly implement our contingency 
plans and keep each other safe, but they also enabled alk to 
maintain an uninterrupted supply of medicines for those who 
rely upon them. 
we continue to value the trust placed in us by patients, 
prescribers, and investors, and we will maintain our efforts 
to sustain and strengthen that trust wherever possible. by 
successfully executing the next phase of our development, 
which is designed to deliver sustainable growth and 
profitability, we can continue our progress towards becoming 
the 'go-to' allergy company.

– in local currencies

alk expects growth across all sales regions 
in 2021, and revenue is projected to increase 
by 8-12% organically in local currencies, with 
the tablet portfolio expected to remain the key 
growth driver.
as a consequence of significant r&d cost 
delays from 2020 to 2021 due to the impact 
of covid, and a gradual normalisation of 
capacity costs, operating profit (ebitda) is 
expected to be close to that seen in 2020, 
despite revenue growth and an improved 
gross margin, attributable to tablet sales 
growth, and efficiencies.
alk’s working assumption is that the first half 
of 2021, and especially q1, will continue to 
be impacted by covid, especially in relation 
to allergy patients’ ability and willingness to 
visit healthcare professionals. this is likely 
to continue to impact the sales of treatments 
that rely on more frequent clinic visits, while 
sales of tablets are expected to remain 
resilient.
consequently, and as a result of the quarterly 
variations in 2020, fluctuations in revenue 
growth and earnings are likely from quarter to 
quarter during 2021.
revenue 
organic growth is projected at 8-12% in 
local currencies. discontinuations of legacy 
products are estimated to impact projected 
growth negatively by approximately 1 
percentage point.
alk expects broad-based growth across 
all sales regions. the mid-point of the 
projected revenue range assumes that 
sales in europe will increase by around 
10%. sales in north america are expected 
to recover from the impact of covid during 
2021, growing in double digits, while 
sales growth in international markets is 
projected to temporarily slow to high single 
digits. this is mainly due to growth in japan 
becoming more incremental following the 
extraordinarily high rates seen when torii 
converted patients from an outgoing legacy 
product to the cedarcure™ tablet, and 
built up its inventories of cedarcure™ and 
miticure™. 
tablets, alk’s single largest product 
category, will remain key to growth in 2021. 
alk plans for strong, double-digit tablet sales 
growth in europe and north america, while 
growth in japan will be slower for the reasons 
stated above. taking these factors together, 
alk estimates that global tablet sales growth 
will exceed 20% in 2021, continuing their 
strong positive trajectory. 
in addition, alk expects low single-digit 
sales growth from the remaining, non-tablet 
product portfolio, mainly driven by scit 
products, and double-digit sales growth from 
the jext® adrenaline auto-injector. 
continues 
10
management’s review • annual report 2020 • alk
intro - 2021 outlook
the higher end of the projected revenue 
range assumes accelerated sales growth 
across all regions with tablets leading 
the way and faster market share gains, 
supported by a continuing regulatory 
transition towards evidence-based ait 
products in key markets. the lower end of the 
revenue range incorporates pricing pressure, 
particularly in southern europe, and/or more 
pronounced, ongoing negative effects from 
covid.
margins
the gross margin is expected to increase by 
1-2 percentage points versus 2020, driven 
by efficiencies and higher sales – especially 
from tablets, with higher volumes absorbed 
by existing capacity. alk will continue 
to allocate significant resources to the 
execution of its portfolio and site strategy, 
which designates each production facility 
as a centre of manufacturing excellence 
and is consolidating the number of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients used across the 
portfolio. these activities – in combination 
with increased sales and efficiencies that 
come from utilising higher-volume production 
lines – are expected to lead to substantial, 
long-term margin improvements.
operating profit 
capacity costs will be influenced by a 
significant increase in r&d expenses in 
order to complete the clinical development 
of the tablet portfolio and gather further 
evidence for the tablets’ use in children, 
adolescents and to secure registrations 
in new geographies. r&d costs for 2021 
are estimated at around dkk 650 million, 
a significant increase over 2020, of which, 
approximately dkk 100 million relates to 
activities that were originally scheduled for 
2020 but were postponed due to the impact of 
covid on patient recruitment for clinical trials.
sales and marketing activities are expected 
to gradually return to normal as the impact of 
covid eases, particularly in the second half of 
the year. for the full year, costs are expected 
to rise in line with support for growth 
initiatives, although alk will continue to seek 
to leverage its existing sales and marketing 
platforms to drive margin improvement. 
on this basis, alk expects the operating profit 
(ebitda) to be in the range of dkk 325-425 
million, which is largely level with 2020's 
ebitda of dkk 395 million.
free cash flow 
free cash flow is expected to be negative, in 
the region of dkk 200-300 million. free cash 
flow will be impacted by changes in working 
capital, including a one-off repayment of up 
to dkk 175 million in accrued rebates, which 
was originally scheduled for 2020, as well 
as a deadline extension for the settlement 
of around dkk 50 million related to 2020 tax 
payments for employees in denmark. capex 
is projected at approximately dkk 300 million 
with investments focused on streamlining 
the manufacturing footprint and further 
specialisation at alk’s production facilities. 
other assumptions
the outlook does not include any revenue 
from acquisitions, new partnerships or the in-
licensing of adjacent products and services, 
nor does it include any sizeable payments 
related to m&as or in-licensing activities. the 
outlook is based on current exchange rates, 
resulting in a negative effect of approximately 
1 percentage point on reported revenue 
growth and an immaterial effect on reported 
ebitda.
forward-looking statements 
this report contains forward-looking 
statements, including forecasts of future 
revenue, operating profit and cash 
flow, as well as expected business-
related events. such statements are, 
by their very nature, subject to risks 
and uncertainties, as various factors, 
some of which are beyond the control 
of alk, may cause actual results and 
performance to differ materially from the 
forecasts made in this report. without 
being exhaustive, such factors include, 
e.g., consequences of the global covid 
pandemic, general economic and 
business-related conditions, including: 
legal issues, uncertainty relating to 
demand, pricing, reimbursement 
rules, partners’ plans and forecasts, 
fluctuations in exchange rates, 
competitive factors and reliance on 
suppliers. additional factors include 
the risks associated with the sourcing 
and manufacturing of alk’s products 
as well as the potential for side effects 
from the use of alk’s existing and future 
products, as allergy immunotherapy 
may be associated with allergic 
reactions of differing extents, durations 
and severities.

sales and market trends
revenue grew 8% organically in 
local currencies, and was in line 
with the most recent outlook, 
issued in november 2020. planned 
portfolio rationalisations reduced 
growth by around 3 percentage 
points in 2020. alk also saw an 
impact on sales from covid, 
particularly in the usa, where 
alk estimates the total value of 
missed sales exceeded dkk 100 
million.
(comparative figures for 2019 are shown 
in brackets. revenue growth rates are 
organic and stated in local currencies, unless 
otherwise indicated)
 overall revenue was dkk 3,491 million 
(3,274), which equates to organic growth of 
8% in local currencies. growth was driven by 
tablets, which is alk’s largest single product 
category, and which proved resilient to the 
effects of covid – in part due to its suitability 
as an alternative option for patients who 
were unable to continue with their usual 
treatments. tablet sales grew by 42% with 
itulazax® leading the way, while scit 
products were negatively affected by the 
impact of covid as they are administered 
during visits to allergy clinics. the covid-
effect impacted sales in the usa in particular, 
where conditions were challenging, with 
significantly fewer patients visiting allergy 
specialists. 
europe 
european revenue increased by 8% to 
dkk 2,550 million (2,368) despite some 
continuing constraints caused by covid. 
planned product discontinuations reduced 
growth by 4 percentage points, as numerous 
older scit and slit-drops products 
continued to be phased out in favour of 
documented, registered products.
revenue growth was largely fuelled by sales 
of slit-tablets, which were up 40% at dkk 
1,019 million (735). sales benefited from the 
confluence of several factors: resilience to the 
impact of covid versus alternative treatment 
options, the ongoing market shift in favour of 
evidence-based medicines, the benefits of 
an alk sales excellence programme, and the 
ongoing roll-out of itulazax®.
combined scit and slit-drops sales were 
down 9% at dkk 1,320 million (1,454). of 
this, 6 percentage points related to product 
discontinuations, as well as the fact that 
scit treatments rely on more frequent clinic 
visits, and were disproportionately affected 
by covid since patients were either unable 
or unwilling to visit clinics and, in any case, 
capacity at many clinics – particularly in 
southern europe – was significantly reduced.
sales of other products were up 18% at dkk 
211 million (179), driven by strong demand 
for the adrenaline auto-injector jext®, which 
registered 42% sales growth and market 
share gains in key markets.
overall revenue increased in most markets, 
especially germany, which delivered double-
digit growth following a significant increase 
in tablet sales with a promising performance 
by itulazax®. furthermore, alk became the 
first company in germany to offer a complete 
product range for major allergens comprised 
solely of registered ait treatments, reflecting

an ongoing market shift in favour of 
registered, evidence-based products, which 
was further facilitated by a change to the fee 
model, mitigating unintended disincentives 
for doctors to prescribe tablets. in france, 
overall sales were unchanged as growth in 
tablet sales was offset by lower slit-drops 
sales. however, alk remains the market 
leader in terms of the number of patients 
receiving treatment. meanwhile, sales in 
spain were also impacted by covid, while the 
challenging conditions in italy were further 
exacerbated.
overall, market conditions were largely 
stable, and there were no notable changes 
affecting the pricing and reimbursement of 
ait products, although the risk of pressure in 
southern europe remains.
north america 
the fallout from the covid pandemic 
made market conditions in north america 
challenging, especially in the usa, and 
suppressed sales across the portfolio. a 
major influence on this was patients’ ability 
and willingness to visit allergy clinics, while 
a further challenge came from the fact that 
many clinics were running at a reduced 
capacity. at one point, during q2, alk 
estimated that up to half of us allergy clinics 
were fully or partially closed, while those that 
were open were seeing significantly fewer 
patients.
in consequence, revenue in north america 
was down 10% organically in local currencies 
to dkk 573 million (669). this was despite 
some improvements in h2, particularly in 
sales of tablets and bulk scit products.

full-year sales of tablets in the region grew 
by 4% to dkk 85 million (85), driven by 
canada as us sales stagnated. in volume 
terms, tablet uptake in north america 
increased by 28%, but market-building 
tactics such as rebates and coupons – 
essential to establishing any new medicine in 
this region – reduced effective sales prices. 
sales of bulk allergen extracts were down 
5% at dkk 275 million (306), while sales of 
diagnostics and other products decreased 
19% to dkk 213 million (278) – mainly due 
to covid reducing sales of non-allergy 
related life science products and the use of 
pre-pen® in hospitals.
international markets 
revenue from international markets was up 
58% in local currencies at dkk 368 million 
(237) as alk’s largest markets in the region, 
japan and china, resisted and rebounded 
from covid, respectively. 
revenue in japan from product supply and 
sales royalties grew by 80%. alk’s partner 
torii continued to successfully build the 
market for tablets and miticure™ sales were 
up strongly, while sales of cedarcure™ 
were boosted by the conversion of patients 
from an outgoing legacy product. revenue 
in japan also benefited from the effects of 
stock-building by torii, which provided an 
extraordinary boost to revenue in q3 and q4. 
alk sales in china grew by 28%, while growth 
was also recorded in south-east asia, turkey, 
and israel.

covid-19:  
the defining challenge of 2020
the emergence of covid, its 
global spread, and subsequent 
measures to contain it, all had 
a significant effect on alk’s 
business in 2020. 
once the seriousness of the pandemic 
became clear, in q1, alk took immediate 
action to protect staff, and invoked 
contingency measures to safeguard business 
continuity and maintain the supply of alk 
products for doctors and their patients. as a 
result of these measures, alk’s inventories 
of both supplies and finished products 
remained robust throughout the year.
the impact on sales was greatest for those 
products that are typically delivered in an 
allergy clinical or hospital, such as scit 
products, and in specific markets, such as the 
usa, where it is estimated that the total value 
of missed sales exceeded dkk 100 million. 
outside of the usa, sales of alk’s slit-
tablets – which can be self-administered 
by patients at home – proved extremely 
resilient. meanwhile alk made good use of 
its digital engagement platforms to support 
healthcare professionals and patients.
regions where covid first took hold, such 
as china and later, europe, were the first 
to stage a market recovery, meaning that 
patients once again became able to visit 
healthcare professionals without significant 
limitations, although, in some countries 
– notably in southern europe – capacity 
was still constrained to some extent. alk’s 
working assumption is that the first half of 
2021, and especially q1, will continue to be 
somewhat impacted by covid, especially 
in relation to allergy patients’ ability and 
willingness to visit healthcare professionals. 
this is likely to continue to impact treatments 
that rely on more frequent clinic visits, while 
tablets are expected to remain resilient.
covid also had a significant effect on alk’s 
clinical development activities, particularly 
on patient recruitment which, at one point, 
was placed on hold for all trials.
continues 
alk’s covid task force
in february 2020, just a few weeks after reports began appearing of a new coronavirus 
emerging in china, alk convened the first meeting of its covid task force. its purpose 
was to anticipate and mitigate the potential consequences of the virus, should it spread 
further, and to promote global guidelines for the alk organisation on managing the 
situation, including initiatives to maintain a sense of togetherness among employees  
working from home during lockdowns.
the task force’s approach was both proactive in that it developed a wide-ranging 
contingency plan to safeguard both employees and the ongoing supply of medicines, 
and conservative in that it applied a ‘safety first’ principle to all the scenarios it 
considered. one example of this was the construction of a separate, temporary staff 
restaurant in denmark solely for the use of manufacturing staff.
the task force served a dual role in overseeing business continuity in denmark, and 
offering guidance to those coordinating contingency measures in other countries, which 
were tailored to ensure compliance with the differing local situations and regulations.
two critical successes of alk’s actions were that, despite many of its employees 
being quarantined at various times, throughout 2020, there was no uncontrolled 
chain of infections within the company and that the supply of alk's products remained 
uninterrupted throughout the year. the task force will continue to meet in 2021 until the 
threat of covid subsides.

financial review of 2020
(comparative figures for 2019 are shown 
in brackets. revenue growth rates are 
organic and stated in local currencies, unless 
otherwise indicated)
2020 revenue increased organically by 
8% in local currencies to dkk 3,491 million 
(3,274) and was negatively impacted by 
covid, predominantly in the usa. exchange 
rate fluctuations impacted reported revenue 
growth negatively by 1 percentage point. 
the divestment of the us veterinary business 
in late 2019 reduced reported growth by 
approximately 0.5 of a percentage point. 
cost of sales increased 7% organically 
in local currencies to dkk 1,463 million 
(1,382). the gross profit of dkk 2,028 
million (1,892) yielded a gross margin of 
58% (58%), and reflected changes in the 
product mix, increased sales – especially 
from tablets – but also lower sales of legacy 
products in europe and significant costs 
associated with compliance efforts to secure 
robustness in product supply, as well as 
the implementation of the product and site 
strategy. increased shipments of tablets at 
a lower gross margin to alk’s partner for 
japan lowered reported gross margin by 
approximately 1 percentage point. 
capacity costs decreased 1% in local 
currencies to dkk 1,877 million (1,922). 
r&d expenses increased by 11% in local 
currencies to dkk 515 million (466) in 
support of clinical trials, although this was 
significantly lower than expected following 
delays to clinical activities due to the covid 
pandemic. particularly affected was the 
recruitment of patients for clinical trials. 
sales and marketing expenses decreased 
organically by 5% in local currencies to dkk 
1,125 million (1,210), reflecting savings as a 
consequence of covid restricting sales and 
marketing activities in many markets, and 
operational leverage of alk’s commercial 
activities. administrative expenses 
decreased 4% in local currencies to dkk 237 
million (246).

ebitda (operating profit before 
depreciation and amortisation) increased 
64% to dkk 395 million (241) and was 
better than expected, reflecting savings 
and delayed r&d expenditure due to covid. 
exchange rates did have a small negative 
impact on operating profit. 
net financials were a loss of dkk 49 million 
(loss of 17) mainly relating to net interest 
expenses and currency fluctuations on 
intercompany loans. tax on the profit 
totalled dkk 76 million (19) and net profit 
was dkk 25 million (a loss of 50).
cash flow from operating activities was 
positive at dkk 301 million (132) mainly as 
a consequence of the increased ebitda. 
furthermore, cash flow was negatively 
impacted by changes in working capital as 
a consequence of the company’s growth 
momentum. 
cash flow from investment activities was 
dkk minus 245 million (minus 157) mainly 
relating to upgrades to legacy production 
and the build-up of capacity for slit-tablet 
production. 
free cash flow was positive at dkk 56 
million (minus 25), which was better than 
expected due to higher earnings. 
cash flow from financing activities was 
dkk minus 62 million (minus 57), mainly 
relating to minor repayments of borrowings 
and the settlement of incentive programmes.
at the end of 2020, cash and marketable 
securities totalled dkk 298 million (316). in 
addition, alk has an unused credit facility of 
dkk 600 million which runs until 2022. 
equity totalled dkk 3,153 million (3,176) at 
the end of the year, and the equity ratio was 
57% (58%).
at the end of 2020, alk held 212,873 of its

q4 review
(comparative figures for 2019 are shown

organic and stated in local currencies, unless 
otherwise indicated)
strong q4 delivers results in line  
with latest outlook
alk finished 2020 with a strong final 
quarter, registering 16% in organic revenue 
growth, fuelled by very strong tablet sales 
growth of 55% during the peak season for 
ait treatment initiations. covid continued 
to impact patients’ ability and willingness 
to visit clinics, especially in the usa and in 
selected european markets, but the overall 
impact of the pandemic was reduced.
q4 highlights
• total revenue was up 16% organically in 
local currencies at dkk 991 million (883). 
portfolio rationalisations reduced growth 
by 3 percentage points. in addition, 
reported growth was negatively impacted 
by 4 percentage points due to exchange 
rate fluctuations
• tablet sales grew by 55% to dkk 409 
million (269) with high, double-digit 
growth in all sales regions
• combined scit and slit-drops sales were 
down 2% at dkk 477 million (501)
• sales of other products declined 1% to 
dkk 105 million (113)
in europe, revenue was up 17%, driven by 
strong uptake of the tablets, for which sales 
grew 54%. combined sales of scit and 
slit-drops were down 2%, reflecting product 
discontinuations, patients switching to tablets 
and covid-related constraints on clinic visits. 
sales of other products increased 18% on 
high growth in sales of the jext® adrenaline 
auto-injector, which were up 45%. some 
general inventory stocking at wholesalers 
ahead of 2021 was observed in selected 
markets.
in north america, q4 revenue was down 
2%, which nevertheless reflected a rise in 
demand after the very challenging market 
conditions caused by covid in q2 and q3. 
tablet sales in the region were up 37%, 
while sales of bulk allergen extracts (scit) 
decreased 1%. sales of other products 
and services declined 13% on the impact 
of covid. in december, ragwitek® was

revenue from international markets grew 
by 46%, fuelled by the strong uptake of 
tablets in japan including planned, advance 
stocking by torii ahead of 2021, which 
provided an extraordinary boost to revenue 
during the quarter. 
during q4, alk saw a clear impact on its 
clinical development activities from covid. 
the anticipated new timelines for alk's key 
clinical trials are detailed below.
gross margin was 58% (58%), reflecting 
changes in the product mix, higher tablet 
sales, and increased lower-gross margin 
shipments to japan, but also significant 
costs for compliance efforts to solidify 
robustness in product supply, as well as 
the implementation of the product and site 
strategy.
capacity costs increased 11% in local 
currencies. sales and marketing expenses 
increased 7% in local currencies as alk 
increasingly focused on its digital platforms 
while covid restricted other promotional 
activities. r&d expenses increased by 21% in 
local currencies, however, covid continued to 
hinder the recruitment of patients for clinical 
trials.
ebitda of dkk 64 million (48) was in line 
with the most recent expectations, reflecting 
higher sales, as well as savings and delayed 
r&d expenditure due to covid.

strategy update
continues 
right: tablets will remain alk's primary 
growth driver for the foreseeable future and 
will be the focus of efforts to extend coverage 
to new patient groups – including children
in december 2017, alk 
announced a three-year strategic 
transformation to establish a 
broader presence in the allergy 
market and stimulate a new period 
of sustained growth.
over the past three years, the company 
has pursued a series of initiatives under 
four areas of focus: succeed in north 
america, complete and commercialise 
the tablet portfolio for all relevant ages, 
patient engagement and adjacent business 
opportunities, and optimise and reallocate 
resources towards growth initiatives.
the usa still holds considerable potential 
for alk’s tablets despite long-standing 
financial disincentives for allergists to 
prescribe these products. alk’s approach 
will be, with creativity and persistence, to 
continue establishing new and broader sales 
channels with the aim of gradually unlocking 
the potential of this market. meanwhile, 
progress on the other three priorities has 
been significant. the slit-tablets now cover 
five of the most common global respiratory 
allergies and have become alk’s growth 
engine, delivering an average growth of 
37% over the past three years (cagr). the 
company’s improved consumer engagement 
capabilities not only offer help and resources 
to millions of people with allergy, they 
also help mobilise consumers towards ait 
treatment. finally, through investments 
in quality upgrades, ongoing portfolio 
reduction and its site specialisation strategy, 
alk has taken significant steps in improving 
manufacturing quality, efficiency and 
robustness.
on the next page is a summary of what has 
been achieved in each of these focus areas.

delivering sustainable growth and 
profitability
with the transformation complete, alk is 
entering the next phase of its development. 
the challenge now is to use what has 
been achieved as the launchpad for future 
success as alk seeks to become the allergy 
company by extending its leadership in 
respiratory allergy, expanding its position 
in anaphylaxis, establishing a presence in 
food allergy, and pursuing new innovations 
through research.
the emphasis for the period 2021-23 is on 
achieving sustainable growth and increasing 
profitability following the significant 
investments made to successfully deliver the 
transformation. 
alk’s overall strategy remains unchanged, 
and is still anchored in the same four areas 
of focus, albeit with minor adjustments to 
some of the names to reflect the necessary 
steps to achieving profitability: succeed in 
north america, complete and commercialise 
the tablet portfolio, consumer engagement 
and new horizons, and finally, optimise for 
excellence.
in addition, some longer-term initiatives have 
been introduced which, as they develop, are 
designed to provide the additional impetus 
to accelerate alk towards its longer-term 
aspiration of becoming a global allergy 
leader.

how covid impacted  
the us ait market
covid made its first big impact in the usa in march 2020, when a nationwide lockdown 
was ordered after infection rates spiked. the timing coincided with the start of the spring 
allergy season which is the peak season for treatment initiations in the usa, when the 
onset of seasonal allergy symptoms usually prompts a rush to allergy clinics.
but by now, many clinics were closed, and where they remained open, patients were 
either unable or too fearful to visit them such that, during q2, in-person visits to doctors' 
offices fell by around 70% versus the same period in 2019.
this severely limited the number of new treatment initiations across alk’s portfolio since, 
even for the tablets, us labelling requires that first doses should be administered under 
medical supervision. as a result, odactra® new patient initiations fell by more than 
50% between march and may when compared with pre-covid levels. alk responded 
with a range of measures – supporting allergists by phone and online, ramping up 
direct-to-consumer communications, offering direct mail-outs of maintenance treatment 
to those already on tablets, and introducing digital tools to support customers, patients 
and its own sales organisation – so that, by q4, odactra® new patient initiations were 
exceeding those of q1.
by the end of the year, capacity in clinics had returned to around 80% of normal and 
alk reverted to a mix of traditional and virtual sales methods. despite the constrained 
capacity at clinics during 2020, alk still saw an overall year-on-year increase in tablet 
sales volumes and saw further encouraging signs in december, when odactra® 
prescription volumes substantially outpaced those from the same period in 2019.
succeeding in north america – 
and particularly the usa, which 
is the world’s largest market for 
pharmaceuticals – continues to 
be an important priority for alk, 
despite the setbacks caused by the 
covid pandemic.
alk will continue to invest in its strategy for 
north america, developing and adapting its 
platform there to mobilise allergy patients 
and deliver accelerated tablet sales, 
and securing paediatric and adolescent 
indications for acarizax®/odactra® and 
ragwitek®, as well as introducing other 
prescription allergy solutions.
central to this approach will be the further 
evolution of digital engagement tools, first 
mobilising patients to seek treatment for 
their allergies, and second, providing a 
framework that connects them with ever 
more healthcare professionals who are 
willing and able to prescribe alk products.
finally, alk will continue to maintain and 
promote its bulk allergens and other 
products that underpin its relationship with, 
and commitment to, existing customers. 
these products represent an important 
commitment to offering a full range of allergy 
products and treatment options and will 
continue to play a role in delivering value 
growth in the region for alk.

the transition towards registered 
products in germany
the ait market in germany has undergone a major transformation over the past 
decade, as a combination of key opinion leader-recommendations, tighter regulation, 
and revised rules on reimbursement and the doctors' fee structure have taken effect. 
together, these changes have resulted in a market that is now much more favourable 
for documented, registered allergy treatments, and have resulted in a reduction from 
more than 6,000 prescription ait products available in the mid-2000s, to fewer than 200 
today. 
in addition to key allergy opinion leaders, this shift has had vocal support from 
germany’s medical insurance funds, who are keen to see evidence of tangible medical 
benefits from the treatments they offer reimbursement for.
from the pharmaceutical industry’s side, alk has been a leader of the move towards 
registered treatments, from the thorough clinical documentation that accompanied 
its development of the slit-tablet portfolio, to the clinical development work it has 
undertaken in support of key legacy products. to the extent that, in july 2020, alk 
became the first company in germany to offer a complete product range for major 
allergens comprised solely of registered ait treatments, which account for more than 
90% of all ait treatments currently administered.
complete and commercialise 
the tablet portfolio for 
all relevant ages
the tablet portfolio now covers all five of the allergies that were targeted 
under this programme – house dust mite, grass, tree, ragweed and 
japanese cedar. these tablets remain alk’s core assets and further 
development will focus on consolidating and expanding the leadership 
they give alk in respiratory ait. 
to achieve this, alk will extend the reach of 
these products to cover new geographies 
and new patient groups – such as children 
and adolescents, and strengthening the 
evidence for their use in allergic asthma.
what is critical, is that each of these steps 
goes hand in hand with the ability to 
successfully commercialise each expanded 
opportunity, and to fully realise the market 
potential of these assets.

how klarify is  
connecting with consumers
in q4, in the usa, alk added a ‘speak to a doctor’ option to its klarify and branded 
digital engagement platforms, and saw more than 40,000 us consumers take its digital 
‘allergy-control’ test. this allows consumers to test whether their allergy is under control 
and offers them the option of an online consultation with a qualified allergist who can 
either issue an appropriate prescription, or refer them for a diagnosis to identify their 
specific allergy and, potentially, treatment with alk’s slit-tablets. by engaging us 
consumers in this way, and identifying those who need more help and connecting them 
with allergists, alk is connecting the dots for people suffering in silence with their allergy 
by offering them a convenient, and digitally-driven consumer journey. 
this type of service is an important way of offering personalised, professional advice 
on allergy, while helping people with allergy to navigate the often confusing path to a 
clear diagnosis and treatment. in addition, it ensures referrals are directed to allergists 
who are willing and able to prescribe the full range of allergy treatment options – from 
symptomatics, to allergy shots (scit) and, importantly for alk, slit-tablets.
while the regulations covering such offerings differ from country to country, alk is 
developing a standardised methodology that can be adapted to local requirements. for 
example, in germany, alk is offering users of klarify the option of speaking to a facilitator 
who can guide them through the process of obtaining a diagnosis and contacting a 
healthcare professional who is able to prescribe an appropriate treatment for their 
allergy.
consumer engagement 
and new horizons
over recent years, alk has 
developed a suite of digital tools 
and platforms as part of its klarify-
branded ecosystem for consumers, 
so that that those most suitable 
for ait can gain smoother access 
to a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.
over the next few years, alk will leverage 
these assets to further engage with and 
mobilise people with allergy. through this 
engagement, alk aims to not only promote 
a wider understanding of allergy, its causes 
and potential treatments, but also to more 
easily connect those suitable for treatment 
with ait with a competent healthcare 
professional who can help them.
in essence, alk aims to become better at 
clarifying the journey and hand-holding 
eligible treatment candidates along the path 
from curious consumer, to ait patient.
the previous priority of seeking adjacent 
business opportunities has been broadened 
to encompass not just business development 
and partnership opportunities, but also 
the work of alk – through its own research 
and development – to formulate and refine 
innovations outside the current respiratory 
ait niche in order to establish a broader and 
more robust presence in the wider allergy 
segment over the long term. one example 
of this is the goal of entering the us market 
with an adrenaline auto-injector that is 
both affordable and competitive, with a 
submission to the us fda no later than 2024. 
another is a platform programme to enter the 
food allergy treatment market, which is an 
area of significant unmet medical need.
finally, alk will continue to identify and 
explore the potential addition of new 
products and services to its portfolio 
through an active programme of business 
development and thorough due diligence.

driving sales excellence 
across alk
the completion of the tablet portfolio and the rationalisation of alk's legacy portfolio 
over recent years has significantly standardised the range of products sold by the 
company. by 2018, this increased standardisation allowed alk to begin an initiative – 
known internally as rise – to significantly strengthen its sales and marketing execution.
a 'better practice' analysis was carried out of the company’s approach to preparing, 
conducting, and following up on customer calls, as well as the materials used to support 
them. the results of this, together with input from external benchmarking, were used 
to create and launch a global sales and coaching model for best practice customer 
interactions. in addition, marketing tools began to be developed with this framework in 
mind, maximising the ease and impact of local adaption. behind the scenes, a digital 
ecosystem of support tools is being implemented, along with a single, global customer 
relationship management (crm) system.
all of this has resulted in improved ways of working within the sales & marketing 
organisation, and has established a more uniform approach to selling across alk, as 
well as better leveraging of tools and resources. meanwhile, alk’s staff have welcomed 
the training they receive as a valuable investment in their future. the rise model is now in 
place across europe and will be expanded to north america, russia and china in 2021.
optimise for excellence
the fourth focus area will see alk 
continue its already established 
programme of portfolio 
rationalisation, manufacturing 
site specialisation, and other 
initiatives designed to ensure 
regulatory compliance, robustness 
of supply, and to improve overall 
quality and efficiency. this 
includes an initiative to upgrade 
and safeguard alk's core legacy 
products in europe, which will 
continue.
in addition, alk will continue its work to drive 
organisational excellence and to further 
embed the cultural progress delivered by the 
transformation effort. efforts to improve the 
operational leverage of alk’s commercial 
activities will also continue.

becoming the allergy company 
will require alk to lead the way in 
many areas, not just scientifically 
and commercially, but also in the 
way it develops its people and 
organisation and in its approach to 
sustainability. 
alk’s efforts in each of the four focus areas 
will therefore be underpinned by a ‘platform’ 
which addresses organisational agility and 
sustainability. 
organisational agility initiatives will ensure 
that alk’s future growth is enabled by highly 
engaged and motivated employees who 
benefit from a strong framework of support 
for leadership and talent development. 
central to this will be alk’s cultural beliefs 
which encourage open dialogue, honest 
feedback, and strong cross-organisational 
cooperation.
in addition, a renewed commitment to 
sustainability will see alk establish a 
business model that will improve access 
to allergy care and deliver on alk’s 
wider commitments to the environment,

from ebitda to ebit for  
medium-term financial ambitions
alk will use ebit – earnings before interest and taxes – as the prime indicator of the company’s 
long-term profitability aspirations. hence, alk’s long-term financial indications for operating profit 
are stated as ebit rather than the previously applied ebitda. the change reflects an increasing 
focus on the underlying earnings generation of the company and the fact that the next phase of the 
strategy is one of stable capital expenditure.
medium-term financial ambitions 
alk's updated range of financial indicators for the next phase of its strategic development are:
• an alk capable of delivering sustainable revenue growth of 10% or more annually
• an alk capable of returning its business to profitability, and ramping up its ebit-margin 
to approximately 25% in 2025
these indications include costs for the development of food allergy immunotherapy 
solutions and new approaches to the treatment of severe allergic conditions. 
they also assume:
• a gradually improving gross margin driven by higher sales and greater efficiencies
• continued extraordinarily high r&d spend during 2021-22, after which, the spend relative to 
revenue will decrease in parallel with the completion of large-scale development work on the 
respiratory tablet portfolio
• further leveraging of alk’s existing sales and marketing platforms meaning that sales and 
marketing costs relative to revenue will further decrease
• annual capex of around dkk 300 million associated with strategic investments, maintenance, 
optimisation efforts and it 
• no revenue from acquisitions, new partnerships or the in-licensing of adjacent products and 
services has been included, nor have any sizeable payments related to m&as or in-licensing 
activities

in 2020, alk instigated a step 
change in its commitment to 
sustainability with a continuing 
focus on ensuring good health 
and well-being for all, the details 
of which were formalised in a 
strategy titled ‘access to allergy 
care for all’.
alk’s sustainability activities aim to mitigate 
risks and adverse impacts related to its 
business activities while also contributing 
to solving societal and environmental 
challenges where possible.
to support its sustainability strategy further, 
alk conducted a materiality assessment 
in 2020 to identify those aspects with 
the highest impact on its business and 
stakeholders. the assessment was based 
on a business analysis as well as input from 
relevant internal and external stakeholders, 
and it now forms the basis for target-setting 
and the prioritisation of resources.

access to medicines
the materiality assessment identified access 
to medicines, and helping as many people 
with allergy as possible, as key priorities 
for alk’s sustainability activities. over the 
years, alk’s solutions have helped many 
people around the world. however, many 
more still lack access to modern medical care 
for their allergies and related asthma.
alk aims to improve this by partnering 
with healthcare systems and professionals 
around the world, and through the wider 
democratisation and dissemination of its 
allergy solutions. this ambition covers the 
full range of alk’s research, its diagnosis, 
treatment, disease modification and 
prevention solutions, as well as its training, 
education and awareness-raising expertise. 
the ultimate goal is an introduction of allergy 
solutions earlier in the patient journey in 
order to achieve better treatment outcomes 
for ever more people, wherever they may be.
at the same time, alk remains committed 
to the un global compact principles and 
contributes to addressing 11 of the un 
sustainable development goals. 
policies and guidelines
alk has various policies and guidelines 
in place to ensure its everyday activities 
support the commitments it has made. 
these include policies on sustainability, 
environment, health and safety (ehs), tax, 
diversity, investor relations, remuneration, as 
well as anti-corruption and bribery policies. 
these policies guide alk’s overall approach 
to integrating sustainability considerations 
into its overall business operations and, as 
such, contribute to ongoing improvements 
in the areas of environment and climate, 
labour rights, human rights and responsible 
business practices. 
in addition, alk’s code of conduct outlines 
the company’s expectations when it comes to 
professionalism, honesty and integrity. every 
alk manager is tasked with ensuring that 
each employee is familiar with the code and 
its importance. furthermore, all employees 
are required to read and sign off on their 
commitment to it every year, and to complete 
an online training programme covering 
various aspects of the code.
alk’s statutory annual report on 
sustainability and the gender diversity 
of management (as required by §99a, 
§99b and §107d of the danish financial 
statements act) is available at www.alk.net/
sustainability. this report also highlights 
important actions taken in 2020 to support 
the un sustainable development goals.

corporate governance
alk’s statutory corporate governance 
statement for the financial year 2020, 
pursuant to section 107b of the danish 
financial statement act, is available at 
https://ir.alk.net/financial-reporting/risk-
management.
the statement provides a detailed account of 
alk’s management structure, including the 
board of directors’ composition, activities, 
remuneration and self-assessment. the 
statement furthermore describes key 
elements of alk’s internal controls and risk 
management systems relating to financial 
reporting processes.
as a listed company, alk is subject to the 
recommendations of the danish committee 
on corporate governance. alk fulfils this 
obligation either by complying with its 
recommendations or by explaining the 
reason for non-compliance. alk complies 
with 45 of the 47 recommendations. the 
exceptions in 2020 being that there was an 
overweight of non-independent directors 
on the board (three out of five) and that the 
majority of members of the audit committee 
and remuneration committee were non-
independent.
the board has proposed establishing an 
adequate balance between independent 
and non-independent directors in 2021 by 
nominating two new, independent members 
to the board of directors, thus increasing the 
number of shareholder-elected members to 
seven. if the nominations are approved at the 
annual general meeting on 18 march 2021, 
the majority of the shareholder-elected 
members will be independent. 
for the audit and remuneration committees, 
alk took an approach of selecting the best 
possible options in terms of experience and 
capabilities.

shareholder information
the aim is that the share price should offer 
a fair representation of alk and reflect the 
company’s actual and expected ability to 
create shareholder value. alk would further 
like the share to be liquid and to have a sound 
foundation, allowing for fair pricing and 
trading in the share.
ownership
the total share capital is divided into a 
shares, aa shares and b shares (cf. core 
data table on the previous page). the a 
shares and aa shares are not listed and 
are predominantly held by the lundbeck 
foundation, while all b shares are listed and 
freely negotiable. at the end of 2020, alk 
had 17,697 registered shareholders, versus 
12,979 at the end of 2019. the registered 
shareholders owned 98% of the share 
capital (98%). as at 31 december 2020, two 
shareholders had notified shareholdings of 
5% or more: the lundbeck foundation had 
a 40.3% interest (including a shares and aa 
shares) and atp had a 7.5% interest. of the 
30 largest registered shareholders, the vast 
majority were institutional investors – from 
north america, the uk and scandinavia in 
particular. in the shareholder register, the 
international ownership was estimated at 
approximately 23% (23%), representing 36% 
of the free float of the b share capital (36%), 
excluding the lundbeck foundation’s holding 
and treasury shares.
alk’s holding of its own shares was reduced 
following the settlement of share option and 
conditional share programmes. at the end 
of the year, alk held 212,873 or 1.9% of its 
own shares (2.2% at the end of 2019) which 
is considered sufficient to cover current 
obligations related to alk’s long-term 
incentive programmes.
return and liquidity
alk aims to provide long-term shareholder 
return through an increased share price, the 
paying-out of dividends, and the purchase of 
its own shares. at the end of 2019, the share 
price was dkk 1,635 and the share closed 
2020 at dkk 2,500. the daily trading liquidity 
improved further during 2020 and averaged 
dkk 31 million (20).
dividend and capital structure
the board of directors considers that alk’s 
financial resources, including credit facilities, 
still constitute a sufficient financial basis 
for implementing the next stage of alk’s 
strategy. in support of the strategy, the board 
of directors is extending its recommendation 
that dividend payments be temporarily 
suspended until business profitability 
improves further. in line with this decision, at 
the annual general meeting in march 2021, 
the board of directors will propose that no 
dividend be declared.
the board of directors will revisit the dividend 
policy and alk’s capital structure on an 
ongoing basis during the next phase of the 
strategy.

risk management
alk’s board of management 
is responsible for the ongoing 
management of risks throughout 
the value chain, including risk 
mapping, the assessment of 
probabilities and potential 
consequences, and the 
introduction of risk-reducing 
measures.
the board of management has established 
a risk committee to assist it in meeting its 
overall responsibility for risk management. 
the risk committee comprises 
representatives from each functional area 
relevant to alk’s risk profile. it meets twice 
a year or more, as required, to perform its 
tasks. risks are systematically assessed 
according to a two-dimensional matrix, 
rating the impact and probability of each 
risk. a risk management report with key 
risks and recommended mitigation plans is 
presented to board of management before it 
is submitted to the board of directors on an 
annual basis for their review and approval.

production and sub-supplier issues  
impacting product supply
description
alk has concentrated its key in-house production capacity at 
plants in denmark, france, spain and the usa. although the plants 
are located in areas that have not historically been hit by natural 
disasters, this geographical spread calls for risk planning in order to 
avoid emergencies, such as lack of, or poor access to raw materials: 
for instance, pollen.
as alk works to rationalise its portfolio, there may be risks 
associated with the discontinuation of its products. among others, 
these may include potential disruption at manufacturing sites during 
decommissioning work, the loss of sales from products for which no 
suitable alk substitute product exists, or the inability to meet sudden 
spikes in demand for other products due to patients switching from 
discontinued products.
dependency on third parties for supplying input for key production 
processes and commercialising the company’s products in several 
markets entails risks that alk would not be subject to if the company 
possessed the necessary in-house capabilities.
risk mitigation
alk conducts risk planning including for the prevention of unwanted 
events, and preventative inventory management, such as the build-
up of contingency stocks in order to ensure an unbroken chain of 
production and supply.
alk’s production processes and quality standards have been 
developed and optimised over many years. alk has invested 
significantly to increase the robustness and compliance of the legacy 
business by reducing manufacturing complexity, and all possible 
steps are taken during portfolio rationalisation work to mitigate 
any potential impact on other areas of manufacturing or the wider 
business.
alk manages third party dependency risks through contractual 
stipulations, planning, monitoring, and joint steering committees.
quality issues impacting  
patient safety and product supply
description
alk’s products are subject to a large number of statutory and 
regulatory requirements with respect to issues such as safety, 
efficacy and production.
meeting high product quality standards is a prerequisite for the 
company’s ability to supply products and hence its competitive 
strength.
alk’s products may be associated with allergic reactions of varying 
extents, durations and severities. if such events occur in unexpected 
situations, they may have an impact on the company’s earnings and 
sales.
risk mitigation
production and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic and 
routine inspections by regulatory authorities as a regular part of their 
monitoring processes to ensure that alk observes the prescribed 
requirements and standards.
alk stringently monitors product quality and safety, both in clinical 
development and in sales and marketing activities. if, despite the 
high levels of quality and safety, a situation should occur in which it is 
necessary to recall a product, alk has procedures in place to ensure 
that this can be managed swiftly and effectively and in accordance 
with regulatory requirements.

competition becoming  
more intense
description
alk operates in competitive markets. if, for 
instance, a competitor were to launch a new and 
more effective treatment for allergy, it may have 
a material impact on alk’s sales. a competitive 
market may also lead to market-driven price 
reductions just as national and regional authorities 
may mandate price reductions. equally, there 
may be circumstances that prevent planned price 
increases, with a consequent impact on revenue. 
both competition and pricing risks may have a 
material impact on alk’s ability to achieve its long-
term goals.
risk mitigation
alk’s scientific committee monitors the competitor 
landscape in global ait research and development 
to ensure a timely response to developments by 
competitors or in the market. as a consequence, 
and to stay ahead of competition, alk monitors 
economic, market and regulatory developments 
as they relate to product pricing, along with 
the competitive situation and initiatives in all 
important markets with the aim of appropriate risk 
mitigation.
continues 
failures or delays in  
product development
description
the future success of alk depends on the 
company’s ability to maintain current products 
and to successfully identify, develop and market 
new, innovative drugs, which involves significant 
risks.
a pharmaceutical drug must be subjected to 
extensive and lengthy clinical trials to document 
qualities such as safety and efficacy before 
it can be approved for marketing. during the 
development process, the outcomes of these 
trials are subject to significant risks. even 
though substantial resources are invested in the 
development process, the trials may produce 
negative results.
failures or delays in the development process or in 
obtaining regulatory approvals may have a major 
impact for the patients not being able to benefit 
from the products and on the ability of alk to 
achieve its long-term goals.
risk mitigation
alk and its collaborative partners perform 
thorough risk assessments of their research 
and development programmes throughout the 
development and registration processes with 
the objective of risk mitigation to optimise the 
likelihood of the products reaching the market.
alk’s scientific committee is responsible for other 
patient-/product-related innovation activities. 
the committee advises on matters relating to r&d 
activities and other patient-/product-related 
innovation activities, including reviewing r&d 
programmes and the overall r&d pipeline.
tablets not gaining market  
acceptance 
description
if alk and its partners succeed in developing new 
products and obtaining regulatory approvals for 
them, the ability to generate revenue depends 
on the products being accepted by doctors and 
patients.
the degree of market acceptance for a new 
product or drug candidate depends on several 
factors, including the demonstration of 
clinical efficacy and safety, cost-effectiveness, 
convenience and ease of administration, potential 
advantages over alternative treatment methods, 
competition, and marketing and distribution 
support. 
if alk’s new products, primarily tablets, fail to 
achieve market acceptance, this could have a 
significant influence on the company’s ability to 
generate revenue. even if market acceptance of 
the tablets is successfully achieved, the extent of 
their acceptance could influence the company’s 
ability to fully deliver on its sales -growth targets 
for these products.
risk mitigation
alk regularly conducts extensive surveys of 
market conditions and similar factors and commits 
significant resources to providing information on 
its products to doctors and patients. sales growth 
targets are set with a full understanding of the 
potential risks involved in successfully marketing 
any product and these are anticipated and 
managed so far as is possible.
authorities introducing  
new pricing pressures
description
in most of the countries in which alk operates, 
prescription drugs are subject to reimbursement 
from, and price controls by, national authorities 
and healthcare providers. this often results in 
significant price differences between individual 
markets. regulatory requirements and 
interventions, as well as price control measures, 
may therefore have a significant impact on the 
company’s earnings capacity.
exceptionally, governments and national 
authorities may introduce economic measures 
that also affect the pricing and reimbursement of 
medicines, for example, as a consequence of the 
impact of covid on healthcare budgets or as a 
result of a major economic downturn.
risk mitigation
alk is strongly committed to evidenced-based 
medicine, based on strong clinical and health 
economic evidence as the basis for pricing and 
reimbursement. alk actively engages in dialogue 
with authorities with the aim of securing fair 
pricing and reimbursement agreements and 
maintains a strong focus on its market access 
strategy.

fluctuations in exchange rates and 
interest rates
description
due to the nature of its operations, investments 
and financing, alk is exposed to fluctuations in 
exchange rates and interest rates, which could 
impact the company’s cash flow and earnings.
risk mitigation
the company’s financial risks are managed 
centrally, based on policies approved by the 
board of directors. the objective of alk’s financial 
risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of 
earnings to fluctuations in exchange rates, interest 
rates, liquidity and changes in credit rating. 
company policy is to refrain from active financial 
speculation. 
see note 25 of this annual report for a specification 
of the company’s exposure to currency, interest 
rate and credit risks and its use of derivative 
financial instruments.
it security breaches impacting 
business continuity
description
disruption to it systems, such as breaches of 
data security, may occur across the global value 
chain, where well-functioning it systems and 
infrastructure are critical for the company’s ability 
to operate effectively.
risk mitigation
alk manages this risk, among other ways, by 
having a security strategy in place to prevent 
intruders from causing damage to systems or 
gaining access to critical data and systems. 
awareness campaigns, access controls, intrusion 
detection and prevention systems have all 
been implemented, and systems are regularly 
upgraded to increase network security.
breaches of legal or  
ethical standards
description
non-compliance with applicable regulations, 
legislation, or alk’s code of conduct could 
negatively affect the company’s good reputation 
which is essential for operating within the 
pharmaceutical industry.
patents and other intellectual property rights are 
important for developing and retaining alk’s 
competitive strength.
risk mitigation
alk strives to act professionally, honestly, and with 
high integrity throughout the company in relation 
to stakeholders. alk’s code of conduct defines 
alk’s high standard of ethical behaviour in relation 
to customers, employees, shareholders, society, 
suppliers and partners. immediate action is taken 
on substantiated non-compliance. annually, all 
employees are asked to sign and confirm their 
knowledge of the code of conduct and to take an 
online test. 
internal controls and policies are in place to 
safeguard alk’s intellectual property rights. the 
risk that alk might infringe patents or trademark 
rights held by other companies, as well as the 
risk that other companies may attempt to infringe 
the patents and/or trademark rights of alk are 
monitored and, if necessary, suitable measures 
are taken.

remuneration  
report 2020
remuneration 
alk’s remuneration policy was 
prepared in accordance with 
the danish companies act and 
approved by shareholders at 
the annual general meeting 
in 2020. the remuneration 
policy replaced the previous 
remuneration guidelines and 
guidelines for incentive pay, and 
governs the remuneration for the 
board of directors and board of 
management. 
the overall aim of the remuneration 
policy is to outline the overall framework 
for remuneration at alk and to provide 
shareholders with a clear, understandable 
and comprehensive overview of the 
remuneration provided by alk. the 
objectives of the remuneration policy are to: 
• attract, motivate and retain qualified 
members of the board of directors and 
board of management
• align the remuneration components to the 
interests of shareholders
• contribute to promoting value creation 
at alk and to support alk’s business 
strategy 
• ensure that the remuneration of individual 
members of board of management reflect 
the company's performance as well as 
individual results
in 2020, the remuneration for the board of 
directors and board of management followed 
the structure and principles outlined in the 
remuneration policy. 
alk has prepared a separate report that 
describes remuneration for the board 
of directors and board of management 
in more detail. the remuneration report 
provides an overview of the components in

report on the audit of  
the financial statements
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the 
group’s financial position at 31 december 
2020 and of the results of the group’s 
operations and cash flows for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act.
moreover, in our opinion, the parent 
company financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the parent company’s 
financial position at 31 december 2020 
and of the results of the parent company’s 
operations for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 in accordance with the 
danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s 
long-form report to the audit committee and 
the board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements 
of alk-abelló a/s for the financial year 
1 january to 31 december 2020 which 
comprise income statement, balance sheet, 
statement of changes in equity and notes, 
including summary of significant accounting 
policies for the group as well as for the parent 
company  and statement of comprehensive 
income and cash flow statement for the 
group. 
collectively referred to as the “financial 
statements”. 
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) 
and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report.  
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
independent auditor’s reports 
independence
we are independent of the group in 
accordance with the international ethics 
standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba 
code) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. we have also 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the iesba code.  
to the best of our knowledge and belief, 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 
were not provided. 
appointment
we were appointed auditors of alk-abelló 
a/s for the first time on 11 march 2020 for the 
financial year 2020.  
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

statements - auditor
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
valuation of inventories
inventories of the group comprise raw materials, work in progress 
and manufactured goods and goods for resale.
inventories are measured at cost determined under the fifo method 
or net realisable value where this is lower. 
the valuation is based on a costing model, which includes a number 
of significant accounting judgements and estimates related to 
allocation of indirect production costs, including capacity utilisation, 
and the model for eliminating unrealised internal profit in the 
consolidated financial statements.
we focused on this area as the amounts involved are material and 
as the valuation is associated with significant accounting estimates 
and judgements. this includes the complex models for indirect 
production costs and eliminating unrealised internal profits and 
the assumptions used for measuring indirect production costs and 
unrealised internal profits.
we refer to notes 2 and 15 in the consolidated financial statements.
 
we evaluated and discussed inventory accounting policy with 
management. 
we evaluated related application and monitoring controls. 
we selected a sample and tested the costing model for allocation 
of indirect production costs and analysed the allocation of indirect 
production costs between the group’s products. 
we selected a sample and tested product cost prices, including tests 
of raw material prices and allocated indirect production costs.
we assessed and challenged management’s assumptions and 
judgements related to the allocation of indirect production costs, 
including capacity utilisation, and the assumptions used in 
eliminating unrealised internal profit. 
furthermore, we tested the group’s model for eliminating unrealised 
internal profit in the consolidated financial statements.
we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosure provided 
in the consolidated financial statements.
valuation of deferred tax assets
a significant part of the recognised deferred tax assets relates to tax 
losses carried forward in denmark. 
utilisation of the recognised deferred tax assets is depending on 
the expected future taxable income within the danish joint taxation 
group with the lundbeck foundation and its other subsidiaries. 
we focused on this area as the amounts involved are material and 
as the valuation of deferred tax assets is associated with significant 
accounting estimates and judgements. this includes the estimation 
uncertainty regarding assessing the future taxable profits in alk-
abelló a/s and within the danish joint taxation group. 
we refer to notes 2, 9 and 14 in the consolidated financial 
statements.
 
we assessed the method applied by management for calculating the 
deferred tax assets and assessing its valuation. 
we tested the calculation of the deferred tax assets prepared by 
management and involved our internal tax specialist in assessing 
the tax calculation to ensure compliance with relevant tax legislation.
we evaluated and challenged the documentation prepared 
by management regarding the deferred tax asset, including 
management’s best estimate of the probability of realising the 
future taxable profits in denmark and within the joint danish taxation 
group, including sensitivity and risk analysis. 
we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosure provided 
in the consolidated financial statements.
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for 
management’s review, pages 1-46, and 
page 97.
our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover management’s review, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
management’s review and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review 
is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether 
management’s review includes the 
disclosures required by the danish financial 
statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, 
in our view, management’s review is in 
accordance with the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company 
financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
danish financial statements act. we did 
not identify any material misstatement in 
management’s review.

management’s responsibilities for 
the financial statements
management is responsible for the 
preparation of consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act and for the 
preparation of parent company financial 
statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing 
the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
• identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal 
control relevant to the audit in order 
to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the group’s and the 
parent company’s internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by 
management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. however, 
future events or conditions may cause the 
group or the parent company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, 
structure and content of the financial 
statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance 
of the group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged 
with governance regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we 
have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

report on compliance with 
the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial 
statements we performed procedures to 
express an opinion on whether the annual 
report of alk-abelló a/s for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the 
filename alk-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, 
in all material respects, in compliance with 
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic 
format (esef regulation) which includes 
requirements related to the preparation 
of the annual report in xhtml format and 
ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements.
management is responsible for preparing 
an annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation. this responsibility includes:
• the preparing of the annual report in 
xhtml format;
• the selection and application of 
appropriate ixbrl tags, including 
extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the 
taxonomy, for all financial information 
required to be tagged using judgement 
where necessary;
• ensuring consistency between ixbrl 
tagged data and the consolidated 
financial statements presented in human-
readable format; and
• for such internal control as management 
determines necessary to enable the 
preparation of an annual report that is 
compliant with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable 
assurance on whether the annual report 
is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation based 
on the evidence we have obtained, and to 
issue a report that includes our opinion. 
the nature, timing and extent of procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of 
material departures from the requirements 
set out in the esef regulation, whether due to 
fraud or error. the procedures include:
• testing whether the annual report is 
prepared in xhtml format;
• obtaining an understanding of the 
company’s ixbrl tagging process and of 
internal control over the tagging process; 
• evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements;
• evaluating the appropriateness of the 
company’s use of ixbrl elements selected 
from the esef taxonomy and the creation 
of extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been 
identified; 
• evaluating the use of anchoring of 
extension elements to elements in the 
esef taxonomy; and
• reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with 
the audited consolidated financial 
statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of alk-
abelló a/s for the financial year 1 january to 
31 december 2020 with the file name alk-
2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 accounting policies
general
the consolidated financial statements for the 
period 1 january to 31 december 2020 have been 
prepared in accordance with the international 
financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted 
by the eu and in accordance with danish disclosure 
requirements for listed companies. additional 
danish disclosure requirements for annual reports 
are imposed by the statutory order on adoption of 
ifrs issued under the danish financial statements 
act.
the consolidated financial statements are 
presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is 
considered the primary currency of the alk group’s 
activities and the functional currency of the parent 
company.
the consolidated financial statements are 
presented on a historical cost basis, apart from 
certain financial instruments, which are measured 
at fair value. otherwise, the accounting policies are 
as described below.
the accounting policies are unchanged from last 
year except for the below mentioned.
new standards effective from 1 january 2020
the alk group has implemented all new and 
amended standards and interpretations (ifric) 
which are effective for the financial year 2020. this 
has not resulted in any changes to the accounting 
policies of the alk group.
new standards effective after 1 january 2021
a number of ifrs standards, amended standards 
and ifric interpretations, which are effective on or 
after 1 january 2021, have not been implemented. 
based on a preliminary assessment it is estimated 
that these standards and interpretations will have 
no material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements for 2020 and in the coming years.
the consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise 
the financial statements of alk-abelló a/s (the 
parent company) and companies (subsidiaries) 
controlled by the parent company. the parent 
company is considered to control a subsidiary 
when it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% 
of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise 
or actually exercises a controlling influence, and 
has the right to variable returns from the entity.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared based on the financial statements 
of alk-abelló a/s and its subsidiaries. the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared 
as a consolidation of items of a uniform nature. 
the financial statements used for consolidation 
are prepared in accordance with the alk group’s 
accounting policies.
on consolidation, intra-group income and 
expenses, intra-group balances and dividends, 
and gains and losses arising on intra-group 
transactions are eliminated.
business combinations
newly acquired or newly established companies 
or operations are recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date of acquisition or 
establishment. the date of acquisition is the date 
when control of the company actually passes to the 
alk group. companies sold or discontinued are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement 
up to the date of disposal. the date of disposal 
is the date when control of the company actually 
passes to a third party.
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase 
method, according to which the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of companies 
acquired are measured at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. however, non-current assets held for 
sale are measured at fair value less expected costs 
to sell.
restructuring costs are only recognised in the 
takeover balance sheet if they represent a 
liability to the acquired company. the tax effect of 
revaluations is taken into account.
the cost of a company is the fair value of the 
consideration paid. if the final determination of the 
consideration is conditional on one or more future 
events, these are recognised at their fair value as 
of the acquisition date.
costs that can be attributed directly to the transfer 
of ownership are recognised in the income 
statement when they are incurred. as a general 
rule, adjustments to estimates of conditional 
consideration are recognised directly to the income 
statement.
if the fair value of the acquired assets or liabilities 
subsequently proves different from the values 
calculated at the acquisition date, cost is adjusted 
for up to 12 months after the date of acquisition. 
any excess of the cost of an acquired company over 
the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities (goodwill) is recognised as 
an asset under intangible assets and tested for 
impairment at least once a year.
gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries
gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries are 
stated as the difference between the disposal 
amount and the carrying amount of net assets 
including goodwill at the date of disposal, 
accumulated foreign exchange adjustments 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and 
anticipated disposal costs. the disposal amount 
is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received.
foreign currency translation
on initial recognition, transactions denominated 
in currencies other than dkk are translated 
at average exchange rates, which are an 
approximation of the exchange rates at the 
transaction date. receivables and debt and other 
monetary items not settled at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the closing rate.
exchange rate differences between the exchange 
rate at the date of the transaction and the exchange 
rate at the date of payment or the balance sheet 
date, respectively, are recognised in the income 
statement under financial items. tangible assets 
and intangible assets, inventories and other 
nonmonetary assets acquired in foreign currency 
and measured based on historical cost are 
translated at the exchange rates at the transaction 
date.
on recognition in the consolidated financial 
statements of subsidiaries whose financial 
statements are presented in a functional currency 
other than dkk, the income statements are 
translated at average exchange rates for the 
respective months, unless these deviate materially 
from the actual exchange rates at the transaction 
dates. in that case, the actual exchange rates are 
used. balance sheet items are translated at the 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. goodwill 
is considered to belong to the acquired company in 
question and is translated at the exchange rate at 
the balance sheet date.
exchange rate differences arising on the translation 
of foreign subsidiaries’ opening balance sheet 
58
consolidated financial statements • annual report 2020 • alk
financon - note 01
notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 accounting policies – continued
items to the exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and on the translation of the income 
statements from average exchange rates to 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
foreign exchange rate adjustment of receivables 
or debt to subsidiaries which are considered part 
of the parent company’s overall investment in 
the subsidiary in question are also recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the consolidated 
financial statements.
share-based incentive plans
share-based incentive plans (equity-settled share-
based payments), which comprise share options 
and performance share units, are measured at 
the grant date at fair value and recognised in the 
income statement under the respective functions 
over the vesting period and offset in equity.
the fair value of share options is determined 
using the black & scholes model. the fair value of 
performance share units is determined using the 
average share price (closing) 5 days after annual 
general meeting.
the alk group settles the equity-settled share-
based incentive plans in shares. however, the 
share option agreement entitles the alk group 
to demand cash settlement of the options. the 
alk group recognises share options, in case of 
cash settlement, as other liabilities and adjusts 
to fair value as from the time when the alk group 
has an obligation to settle in cash. the alk group 
recognises subsequent adjustment to fair value in 
the income statement under financial income or 
financial expenses.
tax
tax on the profit for the year comprises the year’s 
current tax and changes in deferred tax. the tax 
expense relating to the profit/loss for the year 
is recognised in the income statement, and the 
tax expense relating to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income and directly in equity, 
respectively, is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. exchange rate 
adjustments of deferred tax are recognised as part 
of the adjustment of deferred tax for the year.
current tax payable and receivable is recognised 
in the balance sheet as the expected tax on the 
taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax paid 
on account.
the current tax charge for the year is calculated 
based on the tax rates and rules enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
uncertain tax position is recognised for those 
matters for which the tax determination is uncertain 
but it is considered probable that there will be a 
future outflow of funds to a tax authority (and a 
future inflow of funds from a tax authority). the 
uncertain tax positions are measured at the best 
estimate of the amount expected to become 
payable (and receivable).
deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet 
liability method on all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount and the tax base 
of assets and liabilities. however, deferred tax is 
not recognised on temporary differences relating 
to the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial 
recognition of a transaction, apart from business 
combinations, and where the temporary difference 
existing at the date of initial recognition affects 
neither profit/loss for the year nor taxable income. 
deferred tax is calculated based on the planned 
use of each asset and settlement of each liability, 
respectively. deferred tax is measured using the 
tax rates and tax rules that, based on legislation 
enacted or in reality enacted at the balance sheet 
date, are expected to apply in the respective 
countries when the deferred tax is expected to 
crystallise as current tax. changes in deferred 
tax as a result of changed tax rates or rules are 
recognised in the income statement, in other 
comprehensive income or in equity, depending on 
where the deferred tax was originally recognised. 
deferred tax related to equity transactions is 
recognised in equity.
deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax 
loss carry-forwards, are recognised in the balance 
sheet at the value at which the asset is expected 
to be realised, either through a set-off against 
deferred tax liabilities or as net assets to be offset 
against future positive taxable income. deferred 
tax assets including the tax value of tax losses are 
recognised if it is probable that it can be utilised 
against future taxable income within a foreseeable 
future (5 years). this includes an assessment of the 
possibilities to utilise tax losses in the joint danish 
taxation scheme with the lundbeck foundation 
(lundbeckfond invest a/s). 
at each balance sheet date, it is reassessed 
whether it is likely that there will be sufficient future 
taxable income for the deferred tax asset to be 
utilised.
the parent company is included in a joint danish 
taxation scheme with the lundbeck foundation 
(lundbeckfond invest a/s) and its danish 
subsidiaries. the tax charge for the year is 
allocated among the jointly taxed companies in 
proportion to the taxable incomes of individual 
companies, taking into account taxes paid.
income statement
revenue
the primary performance obligation of the alk 
group is the sale and delivery of own-manufactured 
goods and goods for resale for allergy treatment. 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the 
income statement upon the control of the goods 
being transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods 
are delivered. revenue is recognised by the alk 
group at a point in time. 
the alk group's customers have payment terms 
that reflect the customer type and the market in 
which sales take place, which typically varies from 
0 to 180 days.
revenue is measured as the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable.
revenue is measured exclusive of vat, taxes etc. 
charged on behalf of third parties and less any 
commissions and discounts in connection with 
sales.
furthermore, revenue includes licence income 
and royalties from outlicensed products as well 
as up-front payments, milestone payments and 
services in connection with partnerships. these 
revenues are recognised in the income statement 
in accordance with the agreements and when the 
alk group obtains the right to the payments, which 
is at the point in time the subsequent sales occur or 
services have been delivered to the customer. 
nonrefundable payments that are not attributable 
to subsequent research and development activities 
are recognised when the related right is obtained, 
whereas payments attributable to subsequent 
research and development activities are 
recognised over the term of the activities. 
when combined contracts are entered into, the 
elements of the contracts are identified and 
assessed separately for accounting purposes.
cost of sales
the item comprises cost of sales and production 
costs incurred in generating the revenue for the 
59
consolidated financial statements • annual report 2020 • alk
notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 accounting policies – continued
year. costs for raw materials, consumables, goods 
for resale, production staff and a proportion of 
production overheads, including maintenance 
and depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
of tangible assets and intangible assets used in 
production as well as operation, administration 
and management of factories are recognised in 
cost of sales and production costs. in addition, the 
costs and write-down to net realisable value of 
obsolete and slow-moving goods are recognised.
research and development expenses
the item comprises research and development 
expenses, including expenses incurred for 
wages and salaries, amortisation, impairment 
of capitalised development projects in progress, 
and other overheads as well as costs relating 
to research partnerships. research expenses 
are recognised in the income statement when 
incurred. due to the long development periods 
and significant uncertainties in relation to 
the development of new products, including 
risks regarding clinical trials and regulatory 
approvals, it is the assessment that most of the 
alk group’s development expenses do not meet 
the capitalisation criteria in ias 38, intangible 
assets. consequently, development expenses 
are generally recognised in the income statement 
when incurred. development expenses relating to 
individual minor development projects running for 
short-term periods and subject to limited risk are 
capitalised under other intangible assets.
sales and marketing expenses
the item comprises selling and marketing 
expenses, including salaries and expenses 
relating to sales staff, advertising and exhibitions, 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses 
on tangible assets and intangible assets used in 
the sales and marketing process as well as other 
indirect costs.
administrative expenses
the item comprises expenses incurred for 
management and administration, including 
expenses for administrative staff and 
management, office expenses and depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment losses on 
tangible assets and intangible assets used in 
administration.
other operating items
other operating items comprise income and 
expenses of a secondary nature relative to the 
principal activities of the alk group.
financial items
financial items comprise interest receivable 
and interest payable, the interest element of 
lease payments, realised and unrealised gains 
and losses on securities, cash and marketable 
securities, liabilities and foreign currency 
transactions, mortgage amortisation premium/
allowance etc. and supplements/provisions under 
the on-account tax scheme. 
interest expenses and income related to uncertain 
tax positions are recognised on the balance sheet 
as tax liabilities and tax assets respectively upon 
the receipt of ruling from the tax authorities and 
correspondingly reflected in the income statement 
as financial items net.
interest income and expenses are accrued based 
on the principal and the effective rate of interest. 
the effective rate of interest is the discount rate to 
be used on discounting expected future payments 
in relation to the financial asset or the financial 
liability so that their present value corresponds 
to the carrying amount of the asset or liability, 
respectively.
balance sheet
goodwill
on initial recognition, goodwill is measured and 
recognised as the excess of the cost of the acquired 
company over the fair value of the acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities, as described 
under ‘business combinations’.
on recognition of goodwill, the goodwill amount is 
allocated to those of the alk group’s activities that 
generate separate cash flows (cash-generating 
units). the determination of cash-generating units 
is based on the alk group’s management structure 
and internal financial management and reporting.
goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for 
impairment at least once a year, as described 
below.
intangible assets
acquired intellectual property rights in the form 
of patents, brands, licenses, software, customer 
base and similar rights are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment.
interest expenses on loans to finance the 
development of intangible assets are included 
in cost if they relate to the production period. 
other borrowing costs are charged to the income 
statement.
the cost of software includes costs of instalment 
and direct salaries.
such acquired intellectual property rights are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful lives of the assets, typically 
not exceeding 10 years. if the actual useful life 
is shorter than either the remaining life or the 
contract period, the asset is amortised over this 
shorter useful life. acquired intellectual property 
rights are written down to their recoverable amount 
where this is lower than the carrying amount, as 
described below.
individual minor development projects running for 
short-term periods which fulfil the requirement in 
ifrs are capitalised under other intangible assets 
as described under ‘research and development 
expenses’ and are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment.
intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives 
are not amortised, but are tested for impairment 
at least once a year. to the extent that the carrying 
amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable 
amount, the assets are written down to this lower 
amount, as described below.
tangible assets
land and buildings, plant and machinery and other 
fixtures and equipment are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. land is 
not depreciated.
cost comprises the purchase price and any costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition and any 
preparation costs incurred until the date when the 
asset is available for use.
lease assets are recognised at the commencement 
date of the contract if it is or contains a lease. lease 
assets are recognised at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. cost is defined as 
the lease lia bility adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date. lease 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
interest expenses on loans to finance the 
manufacture of tangible assets are included in

cost if they relate to the production period. other 
borrowing costs are recognised in the income 
statement.
the depreciation base is cost less the estimated 
residual value at the end of the useful life. the 
residual value, estimated at the acquisition date 
and reassessed annually, is determined as the 
amount the company expects to obtain for the asset 
less costs of disposal.
the cost of an asset is divided into smaller 
components that are depreciated separately if 
such components have different useful lives.
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives as follows:
buildings  
25-50 years
plant and machinery  
5-10 years
other fixtures and equipment 
5-10 years
depreciation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reassessed once a year. tangible assets 
are written down to the recoverable amount, if 
lower, as described below.
impairment of tangible assets and intangible 
assets
the carrying amounts of tangible assets and 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are 
reviewed at the balance sheet date to determine 
whether there are any indications of impairment. 
if such indications are found, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is calculated to determine 
any need for an impairment write-down and, if 
so, the amount of the write-down. for intangible 
assets with indeterminable useful lives and 
goodwill, the recoverable amount is calculated 
annually, regardless of whether any indications of 
impairment have been found.
if the asset does not generate any cash flows 
independently of other assets, the recoverable 
amount is calculated for the smallest cash-
generating unit that includes the asset.
the recoverable amount is calculated as the higher 
of the fair value less costs to sell and the value 
in use of the asset or the cash-generating unit, 
respectively. in determining the value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value, using a discount rate reflecting 
current market assessments of the time value of 
money as well as risks that are specific to the asset 
or the cash-generating unit and which have not 
been taken into account in the estimated future 
cash flows.
if the recoverable amount of the asset or the 
cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying 
amount, the carrying amount is written down to the 
recoverable amount. for cash-generating units, the 
write-down is allocated in such a way that goodwill 
amounts are written down first, and any remaining 
need for write-down is allocated to other assets in 
the unit, although no individual assets are written 
down to a value lower than their fair value less 
costs to sell.
impairment write-downs are recognised in the 
income statement. if write-downs are subsequently 
reversed as a result of changes in the assumptions 
on which the calculation of the recoverable amount 
is based, the carrying amount of the asset or the 
cash-generating unit is increased to the adjusted 
recoverable amount, not, however, exceeding the 
carrying amount that the asset or cash-generating 
unit would have had, had the write-down not been 
made. impairment of goodwill is not reversed.
other financial assets
on initial recognition, investments and 
other financial assets are measured at cost, 
corresponding to fair value. they are subsequently 
measured at fair value either through the income 
statement or through comprehensive income.
inventories
inventories are measured at cost determined under 
the fifo method or net realisable value where this 
is lower.
cost comprises raw materials, goods for 
resale, and direct payroll costs as well as fixed 
and variable production overheads. variable 
production overheads comprise indirect materials 
and payroll costs and are allocated based on 
predetermined costs of the goods actually 
produced. fixed production overheads comprise 
maintenance of and depreciation on the machines, 
factory buildings and equipment used in the 
manufacturing process as well as the cost of factory 
management and administration. fixed production 
overheads are allocated based on the normal 
capacity of the production plant.
the net realisable value of inventories is calculated 
as the expected selling price less completion costs 
and costs incurred in making the sale.
receivables
on initial recognition, receivables are measured at 
fair value, subsequently at amortised cost.
expected credit losses are measured based 
on historical data adjusted by forward-looking 
information. forward-looking information includes 
assessment of the probability of default as well as 
consideration of various external sources of actual 
and economic information that is reasonable and 
supportable without undue cost or effort.
an impairment gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
receivables are written down when information 
indicates severe financial difficulties and that 
there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. 
financial assets written off may still be subject to 
enforcement activities. any recoveries made are 
recognised in the income statement.
prepayments
prepayments are recognised as an asset and 
comprise incurred costs relating to subsequent 
financial years. prepayments are measured at cost.
dividend
dividend is recognised as a liability when adopted 
by the shareholders at the annual general meeting.
treasury shares
acquisition and sales sums arising on the purchase 
and sale of treasury shares and dividends on 
treasury shares are recognised directly in retained 
earnings under equity.
pensions and similar liabilities
the alk group has entered into pension 
agreements and similar agreements with some of 
the alk group’s employees.
in respect of defined contribution plans, the alk 
group pays in fixed contributions to independent 
pension funds etc. the contributions are 
recognised in the income statement during the 
period in which the employee renders the related 
service. payments due are recognised as a liability 
in the balance sheet.
in respect of defined benefit plans, the alk group 
is required to pay an agreed benefit in connection 
with the retirement of the employees covered by 
the plan, e.g. in the form of a fixed amount or a 
percentage of the salary at retirement.
for defined benefit plans, an annual actuarial 
assessment is made of the net present value of 
future benefits to which the employees have earned 
the right through their past service for the alk 
61

group and which will have to be paid under the 
plan. the projected unit credit method is applied to 
determine net present value.
the net present value is calculated based on 
assumptions of the future development of salary, 
interest, inflation, mortality and disability rates.
the net present value of pension liabilities is 
recognised in the balance sheet, after deduction of 
the fair value of any assets attached to the plan, as 
either plan assets or pension liabilities, depending 
on whether the net amount is an asset or a liability, 
as described below.
if the assumptions made with respect to discount 
factor, inflation, mortality and disability are 
changed, or if there is a discrepancy between 
the expected and realised return on plan assets, 
actuarial gains or losses occur. these gains and 
losses concerning previous financial years are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
provisions
provisions are recognised when, as a consequence 
of a past event during the financial year or previous 
years, the alk group has a legal or constructive 
obligation, and it is likely that settlement of the 
obligation will require an outflow of the alk group’s 
financial resources.
provisions are measured as the best estimate of 
the costs required to settle the obligations at the 
balance sheet date. provisions with an expected 
term of more than a year after the balance sheet 
date are measured at present value.
mortgage debt
mortgage debt is recognised on the raising of a 
loan at cost, equalling fair value of the proceeds 
received, and net of transaction costs incurred. 
subsequently, mortgage debt is measured at 
amortised cost.
lease liabilities
on initial recognition, lease liabilities are measured 
as the present value of future payments. the lease 
payments contain fixed payments less any lease 
incentives receivable and variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate. 
on subsequent recognition, lease liabilities are 
measured at amortised cost. the difference 
between the present value and the nominal value 
of lease payments is recognised in the income 
statement over the term of the lease as a finance 
charge. 
if the interest rate cannot be determined in the 
agreement, the lease payments are discounted 
using the alk group’s incremental borrowing rate 
adjusted for the functional currency and length of 
the lease term. the lease liability is remeasured if 
or when the future payment or lease term changes.
short term lease expenses and low value assets 
are not recognised as part of lease liabilities. they 
are recognised in the income statement when 
incurred as an operating expense.
other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities, including bank loans 
and trade and other payables, are on initial 
recognition measured at fair value. the liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
deferred income
deferred income comprises income received 
relating to subsequent financial years. deferred 
income is measured at cost.
debt
trade payables, other payables, including sales 
discounts and rebates as well as debt to public 
authorities etc., are measured at amortised cost.
other accounting information 
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement of the alk group is 
presented using the indirect method and shows 
cash flows from operating, investing and financing 
activities as well as cash and marketable securities 
at the beginning and at the end of the financial 
year.
the cash effect of acquisitions and divestments is 
shown separately under cash flows from investing 
activities. in the cash flow statement, cash flows 
concerning acquired companies are recognised 
from the date of acquisition, while cash flows 
concerning divested companies are recognised 
until the date of divestment.
cash flows from operating activities are stated as 
net profit, adjusted for non-cash operating items 
and changes in working capital, less the income tax 
paid and plus net financial items.
cash flows from investing activities comprise 
payments in connection with acquisition and 
divestment of companies and financial assets as 
well as purchase, development, improvement and 
sale of intangible and tangible assets.
cash flows from financing activities comprise 
changes to the parent company’s share capital and 
related costs as well as the raising and repayment 
of loans, instalments on interest-bearing debt, 
lease liabilities, purchase of treasury shares, 
and settlement of share options and payment of 
dividends.
cash flows in currencies other than the functional 
currency are recognised in the cash flow statement 
using average exchange rates for the individual 
months if these are a reasonable approximation of 
the actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. 
if this is not the case, the actual exchange rates for 
the specific days in questions are used.
cash and marketable securities comprise cash and 
short-term securities subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value less any overdraft facilities 
that are an integral part of the alk group’s cash 
management.
segment reporting
based on the internal reporting used by the board 
of management to assess the results of operations 
and allocation of resources, the alk group 
has identified one operating segment ‘allergy 
treatment’, which is in accordance with the way the 
activities are organised and managed. in addition, 
the disclosures in the financial statements include 
a breakdown of revenue by product line and a 
geographical breakdown of revenue and non-
current assets.
definitions and ratios
the key ratios have been calculated in accordance 
with generally accepted financial ratios applied by 
financial analysts. definitions are shown on page

reporting under the esef regulation
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic 
format (esef) (esef regulation) has introduced 
a single electronic reporting format for the annual 
financial reports of issuers with securities listed on 
the eu regulated markets.
the esef regulation sets out the following main 
requirements: (1) issuers shall draw up and 
disclose their annual financial reports using the 
xhtml format; and (2) issuers that draw-up their 
primary consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the eu shall 
tag those consolidated financial statements using 
inline extensible business reporting language 
(ixbrl) and with effect from the 2022 annual report 
block-tag the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements.
the combination of the xhtml format with the 
ixbrl tags makes the annual financial reports both 
human-readable and machine-readable, thus 
enhancing accessibility, analysis and comparability 
of the information included in the annual financial 
reports.
ixbrl tags shall comply with the esef taxonomy, 
which is included in the esef regulation and 
developed based on the ifrs taxonomy published 
by the ifrs foundation.
as part of the tagging process financial statement 
line items are marked up to elements in the esef 
taxonomy. if a financial statement line item is not 
defined in the esef taxonomy, an extension to 
the taxonomy is created. extensions have to be 
anchored to elements in the esef taxonomy, except 
for elements corresponding to subtotals.
the annual report 2020 for the alk group 
submitted to the danish financial supervisory 
authority (the officially appointed mechanisms) 
consists of the xhtml document together with 
some technical files all included in a zip file named 
"alk-2020-12-31.zip".
key definitions
xhtml (extensible hypertext markup language) 
is a text-based markup language used to structure 
and mark up content such as text, images, and 
hyperlinks in documents that are displayed as web 
pages in an updated standard web browser like 
chrome, internet explorer or safari.
ixbrl tags (or inline xbrl tags) are hidden 
meta-information embedded in the source code 
of an xhtml document in accordance with the 
inline xbrl 1.1 specification, which enables the 
conversion of xhtml-formatted information 
into a machine-readable xbrl data record by 
appropriate software. 
the tagging process is a process where ixbrl tags 
are applied to financial statement line items, etc. 
taxonomy is an electronic dictionary of business 
reporting elements used to report business data. 
a taxonomy element is an element defined in a 
taxonomy that is used for the machine-readable 
labeling of information in an xbrl data record.

2  significant accounting estimates and judgements
in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements according to ifrs, management is 
required to make certain estimates as many 
financial statement items cannot be reliably 
measured, but must be estimated. such estimates 
comprise judgements made on the basis of the 
most recent information available at the reporting 
date.
it may be necessary to change previous estimates 
as a result of changes to the assumptions on which 
the estimates were based or due to supplementary 
information, additional experience or subsequent 
events. similarly, the value of assets and liabilities 
often depends on future events that are somewhat 
uncertain. in that connection, it is necessary 
to set out e.g. a course of events that reflects 
management’s assessment of the most probable 
course of events. 
in the consolidated financial statements for 
2020, management considers the following key 
accounting estimates and related judgements 
material to the assets and liabilities recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements.
recoverable amount of goodwill
the assessment of whether goodwill is impaired 
requires a determination of the value in use of 
the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill 
amounts have been allocated. the determination 
of the value in use requires estimates of the 
expected future cash flow of the cash-generating 
unit and a reasonable discount rate. see note 
12 in the consolidated financial statements for 
information on goodwill impairment test.
at 31 december 2020, the carrying amount of 
goodwill is dkk 452 million (2019: dkk 461 million).
inventories
the valuation of inventories includes 
management’s assessment of the saleability of the 
finished goods, and the quality of raw materials to 
be used in the production process. if the expected 
sales price less any completion costs and costs to 
execute sales (net realisable value) of inventories 
is lower than the carrying amount, the inventories 
are written down to net realisable value. when 
assessing salability and net realisable value, 
management uses estimates for future sales and 
related costs.
further, work in progress and manufactured 
goods and goods for resale are measured at cost 
including indirect production costs. the indirect 
production costs are measured using a standard 
cost method. this is reviewed regularly to ensure 
reliable measurement of employee costs, capacity 
utilisation, cost drivers and other relevant factors. 
when including the indirect productions costs for 
capitalisation, management makes estimates 
about cost of production, standard cost variances, 
cost drivers and capacity utilisation. changes in 
these parameters may have a significant impact on 
the gross margin and the overall valuation of work 
in progress and manufactured goods and goods 
for resale. 
the indirect production costs capitalised under 
inventories amounted to dkk 377 million at the end 
of 2020 (2019: dkk 348 million). at 31 december 
2020, the carrying amount of inventories is dkk 
1,093 million (2019: dkk 1,056 million).
tax
management is required to make an estimate in the 
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
the alk group recognises deferred tax assets 
including the tax value of tax losses if it is probable 
that it can be utilised against future taxable income 
within a foreseeable future (5 years). this includes 
an assessment of the possibilities to utilise tax 
losses in the joint danish taxation scheme with the 
lundbeck foundation (lundbeckfond invest a/s) 
and based on forecasts with positive results for 
the coming years in relation to the joint taxation. 
this assessment includes estimates of future 
taxable income in alk and other members of the 
joint danish taxation scheme with the lundbeck 
foundation. the forecasts for alk-abelló a/s with 
increased positive results (ebt) is based on growth 
in revenue and earnings driven by slit-tablets.
at 31 december 2020, the value of the total net 
deferred tax asset is dkk 697 million (2019: dkk 
616 million). it includes a net deferred tax asset in 
denmark related to tax losses carried forward of 
dkk 322 million (2019: dkk 372 million).
complying with tax rules, when conducting 
business globally, can be complex as the 
interpretation of legislation and case law may 
change over time or may not always be clear. 
management’s judgements are applied to 
assess the possible effect of exposures and the 
possible outcome of disputes or interpretational 
uncertainties when transfer pricing disputes with 
local tax authorities may occur. dialogue with local 
tax authorities, tax advisors, business plans and 
knowledge of the business are key parameters 
for management to estimate the tax assets and 
liabilities.
at 31 december 2020, the alk group recognises 
uncertain tax positions as part of non-current 
tax and deferred tax. the actual outcome may 
deviate and depends on the result of litigation and 
settlements with the relevant local tax authorities.
outsourced clinical trials
clinical trials, which are outsourced to clinical 
research organisations (“cros”), take several 
years to complete. as such, management is 
required to make estimates based on the progress 
and costs incurred to-date for the ongoing trials. 
estimates are made in determining the amount 
of costs to be expensed during the period or 
recognised as prepayments or accruals on the 
balance sheet. 
at 31 december 2020, dkk 135 million is 
recognised as accrued expenses (2019: dkk 105 
million) and dkk 218 million as prepayments on 
the balance sheet (2019: dkk 166 million). in 2020, 
clinical trials expenses of dkk 154 million have 
been recognised in the income statement (2019: 
dkk 144 million).

3 revenue and segment information
based on the internal reporting used by management to assess profit and allocation of resources, the alk group has identified one operating segment “allergy treatment” 
which complies with the organisation and management of the activities. even though revenue within the operating segment “allergy treatment” can be divided by product 
lines and markets, the main part of the activities within production, research and development, sales and marketing and administration are shared by the alk group as a 
whole.

5 share-based payments
the alk group has established long-term equity-based incentive plans linked to the creation of 
shareholder value and the fulfilment of strategic goals. the plans are established for the members 
of board of management and other key employees, reward long-term value creation and align to 
interests of the shareholders.
the incentive plans consist of share options and performance share units.
ordinary incentive plans
the share options entitle the holder to acquire one existing b share of dkk 10 nominal value in the 
company per share option and the performance share units entitle the holder to receive one existing b 
share per performance share unit free of charge.
the vesting period for both share options and performance share units is three years after grant. 
vesting is conditional upon certain targets being met and upon the participant not having resigned. 
target achievement is met upon fulfilment of strategic key performance indicators. in case 
performance is below the threshold there will be no units vesting, and if above target, a multiplier is 
applied that can increase the vesting by up to 100%.
the exercise of share options is possible in the trading windows following the release of annual and 
interim reports conditional upon the share option holder not having resigned at the time of exercise. 
for performance share units, the final transfer of ownership takes place at vesting three years after 
the grant.
special incentive plan 2018
alk’s special incentive plan is a one-time scheme designed to implement alk’s growth strategy 
and consists of both share options and performance share units with a vesting period of three years. 
the value of the plan did not exceed 50% of the executive’s 2018 annual base salary on the grant/
allocation date. the special incentive plan is conditional upon strategic key performance indicators 
being attained, with a threshold value below which the plan will not pay out. if the result exceeds the 
threshold, a defined multiplier may increase the grant/allocation in alk’s special incentive plan by up 
to 300%. however, the overall payout of the plan on the vesting date for the performance share units 
and on the exercise date for the share options can never exceed a total value of 300% of the recipient’s 
2018 annual base salary. the special incentive plan was adopted at the annual general meeting in 
march 2018.
for both the ordinary incentive plan 2018 and the special incentive plan 2018, for a limited number of 
share options (45,441) and performance share units (11,458), the vesting can be increased by up to 
300%.
sign on plan, ceo
in connection with the employment of carsten hellmann in 2017, a ceo sign-on plan was launched. no 
kpis were linked to the plan, which vested in january 2018 with an expiration date on 1 january 2024.
share options and performance share units are considered sufficiently covered by treasury shares.

12 intangible assets – continued
goodwill
goodwill is related to acquisition of companies in previous years and is recognised as the excess of 
the cost of an acquired company over the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities.
goodwill has been subject to an impairment test, which has been submitted to the audit committee for 
subsequent approval by the board of directors. the impairment test performed in 2020 revealed no 
need for impairment of goodwill. 
goodwill has been tested at an aggregated level. the alk group is considered as one cash-
generating unit as the individual companies and business units in the alk group cannot be evaluated 
separately due to the value-adding processes are generated across corporations and entities.
in the calculation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit, future free net cash flow is estimated 
based on board of directors-approved financial forecast in line with the alk group’s strategy.
the budget and the strategy plans are based on specific future business initiatives for which the 
risks relating to key parameters have been assessed and recognised in estimated future free cash 
flows. the key parameters in the calculation of the value in use are revenue, earnings, working 
capital, capital expenditure, discount rate and the preconditions for the terminal value. estimates 
are based on historical data and expectations on future changes in the markets and products. these 
expectations are based on a number of assumptions including expected product launches, volume 
forecasts, price information and profitability of both the alk group’s business as well as geographical 
expansions.
for financial years after the five year forecast period (2021-2025), the cash flows in the most recent 
period have been extrapolated adjusted for a growth factor of 1.5% (2019: 1.5%) during the terminal 
period. 
the calculated value in use shows that future earnings and cash flows fully support the carrying 
amount of total net assets, including goodwill.
the discount rate used is 10% pre-tax and 7.5% after tax (2019: 10% pre-tax and 7.5% after tax).
other intangible assets
other intangible assets cover minor finished development projects and development projects in 
progress including software development projects.

contingent liabilities
in the ordinary course of business, the alk group is involved in certain claims, disputes etc. in the 
opinion of management, settlement or continuation of pending claims and other disputes will have no 
material impact on the alk group’s financial position.
the alk group operates in a wide variety of jurisdictions, in some of which the tax law is subject to 
varying interpretations and potentially inconsistent enforcement. as a result, there can be practical 
uncertainties in applying tax legislation to the alk group’s activities. whilst the alk group considers 
that it operates in accordance with applicable tax law, there are potential tax exposures in respect of 
its operations, the impact of which cannot be reliably estimated, but could be material.
joint taxation scheme
alk-abelló a/s is included in a joint danish taxation scheme with the lundbeck foundation 
(lundbeckfond invest a/s) and its danish subsidiaries. the danish companies are joint and several 
liable for the joint taxation liability. the joint taxation liability covers income taxes and withholding 
taxes on dividends, royalties and interest. the joint taxation liability is capped at an amount equal to 
the share of the capital of the company directly or indirectly owned by the ultimate parent company.
commitments
land and buildings provided as security vis-à-vis for mortgage debt amount to dkk 197 million  
(2019: dkk 209 million) out of mortgage debt of dkk 258 million (2019: dkk 277 million).
change of control
the alk group's credit facilities are subject to standard change of control clauses according to which 
the lender has the right to cancel the commitment and demand repayment of outstandings.

25  financial risks and financial instruments – continued
the general objective of the alk group’s foreign exchange risk management is to limit and delay 
any adverse impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and thus increase 
the predictability of the financial results. the most significant financial risk relates to exchange rate 
fluctuations. the greatest exposure is to usd and in 2020, 15% (2019: 19%) of the revenue was 
denominated in usd. the sales are not deemed to be exposed to eur due to denmark’s participation 
in the european exchange rate mechanism.
the alk group is exposed to exchange rate risks when intercompany balances and net assets 
of foreign subsidiaries are translated into dkk. in accordance with the alk group’s accounting 
policies, such currency translation adjustments are recognised in the income statement and in other 
comprehensive income, respectively.
the alk group has no open exchange rate hedge contracts at 31 december 2020 or 31 december 
2019.
sensitivity to a 10% increase in usd exchange rate
the table below shows the estimated effect of a 10% increase in the usd exchange rate on revenue, 
ebitda and equity levels, respectively.  in the sensitivity analysis, data for revenue and ebitda are 
based on current short-term expectations and data for equity are based on actual equity at 31 
december 2020.

25  financial risks and financial instruments
financial risk management policy
as a result of operations, investments and financing, the alk group is exposed to exchange and 
interest rate changes. alk-abelló a/s manages the alk group’s financial risks centrally and 
coordinates the alk group’s cash management, including the raising of capital and investment of 
excess cash. the alk group complies with a policy, approved by the board of directors, to maintain 
a low risk profile, ensuring that the alk group is only exposed to foreign exchange rate risk, liquidity 
risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk in connection with its commercial activities.
capital structure
the alk group manages its capital to ensure that all entities will be able to continue as going concern 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balances. 
the capital structure of the alk group consists of net debt and equity. the dividend policy of the alk 
group is to distribute maximum possible dividend to alk-abelló a/s.
the alk group’s risk committee reviews the capital structure annually. as a part of this review, the 
committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
foreign exchange rate risk
foreign exchange rate risk arises due to imbalances between revenue and expenses in each individual 
currency. foreign exchange rate exposure relating to future transactions and assets and liabilities is 
evaluated and hedged through matching of payments received and paid in the same currency. this 
serves to limit the impact on the financial results of any exchange rate fluctuations. the exchange 
rate exposure relating to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is not hedged by forward exchange 
contracts. the alk group hedges significant exchange rate exposures regarding future sales and 
purchase of goods in the coming six months in accordance with the alk group’s policy.

25  financial risks and financial instruments – continued
liquidity risk
in connection with the alk group’s ongoing financing of operations, including refinancing, efforts are 
made to ensure adequate and flexible liquidity. this is guaranteed by placing free funds in credit-
worthy, liquid, interest bearing instruments of relatively short durations in accordance with the alk 
group’s policy. 
the liquidity risk is considered to be minimal due to the alk group’s current capital structure.

25  financial risks and financial instruments – continued
credit risk
the alk group’s primary credit exposure is related to trade receivables and cash. the alk group has 
no major exposure relating to one single customer or business partner. according to the alk group’s 
policy for assuming credit exposure, all customers and business partners are credit rated regularly. 
trade receivables are monitored at the local level and are distributed across a number of markets and 
customers. therefore, the credit risk is considered to be low. for more information, see note 16.
embedded derivative financial instruments
the alk group has made a systematic review of contracts that might contain terms that would make 
the contract or parts thereof a derivative financial instrument. the review did not lead to recognition of 
derivative financial instruments relating to the contracts.
25  financial risks and financial instruments – continued
interest rate risk
the alk group does not hedge its interest rate exposure, as this is not considered to be financially 
viable.
concerning the alk group’s financial assets and financial liabilities, the earlier of the contractual 
revaluation and redemption date is applied. effective interest rates are stated on the basis of the 
current level of interest rates on the balance sheet date.

notes to the parent company financial statements
general
the financial statements of the parent company 
alk-abelló a/s for the period 1 january – 
31 december 2020 have been prepared in 
accordance with the danish financial statements 
act for large reporting class d enterprises.
the financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner (dkk), which is also the functional currency 
of the company.
changes in accounting policies
the accounting policies are unchanged from last 
year. 
accounting policies
the accounting policies are as described below.
differences relative to the alk group’s 
accounting policies
the parent company’s accounting policies for 
recognition and measurement are in accordance 
with the alk group’s accounting policies with the 
following exceptions:
income statement
results of investments in subsidiaries
dividends from investments in subsidiaries are 
recognised in the parent company’s financial 
statements when the right to the dividend finally 
vests, typically at the date of the company’s 
approval in general meeting of the dividend of the 
company in question less any write-downs at the 
investments.
balance sheet
acquisition of activities from subsidiaries
acquisition of activities from subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the purchase method. on initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured and recognised 
as the excess of the consideration transferred 
exceeding the fair value of the net assets acquired 
at the acquisition date.
goodwill
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment. amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method over 
the expected useful life, estimated at 10 years. 
this estimate was made on the basis of estimated 
useful lives of the assets acquired.
investments in subsidiaries
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost.
where the recoverable amount of the investments 
is lower than cost, the investments are written down 
to this lower value.
in addition, cost is written down to the extent that 
dividends distributed exceed the accumulated 
earnings in the company since the acquisition 
date. in the event of indications of impairment, an 
impairment test is performed of investments in 
subsidiaries.
capitalisation of development costs
a reserve for capitalisation of development costs 
less deferred tax is recognised in the statement of 
equity. the reserve contains development costs, 
less amortisation/impairment losses, and less 
deferred tax, capitalised since 1 january 2016. 
other accounting information
cash flow statement
as allowed under section 86 (4) of the danish 
financial statements act, no cash flow statement 
is presented, as this is included in the consolidated 
cash flow statement.

the impairment of intangible assets includes dkk 13 million related to impairment of acquired 
intellectual property rights and dkk 9 million related to impairment of software projects in progress.

progress. in the income statement, the impairment of tangible assets is recognised as cost of sales.
in 2019, impairment of investments in subsidiaries of dkk 232 million decreased the income from

amount of the subsidiaries. based on the assessment, the investments in the following subsidiaries 
were impaired: alk-abelló source materials inc., alk e-com a/s, and alk ilac ve alerji Ürünleri ticaret 
anonim sirketi. the impairment of tangible assets of dkk 30 million was related to alk’s divestment 
of its part-share of a formulation production line for tablets to production partner catalent effective 30 
june 2019. the impairment of tangible assets was recognised as cost of sales.
for the assets where alk estimates that there is a recoverable amount, such amount was determined 
based on the fair value less cost to sell or the value in use of the respective asset.
