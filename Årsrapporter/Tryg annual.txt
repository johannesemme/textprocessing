all financial targets met
in 2020, tryg met all the financial targets pre-
sented at the capital markets day (cmd) in no-
vember 2017. the technical result target of dkk 
3,300bn should be seen against a full-year techi-
nal result of dkk 3,495bn, the combined ratio 
target of ≤ 86 should be seen against a full-year 
combined ratio of 84.5, and the expense ratio 
target of ~14 should be seen against a full-year 
expense ratio of 14.1. in a stock exchange an-
nouncement on march 27, tryg abandoned the 
≥ 21% after tax roe target for 2020 following 
unprecedented capital market developments in 
q1. the mark to market losses in q1 were more 
than fully recovered in the following quarters, 
and tryg is reporting a fy roe of 22.5%.
achieving targets through strategic initiatives
tryg has defined four strategic initiatives to 
achieve its financial targets, including continu-
ous work on claims excellence through leverag-
ing of tryg's procurement power and capitalising 
alka’s fraud capabilities.  
many customers prefer digital communication, 
and tryg aims to offer a wide range of digital 
self-service solutions, including solutions that 
enable customers to access exactly which 
products and coverage they need, buy insurance 
products, make changes to existing products and 
to report claims. in 2020, more than 5 million 
customers logged in to tryg’s digital self- service 
offerings.
tryg continued to focus on distribution efficien-
cy, and in 2020 the continued use of agents 
was the primary driver of benefits. private in 
denmark and norway as well as commercial in 
denmark have been particularly successful in 
using agents.
tryg is constantly developing new products and 
services, which has resulted in the launch of 
more than 50 new products and services since 
the beginning of 2018. these products and ser-
vices meet customer demand and are increasing 
tryg's share of wallet. 
strong customer focus
tryg continues to have a strong customer focus. 
in 2020, the transaction net promotor score 
(tnps) was 72, exceeding the ambitious target 
of 70. the number of products per customer 
was 3.9 in 2020, corresponding to growth of 7% 
per customer, and therefore slightly lower than 
the targeted 4.0. this is mainly due to strong 
growth in the car sales channel in norway selling 
only motor insurance. 
high profitable growth driven by  
private segment
tryg reported a premium growth of 7.0%, driven 
by strong growth of 9.0% in the profitable pri-
vate segment in both denmark and norway. the 
commercial segment also reported a positive 
growth of 6.0%, supported by both denmark 
and norway. corporate reported a growth of 
1.4%, reflecting a continued focus on improving 
profitability in all countries. the development 
in 2020 supports the focus to rebalance the 
portfolio with more private and commercial 
business and less corporate business.
stable and increasing dividend to shareholders 
tryg has a strong focus on ensuring that share-
holders receive a nominal and stable increase 
in dividends. a total dividend of dkk 7.00 per 
share will be paid for 2020 (dkk 6.80 in 2019). 
after the significant negative impact of covid-19 
in q1 2020, tryg announced an annual dividend 
decision instead of quarterly dividend payment. 
however, despite challenging times, tryg's 
business model proved very resilient, and it was 
therefore decided on 9 november 2020 to pay out 
a dividend of dkk 5.25 per share for the first three 
quarters of 2020. in q4, tryg will pay a dividend 
per share of dkk 1.75. 
recommended cash offer for rsa  
insurance group plc
on 18 november, tryg made a recommended 
cash offer together with the canadian insurer 
intact financial corporation to acquire rsa 
insurance group plc. as part of the transaction, 
tryg will take over rsa's swedish and norwegian 
businesses and co-own rsa’s danish business 
on a 50/50 economic basis. the acquisition will 
make tryg the biggest non-life insurer in scandi-
navia and create a much more balanced group 
with a significantly strengthened presence in 
tryg has a strong focus on ensuring that  
shareholders receive a nominal and stable 
increase in dividends. a total dividend of 
dkk 7.00 per share will be paid for 2020.
”
sweden. the acquisition is expected to achieve 
an roi of around 7%, result in the high teen eps 
accretion by 2023 and double the technical result 
(including dkk 900m of synergies) in 2024. tryg 
takes confidence from the alka acquisition, which 
delivered synergies of dkk 176m in 2020 against 
a target of dkk 150m.
a year with covid-19
covid-19 impacted 2020 in many ways. pri-
marily, it led to changed ways of working for all 
employees with much more working from home 
and virtual meetings. despite this big change, 
tryg managed to improve customer satisfac-
tion and maintain high sales level due to very 
flexible employees and strong customer focus. 
the financial impact of covid-19 was limited in 
2020 with a large loss driven by travel insurance 
claims in q1 2020 fully offset by lower claims 
frequencies in the following quarters.
thanks to all employees 
2020 was a very challenging year for all the 
employees in tryg as a result of covid-19. we are 
very proud to see how the employees adapted to 
a new and unprecedented situation with a contin-
ued strong customer focus. furthermore, even in 
this difficult situation we saw that job satisfaction 
increased to 80 in 2020 against 78 in 2019. the 
supervisory board and the executive board would 
like to thank all employees for their great efforts.

renewal of big partner agreements
tryg renewed its big partner agreements with 
udf (union of education norway) and nmf (nor-
wegian band federation) in q4 2020 for three 
and five years, respectively. partner agreements 
are very important for the norwegian business, 
and tryg was therefore pleased to renew these 
agreements on good terms for all parties.
a good year for bilsport & mc and atlantica
moderna’s enthusiast brands – bilsport & mc (for 
car and motorcycle enthusiasts) and atlantica (for 
boats) – have shown that profitability and growth 
can go hand in hand. a new product offered by 
bilsport & mc was the single most important con-
tributor to delivering full-year sales targets already 
in q3 2020. atlantica has benefitted from people 
holidaying in sweden and has met full-year sales 
target with comfortable margins. 
management changes in corporate
in 2020, two new directors in corporate norway 
and denmark as well as a new country manager 
in the swedish business, moderna, were appoint-
ed. the recruitment of the new management 
is aligned with tryg’s ambition to increase our 
focus on profitability initiatives in all corporate 
segments in the coming years. 
tryg sund
in 2020, tryg’s own app ‘tryg sund’ (‘tryg health’) 
was launched. tryg sund provides users with 
an overview of health insurance services, such 
as tryg medical hotline, as well as guidance on 
ways to improve health, while also enabling cus-
tomers to report claims directly from the app. in 
the first month following its launch, the app had 
more than 4,000 downloads from appstore and 
googleplay.
tryg smart
a number of nito (norwegian engineer organ-
isation) members were offered to test a sensor 
package that will be installed in the members’ 
holiday homes. through an app, members can 
check temperature, leaks, smoke and electricity 
consumption. the initiative is tailored to nito's 
members and supports tryg's strong focus on 
prevention and digitalisation.
strong development together with new  
and old partners
during 2020, existing partner channels devel-
oped, and furthermore new partnerships were 
launched. for example, moderna launched me-
konomen bilförsäkring together with the existing 
partner mekonomen and broadened its product 
offering through akademikerförsäkring to include 
the bilsport & mc and atlantica product ranges. 
tryghedsgruppen’s member bonus
for the fifth consecutive year, tryghedsgruppen, 
tryg’s majority shareholder, paid out a member 
bonus for 2020 of dkk 985m, equivalent to 8% 
of premiums paid for 2019. the bonus was paid 
to tryg and alka customers in denmark, or every 
fourth dane. 
tryg bilpleje – new digitally driven  
prevention product
in q1 2020, ‘tryg bilpleje’ (‘tryg car service’) was 
launched in denmark for private customers. for a 
monthly fee, the product offers access to a num-
ber of light car services such as car wash, change 
of tyres and seasonal car check-ups – all in one 
package. tryg bilpleje is the first fully digitalised 
product. this means that customers can only 
buy and use the product digitally, which makes it 
more convenient for them to use the services. 
digital seminars
during the year, commercial and corporate in 
moderna arranged a number of digital seminars 
for brokers all around sweden. they attracted 
more than 10,000 participants in the course of 
the year, and levels of engagement were high, 
both internally and externally.
tryg works from home 
since march 2020, the vast majority of tryg’s 
employees in denmark, sweden and norway 
have been working from home as a result of cov-
id-19. throughout this period, it has been a key 
priority to ensure strong operations and maintain 
a high level of customer satisfaction. it was  very 
positive to see an increase in the overall tnps 
score reaching an all-time high level under these 
conditions.
recommended cash offer for rsa  
insurance group plc
on 18 november, tryg made a cash offer togeth-
er with the canadian insurer intact to acquire 
rsa according to which tryg would take over the 
swedish and norwegian businesses and co-own 
rsa’s danish business on a 50/50 economic 
basis. following the acquisition, tryg will be the 
largest non-life insurance company in scandina-
via with a much more balanced portfolio across 
denmark, sweden and norway. at the egm on 18 
december 2020, the supervisory board was au-
thorised to increase the company’s share capital 
to finance the bid of approximately dkk 35bn.

financial outlook
governments across scandinavia have, to differ-
ent extents, introduced schemes to help busi-
nesses in these very challenging times. the start 
of vaccination programmes towards the end of 
the year is expected to gradually help improve 
the macroeconomic outlook in 2021. however, 
due to the enduring uncertainty, the macroeco-
nomic backdrop remains challenging.
the nordic non-life insurance markets remain 
relatively stable in terms of top-line growth and 
product offerings. the nordic countries are 
characterised by a high level of non-life insur-
ance penetration – ratios of non-life insurance 
premiums in % of gdp are some of the highest 
in the world. this is attributable to the fact that 
households are generally wealthy and tend to 
cover their insurance needs relatively well.
retention levels are very high in the nordic re-
gion compared to nearly everywhere else in the 
world. this is a key profitability driver as it helps 
insurers keep their overall expenses low. reten-
tion rates hover around 90% in the private and 
commercial (smes) segments, which represent 
more than 80% of tryg’s total business. a direct 
distribution model also contributes significantly 
in 2020, the outbreak of covid-19 across the world resulted in a lot 
of human pain, devastation and uncertainties, and sharply dampened 
the economic outlook. the scandinavian economies entered the crisis 
in a better position than most countries with good growth levels, bal-
anced public finances and low levels of unemployment. 
to the very efficient set-up. at the end of 2020, 
tryg reported an expense ratio of 14.1, which 
is in line with the target of ~14. in comparison, 
most international insurers report expense 
ratios between 25 and 30.
tryg’s reserves position remains strong. on the 
cmd in november 2017, it was disclosed that 
run-off gains were expected to be between 
3% and 5% in 2020. tryg’s systematic claims 
reserving approach still includes a margin of 
approximately 3% on best estimate.
in 2021, weather and large claims both net of re-
insurance are expected to total dkk 600m and 
dkk 550m, respectively, which is unchanged 
compared to previous years.
the interest rate used to discount tryg’s tech-
nical provisions is historically low. an interest 
rate increase will have a positive effect on tryg’s 
results. an interest rate increase of 1 percentage 
point will increase the pre-tax result by around 
dkk 300m, and vice versa. the calculation 
includes the lower claims in the p&l from higher 
discounting, the higher technical interest and the 
higher return on the bonds in the free portfolio.

the investment portfolio is divided into a match 
portfolio corresponding to the technical provi-
sions, and a free portfolio. the objective is for the 
return on the match portfolio to be approximate-
ly zero as capital gains and losses on the assets 
side should be mirrored by corresponding devel-
opments on the liabilities side. the free portfolio 
is invested in different asset classes with a view 
to obtaining the best risk-adjusted return.
the return on bonds in the free portfolio (slightly 
above 60% of the free portfolio) will vary, but 
given current interest rate levels, a very low 
return is expected. for shares, the expected 
return is around 7% with the msci world index 
as benchmark, while the expected return for 
property is around 5%. the investment return 
in the income statement also includes the cost 
of managing investments, the cost of currency 
hedges, interest expenses on subordinated 
loans and other minor items.
2021 outlook
the three-year strategy period ended in 2020 
with tryg meeting all its financial targets. a new 
capital markets day was initially scheduled for 
29 january 2021 but it has been postponed until 
the autumn following the recommended cash offer 
for rsa insurance group plc and pending approval 
by the regulatory authorities. the acquisition is 
considered transformational as it will create the 
largest scandinavian non-life insurer, doubling the 
pro-forma technical result. therefore, including the 
acquired asset in future financial targets is deemed 
essential for tryg’s next capital markets day. 
tryg has decided to publish a detailed outlook 
for 2021 together with the publication of the 
annual report. it is important to note that tryg 
will not publish annual financial guidance going 
forward (i.e. in future annual reports) but will

the next three years ending in 2024.
tryg stand-alone
tryg (excluding rsa’s assets) expects a techni-
cal result of between dkk 3.3bn and 3.7bn in 
2021. the range is driven by the natural volatility 
of large and weather claims and the more 
challenging macroeconomic outlook (compared 
to past years), which could impact the top line 
especially in the commercial and corporate 
segments. the low end of the range would imply 
a significantly higher level of weather and large 
claims compared to a normalised guidance of 
large claims of dkk 550m and weather claims 
of dkk 600m a year. run-off gains are expected 
to be between 3-5%. 
tryg has guided previously for a normalised 
investment income between dkk 0 and dkk 
200m. a newsletter explaining all the moving 
parts is available on tryg.com. the assumptions 
remain valid. additionally a link on tryg.com 
provide daily updates on the return of the free 
portfolio (the capital of the company), adding 
more visibility to the overall investment income.
other income and costs in the p&l are expected 
to be between dkk -150m and dkk -250m. 
tryg is booking in this line the depreciation from 
the alka acquisition, some holding company 
costs not related to the insurance portfolio and 
the income and costs related to selling pension 
products for danske bank.
impact from rsa's assets
the acquisition of rsa’s norwegian and swedish 
businesses and 50% of rsa's danish business 
is expected to be approved before the end of 
q2. based on this assumption, rsa’s assets are 
expected to be 'equity-accounted' for in h2 2021. 
tryg will book the net profit contribution (for the 
relevant period) of the acquired assets under 'in-
come from associates' in the investment activities. 
in the table taken from codan’s sfcr (solvency 
& financial condition report), it is possible to see 
the underwriting result by geographies for the past 
three years, the investment income (as sum of the 
three geographies) and the total net profit. it is im-
portant to note that the subsidiaries privatsikring 
and holmia are not consolidated in the group and 
therefore not included in these figures but they are 
part of the acquisition perimeter.
tryg has disclosed total costs of dkk 4.4bn costs 
related to the rsa transaction. some of these 
costs will be booked in the p&l while some will be 
on the balance sheet. during 2020, the deal-con-
tingent forward hedges (derivate contracts 
entered to ensure certainty of funds at the time of 
r.2.7 announcement) was booked with no impact 
in p&l. during 2021, the cost of dkk1.3bn related 
to the cost of the contracts will be booked in the 
p&l if the acquisition is completed.  it is important 
to note that the cost related to the dcf hedge 
is not tax-deductible. additionally, dkk 1.6bn 
pertaining to underwriting fees for the rights issue 
and to financial and legal advisor costs will all be 
booked in the balance sheet. total restructuring 
costs of dkk 1.5bn will also be booked in the p&l. 
at the time of writing, it is expected that some 
dkk 500m will be booked in 2021 and a remain-
ing dkk 1bn in 2022. however, the exact timing 
remains uncertain as it is dependent from the 
closing of the transaction and relative integration.
a first draft of the purchase price allocation 
shows a likely annual intangible assets depreci-
ation (after tax) range between dkk 600m and 
dkk 800m expected from 2022.

targets and strategy
at the capital markets day in november 2017, tryg announced a 
set of financial and non-financial targets for 2020. the financial 
targets were later updated following the acquisition of alka. along 
with a new strategy, a new purpose was defined. 
‘as the world changes, we make it easier to be 
tryg’. this purpose has been the overarching 
principle guiding the realisation of the targets for 
2020. four strategic initiatives were defined to 
support the financial and non-financial targets: 
claims excellence, digital empowerment of cus-
tomers, product & service innovation and distri-
bution efficiency as well as alka synergies, all of 
which are described in detail on page 14-16. 
the importance of customer relations 
customer satisfaction is of paramount impor-
tance. tryg continually strives to strengthen 
customer relations through advisory services, 
products, concepts, claims handling procedures 
and claims prevention measures. satisfied 
customers improve retention levels, which hover 
around 90% for tryg’s private and commercial 
customers. since 2012, customer targets have 
been an integrated part of the cmd targets, 
reflecting tryg's strong focus on customer 
satisfaction.
employees are a key resource 
tryg’s employees are essential to delivering 
the overarching purpose of making it easier to 
be ‘tryg’ for the customers. all employees are 
encouraged to understand that they play an 
integral role in supporting the overall purpose. 
therefore, clear and ambitious targets are set 
for each individual employee – and regular feed-
back must be provided.

tryg’s business model
tryg makes it easier to be 
‘tryg’ for  its customers by 
offering them insurance 
against risk, efficient claims 
handling, and advice and 
services to prevent  claims 
from arising in the first place. 
by making it easier for our 
customers to feel protected 
and cared for, we benefit all 
of tryg’s stakeholders. via 
tryghedsgruppen’s 53% 
ownership of tryg, part of the 
company’s profit is returned 
to customers, who are also 
members of tryghedsgrup-
pen. tryg’s purpose is valid 
for all stakeholders – our cus-
tomers, our employees and 
our shareholders.

management’s review - contents
in 2020, tryg was very pleased to see a his-
torically high level of employee satisfaction, 
surpassing the general level of employee 
satisfaction in the financial sector in the nordics. 
tryg is aiming for the highest level of employee 
satisfaction in the financial sector in the nordic 
region. 
creating value for our shareholders
tryg’s shareholders must see tryg as a company 
with a clear focus on profitability and efficiency, 
which reflects the company’s core strategy and 
its financial targets. tryg’s performance can be 
measured by its long-term total shareholder 
return. tryg aims to pay a nominal, stable and 
increasing ordinary dividend, while maintaining 
stable results and a high level of return on capital 
employed.
financial targets
in november 2017 at a cmd, tryg communicat-
ed a set of financial targets for 2020. tryg’s main 
target for 2020 was a technical result of dkk 
3.3bn, which has been met with tryg reporting 
a technical result of dkk 3,495m for 2020. the 
financial target of an expense ratio ~14 and a 
combined ratio at or below 86 were also met. 
the roe target at or above 21% was suspended, 
as communicated in the stock exchange an-
nouncement on 27 march 2020, considering the 
mark-to-market investment losses in q1 2020. 
however, following the rebound of the financial 
markets in the last three quarters of the year, 
tryg reported an roe of 22.5% for the fy, and 
therefore realised the initial target.
customer targets 
in tryg, customer satisfaction is of paramount 
importance, and tryg has therefore worked 
intensively to continually improve the customer 
experience and reaching the customer targets

customer targets
for 2020. this was reflected in an increased fo-
cus on customer satisfaction measured through 
the tnps score. in 2020, tryg reached a tnps 
level of 72, and the target was therefore met. 
there is a strong correlation between cus-
tomer loyalty and the number of products per 
customer, and therefore a target of increasing 
the number of products per customer by 10% 
was defined. in the strategy period, the number 
of products per customer was 3.9, an increase 
of 7%. tryg's efforts in partnering with car deal-
erships have resulted in a higher-than-expected 
amount of one-product customers. as growth 
in this particular segment has been higher than 
expected, the 10% increase in products per 
customer has not been achieved. however, tryg 
considers the increase in products per custom-
er as being satisfactory, and the potential for 
enhancing the coverage for new customers from 
our car channels will be explored going forward.
strategic initiatives 
tryg defined four strategic initiatives to support 
both its financial targets and customer targets 
for 2020. kpis have been defined for each initi-
ative. furthermore, synergies related to alka will 
also be part of the initiatives. 
claims excellence is the most important strate-
gic initiative for improving the technical result. 
the target was to reduce claims costs by dkk 
600m in 2020, and during the three-year period 
accumulated savings of dkk 640m has been 
realised. 
one of the main initiatives has been to further 
leverage tryg’s procurement power, and cost 
savings of more than dkk 350m were realised. 
initiatives in the strategy period include the 
renewal of a contract for windscreen services, a 
new five-year contract with recover nordic (the 
largest nordic claims service group) and a claims 
agreement for electronic products (such as tab-
lets, laptops and mobile phones) in denmark.
fraud detection has been another important 
driver of the claims excellence initiative in 
the strategy period. following the successful 
integration of alka, a more sophisticated fraud 
detection methodology has been implemented 
across tryg's claims-handling units. initially, 
the methodology was implemented in tryg 
denmark in 2019, followed in 2020 by norway 
and sweden. the methodology is based both 
on automated fraud detection algorithms in the 
claims-handling systems, and enhanced training 
of employees. additional cost savings of dkk 
70m compared to 2017 have been realised.
finally, improving the claims-handling process 
has also been an important driver to success-
fully meet the target, with realised accumulated 
claims excellence

cost savings at dkk 220m in the strategy period. 
the benefits have been realised through more 
accurate claims assessments, better recourse 
management, data and speech analytics and the 
ongoing implementation of a new claims-han-
dling system in denmark and norway. the 
previously mentioned focus areas all aim at 
improving the claims process for the custom-
er, providing a far more efficient and relevant 
experience.
digital empowerment of customers is another 
important initiative in tryg. digital services, sim-
plification and efficient customer interaction are 
becoming increasingly important for customers. 
customers in general prefer speedy processes, 
and therefore digital solutions also support 
tryg’s focus on customer satisfaction. the target 
for 2020 was 50% straight-through processing 
(stp) of claims and a self-service level of 70% 
for all contacts with tryg. the focus on digital 
services in tryg contributed dkk 120m to the 
financial targets as well as improving customer 
satisfaction.
in the past three years, tryg has experienced 
a general increase in the number of customer 
contacts. approximately 5 million logins to 
the digital universe were registered in 2020, 
corresponding to a 182% increase compared to 
2017. in the same period, phone calls increased 
approximately 7%. this indicates that many 
customers acknowledge and use the new 
digital solutions, but at the same time still value 
personal contact. tryg believes that the general 
increase in customer contact is positive and 
supports both sales and customer interaction 
and loyalty.
the increase in log-ins is generated by a number 
of new digital self-service solutions such as 
digital invoicing, online insurance check-ups and 
various ways for customers to order and change 
products and register claims. the self-service 
target at 70% has been exceeded with the level 
of 72%, this has been achieved despite a surge 
of phone calls related to the covid-19 outbreak 
in the first part of the year.
in the strategy period, the level of stp of claims 
increased due to the use of robotic automa-
tion processes (rpas) in the claims-handling 
process, and due to the implementation of the 
new claims-handling system. even though the 
stp target was challenged by the high number 
of phoned-in covid-19-related claims, the new 
claims-handling system handled many of the 
simple travel claims, and the total stp level of 
51% therefore exceeded the target of 50% stp. 
in the coming years, the new claims-handling 
system is expected to further boost stp levels in 
both denmark and norway.
product & service innovation is important for 
tryg to remain relevant to customers in the 
future. the target was to increase premiums by 
dkk 1,000m from new products and services by 
2020+. in the strategy period, premiums from 
new products and services increased by dkk 
1,060m, meeting the target.
a key initiative is innovation of new products 
and services such as cyber insurance, preg-
nancy insurance (in sweden) offering access to 
specialist care after giving birth, and senior care 
(in denmark) offering additional care for elderly 
people. premiums from new products in the 
strategy period totalled dkk 640m.
bundling of products has been another impor-
tant focus for tryg in order to reach the 2020+ 
target. the aim of bundling products has been 
to make insurance products more accessible for 
our customers by removing complexity. based 
on private's positive experience with, e.g., health 
and child insurance during the strategy period, 
the commercial business also began to bundle 
products. bundled products generated premi-
ums of dkk 340m in the strategy period. 
prevention is key for the well-being of customers 
and a key element in tryg’s purpose. products 
such as tryg drive/side kick, a digital device that 
rewards good driving behavior, tryg alarm, and a 
rat blocker to prevent rats from entering drains 
following a few mild winters, are all part of tryg’s 
prevention strategy. 
finally, entering new markets and increasing 
the profitable credit and surety business, tryg 
garanti, has also been an important initiative for 
realising tryg’s 2020 targets. in 2019, tryg garan-
ti expanded to germany, austria and the nether-
lands, and further expansion is considered.
increasing distribution efficiency is a strategic 
priority for tryg. the target has been to improve 
distribution with an impact of dkk 150m in 
2020. the initiative has generated a total impact 
of approximately dkk 175m, exceeding the 
target. 
the improvement has primarily been driven 
by improving the distribution channel mix in 
the private and commercial businesses. the 
optimisation has supported an improvement in 
the customer experience and lowered the cost 
of sales in the strategy period. an important 
element in the optimisation of the channel mix 
has been the introduction of independent sales 
agents during the strategy period in private den-
mark and commercial denmark, inspired by the 
franchise channel in norway, selling exclusively 
on behalf of tryg.

finally, an important component for improving 
distribution efficiency involves partner agree-
ments. in norway, the partner agreement with 
nito has generated very good leads, increased 
sales and retention levels. the agreement with 
danske bank also got off to a good start in 2019, 
generating good leads and sales both for private 
and commercial customers in denmark and 
norway. finally, tryg’s norwegian branch, enter 
forsikring, has in the strategy period launched 
‘enter proff’, selling car insurance to commercial 
customers. 
alka synergies 
in connection with the acquisition of alka, tryg 
communicated a guidance of dkk 300m of 
synergies which are expected to be achieved in 
2021. at the same time, tryg announced syner-
gies targets of dkk 75m in 2019, dkk 150m in 
2020 and dkk 300m in 2021. synergies of dkk 
90m were realised in 2019 (dkk 75m target).  
in 2020, tryg realised synergies of dkk 176m 
(dkk 150m target) demonstrating that it is 
slightly ahead of the plan for delivering syner-
gies. approximately half of the achieved syner-
gies relate to costs, while the inclusion of the 
alka business in tryg's extensive procurement 
network has also been an important driver.
in q4, tryg realised synergies of dkk 46m, 
 comprising dkk 19m from claims, dkk 16m 
from costs and dkk 11m from revenue.
corporate responsibility
corporate responsibility (cr) is an integrated 
part of tryg’s core business and is closely linked 
to the purpose ‘as the world changes, we make it 
easier to be tryg’. tryg focuses on activities relat-
ed to human and labour rights, climate and the 
environment as well as anti-corruption, and is 
actively working to integrate cr into insurance, 
claims-handling and prevention activities. cr 
plays a role in tryg's decision making, risk mit-
igation, the improvement and development of 
tryg's products and services, the optimisation of

strategy 2021
in 2021, tryg will continue to build on the strong 
foundation within customer and sales excel-
lence that has been established during the past 
three years. this will entail the enhancement of 
some of the strategic focus areas from the 2020 
strategy, as well as additions to these. further-
more, in 2021 there will be a strong focus on the 
b2b segment, and initiatives will be introduced 
aimed at growing the commercial segment, and 
at increasing profitability in the corporate seg-
ment. as regards the acquisition of trygg-hansa 
in sweden and codan in norway, planning the 
integration is a priority in order to ensure that 
tryg will be on track with ambitious synergy 
targets as soon as the transaction closes. 
tryg expects to present cmd targets based on 
the new strategy in autumn 2021 following the 
closing of the acquisition.

tryg’s results
premium growth of 7.0% in local currencies was primarily  
driven by strong growth in the private and commercial segments. 
technical result of dkk 3,495m (dkk 3,237m) was impacted 
positively by the underlying claims development, delivery of the 
alka synergies, and lower-than-normal large and weather claims, 
which offset a negative currency development and a further drop 
in interest rates. investment income of dkk 311m characterised 
by volatility in all quarters driven by the covid-19 outbreak and 
following capital market turbulence. pre-tax profit of dkk 3,541m. 
quarterly dividend of 1.75 per share, supporting trygheds-
gruppen’s member bonus. solvency ratio of 183.
results 2020
premium growth was 7.0%, driven primarily by 
strong growth in the private and commercial 
segments. the private segment was up 9.0%, 
while the commercial segment was up 6.0%. 
corporate reported a virtually flat top-line devel-
opment. tryg reported a technical result of dkk 
3,495m (dkk 3,237m) impacted positively by 
the underlying claims development, delivery of 
the alka synergies, lower-than-normal large and 
weather claims and lower claims frequencies 
driven by the covid-19 outbreak. the technical 
result was impacted negatively by currency 
developments and by even lower levels of 
interest rates. the gross impact of the covid-19 
outbreak on the technical result was close to 
nil, while the net impact was dkk 141m due 
to reinsurance cover of travel insurance. tryg 
reported a combined ratio of 84.5 (85.1), driven 
by a claims ratio of 70.3 (70.9) and an expense 
ratio of 14.1 (14.2).
the private segment reported an increased 
technical result, driven by the positive top-line 
development, an improved underlying claims ra-
tio and lower claims frequencies in selected lines 
of business following the outbreak of covid-19. 
the commercial segment reported an increased 
technical result driven by the positive top-line 
development, an improved underlying claims 
ratio, lower claims frequencies in selected lines 
of business following the outbreak of covid-19 
and tight cost control reducing the expense ratio. 
the corporate segment reported a stable tech-
nical result, virtually flat top-line development 
as price increases (across all geographies) offset 
the loss of some customers. the underlying 
claims ratio is moving in the right direction but 
more efforts are needed to produce long-term 
sustainable returns. further profitability actions 
have been put in place in 2021. private sweden 
reported a somewhat higher technical result, 
top-line development was positive, and a mod-
est improvement in the underlying claims ratio 
was recorded.
synergies from the alka transaction amounted 
to dkk 176m in 2020 with dkk 73m from 
claims, dkk 62m from costs and dkk 41m from 
revenue synergies. targeted synergies for 2020 
were dkk 150m.
the investment result was dkk 311m (dkk 
579m), characterised by high volatility between 
quarters. the covid-19 outbreak caused 
wide-spread selling in capital markets in march, 
which was followed by a robust recovery in the 
following quarters. the macroeconomic picture 
looked very bleak in march/april, improved 
slightly afterwards, and the start of covid-19 
vaccination programmes towards the end of 
2020 and beginning of 2021 is renewing hopes 
of stabilisation of the world economy. equities 
closed the year up 13.5%, while corporate 
bonds also saw strong returns. in general, all 
asset classes in the free portfolio contributed 
positively to the strong performance.
other income and expenses were dkk -265m 
(dkk -188m), the increase on 2019 being 
explained by a vat refund in the last quarter 
of 2019, by lower income from the pensions 
products.

the pre-tax result was dkk 3,541m (dkk 3,628m), 
while the net profit was dkk 2,773m (dkk 
2,843m), resulting in an roe of 22.5% (24.6%). 
in 2020, danish customers received the fifth 
member bonus from tryghedsgruppen (tryg’s 
53% majority shareholder). the 8% bonus is ap-
preciated by customers and seen as an impor-
tant competitive advantage, boosting customer 
loyalty and supporting customer targets. 
premiums
premium income totalled dkk 22,653m (dkk 
21,741m), representing growth in 2020 in local 
currencies of 7.0%.
the private segment posted strong growth of 
9.0% (7.8% in 2019 excluding alka) with positive 
impact from both denmark and norway. in 
denmark, tryg continued to see strong sales 
through partner agreements such as fdm and 
danske bank, and at the same time upselling to 
existing customers of new products supported 
the growth. in norway, strong growth was driven 
by partner agreements with nito and obos, 
but also by very strong sales from the car sales 
channel (enter).
the commercial segment posted growth of 
6.0% in 2020 (8.3% in 2019 impacted by alka), 
supported by an increase in the number of cus-
tomers in denmark, helped by continued strong 
sales by tryg's independent sales agents and 
improved sales from the broker sales channel. 
in norway, growth primarily related to price 
adjustments to improve profitability, which were 
generally accepted by customers.
the corporate segment posted modest growth 
of 1.4% (2.0%) with a loss of premium in-
come in norway as a result of significant price 
adjustments for the third year in a row, while 
in denmark and sweden some growth was 
observed, primarily driven by price hikes, which 
did not impact churn much as they were the first 
significant price adjustments for many years.
the segment sweden posted growth of 4.9% 
(6.1%), helped by price adjustments, especially 
for motor to improve profitability, but also by 
strong sales in the boat sales channel atlantica, 
helped by many people holidaying in sweden 
(as opposed to travelling abroad) through the 
covid-19 period.
claims
the claims ratio, net of ceded business, was 
70.3 (70.9), while the underlying claims ratio 
saw an improvement of 0.6 percentage points 
for the group and 0.2 percentage points for the 
private segment, driven by price adjustments 
and 'claims excellence' initiatives. it is worth re-
membering that 'new' business is normally less 
profitable than 'old' business, due to structurally 
higher claims frequencies of approximately 3% 
and higher distribution costs. the underlying 
claims ratio for private is currently impacted by 
the initial adverse effect on profitability of the 
robust growth. however, in the longer term the 
initial drag will be offset by higher profitability. 
at the same time, profitability initiatives in the 
corporate segment should also help sustain the 
improvement in the underlying claims develop-
ment. the underlying claims ratio is therefore 
expected to improve in 2021. 
claims inflation is monitored constantly using 
internal and external parameters in all lines 
of business. motor insurance and property insur-
ances accounts for almost 70% of total premi-
ums and a similar share of the technical result, 
and claims patterns are therefore carefully 
scrutinised. new trends such as sales of electric 
cars and general developments in property mar-
kets are followed closely to anticipate pockets of 
claims inflation and try to adjust prices accord-
ingly. 
in 2020, large claims totalled dkk 500m (dkk 
455m), while weather claims totalled dkk 368m 
(dkk 416m). in q4, weather claims were im-
pacted by a landslide in norway on 30 decem-
ber with an impact of approximate dkk 100m 
for tryg. levels of large and weather claims were 
below normalised expectations of dkk 550m 
and dkk 600m a year. the overall run-off result 
was dkk 1,145m (dkk 1,194m) or 5.1% (5.5%) 
on the combined ratio. the run-off result was 
driven mainly by run-off gains in the long-tail 
segments.  
covid-19 outbreak had a significant negative 
impact in the first quarter of 2020 due to high 
gross losses on travel insurance somewhat 
mitigated by lower claims frequencies in lines 
such as motor, property and accident resulting 
in a total negative gross impact of dkk -180m 
or dkk -40m after reinsurance. in the following 
quarters, a positive impact was recorded due 
to lower activity in the society leading to lower 
claims frequency primarily mentioned lines of 
business. the total impact from covid-19 for 
fy 2020 was dkk 39m on a gross basis (before 
reinsurance) and dkk 179m on a net basis (after 
reinsurance).
expenses
the expense ratio was 14.1 (14.2). at the cmd 
in 2017, tryg announced an expense ratio target 
of around 14 in 2020. a number of initiatives to 
lower distribution costs are being implemented, 
and some of the savings from these initiatives 
are being invested in new digital solutions. the 
expense ratio was impacted by satifactory 
growth in the private segment, especially in 
norway, where commissions are paid upfront 
in many distribution channels. this higher level 
was also supported by distribution initiatives, for 
example the implementation and increased use 
of more efficient independent sales channels, 
especially in denmark in both private and com-
mercial. the expenses were negatively impacted 
by dkk 38m related to covid-19 initiatives 
such as it and increased cleaning and disinfec-
tion of offices.
investment activities
the investment return totalled dkk 311m (dkk 
579m), with capital market developments being 
very volatile in 2020. during march, following 
the outbreak of covid-19, an extreme sell-off 
in virtually all assets classes was recorded, with 
equities dropping an unprecedented 25-30% in 
just a few weeks. a recovery gradually built up in 
q2 and continued gathering strength, with a very 
robust performance in the last quarter of the 
year. all asset classes in the free portfolio pro-
duced good returns for the full year with equities 
(up 13.5%) and corporate bonds (returning 6%)

leading the way. the start of covid-19 vacci-
nation programmes towards the end of 2020 is 
also helping the outlook, together with a clear 
outcome of the us presidential elections. the 
match portfolio also experienced a volatile pat-
tern during the year, with a loss in q1 followed 
by a recovery in the following quarters. other 
financial income and expenses totalled dkk 
-255m (dkk -236m). 
oher income and costs
other income and costs were dkk -265m (dkk 
-188m). approximately half of 'other income 
and costs' is represented by the amortisation 
of customer relations stemming from the alka 
acquisition. additionally, bancassurance fees and 
some other minor items are also booked in this 
line.
tax
tryg paid a total tax bill of dkk 768m (dkk 
783m) or 21.7% of profit before tax
capital position
the solvency ratio (based on tryg’s partial inter-
nal model) was 183 at year-end. back in march, 
tryg moved the dividend decision to year-end 
as opposed to quarterly in 2020 due to consid-
erable capital market volatility and heightened 
regulatory pressure on the financial sector in 
general. however, as the business model proved 
sufficiently robust, this decision was revisited, 
and in november dividend for the first nine 
months of 2020 was paid. tryg will pay a q4 
dividend of dkk 1.75 per share on 29 january 
2021 in connection with the publication of the 
fy 2020 results. the q4 dividend is proportion-
ate to the dividend for the first nine month paid 
in november, and also in line with the policy of 
paying a stable quarterly dividend.
own funds totalled dkk 8,884m (dkk 8,119m) 
at the end of 2020. own funds were primarily 
positively impacted by the net profit, and nega-
tively impacted by the ordinary dividend. 
tryg’s own funds mainly consist of shareholders’ 
equity, intangibles (fully deducted), tier 2 instru-
ments (subordinated debt and the norwegian 
natural perils pool), tier 1 instruments and 
future profits. most of tryg’s own funds consist 
of shareholders’ equity. tier 2 capacity has been 
fully utilised, while tier 2 bonds in the amount 
of dkk 147m are currently not included in own 
funds, as they exceed the 50% solvency capital 
requirement (scr). tier 1 capacity has also been 
almost fully utilised, with dkk 261m remaining 
at year-end 2020.
tryg’s solvency ratio displays low sensitivity to 
capital market movements. the area with the 
highest level of sensitivity is spread risk, where a 
widening/tightening of 100 basis points would 
impact the solvency ratio by approximately 20 
percentage points. sensitivities towards falling 
equity market and interest rate movements are 
low.
tryg calculates its scr based on a partial 
internal model in accordance with the danish 
financial supervisory authority’s executive 
order on solvency and operating plans for 
insurance companies. the model is based on 
the structure of the standard model. tryg uses 
an internal model to assess insurance risks, 
while other risks are calculated using standard 
model components. tryg’s scr, calculated using 
the partial internal model, was dkk 4,855m at 
the end of 2020 compared to dkk 5,021m at 
the end of 2019. the lower scr in 2020 has 
primarily been driven by the fsa approval of the 
company’s revised partial internal model in april

86.3. the underlying claims ratio improved 
0.6 percentage points for the group and 0.2 
percentage points for private. the pre-tax result 
was dkk 1,223m, and the after-tax result was 
dkk 1,038m. tryg pays a quarterly dividend of 
dkk 1.75 per share (dkk 529m) and reports a 
solvency ratio of 183.
premiums 
premium growth was 7.4%, driven by positive 
organic growth, higher retention levels and sat-
isfactory sale of new products. premium growth 
mostly stemmed from the private segment, es-
pecially in norway, but the commercial business 
also experienced a positive development. cor-
porate reported a broadly flat top-line develop-
ment, with price increases being pushed through 
across all geographies to improve profitability. 
claims
the claims ratio (net) was 72.3. large claims 
of dkk 201m (dkk 98m) were higher than last 
year and higher compared to a normal quarter 
(dkk 137m), while weather claims of dkk 
148m (dkk 94m) were also higher than last 
year, but below a normal q4, which ordinarily 
would be characterised by relatively harsh scan-
dinavian weather conditions. the run-off result 
was dkk 314m (dkk 256m). the underlying 
claims ratio improved 0.6 percentage points 
for the group and 0.2 percentage points for the 
private segment. in the last quarter of the year, 
further restrictions were introduced due to a 
new outbreak of covid-19, which has resulted 
in lower economic activity, impacting claims 
frequencies in selected lines of business. the 
overall impact has been quantified to dkk 52m. 
in q4, weather claims were impacted by a land-
slide in norway on 30 december with an impact 
of approximate dkk 100m for tryg. 
2020, which reduced the scr by approximately 
dkk 400m. the reduction in the scr was driven 
by the inclusion of sweden in the model, thereby 
increasing the diversification benefit, while some 
marginally lower capital charges for the non-life 
risks were also included as part of a general 
review and update of the model. based on the 
standard formula, tryg’s scr was dkk 6,608m 
compared to dkk 6,293m at the end of 2019. 
dividend policy 
tryg’s dividend policy targets a nominal, stable 
increase in dividend payments on a full-year 
basis. a total dividend of dkk 7.00 per share will 
be paid out for 2020 (dkk 6.80 in 2019). after 
the significant negative impact of covid-19 in 
q1 2020, tryg announced an annual dividend 
decision instead of quarterly dividend payment. 
however, despite challenging times, tryg's 
business model proved very resilient, and it was 
decided to pay out a dividend of dkk 5.25 per 
share for the first three quarters of 2020. tryg 
will pay a q4 dividend per share of 1.75. the 
full-year dividend will amount to dkk 2,115m, 
or 76% of the profit for the year.
results q4 2020
the technical result was dkk 780m (dkk 762m), 
driven by a positive development in the underly-
ing claims ratio, the delivery of alka synergies and 
lower claims frequencies driven by covid-19. 
these have broadly offset a significantly higher 
level of large and weather claims in q4 2020 
compared to q4 2019. investment income was 
dkk 513m (dkk 198m), primarily driven by very 
robust equity markets, but also by strong returns 
from corporate bonds. in general, all assets class-
es in the free portfolio posted good returns.
the claims ratio (net) was 72.3, the expense 
ratio was 14.0, and the combined ratio was

the reported expense ratio was 14.0 (14.6). 
various initiatives aimed at lowering distribution 
costs are being implemented, and some of the 
savings from these initiatives are being invested 
in new digital solutions and partnerships. by 
reporting an expense ratio of 14,1 for fy 2020, 
tryg delivers its fy 2020 expense ratio target.
investments 
the investment return totalled dkk 513m (dkk

of dkk 17m (dkk 19m) on the match portfolio, 
and other financial income and expenses of dkk 
-17m (dkk -47m). the primary driver of the 
strong investment return in q4 is the performance 
of equities, which were up 14% (7.5%), while cor-
porate bonds also generated very good returns.

private sells insurance products to private individuals in den-
mark  and norway. sales are effected via call centres, the internet, 
tryg’s own agents, alka (denmark), franchisees (norway), inter-
est organisations, car dealers, estate agents and danske bank 
branches.  
results 2020
the technical result for 2020 was dkk 2,045m 
(dkk 1,951m), with a combined ratio of 83.9 
(83.7). the result was attributable to a combina-
tion of higher premium growth in both denmark 
and norway and slightly improved underlying 
claims ratio development and net positive im-
pact from covid-19. 
premiums 
gross premium income was up 9.0% (7.8% in 
2019 excluding alka) in local currencies, which 
was attributable to growth in both denmark and 
norway. the growth was mainly driven by con-
tinued high retention levels in the danish and 
norwegian private segments, strong develop-
ments in partner agreements and cross-selling 
to existing customers primarily in denmark. the 
partner agreements driving growth in norway 
were primarily obos, norwegian society of en-
gineers and technologists (nito) and a car sales 
channel (enter). growth was achieved through 
the development of innovative solutions and 
products tailored especially to the members of 
the various partner organisations.
the retention rate in denmark decreased from 
91.6 to 90.1 due to the termination of the nordea 
agreement, which naturally led to a higher churn 
level. excluding nordea churn, the retention rate 
was 91.3. the higher level of churn was more than 
mitigated by new sales from the danske bank 
agreement. the sales to danske bank customers 
do not impact the retention rate as they are new 
sales, and will only impact the rentetion rate in the 
second year and onwards. in norway, the retention 
rate increased from 87.1 to an all-time high of 88.4. 
claims 
the gross claims ratio totalled 69.7 (68.1), while 
the claims ratio, net of ceded business was 70.3 
(70.0). the underlying claims level improved by 
0.2 percentage points, which was attributable 
to the claims excellence programme and price 
adjustments aimed at mitigating increased 
claims inflation. the underlying claims ratio im-
provement was somewhat lower than last year 
due to the high organic premium growth and 
the fact that new customers have an approxi-
mately 3% higher claims frequency than existing 
customers. weather claims were on par with 
2019 levels and primarily related to norway. 
covid-19 had a limited positive impact of 1.0%, 
with travel insurance impacting negatively and 
motor, content and accident insurance impacting 
positively. in q4, weather claims were impacted 
by a landslide in norway on 30 december with 
an impact of approximate dkk 60m for tryg.
the business area accounts for 56% of

expenses 
the expense ratio for private was 13.6 (13.7), 
which was in line with the previous year. the 
expenses were impacted by commissions due 
to high premium growth that were mitigated 
through initiatives to reduce distribution costs. 
a key initiative was an increase in the number 
of very efficient private sales agents and gener-
ally increased efficiency for the sales channels. 
total employee numbers increased from 1,317 
at the end of 2019 to 1,344 in 2020, reflecting 
a continued focus on efficiency, but also an 
increase especially in distribution. 
results q4 2020
the technical result totalled dkk 537m (dkk 
494m), with a combined ratio of 83.3 (83.8). 
the higher technical result was due primarily to 
a higher level of premium income and positive 
impacts from covid-19. the underlying claims 
ratio improved by 0.2 percentage points in line 
with developments in the previous quarters. 
premiums
gross premiums increased by 9.0% (16.2% in 
q4 2019 including alka, and 7.6% excluding 
alka). in q4, tryg reported continued high 
growth levels in denmark and norway for the 
reasons as described for the full-year develop-
ment. the retention rate in denmark de-
creased from 91.6 to 90.1 due to churn from 
the nordea agreement, which was more than 
off-set by sales to danske bank customers. in 
norway, the retention rate increased from 87.1 
to 88.4. 
claims
the gross claims ratio was 68.1 (67.9), and the 
claims ratio, net of ceded business, was 70.5 
(70.4). the underlying claims ratio improved 
by 0.2 percentage points and was positively 
impacted by the claims excellence programme 
and alka synergies, but also a slightly negative 
impact from the high growth due to higher 
claims frequencies for new customers. in q4, 
weather claims were impacted by a landslide 
in norway on 30 december with an impact of 
approximate dkk 60m.
expenses 
the expense ratio was 12.8 (13.4), somewhat 
lower than q4 prior year period, impacted by 
high commissions due to high level of sales 
and improved distribution efficiency in general.

commercial
commercial sells insurance products to small and medium-sized 
businesses in denmark and norway. sales are effected via tryg’s 
own sales force, brokers, alka  (denmark), franchisees (norway), 
customer centres as well as group agreements. 
results 2020
the technical result for 2020 was dkk 735m 
(dkk 566m), with a combined ratio of 83.3 
(86.8). the combined ratio was positively 
affected by an improved underlying claims 
ratio, a lower level of large and weather claims 
and lower frequency for some lines of business 
because of covid-19. the development in pre-
miums improved significantly in both denmark 
and norway, driven by improved sales levels in 
denmark and price adjustments in norway to 
improve profitability. 
premiums 
the development in gross premium income 
was a positive 6.0% (8.3% in 2019, impacted by 
alka) in local currencies with an improvement 
in both the danish and norwegian commercial 
business areas. commercial denmark reported 
a positive development in customer numbers, 
driven by both own sales agents and improved 
sales from the broker sales channel. commer-
cial denmark has a strong focus on rebalancing 
its portfolio with a higher proportion of small 
commercial customers and a lower proportion 
of large commercial customers as this supports 
the focus on profitability. in norway, premium 
development was positively impacted by price 
adjustments, particularly for large commercial 
customers, which were widely accepted by the 
customers.
the retention rate for commercial denmark was 
unchanged at 88.6 compared to the prior-year 
period, while in norway the retention rate in-
creased from 89.0 to 89.2. the positive develop-
ments in denmark and norway are attributable 
to a strong customer focus, while the customer 
bonus model also supported the development 
in denmark. 
claims 
the gross claims ratio was 62.9 (67.1), with 
a claims ratio, net of ceded business of 66.2 
(69.3). the lower claims level was helped by an 
improvement in the underlying clams ratio, a 
lower level of large and weather claims and a 
positive impact from covid-19 due to lower 
claims frequencies for business lines such as 
motor, accident and workers' compensation. in 
q4, weather claims were impacted by a land-
slide in norway on 30 december with an impact 
of approximate dkk 20m for tryg.

expenses 
the expense ratio for commercial was 17.1 
(17.5). the lower level was helped by improved 
distribution efficiency, especially in denmark 
through the use of independent sales agents 
with much lower costs per sale. in norway, the 
improved retention rate and high acceptance 
of price adjustments supported a positive 
development in the expense ratio. total em-
ployee numbers were up from 495 at the end 
of 2019 to 538 in 2020.
results q4 2020 
the technical result was dkk 153m (dkk 
105m), with a combined ratio of 86.4 (90.3). 
the result was negatively affected by a sub-
stantial increase in the level of large claims, 
but also positively impacted by a much higher 
level of run-off. premium growth increased by 
7.2% (4.8%). 
premiums
gross premiums increased by 7.2% (4.8%) in 
local currencies, primarily due to increased 
customer numbers in denmark and price 
adjustments in norway. the retention rate in 
denmark was stable at 88.6 (88.6), while the 
retention rate in norway increased signifi-
cantly to 89.2 (89.0) due to a strong focus on 
customer loyalty.
claims 
the gross claims ratio was 64.9 (69.1), with 
a claims ratio, net of ceded business, of 68.2 
(72.8). the claims ratio was impacted by a 
higher level of large claims mainly related to 
fires and also a substantially higher level of 
run-offs compared to prior-year period. in q4, 
weather claims were impacted by a landslide 
in norway on 30 december with an impact of 
approximate dkk 20m for tryg.
expenses 
the expense ratio was somewhat higher at 
18.2 (17.4), which did not represent a trend 
but reflected volatile expense pattern.

corporate sells insurance products to corporate customers 
under the brands ‘tryg’ in denmark and norway, ‘moderna’ in 
sweden and ‘tryg garanti’. sales are effected both via tryg’s own 
sales force and via insurance brokers. moreover, customers with 
international insurance needs are served by corporate through 
its cooperation with the axa group. 
results 2020
the technical result was dkk 464m (dkk 
496m), with a combined ratio of 88.0 (87.6). the 
result was positively affected by an under-
lying improvement, a slightly higher level of 
large claims and a slightly higher run-off level. 
premiums were up 1.4% (2.0%), impacted by 
price hikes in norway, denmark and sweden 
to improve profitability, and a high retention 
level in denmark, driven by the member bonus 
model. even though the underlying profitability 
is increasing, tryg will still have to improve profit-
ability in all countries and will therefore continue 
to implement profitability actions in all countries 
in 2021, which might reduce premium income, 
depending on market conditions. 
premiums 
gross premium income was up 1.4% (2.0%) 
in local currencies. an increase of around 
3.6% was seen in denmark, impacted by 
price adjustments of approximately 10% and 
continued positive developments for the credit 
and surety business (tryg garanti) and a high 
retention level. in corporate norway, premiums 
decreased by 3.6%, primarily due to price hikes 
of approximately 14% (excluding fronting and 
captive agreements). in sweden, which accounts 
for only 20% of the total corporate business, 
premium growth was 5.1% and was also impact-
ed by profitability initiatives of approximately 8% 
resulting in a loss of customers. 
claims 
the gross claims ratio totalled 69.5 (70.8), and 
the claims ratio, net of ceded business, was 76.6 
(77.2). the claims ratio was impacted by price 
initiatives improving the underlying claims ratio 
in all countries, a higher level of large claims and 
a larger level of run-off gains. the claims ratio 
was slightly negatively impacted by covid-19 
with some positive impact for certain lines of 
business, e.g. travel insurance and workers' com-
pensation. the claims ratio was also impacted by 
a few claims in tryg garanti related to covid-19. 
as mentioned, tryg will continue to focus on 
improving profitability in all countries as prof-
itability remains challenging in the corporate 
segment, considering a combined ratio of 109.1 
excluding run-offs. tryg plans further important

the group’s total premium income.

profitability initiatives to be implemented in 
2021. in q4, weather claims were impacted by 
a lanslide in norway on 30 december with an 
impact of approximate dkk 15m for tryg.
expenses 
the expense ratio for corporate was 11.4 
(10.4) and was quite stable throughout the 
year. the low expense ratio is driven by high 
average premiums in the corporate segment, 
leading to relatively low administration costs 
in per cent of premiums, and by the fact that 
brokers are paid by customers. employee 
numbers were almost unchanged from 290 at 
the end of 2019 to 291 in 2020.
results q4 2020 
the technical result was dkk -6m (dkk 73m), 
with a combined ratio of 100.5 (92.6). the 
results were positively impacted by an improved 
underlying claims ratio, but negatively impacted 
by a higher level of large and weather claims, a 
slightly lower level of run-off and a negative net 
impact from covid-19 claims due to a single 
claim in tryg garanti. premium growth was a 
slightly positive 2.0% (1.1%) and was impacted 
by price adjustments and growth in tryg garanti.
premiums 
gross premiums were up 2.0% (1.1%) in local 
currencies due to a combination of price 
adjustments and churn because of these 
initiatives. tryg continues to see a positive pre-
mium development in tryg garanti, primarily 
because of the expansion in germany, austria 
and the netherlands. 
claims 
the gross claims ratio was 79.9 (86.1), and the 
claims ratio, net of ceded business, was 87.0 
(80.4). the higher claims ratio was primar-
ily caused by a higher level of large claims, 
negative covid-19 impact and a lower level of 
run-off. the underlying claims ratio improved 
based on the above initiatives in norway, den-
mark and sweden.
expenses 
the expense ratio was 13.5 (12.1) and some-
what higher than q4 2019 and higher than the 
full year, which however did not represent a 
trend but rather reflected volatility in costs.

sweden sells insurance products to private customers under the 
‘moderna’ brand. moreover, insurance is sold under the brands 
atlantica, bilsport & mc and moderna djurförsäkringar. sales 
take place through its own sales force, call centres, partners and 
online. 
results 2020
sweden reported a technical result of dkk 
268m (dkk 231m) and a combined ratio of 
83.2 (84.8). the lower combined ratio was 
driven by a lower expense ratio, and as planned 
there was also an improved underlying claims 
ratio due to price adjustments, especially for 
motor insurance. the high level of run-off gains 
reflects a strong reserving position in the motor 
third-party liability segment. the underlying 
profitability for the current underwriting year 
with a normalised run-off level is still not satis-
factory. premium growth in 2020 was primarily 
due to acceptance of price adjustments and 
organic growth for atlantica, the niche area for 
boat insurance.
premiums
gross premium income totalled dkk 1,604m 
(dkk 1,521m), equating to growth of 4.9% 
(6.1%) in local currencies. growth was especially 
attributable to motor insurance as a result of 
widespread acceptance of price adjustments 
to improve the claims ratio for this product. 
during the covid-19 pandemic, tryg has seen 
a big increase in the demand for boat insurance 
as many people were ‘staycationing’ in sweden 
instead of travelling abroad. atlantica, which is a 
niche brand in private sweden for boat insur-
ance, is a very profitable segment.
claims
the gross claims ratio was 66.5 (66.6), and the 
claims ratio, net of ceded business was 66.4 
(67.3). in 2020, prices for motor insurance were 
adjusted to improve profitability, and this led to 
an improved underlying claims ratio for private 
sweden. profitability, assuming a normalised 
run-off level, remains challenging, and initiatives 
to improve profitability will therefore continue 
in 2021. the strong run-off result reflects a very 
solid reserves position in the long-tail motor 
segment.
expenses
the expense ratio was 16.8 (17.5), which is a 
somewhat lower level than the previous year. 
expenses were impacted by one-off costs 
related to organisational restructuring in 2020. 
employee numbers in sweden were up by 23 
compared to the prior-year period, totalling 
323 at the end of 2020, primarily because of an 
increase in inbound sales. 
the business area accounts for 7% of  
the group’s total premium income.

dkk 96m (dkk 90m), with an expense ratio 
of 13.9 (21.5) and a combined ratio of 75.7 
(75.3). 
premiums
gross premium income was dkk 393m (dkk 
364m), or 5.6% (3.3%) in local currencies. the 
primary growth driver was the price adjust-
ments implemented for motor insurance to 
improve profitability, but also strong sales 
from the inbound channel and improved distri-
bution from danske bank.
claims
the gross claims ratio was 61.3 (53.1) and 
net of ceded business 61.6 (53.8). the higher 
claims level was primarily due to a lower level 
of run-off gains at 21.4% compared to 29.5% 
for the prior-year period. 
expenses
the expense ratio was 13.9 (21.5) and was 
impacted by adjustments relating to previous

the investment return totalled dkk 311m  (dkk 
579m) for the fy 2020, driven by  a return of 
dkk 585m (dkk 857m) on the free portfolio, a 
return of dkk -19m (dkk -42m) on the match 
portfolio, and other financial income and ex-
penses of dkk -255m (dkk -236m).
the total market value of tryg’s investment 
portfolio was dkk 40.5bn (dkk 40bn) at year-
end 2020. the investment portfolio consists of a 
match portfolio  of dkk 28.1bn (dkk 29bn) and 
a free portfolio of dkk 12.4bn (dkk 11bn). the 
match portfolio is composed of low-risk fixed-in-
come assets that match the group’s insurance 
liabilities, so that fluctuations resulting from 
interest rate changes are offset to the greatest 
possible extent. the free portfolio reflects the 
group’s capital, which is predominantly invested 
in fixed-income securities with a short duration, 
but also in equities and properties.
free portfolio 
financial markets experienced a highly volatile 
year due to the outbreak of covid-19 in march 
and the resulting macroeconomic worries 
followed by a strong recovery in the following 
quarters. equity markets were down 25-30% 
during the second half of march, but finished 
the year up 13%, an unprecedented rollercoast-
er. macroeconomic worries were dominant in 
february and march, while large government 
spending programmes across the globe have 
mitigated the impact on employment levels but 
obviously increased public borrowing levels, 
which in some cases were already very high. 
the start of covid-19 vaccination programmes 
just after christmas has given hope for a rapidly 
improved outlook for 2021 although the winter 
months are likely to remain very challenging.   
tryg’s equity portfolio reported a return of dkk

the return on equities explains around half the 
difference between investment returns in 2019 
and 2020. the credit bonds portfolio also 
produced a good return of dkk 136m (6.3%) 
even though it was lower than in 2019 (10.8%), 
primarily due by falling rates throughout most 
of the year and tightening credit spreads. the 
return on the investment property portfolio 
was dkk 64m (dkk 159m in 2019 driven by 
revaluations of dkk 68m in q4), or 2.7%. 
equity and property investments totalled dkk 
5.4bn, while approximately dkk 2.3bn were 
invested in corporate bonds. some dkk 3.8bn 
were primarily invested in nordic covered 
bonds and government bonds, including infla-
tion-linked bonds, where current yields remain 
negative, putting downward pressure on the 
return on the free portfolio and the overall 
investment income. finally, an amount corre-
sponding to just under dkk 1bn was invested 
in diversifying alterative assets.

match portfolio 
the result of the match portfolio is the differ-
ence between the return on the match portfolio 
and the amount transferred to the technical 
result. the result can be split into a 'regulato-
ry deviation' and a ’performance result’. the 
regulatory deviation was dkk -48m (dkk -73m) 
for fy 2020, driven primarily by the increased 
yield spread between the fsa/eiopa discount-
ing curve (in eur) and the assets side invested 
in danish kroner. the performance result was 
dkk 29m (dkk 31m) as nordic covered-bond 
spreads narrowed slightly.
other financial income and expenses 
other financial income and expenses is primarily 
characterised by interest expenses related to 
outstanding subordinated debt, the cost of 
currency hedges to protect shareholders’ equity 
and the cost of running investment operations. 
other financial income and expenses totalled 
dkk -255m (dkk -236m). tryg has previously  
announced that this line should report a result 
of approximately dkk -60m per quarter after 
which the overall amount for 2020 is broadly in 
line with expectations.
investment result in q4 2020 
the last quarter of 2020 was characterised by 
positive developments, especially in the equity 
markets. tryg’s equity portfolio returned dkk 
307m or 14.0%. the last three months of 2020 
were characterised by the us presidential 
elections and by increased hope for vaccination 
programmes related to covid-19 that finally 
started towards the end of december. mac-
roeconomic worries abated slightly although 
the first months of 2021 are still likely to be 
problematic. 
the credit bonds portfolio returned a very 
positive result of dkk 113m (dkk 27m) or 5.0%, 
with most fixed-income asset classes posting 
very strong returns driven by a risk-on rally, 
primarily on the back of better covid-19 news.

management’s review - contents
solvency and dividend
risk management is a key function in tryg. the 
assessment and management of tryg’s aggre-
gated risk and associated capital requirement 
constitutes a core element in the management 
of the company.
risk management is based on tryg’s targets and 
strategies and the risk exposure limits decided 
by the supervisory board. tryg’s supervisory 
board defines the framework for the compa-
ny’s target risk appetite and thereby the capital 
which must be available to cover any losses.
solvency ii
the solvency ii regime (introduced at the begin-
ning of 2016) emphasises the need for sound 
risk management and has introduced additional 
requirements concerning risk governance, con-
sistency across the group and top management 
reporting and involvement. tryg has implement-
ed a risk governance structure in full compliance 
with solvency ii. in addition to the solvency ii 
requirements, tryg has chosen to appoint a 
special risk committee consisting of members 
from the supervisory board. tryg has chosen to 
implement a partial internal model, approved 
by the danish fsa, which models insurance 
risk while all other modules are based on the 
standard formula. 
insurance risk  
the insurance risk is controlled by limiting the 
size of single exposures and through the use of 
reinsurance, thereby capping the cost of large 
and weather-related claims. additionally, the 
insurance risk is managed through geograph-
ical limitations and by refraining from offering 
certain types of insurance such as aviation and 
marine hull insurance. operating within these 
boundaries, tryg’s risk depends on the com-
pany’s choice of exposure within different seg-
ments and industries in the insurance market. 
tryg operates in relatively stable markets, while 
slightly more than 80% of premiums are in the 
private and commercial (smes) segments. quar-
terly fluctuations are driven mainly by large and 
weather-related events, and reinsurance is used 
extensively to stabilise the overall earnings level.
investment risk
invested assets are split into a match portfolio 
(dkk 28.1bn) and a free portfolio (dkk 12.4bn). 
the objective is for the return on the match port-
folio to be as close as possible to zero as capital 
gains and losses on the assets side should be 
mirrored by corresponding developments on the 
liabilities side. the free portfolio is intended to 
produce the maximum risk-adjusted return. the 
investment risk associated with the free portfolio 
is managed through limits on exposure within 
single asset classes.
capital management 
capital management and capital modelling 
are key functions in tryg. capital management 
covers broadly the company’s current and future 
capital requirements, capital allocation to the 
different lines of business and required returns, 
dividends outlook, and the ability of the compa-
ny to meet its own return on equity target. 
tryg’s solvency ratio is a function of develop-
ments in own funds and the solvency capital 
requirement (based on the approved partial 
internal model). as mentioned previously, tryg 
has modelled the insurance risk internally, while 
all other modules are based on the standard for-
mula. the capital model is based on tryg’s risk 
profile and takes into consideration the compo-
sition of tryg’s insurance portfolio, geograph-
ical diversification, its claims reserves profile, 
reinsurance programme, investments mix and 
overall level of profitability. the solvency ratio 
was 183 as per year-end 2020, up from 162 at 
the end of 2019. 
the key components of tryg’s own funds are 
shareholders’ equity, qualifying debt instru-
ments (both tier 1 and tier 2 debt) and future 
profit, while all intangibles are deducted in the 
calculation. the debt capacity has been virtually 
fully utilised, and at the end of 2020 some dkk 
147m of tier 2 instruments are not included in 
own funds as they exceed the 50% scr limit. 
own funds totalled 8,884m at the end of 2020 
against dkk 8,119m at the end of 2019, the pri-
mary drivers of the change in own funds having 
been profits and dividends. 
the solvency capital requirement (scr) is 
calculated in a way that tryg should be able to 
honour its obligations in 199 out of 200 years, 
and is regularly stress-tested. in other words, at 
the end of 2020, tryg’s scr was dkk 4,855m, 
down slightly less than dkk 200m since the end 
of 2019. the lower scr is primarily driven by the 
solvency capital requirement

danish fsa’s approval of tryg’s updated internal 
model in april, which included the swedish 
business, thereby increasing the diversification 
benefit, while some marginally lower capital 
charges for non-life risks were also included.
tryg’s solvency ratio continues to display low 
sensitivity towards capital market movements. 
fixed-income securities represent some 90% of 
tryg’s invested assets, and the highest solven-
cy sensitivity is therefore towards spread risk, 
where a widening/tightening of 100 basis points 
will impact the solvency ratio by 20 percentage 
points. lower sensitivity is displayed towards 
equity market falls and interest rate fluctua-
tions. additional changes in the ufr (ultimate 
forward rate) will have a negligible impact due 
to the relatively short duration of tryg’s liabilities 
(approximately four years on average).
ordinary and extraordinary dividend
the supervisory board regularly assesses capital 
structure in light of future internal earnings fore-
casts and balance sheet needs. the projections 
include initiatives set out in the company’s strat-
egy for the coming years and are based also on 
the most significant risks identified by the com-
pany. adequacy is measured in relation to tryg’s 
strategic targets, including return on equity and 
dividend policy. tryg will pay a q4 dividend of 
dkk 1.75 per share on 29 january 2021, after 
having paid a dividend for the first nine month of 
5.25 per share immediately after the q3 results. 
the full-year dividend amounts to dkk 7.00 per 
share, equivalent to the total distribution of just 
above dkk 2.1bn.
moody’s rating
tryg has an ‘a1’ (stable outlook) insurance finan-
cial strength (ifsr) rating from moody’s. the 
rating agency highlights tryg’s strong position in 
the nordic p&c market, robust profitability, very 
good asset quality and relatively low financial 
leverage. moody’s also assigned an ‘a3’ rating to 
tryg’s subordinated debt and a ‘baa3’ rating to 
tryg’s tier 1 debt. the ratings were re-affirmed 
in autumn 2020 following the offer made by 
tryg and intact financial corporation (intact) to 
acquire rsa insurance group pls (rsa), whereby 
tryg would acquire rsa’s swedish and norwe-
gian operations, and tryg and intact would co-
own rsa’s danish business on a 50/50 econom-
ic participation. moody’s expects the acquisition 
to further increase and broaden tryg’s earnings 
base in the long term. furthermore, tryg’s lever-
age will reduce meaningfully in the short term.

investor information
investor relations (ir) is responsible for tryg’s 
communication with the capital markets. it is 
important that investors, analysts and other 
stakeholders can form a true and fair view of 
developments, including tryg’s financial results. 
for this reason, tryg’s ir team strives to be as 
open and transparent as possible to ensure that 
stakeholders’ information requirements are met 
at the highest possible level. ir is in charge of the 
communication with equity investors, fixed-in-
come investors and rating agencies. 
after the publication of quarterly and annual re-
ports, tryg’s management and ir team ordinarily 
travel extensively to meet with shareholders and 
potential investors. quarterly analyst presenta-
tions are held in copenhagen and london. tryg 
also attends investor meetings and various 
financial conferences on a local and global basis. 
as a result of covid-19, the majority of the 
analyst and investor meetings and financial con-
ferences were held virtually in 2020. the tryg 
share is currently covered by 20 analysts, who 
continuously update their recommendations 
and earnings forecasts. tryg hosts an annual 
analyst day, while more in-depth capital market 
days are hosted every three years. as a result of 
the recommended acquisition of rsa’s scandi-
navian business, tryg has decided to postpone 
the capital markets day originally planned for 
28 january 2021 to the autumn. a new date will 
be published in due course.
the tryg share
the tryg share is listed on nasdaq copenha-
gen. company announcements and trading 
announcements are published in both danish 
and english, whereas interim reports and annual 
reports are published in english. 
the tryg share started the year at a price of 
dkk 196.4 and ended 2020 at dkk 192.1. the 
total return (price and dividends) of the share 
was a positive 1.4% (for comparison purposes 
the european insurance index (sxip) had a 
reported total return of -10.9% in 2020). the 
insurance sector’s key attraction is its dividend 
yield. earnings and solvency are always carefully 
scrutinised by investors. in the world of solvency 
ll, changes in solvency levels can be more diffi-
cult to predict and often difficult to understand. 
tryg has a relatively simple business model and 
a transparent capital position, which is highly 
appreciated by analysts and investors. 
share capital and ownership
tryg’s share capital totalled dkk 1,510,739,955 
on 31 december 2020. it comprises one share 
class (302,147,991 shares with a nominal value 
of dkk 5), and all shares rank pari passu. the 
majority shareholder, tryghedsgruppen smba, 
owns 53% of the shares and is the only share-
holder holding more than 5% of the share capital. 
tryghedsgruppen invests in peace of mind and 
healthcare providers in the nordic region and 
supports non-profit-making activities. 
quarterly dividends
tryg started paying quarterly dividends in 2017. 
the tryg share has a distinct income profile in 
that the business generally grows in line with 
gdp, producing high margins, which are mostly 
returned to shareholders. the prolonged period 
of very low interest rates in the wake of the 
financial crisis means that investors, all else 
being equal, attach even greater importance to 
dividends than in a more normal environment.
this is particularly true for insurance investors 
as insurance is one of the sectors offering the 
highest dividend yield. from an investment per-
spective, a quarterly dividend is a clear reminder 
of the high profitability of tryg’s business and 
the company’s focus on returning capital to 
shareholders. tryg’s dividend policy is based on 
the following assumptions: 
•   an aspiration to distribute a steadily increasing 
dividend in nominal terms on a full-year basis. 
•   a general objective of creating long-term value 
for the company’s shareholders. 
•   a competitive dividend policy in comparison 
with the policies of our nordic competitors. 
•  annual distribution of 60-90% of our profit 
after tax. 
•  the capital level must at all times reflect our 
return-on-equity targets and statutory capital 
requirements.
•  the capital level may be adjusted via extraordi-
nary dividends.
tryghedsgruppen
in 2020 and for the fifth year 
running, tryg’s majority share-
holder, tryghedsgruppen, paid 
out a member bonus to tryg 
and alka customers in denmark 
corresponding to 8% of the an-
nual premiums paid for 2019.
trygfonden
trygfonden is the leading and 
most well-known peace-of-
mind supporter in denmark, 
supporting around 800 activi-
ties that contribute to creating 
peace of mind, such as coastal 
lifeguards, cuddle bears for 
children at hospitals and defi-
brillators. behind trygfonden is 
tryghedsgruppen, which owns 
53% of the shares in tryg and 
annually contributes around 
dkk 650m to projects that cre-
ate peace of mind in all parts of 
denmark.

in march 2020, tryg announced that it was 
moving to a full-year dividend decision for 2020 
due to market volatility and the general macro-
economic backdrop. tryg’s business model has 
proved resilient even in very challenging times, 
and the company’s balance sheet and solvency 
position have remained very healthy throughout 
this period. in november 2020, the supervisory 
board approved the payment of the q1-q3 2020 
ordinary dividend. 
annual general meeting 
tryg’s annual general meeting will be held virtual 
on 26 march 2021 at 15:00 cet.
the notice will be advertised in the daily press in

dialogue between tryg, shareholders and other 
stakeholders
tryg’s investor relations (ir) department main-
tains regular contact with analysts and investors.
together with the executive board, ir organ-
ises investor meetings, conference calls and 
participates in conferences in denmark and 
abroad. due to the outbreak of covid-19, most 
meetings were held virtually in 2020. ir also 
communicates with stakeholders on social 
media via twitter@trygir. 
the supervisory board is informed about the 
dialogue with investors and other stakeholders 
on a regular basis. tryg has an ir policy, which 
states that all company announcements are 
published in danish and english. tryg publishes 
quarterly interim reports in english. further-
more, tryg publishes an annual profile in danish, 
english and norwegian. the profile is addressed 
to tryg’s private shareholders, customers, 
employees and other stakeholders and will be 
published on 9 february 2021. 
moreover, tryg prepares quarterly investor 
presentations, which are used in our dialogue 
with investors and analysts. tryg also publishes 
ir newsletters on relevant topics on a regular 
basis. all announcements, financial reports, 
presentations and newsletters are available at 
tryg.com. this material provides all stakeholders 
with a comprehensive picture of tryg’s position 
and performance. 
the consolidated financial statements are 
presented in accordance with ifrs. at tryg.com, 
stakeholders are invited to subscribe to press 
releases, company announcements as well as 
trading announcements by insiders. a number of 
internal guidelines ensure that the disclosure of 
price-sensitive information complies with legis-
lation and stock exchange codes of conduct. tryg 
has adopted a number of policies describing the 
relationship between different stakeholders.

annual general meeting
tryg holds an annual general meeting (agm) 
every year. as required by the danish compa-
nies act and tryg’s articles of association, the 
agm is convened via a company announcement 
and at tryg.com subject to at least three weeks’ 
notice. shareholders may also opt to receive 
the notice by post or email. the notice contains 
information about time and venue as well as an 
agenda for the meeting.
all shareholders are encouraged to attend the 
agm. the agm is normally held by personal 
attendance as the supervisory board values 
personal contact with the group’s shareholders. 
shareholders may propose items to be includ-
ed on the agenda for the agm and may ask 
questions before and at the meeting. sharehold-
ers may vote in person at the agm, by post or 
appoint the supervisory board or a third party 
as their proxy. shareholders may consider each 
item on the agenda. the proxy form and form for 
voting by post are available at tryg.com prior to 
the agm.
in 2020, the general meeting differed from 
prior years due to covid-19. in light of tryg’s 
responsibility for the safety of shareholders, 
employees and management and the danish 
authorities’ measures to control the risk of infec-
tion with covid-19, tryg decided to livestream 
the general meeting and recommended that 
neither shareholders nor their advisors attended 
the agm in person, thus enabling the agm to 
be held with a minimum of physical attendance. 
instead, tryg encouraged all shareholders to 
submit questions, make use of written votes or 
issue a proxy and to follow the general meeting 
via livestream rather than by physical attend-
ance. information on how to exercise sharehold-
ers’ rights at the agm were communicated to 
shareholders and published at tryg.com.
due to the recommended acquisition, an 
extraordinary general meeting (egm) was held 
on 18 december 2020. again, due to covid-19, 
tryg encouraged all shareholders to submit 
questions, make use of written votes or issue 
a proxy and to follow the general meeting via 
livestream rather than by physical attendance.
share and capital structure
tryg’s share capital comprises a single share 
class, and all shares rank pari passu. the major-
ity shareholder, tryghedsgruppen smba, owns 
53% of the shares and is the only shareholder 
owning more than 5% of the company’s shares. 
the supervisory board ensures that tryg’s 
capital structure is aligned with the needs of the 
group and the interests of its shareholders and 
that it complies with the requirements appli-
cable to tryg as a financial undertaking. tryg 
has adopted a capital plan and a contingency 
capital plan, which are reviewed annually by the 
supervisory board.
depending on the development in results, 
each year the supervisory board proposes the 
distribution of quarterly dividends, and possi-
bly an extraordinary annual dividend if further 
adjustment of the capital structure is required. in 
march 2020, tryg’s supervisory board decided 
to move to full-year dividends due to market 
volatility and the general macroeconomic 
backdrop. tryg’s business model has proved

have remained very healthy throughout this peri-
od. in november 2020, the supervisory board 
therefore approved the payment of the q1-q3 
2020 ordinary dividend.
duties, responsibilities and composition of the 
supervisory board
the supervisory board is responsible for the 
central strategic management and financial 
control of tryg and for ensuring that tryg’s 
business is organised in a robust way. this is 
achieved by monitoring targets and frameworks 
on the basis of regular and systematic reviews of 
strategy and risks. the executive board reports 
to the supervisory board on strategies and 
action plans, market developments and group 
performance, funding issues, capital resources 
and special risks.
the supervisory board holds one annual 
strategy seminar to decide on and/or adjust the 
group’s strategy with a view to sustaining value 
creation in the company. the executive board 
works with the supervisory board to ensure 
that the group’s strategy is developed and 
monitored. the supervisory board ensures that 
the necessary skills and financial resources are 
available for tryg to achieve its strategic targets. 
the supervisory board specifies its activities in 
a set of rules of procedure and an annual cycle 
for its work.
the current eight members of the supervisory 
board were elected by the annual general meet-
ing for a term of one year. of the eight members 
elected at the annual general meeting, five, and 
thus the majority, are independent persons, thus 
complying with recommendation 3.2.1. in the 
recommendations on corporate governance, 
while the other three members are dependent 
persons as they are appointed by tryg’s majority 
shareholder, tryghedsgruppen. see page 40 for 
information on when the individual members 
joined the supervisory board, were re-elected 
and when their current election period ends. to 
ensure the integration of new talent on the su-
pervisory board, members elected by the annual 
general meeting may hold office for a maximum 
of twelve years. the supervisory board has 12 
members in all, with an equal representation of 
men and women (currently including two male 
and two female employee representatives).
women are thus not underrepresented on tryg’s 
supervisory board, which is in compliance with 
legislation as well as tryg’s policy. the super-
visory board has members from denmark, 
sweden and norway.
see details about the independent board mem-
bers in the section supervisory board on pages 
40-42 and at tryg.com > governance
the supervisory board performs an annual 
evaluation of its work and skills to ensure that 
it possesses the expertise required to perform 
its duties in the best possible way. in addition 
to the annual self-evaluation, an assessment is 
facilitated with external assistance as a mini-
mum every three years to ensure objectivity in 
the evaluation process. the supervisory board 
focuses primarily on the following qualifications 
and skills: business judgement, problem solving, 
networking, risk management, succession 
management, general management, cfo/audit, 
people and organisation, business development, 
financial services, risk and regulatory matters, 
insurance – commercial and product, insurance 
– technical/financial modelling, digitalisation, 
value chain optimisation and customer journey. 
as part of the evaluation, the supervisory board 
also focuses on other executive positions and 
board memberships held by the members of the 
supervisory board, including the level of com-
mitment and workload associated with each 
position in order to prevent potential overboard-
ing. the evaluation is based on the individual 
board members’ ability to devote the neces-
sary time for preparation, their performance, 
attendance and participation at committee and 
board meetings in tryg. in 2020, the chair held 
five board seats in publicly listed companies. as 
a professional board member with more than 25 
years of relevant international experience com-
bined with a unique set of competencies, the 
chair, with his role as an independent chair at 
tryg, is a very valuable presence at supervisory 
board and committee meetings. the chair has 
been very dedicated to all board and committee 
meetings with a 100% attendance rate since he 
was elected as chair of the supervisory board 
in 2018. the chair has reduced the amounts of 
obligations in listed and non-listed companies in 
2020 and is continuously assessing his capabili-
ty to allocate the required time and energy to his 
actual board posts.
in early 2020, an evaluation with external assis-
tance was conducted, involving individual inter-
views with all board members and members of 
the executive management based on a ques-
tionnaire focusing on board competencies and 
performance. the overall conclusion was that 
tryg has a very good, value-adding and profes-
sional supervisory board that works efficiently 
and in accordance with sound governance 
principles. the evaluation resulted in a contin-
ued focus on securing succession on the board, 
proactively trimming the reporting process on 
tryg’s financial position, risk management and 
compliance in order to optimise meeting prepa-
rations as well as continued focus on the roles of 
the board committees and their output. further, 
the supervisory board decided to arrange a 
board education day on relevant matters. 
see cvs and descriptions of skills in the section 
supervisory board on pages 41-42 
and at tryg.com > governance
duties and composition of the executive board 
each year, the supervisory board reviews and 
adopts the rules of procedure of the superviso-
ry board and the executive board, comprising 
relevant policies, guidelines and instructions 
describing reporting requirements and require-
ments for communication with the executive 
board. financial legislation also requires the 
executive board to disclose all relevant infor-
mation to the supervisory board and report on 
compliance with limits defined by the superviso-
ry board and in legislation.
the supervisory board considers the compo-
sition, development, risk and succession plans 
of the executive board in connection with the 
annual evaluation of the executive board, and 
regularly in connection with board meetings. 
each year, the supervisory board discusses 
tryg’s activities to guarantee diversity at man-
agement levels. tryg attaches great importance 
to diversity at all management levels. tryg has 
prepared an action plan, which sets out specific 
targets to ensure diversity and equal opportu-
nities and access to management positions for 
qualified men and women. while tryg has made 
progress in recent years, the target for 2020 of

41% women at management level was not met. 
however, 50% of new appointments in manage-
ment positions were women in 2020. 
see the action plan at tryg.com 
board committees
tryg has an audit committee, a risk commit-
tee, a nomination committee, a remuneration 
committee and an it-data committee. the 
frameworks for the committees’ work are de-
fined in their terms of reference.
the board committees’ terms of reference can 
be found at tryg.com > governance > manage-
ment > supervisory board > board committees, 
including descriptions of members, meeting 
frequency, responsibilities and activities during 
the year.
see the tasks of the board committees in 2020 
at tryg.com > governance > management > 
supervisory board > board committees
all members of the audit committee and three 
out of four members of the risk committee, 
including the committee chair, are independent 
persons. three out of the five members of the 
remuneration committee are independent 
persons, including the committee chair. two out 
of three members of the nomination committee 
are independent, including the committee chair. 
two out of four members of the it-data com-
mittee are independent persons, including the 
committee chair. board committee members are 
elected primarily based on special skills that are 
considered important by the supervisory board.
involvement of the employee representatives in 
the committees is also considered important. 
the committees exclusively prepare matters for 
decision by the entire supervisory board.
the special skills of all members are also 
 described at tryg.com
remuneration of management
tryg has adopted a remuneration policy for tryg 
in general, which contains specific schemes 
for the supervisory board, the executive board 
and other employees in tryg, whose activities 
have a material impact on the risk profile of the 
company, risk takers. the remuneration policy 
for 2020 was adopted by the supervisory board 
in january 2020 and approved by the annual 
general meeting on 30 march 2020.

tryg’s remuneration policy each year in connec-
tion with the review of the annual report at the 
annual general meeting. the board’s proposal 
for the remuneration of the supervisory board 
for the current financial year is also submitted 
for approval by the shareholders at the annual 
general meeting.

in peer companies, taking into account the 
required skills, efforts and the scope of the su-
pervisory board’s work, including the number of 
meetings held. the remuneration received by the 
chair of the supervisory board is three times that 
received by ordinary members, while the deputy 
chair’s remuneration is twice that received by 
ordinary members of the supervisory board.
remuneration of the executive board
members of the executive board are employed 
on a contractual basis, and all terms of their 
remuneration are established by the supervisory 
board within the framework of the approved 
remuneration policy.
tryg wants to strike an appropriate balance 
between management remuneration, predict-
able risk and value creation for the company’s 
shareholders in the short and long term.
the executive board’s remuneration consists 
of a fixed basic salary, a pension contribution of 
25% of the base salary and other benefits. the 
base salary must be competitive and appro-
priate for the market and provide sufficient 
motivation for all members of the executive 
board to do their best to realise the company’s 
defined targets. 
the supervisory board can decide that the basic 
salary should be supplemented with a variable 
pay element of up to 50% of the fixed salary 
including pension.
the variable pay is set out in an incentive pro-
gramme for the executive board. the allocation 
of the variable salary components under the 
incentive programme is based on a result and 
performance assessment of each participant’s 
work in the performance year (financial year), 
based on specific weighted financial and non-fi-
nancial targets decided at the beginning of the 
performance year.
the principal purpose of the incentive pro-
gramme is to ensure the congruence of the fi-
nancial interest of the participants and the com-
pany’s shareholders and to create a correlation 
between remuneration and performance results. 
secondly, the programme should contribute to 
retaining the participants in tryg.
for the performance year 2020, the variable 
pay element was in january 2021 allotted as 
conditional shares. the cap for the incentive 
programme was 32% of the fixed salary including 
pension in 2020. 
the targets for 2020 were based on tryg’s tech-
nical result, transactional net promoter score, 
employee satisfaction levels, the incorporation 
of alka and the implementation of the strategy.
the allotted conditional shares are deferred for 
four years from the time of allotment. after the 
end of the deferral period, the participant will 
receive free shares in tryg a/s corresponding 
to the numbers of conditional shares allotted. 
the granting of free shares is conditional upon 
the fulfilment of additional conditions such as 
continued employment and back-testing (testing 
prior to granting, to ensure that the criteria on 
which the variable salary is based are still met at 
the time of granting of free shares). 
furthermore, all members of the executive 
board received a discretionary one-off bonus in 
december 2020 in recognition of their strategic 
efforts to ensure that tryg, together with cana-
dian intact, was able to submit a binding offer to 
purchase rsa. the one-off bonus took the form 
of conditional shares, which are deferred for 
four years.

the remuneration policy and in the remunera-
tion report at tryg.com
financial reporting, risk management and 
auditing
as an insurance business, tryg is subject to the 
risk management requirements of the danish 
financial business act and solvency ii. the su-
pervisory board defines tryg’s risk management 
framework as regards insurance risk, investment 
risk, compliance risk and operational risk, as 
well as it security, in policies and guidelines for 
the executive board. risks associated with new 
financial reporting rules and accounting policies 
are monitored and considered by the audit 
committee, the finance management and the 
internal auditors. material legal and tax-related 
issues and the financial reporting of such issues 
are assessed on an ongoing basis.
other risks associated with the financial report-
ing are described in the section solvency and 
dividend on pages 31-32 and in note 1 risk 
management on page 60
tryg engages in ongoing risk identification, map-
ping insurance risks and other risks which may 
endanger the realisation of tryg’s strategy, or 
which may potentially have a substantial impact 
on tryg’s financial position. the process involves

identifying and continually monitoring the risks 
identified. as in previous years, tryg undertook 
an own risk and solvency assessment (orsa) 
in 2020. the purpose of the orsa is to ensure 
and demonstrate a link between strategy, risk 
management, risk appetite, solvency and capital 
planning over the planning period. giving the 
outbreak of covid-19, specific attention has 
been given to identifying, assessing and manag-
ing the risks stemming from this new situation.
the supervisory board and the executive board 
approve and monitor the group’s overall policies 
and guidelines, procedures and controls in 
important risk areas. they receive reports about 
developments in these areas and about the ways 
in which the frameworks are applied. the su-
pervisory board checks that the company’s risk 
management and internal controls are effective. 
the board receives reports on non-compliance 
with the frameworks and guidelines established 
by the supervisory board. the risk committee 
monitors the risk management on an ongoing 
basis and reports quarterly to the supervisory 
board.
the group’s internal control systems are based 
on clear organisational structures and guidelines, 
general it controls and segregation of functions, 
which are supervised by the internal auditors.
as part of the internal control system, tryg has 
established independent risk management, 
compliance and actuarial functions. the func-
tions are reporting to the executive board and 
the supervisory board’s risk committee. tryg 
has a decentralised set-up whereby risk manag-
ers in the business areas carry out monitoring 
and reporting of second line internal controls for 
the risk management and compliance functions.
risk management is an integral part of tryg’s 
business operations. the group seeks at all times 
to minimise the risk of unnecessary losses in or-
der to optimise returns on the company’s capital.
read more about tryg’s risk management in the 
section solvency and dividend on pages 31-32 
and in note 1 on page 60
whistleblower line
tryg has a whistleblower line, which allows 
employees, customers and business partners to 
report any serious wrongdoings or suspected ir-
regularities. reporting takes place in confidence 
to the audit committee chair and the head of 
legal & compliance.
read more about tryg’s whistleblower line at 
tryg.com
independent and internal audit
the supervisory board ensures monitoring 
by competent and independent auditors. the 
group’s internal auditor attends all board 
meetings. the independent auditor attends 
the annual board meeting at which the annual 
report is presented.
the annual general meeting annually appoints 
an independent auditor recommended by the 
supervisory board. at least once a year, the 
auditors meet with the audit committee without 
the presence of the executive board. the audit 
committee chair deals with any matters that 
need to be reported to the supervisory board.
tryg’s internal audit department regularly re-
views the quality of the group’s internal control 
systems and business procedures. it is respon-
sible for planning, performing and reporting on 
the audit work to the supervisory board.
deviations and explanations
tryg complies with the recommendations on 
corporate governance except as regards the 
number of independent members of board 
committees, with which tryg complies partially; 
see recommendation 3.4.2. of the recommen-
dations on corporate governance.
the deviations are explained in tryg’s statutory 
corporate governance report, which is available

corporate responsibility in tryg
tryg has been a signatory member to the un 
global compact since 2008. in addition to this 
section on corporate responsibility, tryg pub-
lishes its independent corporate responsibility 
report on tryg.com. our corporate responsibili-
ty report is our statutory statement on corporate 
social responsibility and gender diversity at 
management level presented in accordance with 
sections 132 and 132a of the danish executive 
order on financial reports for insurance com-
panies and lateral pension funds (nationwide 
occupational pension funds). our corporate 
responsibility report also includes extensive en-
vironmental, social and governance (esg) data.
download corporate responsibility report
see esg data on pages 35-37 in our corporate 
responsibility report 
tryg’s corporate responsibility strategy for 
2020 focused on four areas: actively creating 
peace of mind, climate and environment, 
responsible workplace and business ethics. 
our corporate responsibility efforts are linked 
to tryg’s business model and core business (see 
page 13). as an insurance provider, tryg pro-
vides a safety net for its customers across the 
nordics in case of a claim and offers prevention 
initiatives to reduce and limit claims. hence, tryg 
creates peace of mind before, during and after 
a claim. the corporate responsibility board, 
chaired by the cfo, supervises tryg’s corporate 
responsibility efforts.
download terms of reference for corporate 
responsibility board
download corporate responsibility policy
in 2020, tryg conducted an extensive materi-
ality assessment to identify the environmental, 
social, economic and governance issues that 
are perceived to be most important to tryg and 
its stakeholders. the results of the materiality 
assessment form the basis of our corporate 
responsibility approach, which ensures that we 
focus on the opportunities and risks in relation 
to corporate responsibility that matter most to 
our stakeholders. 
actively creating peace of mind
actively creating peace of mind is one of the 
strategic elements of tryg’s corporate responsi-
bility strategy, through which tryg is contributing 
to society as well as offering relevant products 
with a preventive element to our customers. 
in 2020, tryg launched the tryg sund app, which 
consolidates the health of our commercial 
customers in one app. during our busy everyday 
lives, it can be difficult to prioritise one’s health. 
via tryg sund, we are able to push messages to 
inform our customers about the health initi-
atives we offer through our health portal. to 
increase the safety of our customers and their 
cars, we have launched tryg bilpleje, which is 
our new car service product that we offer to our 
car insurance customers. the purpose of the 
product is to ensure that our customers’ cars 
are safe and ready for the seasonal changes in 
weather. 
the nightravens and lifebuoys are two initia-
tives, which create peace of mind in society in 
norway. the nightravens prevent crimes from 
happening by being present and making people 
feel safe in the night life, while the lifebuoys pro-
vide safety along the coastlines, lakes, rivers and 
near harbours in norway. the lifebuoy is a vitally 
important rescue tool, and for decades, tryg has 
provided lifebuoys to norwegian society. today, 
tryg owns more than 47,000 lifebuoys.

responsibility report 
climate and environment
tryg is not an energy-intensive company, since 
its carbon emissions are mainly associated 
with heating and electricity use at the offices 
in addition to car and air travel. however, we 
acknowledge that we are part of the solution 
when it comes to minimising carbon emissions. 
we support the danish government’s ambition 
to reduce carbon emissions by 70% in 2030 
compared to 1990 as well as the efforts to min-
imise climate change and its negative impacts 
addressed in the paris agreement. 
tryg has a direct impact on the climate and the 
environment through its own internal operations 
and an indirect impact through its business 
activities. tryg’s climate and environmental 
policy sets out our commitment to minimising 
the carbon footprint and negative impact of our 
own operations and creating a positive impact 
through our business activities such as product 
development and claims handling.

responsibility report 
climate risks and opportunities
environmental and climate-related issues such 
as climate change and natural disasters are 
material issues for tryg and for our stakeholders. 
the changing climate is causing harm and con-
cern to our customers and society. also, extreme 
weather events potentially represent a risk to 
tryg. yet, it also represents several opportunities.
physical risks and oppotunities
extreme weather events such as flooding, cloud-
bursts and storms as well as changing weather 
patterns such as milder winters represent a 
physical risk to tryg,  since environmental and 
climate-related events can cause an increase in 
the frequency of climate-related claims.
a potential increase in the frequency of cli-
mate-related claims gives rise to insurance and 
underwriting risks. therefore, tryg monitors data 
available on material climate changes and seeks 
to mitigate the risk of such possible changes 
by working to prevent claims by advising its 
customers on how to protect their homes from 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 44
management’s review - contents
climate-related risks and by including it in our un-
derwriting and reinsurance. also, insurance risk is 
controlled by limiting the size of single exposures, 
through geographical limitations and by refraining 
from offering certain types of insurance.
by contributing to the prevention of climate-re-
lated claims, tryg is able to support society and 
the transition to a low-carbon economy, offer 
relevant products and services to our customers 
and increase our customers’ peace of mind.
transitional risks and opportunities
one of the main transitional risks is the potential 
development in climate-related policy and regula-
tion. future policy actions, both at a national and 
at eu level, may seek to either constrain actions 
which contribute to the adverse effects of climate 
change or promote adaptation. even though 
tryg’s direct carbon footprint is limited, the imple-
mentation of such initiatives still represents a risk 
to tryg, which calls for adaptation. also, regula-
tory developments that include new disclosure 
or reporting requirements introduced within the 
financial sector to address climate-related issues 
represent a transitional risk, to which tryg has to 
adapt to stay compliant as well as competitive.
the transition to a low-carbon economy also 
represents several opportunities for tryg. we are 
able to utilise new technology, knowledge and 
data to improve our claims prevention meas-
ures as well as implement more sustainable 
claims handling processes. sustainable claims 
handling is a key area, in which we can become 
more sustainable and contribute to a low-car-
bon economy, while offering our customers a 
more sustainable claims handling process. also, 
sustainable claims handling reduces the use of 
materials, benefitting both the environment and 
tryg’s claims costs.
carbon emissions
in 2020, tryg’s total carbon emissions de-
creased by 51% compared to 2019, correspond-
ing to a decrease of 2,626 tonnes of co2 in total. 
however, 2020 was an unusual year due to the 
covid-19 pandemic, which significantly affect-
ed tryg’s carbon emissions. 
from march 2020, except for business-critical 
travel, almost all business travel across national 
borders was cancelled to limit transmission of 
the virus, which led to an 81% decrease in car-
bon emissions from air travel compared to 2019.
most of our employees in denmark, norway and 
sweden were asked and advised to work from 
home. as a result, the electricity consumption 
at all our offices decreased by 36% in total 
compared to 2019, while total waste produc-
tion decreased by 45%, all contributing to the 
decrease in tryg’s total carbon emissions.
yet, tryg initiated several initiatives in 2020, 
which have also contributed to the decrease in 
our total carbon emissions. read more under on 
page 17 in our corporate responsibility report.
tryg calculates carbon emissions based on 
the greenhouse gas protocol initiative (ghg 
protocol).
eco-lighthouse in norway
eco-lighthouse is a norwegian certification 
scheme for companies seeking to document 
their environmental efforts and demonstrate 
social responsibility. in 2020, tryg initiated the 
recertification of its offices in norway according 
to the specific criteria applicable to the insur-
ance industry. we expect to meet the updated 
reporting deadlines and to obtain recertification 
in the first half of 2021.
responsible workplace
providing a healthy and safe working environ-
ment and securing the well-being of our employ-
ees are vital to tryg. our materiality assessment 
indicated that there is a risk that tryg can have 
adverse impacts on its employees through, 
for example, dissatisfaction, discrimination or 
the physical or psychosocial working environ-

employees.

responsibility report 
employee satisfaction
the annual employee satisfaction survey is 
key to measuring employee satisfaction and 
a starting point for talking about well-being in 
the workplace. in 2020, tryg’s overall employee 
satisfaction score increased to 80, up from 78 in 
2019. despite 2020 being a different year for all 
employees in tryg due to covid-19, the score 
for 2020 is record-high.
diversity and inclusion
we believe that a diverse representation of 
employees and, more importantly, diversity of 
thought are key elements to the success of tryg. 
in 2020, tryg increased the number of women in 
management positions from 35% in 2019 to 38% 
through a successful high focus on improving 
gender balance. as a result, a 50/50 balance for 
managerial recruitments was achieved in 2020.
while we have made significant progress in 
recent years, we still have some way to go before 
reaching our 2020 group target of 41% women 
in management positions.
we realise there are no quick or easy solutions, 
and the cultural change required to meet our 
target will take time. hence, further actions 
are needed to realise our target. this involves 
looking at the barriers and focusing on the 
underlying structures, hr processes and our 
organisational culture. we will continue to work 
towards our target of 41% women in man-
agement positions in our next strategy period 
towards 2023.
tryg’s supervisory board is composed of six 
men and six women, and under danish law as 
well as tryg’s own policy, there is equality among 
the genders.
in 2020, tryg expanded its diversity agenda to 
include a broader focus by promoting diversity 
of thought in management teams. we will be 
focusing on increasing diversity for three factors: 
gender, age and industry/experience.
activities to increase diversity and inclusion
to attract, hire and retain female leaders as well 
as increase diversity in management teams, tryg’s 
action plan for diversity for 2023 focuses on elimi-
nating bias in our recruitment and hr process. 
tryg will recruit the candidate with the best 
competencies and skills for the team, and we 
are striving to hire candidates who will increase 
diversity of thought in our management teams. 
we are also reducing unconscious bias in our 
recruitment process through data collection and 
through training of our recruitment managers. 
by raising awareness and training our leaders 
on how to lead diverse teams in our leadership 
programmes, we are focusing on building an 
inclusive culture.

including women in management 
business ethics
tryg is committed to run an ethical, transpar-
ent and responsible business. our materiality 
assessment shows that business ethics, data 
privacy and cyber security are material matters 
to tryg. building knowledge and capacity on 
these issues, not only internally among our 
employees through for example e-learning, but 
also throughout our business relations, requires 
continuous attention.
our commitment to ethical and strong corporate 
governance is the foundation on which we build 
our business. tryg’s code of conduct defines 
the rules, which all employees are required to 
adhere to. our tax policy and anti-corruption 
policy further outline our commitment to acting 
as a responsible company. our supplier code 
of conduct sets out minimum requirements for 
our suppliers and partners to operate in accord-
ance with responsible business principles and 
in full compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations. tryg’s responsible investment policy 
outlines the principles we follow to ensure that 
our investments are conducted in accordance 
with our values.

security
as an insurance company, for which digitalisa-
tion and innovation are high priorities, tryg is 
exposed to several security threats that we need 
to mitigate. security is crucial to tryg and essen-
tial for us to secure our business. a high security 
level creates a safe workplace as well as the ba-
sis for a successful and adaptive business. this 
includes cyber security, as we are dependent on 
well-functioning it systems to perform our work 
and run our business. this was especially impor-
tant during 2020, as most of our employees had 
to work from home for long periods of time.
to uphold our security level, we test our em-
ployees in their knowledge of our security rules 
once a year, including rules on cyber security, 
confidential material, press enquiries and access 
to our offices. 
data
tryg deals with personal data on a daily basis, 
and it is of high priority to us that our customers’ 
personal data are stored and handled in a lawful, 
secure and compliant manner. through our per-
sonal data policy, we seek to create transparen-
cy for our customers on how we collect, process 
and use their personal data.
download personal data policy 
we require all new employees to do a manda-
tory e-learning programme on gdpr and it 
security as part of their onboarding programme. 
over the course of the year, all new employees 
completed the online training.
data ethics
the use of data, including personal data, is 
essential for tryg’s business model. hence, using 
data in a responsible and ethical way is a key 
issue for us. 
our data ethical principles form part of tryg’s 
code of conduct, are based on industry stand-
ards in the form of the danish trade association,

whistleblower cases
tryg’s whistleblower hotline is available for all its 
stakeholders to report violations or potential vi-
olations of our code of conduct or other issues 
falling within the scope of tryg's whistleblower 
hotline and is reviewed by the chair of the audit 
committee, assisted by tryg’s legal and compli-
ance director. in 2020, two cases were reported 
and investigated compared to three cases in 
2019. one case led to a warning.

responsible investments
tryg wants to ensure that its assets are invested 
in a responsible manner. our materiality as-
sessment has identified responsible investment 
as a material issue to tryg, as we are at risk of 
violating international standards when investing. 
tryg wants to be transparent about its efforts to 
mitigate this risk.
ethical screening process
in 2020, we updated our responsible investment 
policy to reflect our focus on especially cli-
mate-related and environmental issues as mate-
rial for our investments. our manager selection 
process focusses on choosing external portfolio 
managers with a similar responsible mindset 
as tryg. however, a screening of our holdings 
is carried out each year based on controversial 
behaviour and controversial weapons to ensure 
that individual holdings do not deviate from 
expectations. furthermore, we have formulated 
a formal escalation process, which guides the 
process after a screening of investments.
in 2020, the screening led to three companies 
being flagged for controversial behaviour. in 
line with the escalation process, dialogue was 
initiated with the relevant external managers, 
which have yielded satisfactory explanations 
and actions. thus, no companies were excluded.

download process for ethical screening 
active source management
tryg’s initiatives on active ownership are 
primarily directed towards managing and 
monitoring its external managers’ responsible 
investment processes. the process related to 
ensuring compliance by external managers with 
tryg’s responsible investment policy is called 
active source management. our primary focus 
is selecting external managers who share our 
principles and have policies in place to ensure 
that investments are managed responsibly. 
external asset managers are un pri signatories 
or in the process of becoming signatories and 
are expected to incorporate esg considerations 
in their investment processes.

climate risk and carbon footprint monitoring
to mitigate risk in tryg’s investment portfolio, we

associated with our investments. we currently 
monitor our equity portfolio and parts of our 
credit bond portfolio and focus especially on 
transition risks and opportunities that arise from 
the transition to a low-carbon economy. our

responsible supply chain management 
tryg is committed to driving positive environmen-
tal and social progress and impact in the socie-
ties, in which we operate and to respect human 
rights as described in the universal declaration 
of human rights. our commitment is enforced 
through our signatory membership of the un 
global compact and is outlined in our corporate 
responsibility policy as well as in tryg’s code of 
conduct and supplier code of conduct. 
our materiality assessment indicates that there 
is a risk of violations of human and labour rights 
in our supply chain through our outsourcing 
activities. to mitigate any violations, we actively 
monitor our outsourcing suppliers for compli-
ance with the ten principles outlined in the un 
global compact. 
in 2020, we strengthened our commitment by 
updating our code of conduct regarding suppli-

ers and partners, implemented a supplier code 
of conduct and designed a systematic follow-up 
procedure via an external supplier evaluation 
platform provider.
our new supplier code of conduct sets out 
minimum requirements for our suppliers and 
partners to operate in accordance with respon-
sible business principles and in full compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.
with the implementation of a new external plat-
form for the evaluation of suppliers on sustainabil-
ity performance in 2020, we initiated an enhanced 
systematic esg risk-screening and supplier perfor-
mance evaluation process of our suppliers.

corporate responsibility strategy 2023
tryg’s new corporate responsibility strategy for 
2023, 'driving sustainable impact', is based on, 
how tryg as a company and the employees can 
contribute to a more sustainable society, and how 
tryg can support suppliers and help our custom-
ers to make more sustainable choices. the strat-
egy is characterised by a strategic, commercial 
and holistic approach, the purpose of which is to 
integrate sustainability into every corner of the 
company. hence, the strategy rests on three pil-
lars: responsible company, green workplace and 
sustainable insurance. for each strategic pillar, 
we have set ambitious targets for both 2023 and 
2030, as we want to contribute to an actual and 
measurable impact as well as monitor progress.
tryg has published an independent corporate 
responsibility report with extended environ-
mental, social and governance (esg) data.
corporate responsibility strategy 2023
*  tryg's carbon emission reduction targets are based on the greenhouse gas protocol initiative (ghg protocol).
the strategic pillar, responsible company, 
focuses on how tryg can raise the bar for its 
work with responsible procurement, responsible 
investment as well as diversity and inclusion. we 
seek to reduce the carbon intensity of our equity 
portfolio by at least 50% in 2030 compared to 
2020. also, we want to contribute to the green 
transition by divesting all our investments in fos-
sil fuel production companies with no strategy 
for a green transition before 2030.
tryg wants to be a green workplace and have set 
the target of achieving carbon neutrality in 2023 
in relation to the carbon emissions deriving from 
scope 1, scope 2 and from waste, air and train 
travel in scope 3*. we want to reduce our carbon 
footprint by 30% in 2023 and 50% in 2030 com-
pared to 2019 and will compensate for the rest 
of our carbon emissions. however, our goal is to 
compensate less and reduce more over time.
the strategic pillar sustainable insurance 
focuses on how tryg can support and motivate 
its customers on their own sustainability journey 
by offering sustainable products and services as 
well as incorporating sustainability in our claims 
handling process. our ambition is to increase 
our sustainable claims spend by 20% compared 
to 2020 and achieve a total co2 reduction 
effect of 10,000-15,000 tonnes of co2 in 2023 
through climate-friendly claims handling.

the supervisory board and the executive board 
have today considered and adopted the annual 
report for 2020 of tryg a/s and the tryg group.
the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with the international 
financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted 
by the eu and the additional danish disclosure 
requirements of  the danish financial business 
act on annual reports prepared by listed financial 
services companies and the requirements of 
nasdaq copenhagen for the presentation of the 
financial statements of listed companies. the an-
nual report of the parent company is prepared in 
accordance with the executive order on financial 
reports presented by insurance companies and 
lateral pension funds issued by the danish fsa.
in our opinion, the accounting policies applied 
are appropriate, and the annual report gives a 
true and fair view of the group’s and the parent 
company’s assets, liabilities and financial posi-
tion at  31 december 2020 and of the results of 
the group’s and the parent company’s opera-
tions  and the cash flows of the group for the 
financial year 1 january - 31 december 2020.
furthermore, in our opinion the management’s 
review gives a true and fair view of developments 
in the activities and financial position of the 
group and the parent company, the results for 
the year and of the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s financial position in general and describes 
significant risk and uncertainty factors that may 
affect the group and the parent company.
we recommend that the annual report be adopt-
ed by the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting.

independent 
auditor’s report
additional danish disclosure requirements for 
financial companies.
also, in our opinion, the parent financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the parent at 31 december 2020 and 
of its financial performance for the financial year 
1 january to 31 december 2020 in accordance 
with the danish financial business act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit book 
comments issued to the audit committee and 
the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. 
our responsibilities under those standards and 
requirements are further described in the audi-
tor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent finan-
cial statements section of this auditor’s report. 
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the iesba code of ethics for professional 
accountants and additional requirements appli-
to the shareholders of tryg a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements 
of tryg a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020, pages 54-113, which comprise 
the income statement, statement of compre-
hensive income, balance sheet, statement 
of changes in equity and notes, including the 
summary of significant accounting policies, for 
the group as well as the parent and the consol-
idated cash flow statement. the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional danish 
disclosure requirements for listed financial 
companies, and the parent financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with the danish 
financial business act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the group’s 
financial position at 31 december 2020 and 
of its financial performance and cash flows for 
the financial year 1 january to 31 december 
2020 in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements for the financial year 
1 january to 31 december 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consol-
idated financial statements and the parent financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
claims provisions 
management’s estimates of the claims provisions are 
based on actuarial methods and involve complex sta-
tistical methods as well as estimates of future events. 
changes in methods and assumptions may result in a 
material impact on the size of the claims provisions. 
consequently, the audit of the claims provisions is 
considered a key audit matter.
the claims provisions amount to dkk 24,957m at 31 
december 2020 (dkk 24,859 m in 2019).
management has specified the risks etc. related to the 
estimates of the claims provisions in note 1 ”risk and 
capital management” on pages 60-69 and in ”account-
ing policies”, note 29 on pages 99-106. the principles 
of estimating the claims provisions have been specified 
in ”accounting policies”, note 29 on page 105, and 
further specified in note 1 on pages 63-66 and in note 
19 on pages 90-91.
the estimates of the claims provisions depend on 
accurate and complete insurance data of current and 
historical claims, including the development in claims 
and payment patterns, as these data are used to estab-
lish the expectations for future claims for the purpose 
of the statistical models.
how the matter was adressed in the audit
• 
 assessment and test of controls related to the 
processes of claims handling and the recognition 
and measurement of provisions for known claims.
• 
 in cooperation with our own internationally qualified 
actuaries, we have tested controls related to the ac-
tuarial estimates of the claims provisions of selected 
lines of business. 
• 
 we have tested the accuracy and the complete-
ness of the data that are included in the actuarial 
estimates of the claims provisions.
• 
 in cooperation with our own internationally quali-
fied actuaries and based on our knowledge of the 
industry, experience and historical observations, 
we have assessed the statistical models applied to 
estimate the claims provisions and we have tested 
significant estimates and assumptions focusing on 
consistency and possible changes.
• 
 based on the actuarial estimates of the claims 
provisions and analyses, and in cooperation with 
our own internationally qualified actuaries, we 
have assessed the development in the claims 
provisions, including run-off gains/losses and the 
development in the size of the margin included in 
management’s estimate of the claims provisions.
the most important assessments and 
assumptions of future events relate to: 
• 
 estimated future claims payments, which are 
based on the completeness and the accuracy of 
historical claims and payment patterns, among 
other factors.
• 
 expectations for future inflation.
• 
 determination of the margin included in manage-
ment’s estimate of the claims provisions to address 
the uncertainty related to the actuarial estimates.

cable in denmark, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. we believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have 
not provided any prohibited non-audit services 
as referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) 
no 537/2014.
we were appointed auditors of tryg a/s on 28 
january 2002 for the financial year 2002 as 
part of the formation of the company. however, 
we have been the appointed auditors of the 
underlying subsidiaries since before 1995. we 
have been reappointed annually by decision 
of the general meeting for a total contiguous 
engagement period of more than 19 years up to 
and including the financial year 2020.
statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the manage-
ment’s review.
our opinion on the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements does 
not cover the management’s review, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
management’s review and, in doing so, consider 
whether the management’s review is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or other-
wise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider 
whether the management’s review provides the 
information required under the danish financial 
business act.
based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that the management’s review is in 
accordance with the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial business 
act. we did not identify any material misstate-
ment of the management’s review. 
management’s responsibilities for the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent finan-
cial statements
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional danish disclosure 
requirements for listed financial companies, and 
for the preparation of parent financial state-
ments that give a true and fair view in accord-
ance with the danish financial business act, 
and for such internal control as management de-
termines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and parent 
financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, for disclosing, as applica-
ble, matters related to going concern, and for 
using the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements 
unless management either intends to liquidate 
the group or the parent or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark 
will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements and these parent financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, 
we exercise professional judgement and main-
tain professional scepticism throughout the 
audit. we also: 
•  identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial state-
ments, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten-
tional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal con-
trol relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s and the parent’s internal control. 
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of man-
agement’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a ma-
terial uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the group’s and the parent’s ability to contin-
ue as a going concern. if we conclude that a 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 52
financial statements - contents
material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial state-
ments or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. however, 
future events or conditions may cause the 
group and the entity to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial state-
ments, including the disclosures in the notes, 
and whether the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair 
view.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the en-
tities or business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. we are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance 
of the group audit. we remain solely respon-
sible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and sig-
nificant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit. 
we also provide those charged with govern-
ance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independ-
ence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our audi-
tor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

proposed dividend per share is calculated as the total 
dividend proposed by the supervisory board after the 
end of the financial year divided by the total number of 
shares at the end of the year (302,147,991 shares).
the possible payment of dividend from tryg forsikring 
a/s to tryg a/s is influenced by contingency fund 
provisions of dkk 1,706m (dkk 1,677m in 2019). 
the contingency fund provisions can be used to cover 
losses in connection with the settlement of insurance 
provisions or otherwise for the benefit of the insured.

1 risk and capital management
risk management in tryg
the supervisory board defines the basis for the risk 
appetite through the business model and the current 
strategy. the supervisory board has regulated the 
management of risk activities through policies and 
guidelines to the business supported by underlying 
business processes and a power of attorney structure. 
the company’s risk management forms the basis for 
the risk profile being in line with the specified risk 
appetite at all times. tryg’s risk profile is continuously 
measured, quantified and reported to the manage-
ment and the supervisory board. 
in tryg, we have adopted a three lines of defence go-
vernance model across the organisation. this is to en-
sure robust governance and effective communication 
between the business areas, key functions and internal 
audit as well as reporting to the supervisory board and 
the supervisory board’s risk committee (“riu”). 
1st line of defence is the business management 
2nd line of defence is compliance-, actuarial- and risk 
management function
3rd line of defence is internal audit and internal audit 
function
the 1st line consists of the business management: the 
business areas are responsible for the daily risk man-
agement and for carrying out every day work based on 
tryg’s policies and instructions regarding the manage-
ment of risks and are responsible for being compliant 
with both internal and external requirements. this 
means that there must be procedures and guidelines 
in place for vital areas, and that internal controls are 
carried out in such a way that risks are identified in a 
timely manner and necessary risk mitigation activities 
are implemented. 
the 2nd line consists of the compliance, actuarial 
and risk management function: the compliance 
function has the overall responsibility for overseeing 
and monitoring compliance with applicable laws and 
legislation as well as internal policies and guidelines. 
the key responsibility of the actuarial function is to 
ensure and assess the adequacy of the provisions. the 
risk management function is responsible for the facil-
itation, monitoring and implementation of effective 
risk management practices and reporting of adequate 
risk-related information throughout the organisation. 
the risk management function ensures a consistent 
approach to risk identification across the organisation, 
risk assessment of the most significant risks at group 
level and reporting to the supervisory board. 
the risk management function consists of a group 
risk management department and decentralized risk 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 60
financial statements - contents
notes
managers in the individual business areas. the decen-
tralized risk managers are anchored in the respective 
business areas, and also have a dotted reporting line 
into the group risk management. the decentralized 
risk managers are responsible for carrying out the 
activities of the risk management function in their 
respective business areas including the monitoring 
and reporting of second line internal controls.
furthermore, the function prepares specific recommen-
dations in relation to capital management, reinsurance, 
investment risk management and more. tryg’s risk man-
agement function is also responsible for determining 
the company’s solvency capital requirement.
the functions in the second line of defence must have 
an overview of business processes and risks across the 
organisation. 
the 3rd line consists of internal audit: the third line 
must ensure an independent and objective audit of 
the organization’s internal controls, risk management 
and governance processes. internal audit  reports 
independently to the supervisory board and to its 
audit committee. 
the supervisory board has organised their own risk 
committee consisting of 4 members of the supervi-
sory board. in addition to these 4 members, the chief 
financial officer, chief risk officer and the general 
counsel (in capacity as overseeing the compliance 
function) are part of the committee. the supervisory 
board’s risk committee was established to ensure 
that all risk and capital related topics are discussed 
thoroughly before discussed in the supervisory board. 
the supervisory board meets minimum 4 times 
annually. 
capital management
tryg’s capital management is based on the key busi-
ness objectives:
•  a solid capital base, supporting both the statutory 
requirements and a single ‘a’ rating from moody’s.
•  support of a steadily increasing nominal dividend 
per share, with a payout ratio in the interval 60-90%.
tryg’s capital base currently consist of tier 1 and 2 capi-
tal, such as shareholders’ equity and subordinated loans.
 
 see table subordinate loan capital on page 68.
the capital base is continuously measured against 
the capital requirement calculated on the basis of 
tryg’s partial internal model, where insurance risks are 
modelled using an internal model, while other risks are 
described using the standard formula.
the model calculates tryg’s capital requirement with 
99.5% solvency level with a 1-year horizon, which 
means that tryg will be able to fulfil its obligations in 
199 out of 200 years. the partial internal model has 
been used for a number of years, and was approved by 
the danish financial supervisory authority (dfsa) in 
december 2015. a major model change was approved 
by dfsa in april 2020.
monitoring of the capital base also involves capital 
projections based on expected business plans within 
the strategic planning period and stress on selected 
scenarios.  
company’s own risk and  
solvency assessment (orsa)
orsa is the company’s own risk assessment based 
on the solvency ii principles, which implies that tryg 
must assess all material risks that the company is or 
may be exposed to. the orsa report also contains an 
assessment of whether the calculation of solvency 
capital requirement is reasonable and is reflecting 
tryg’s actual risk profile. 
tryg’s risk activities are implemented via continuous risk 
management processes, where the main results are re-
ported to the supervisory board and its risk committee 
during the year. therefore, the orsa report is an annual 
summary document assessing all these processes.
insurance risk
insurance risk comprises two main types of risks: 
underwriting risk and reserving risk.
underwriting risk
underwriting risk is the risk that insurance premiums 
will not be sufficient to cover the compensations and 
other costs associated with the insurance business. 
underwriting risk is managed primarily through the 
company’s insurance policy defined by the super-
visory board, and administered through business 
procedures, underwriting guidelines etc. underwriting 
risk is assessed in tryg’s capital model, determining 
the capital impact from insurance products.
reinsurance is used to reduce the underwriting risk 
in situations where this cannot be achieved to a 
sufficient degree via ordinary diversification. in case 
of major events involving damage to buildings and 
contents, tryg’s reinsurance programme provides 
protection for up to dkk 7.25bn, which statistically is 
sufficient to cover at least a 250-year event. retention 
for such events is dkk 182.5m. 
in the event of a frequency of natural disasters, tryg 
is covered for up to dkk 600m, after total annual 
retention of dkk 300m. tryg has also taken out rein-
surance for the risk of large claims occurring in sectors 
with very large sums insured. tryg’s largest individual 
building and contents risks are covered by up to dkk 
2bn. retention for large claims is dkk 100m, gradually 
dropping to dkk 25m. single risks exceeding dkk 2bn 
are covered individually.
tryg has combined the minimum cover of other 
sectors into a joint cover with retention of dkk 100m 
for the first claim and dkk 25m for subsequent 
claims. for the individual sectors, individual cover has 
subsequently been taken out as needed. the use of re-
insurance creates a natural counterparty risk. this risk 
is handled by applying a wide range of reinsurers with 
a suitable rating and adequate capital level as defined 
by the supervisory board.
reserving risk
reserving risk relates to the risk of tryg’s insurance 
provisions being inadequate. the supervisory board 
lays down the overall framework for the handling of 
reserving risk in the insurance policy, while the overall 
risk is measured in the capital model. the uncertainty 
associated with the calculation of claims reserves 
affects tryg’s results through the run-off on reserves. 
long-tailed reserves in particular are subject to inter-
est rate and inflation risk. interest rate risk is hedged by 
means of tryg’s match portfolio which corresponds to 
the discounted claims reserves. in order to manage the 
inflation risk of danish workers’ compensation claims 
reserves, tryg has bought zero coupon inflation swaps. 
tryg determines the claims reserves via statistical 
methods as well as individual assessments.
at the end of 2020, tryg’s claims reserves net of 
reinsurance totalled dkk 23.870m with an average 
duration of approximately 4,6 years.
investment risk
the overall framework for managing investment risk is 
defined by the supervisory board in tryg’s investment 
policy. in overall terms, tryg’s investment portfolio 
is divided into a match portfolio and a free portfolio. 
the match portfolio corresponds to the value of the 
discounted claims reserves and is designed to hedge 
the interest rate sensitivity of these as closely as pos-
sible. tryg carries out daily monitoring, follow-up and 
risk management of the group’s interest rate risk. the 
swap and bond portfolio is thus adjusted conti nuously 
to minimise the net interest rate risk. 
in 2021, the first steps toward phasing out ibor-rates 
will start. for tryg this has a small impact on existing 
as well as on new interest rate swaps used for hedging 
the interest rate risk. shortly said: euribor / eionia – 
rates will be replaced by a estr-rate. the change of 
ibor rates is expected to imply that euribor in existing 
contracts will be measured as estr plus af fixed inter-
est rate spread. future contracts will incorporate estr 
rates instead of euribor.
the corresponding development in denmark/norway 
has justed started for instance cibor is supposed to 
change to destr, but this will happen later since the 
preliminary study of this will starts in the beginning of 
2021.
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 61
financial statements - contents
notes
the free portfolio is subject to the framework defined 
by the supervisory board through the investment pol-
icy. the purpose of the free portfolio is to achieve the 
highest possible return relative to risk. tryg’s property 
portfolio constitutes the company’s largest investment 
risk. the property portfolio comprises investment 
properties, the value of which is adjusted based on the 
conditions on the property market through internal 
valuations backed by external valuations. at the end 
of 2020, investment properties accounted for 6.75% 
(including property funds) and tryg’s equity portfolio 
accounted for 6.12% of the total investment assets.
tryg does not want to speculate in foreign currency, 
but since tryg invests and operates its insurance busi-
ness in other currencies than danish kroner, tryg is 
exposed to currency risk. tryg is primarily exposed to 
fluctuations in the other scandinavian currencies due 
to its ongoing insurance activities. premiums earned 
and claims paid in other currencies create a natural 
currency hedge, for which reason other risk mitigation 
measures are not required in this area. however, the 
part of equity held in other currencies than danish kro-
ner will be exposed to currency risk. this risk is hedged 
on an ongoing basis using currency swaps.
in addition to the above-mentioned risks, tryg is 
exposed to credit, counterparty and concentration risk. 
these risks primarily relate to exposures in high-yield 
bonds, emerging market debt exposures as well as 
tryg’s investments in aaa-rated nordic and european 
government and mortgage bonds. these risks are also 
managed through the investment policy and the frame-
work for reinsurance defined in the insurance policy.
for a non-life insurance company like tryg, liquidity 
risk is practically non-existent, as premium payments 
fall due before claims payments. the only significant 
assets on tryg’s balance sheet, which by nature is 
somewhat illiquid, are the property portfolio.
operational risk
operational risk relates to errors or failures in internal 
procedures, fraud, breakdown of infrastructure, it secu-
rity and similar factors. as operational risks are mainly 
internal, tryg focuses on an adequate control environ-
ment for its operations. in practice, this work is organ-
ised by means of procedures, controls and guidelines 
covering the various aspects of the group’s operations. 
the supervisory board defines the overall framework 
for managing operational risk in tryg’s operational risk 
policy and in the information security policy. 
a special crisis management structure is set up to deal 
with the eventuality that tryg is hit by major crises. 
this comprises a crisis management team at group 
level, national contingency teams at country level and 
finally business contingency teams in the individual 
areas. tryg has prepared contingency plans to address 
the most important areas. in addition, comprehensive 
it contingency plans have been established, primarily 
focusing on the business critical systems.
other risks
strategic risk
the strategic risk is the risk of loss as a result of tryg’s 
chosen strategic position. the strategic position 
covers both business transactions, it strategy, choice 
of business partners and changed market conditions. 
tryg’s strategic position is determined by tryg’s super-
visory board in close collaboration with the executive 
board. before determining the strategic position, the 
strategic decisions are subject to a risk assessment, 
explaining the risk of the chosen strategy to tryg’s 
supervisory board and executive board.
compliance risk
compliance risk is the risk of loss as a result of lack of 
compliance with rules, regulations, market standards 
or internal guidelines. the handling of compliance risk 
is coordinated centrally via the  compliance function, 
which, among other things, sits on industry commit-
tees in connection with legislative monitoring, ensures 
implementation of regulation in tryg through business 
procedures, provides ongoing training in compliance 
matters and performs compliance controls within the 
organisation. compliance risks and the result of the

emerging risk
emerging risk covers both new risks and already 
known risks, with changing characteristics. the 
management of this type of risk is handled in the 
individual business areas, which monitor the market 
and adapt the products as the conditions change. in 
the event of a change in insurance terms, it is ensured 
that tryg’s reinsurance cover is consistent with the 
new conditions.
emerging risk is also a part of the systematically imple-
mented risk identification process in tryg.

notes
the impact of the outbreak of covid-19
following the outbreak of covid-19, a period of 
high uncertainty and volatility has characterised 
financial markets developments. for that reason 
it has been relevant to update the valuation 
of level 3 investments assets in the fair value 
hierarchy.  at the same time, it has also been 
deemed relevant to reconfirm assumptions in 
the valuation of claims provisions and also how 
exchange rate fluctuations will affect tryg.
valuation of investments assets
total financial investment assets are measured 
at fair value with value adjustment in the income 
statement. listed bonds and shares, parts of unit 
trusts as well as derivative financial instruments 
are measured at quoted market prices or consol-
idated references prices at the balance sheet 
date. 
the valuation of the investment assets can be 
distributed in the fair value hierarchy model, 
which is determined in accordance with ifrs 13. 
the model distributes the total investments as-
sets based on the price at which the investment 
assets are set. reference is made to note 15 for 
further description of the fair value hierarchy. 
the main part of tryg’s investment assets are 
classified as level 1 and 2 and are valuated based 
on quoted market prices or consolidated refer-
ences prices. this involves the bonds portfolio, 
the main part of shares and unit trust units as 
well as the statement of financial instruments. 
assets, which can be classified as level 3, can be 
attributed to unlisted assets, specific unlisted 
unit trusts and investment property. as these 
investment assets are not valued based on 
observable input, there will be a discretionary 
element in this hierarchy. 
on 31 december 2020, the value amounts to 
dkk 1,186m (dkk 1,375m on 31 december 
2019).
claims provisions
the volatility introduced by the outbreak of cov-
id-19 affects some of trygs claims provisions, 
particularly travel insurance but also several oth-
er insurance products due to significant changes 
in behavior. the effects are incorporated in trygs 
reserving models. the statistical uncertainty re-
lated to these changes is insignificant compared 
to the total provisions and balance sheet.
exchange rates
tryg has business in three different nordic 
countries meaning that tryg is exposed to fluc-
tuations in the local currencies (nok and sek) in 
regard to the financial results.
tryg has chosen to implement a currency hedge 
strategy that focuses on mitigating the curren-
cies impact on the financial results. this means 
that the impact on the p/l of changes in local 
currencies is limited.
the shareholders’ equity, due to the currency 
hedge strategy, is not sensitive to changes in the

impairment test
 
 
goodwill
 
 
the value in use method is used when testing the goodwill for impairment.
 
 
primary assumptions for impairment test:
 
 
 when assessing the cash flow management has based its estimates of premiums earned on the insurance 
portfolio adjusted to reflect the expected effect of business decisions and market development from 
past experiences. the portfolio is indexed with the wage and salary index. claims incurred are based on 
expected claims ratios, which corresponds to normalised large- and weather claims. reinsurance is taken 
into account when looking at the overall technical result together with the expected cost ratio. required 
returns are based on management’s own requirements for returns of the individual cash generation units 
and are not expected to change significantly in the near future.
 
 
 covid-19 has not have any affect on the assumptions related to impairment of goodwill, trademarks and 
brand.
 
 
alka
 
 
 in 2018, tryg acquired forsikrings- aktieselskabet alka . the insurance activities were incorporated into 
the tryg group's business structure from 8 november 2018. 
 
 
comprises the sale of insurance products to private and commercial customers under the ‘alka’ brand. 
 
 
 at 31 december 2020, management performed an impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill 
based on the allocation of the cost of goodwill to the cash-generating unit.
 
 
 the cash flows appearing from the latest prognosis approved by management for the next 6 quarters are 
used when calculating the value in use of private dk. the cash flows in the latest prognosis period have 
been extrapolated for financial years after the prognosis periods (terminal period) and adjusted for expec-
ted growth rates determined on the basis of expectations for the general economic growth. the required 
return is based on an assessment of the risk profile of the tested business activities compared with the 
market’s expectations for the group.
 
 
 the impairment test shows a calculated value in use of approximately dkk 31.1bn (26.4bn) relative to a 
recognised goodwill of dkk 4.2bn (4.2bn) and does not indicate any impairment in 2020. according to 
the sensitivity informations below a change in the required return rate will have the highest effect on the 
equity. an increase in the required return of approx. 4.6% will result in a write down of goodwill.

incorporated into the tryg group's business structure and merged into tryg in 2015.
 
 at 31 december 2020, management performed an impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill 
based on the allocation of the cost of goodwill to the cash-generating unit. moderna portfolio consists 
from 1 january 2017 of moderna, securator and skandia, which was prior to this date three separate 
cash-generating units. the reasons behind the merger of securator and skandia into moderna, is that they 
are managed together as part of the swedish business and reported under the segment “sweden”
 
 comprises the sale of insurance products to private customers under the ‘moderna’ brand. moreover, in-
surance is sold under the brands atlantica, bilsport & mc and moderna djurförsäkringar. sales take place 
through its own sales force, call centres and online.
 
 the cash flows appearing from the latest prognosis approved by management for the next 6 quarters are 
used when calculating the value in use of moderna. the cash flows in the latest prognosis period have 
been extrapolated for financial years after the prognosis periods (terminal period) and adjusted for expect-
ed growth rates determined on the basis of expectations for the general economic growth. the required 
return is based on an assessment of the risk profile of the tested business activities compared with the 
market’s expectations for the group.
 
 the impairment test shows a calculated value in use of approximately dkk 2.2bn (1.5bn) relative to a 
recognised goodwill of dkk 0.5bn (0.5bn) and does not indicate any impairment in 2020. according to 
the sensitivity informations below a change in the required return rate will have the highest effect on the

trademarks and customer relations
 
 as at 31 december 2020 management performed a test of the carrying amounts of customer relations as 
an integral part of the moderna, obos and alka portfolio goodwill test.
 
an agricultural portfolio acquired in 2014 was impaired and written down in 2019 dkk 18m. 
 
software and assets under construction
 
 as at 31 december 2020 management performed a test of the carrying amounts of software and assets 
under construction. 
 
 the impairment test compares the carrying amount with the estimated present value of future cash flows. 
the test did indicate an impairment of dkk 147m (dkk 7m) due to revaluation of the groups it-systems.  
the write-down is due to related system development costs will be higher, while for some of the systems 
benefits are also expected to be lower. the cost is recognised as write-downs under depreciations in the 
income statement.
 
 assets under construction are not depreciated but tested once a year for impairment or when there is any 
indication of a decrease in value. amortised software is assessed for impairment at the balance sheet date 
or when there are indications that the future cash flow cannot justify the carrying amount.
 
 in the event that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is recognised in 
the income statement.
 
the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less sales costs and value in use.

sensitivity
 tryg’s property valuations are based on the market-based rental income and operating expenses of  
the individual property relative to the required rate of return. the most important factors impacting  
the valuations are the applied rates of return, annual net rental income and occupancy rates.  
the average rates of return applied are stated above.

the fair value hierarchy 
 
 
 
 
 
 ”quoted market prices and consolidated reference prices” (level 1) consists of financial instruments that 
are quoted and traded in a principal and active market (markets generally accessable and with substantial 
volume and trade frequency).
 
 
 valuation based on observable input (level 2) consists of financial instruments that are valued substantially 
on the basis of observable input other than quoted price or consolidated reference price for the instru-
ment itself. if a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, tryg bases its measurement on 
the most recent transaction price. adjustment is made for subsequent changes to market conditions, for 
instance, by including transactions in similar financial instruments that are assumed to be motivated by 
normal business considerations. for a number of financial assets and liabilities, no market exists. 
 
 
 in such cases, tryg uses recent transactions in similar instruments and discounted cash flows or other 
generally accepted estimation and valuation techniques based on market conditions at the balance sheet 
date to calculate an estimated value. this category covers instruments such as derivatives valued on the 
basis of observable yield curves and exchange rates and illiquid mortgage bonds valued by reference to 
the value of similar liquid bonds.
 
 
 valuation based on significant non-observable input (level 3) consist of certain financial instruments 
based substantially on non-observable input. such instruments include unlisted shares, unit trust invest-
ments, some unlisted bonds and deal contingent forwards. the fair value of investment property is also 
based on non-observable input. please refer to note 13 and accounting policies section investment pro-
perty.
 
 
 if, at the balance sheet date, a financial instrument’s classification differs from its classification at the 
beginning of the year, the classification of the instrument changes. changes are considered to have taken 
place at the balance sheet date. developments in the financial markets can result in reclassifications bet-
ween the categories. some bonds have become illiquid and have therefore been moved from ”quoted pri-
ces or consolidated reference prices” to the ”observable input” category, while other bonds have become 
liquid and have been moved from ”observable input” to the ”quoted prices or consolidated reference 
prices” category.

tions remain constant. in reality, this is rarely the case, and changes to some assumptions may be sub-
ject to covariance. the sensitivity analysis has been carried out  using the same method as the actuarial 
calculation of the pension provisions in the statement of financial position.

description of the norwegian plan
a)  in the norwegian part of the group, about half of the employees had a defined-benefit pension plan. 
the plans were based on the employees’ expected final pay, the secured employee part of the plan has 
been terminated as of 01 january 2020. tryg agreed with the norwegian employees to replace the defi-

sensitivity information (continued) 
description of the swedish plan
moderna försäkringar, a branch of tryg forsikring a/s, complies with the swedish industry pension agree-
ment, the ftp plan, which is insured with försäkringsbranschens pensionskassa - fpk. 
under the terms of the agreement, the group’s swedish branch has undertaken, along with the other 
businesses in the collaboration, to pay the pensions of the individual employees in accordance with the 
applicable rules. 
the ftp plan is primarily a defined-benefit plan in terms of the future pension benefits. fpk is unable to 
provide sufficient information for the group to use defined-benefit accounting. for this reason, the group 
has accounted for the plan as if it were a defined-contribution plan in accordance with ias 19.30.
this years premium paid to fpk amounted to dkk 10m (dkk 12m in 2019), which is about 2,2 % of the 
annual premium in fpk(2019). fpk writes in its annual report for 2019 that it had a solvency ratio of 137 
at 31 december 2019 (solvency ratio of 134 at 31 december 2018). 
the solvency ratio is defined as the own funds relativ to the solvency capital requirement.

price adjustments 2016-2020
at the end of october (2020) tryg received the forbru-
gerombudsmand’s (fo or consumer ombudsman) as-
sessment of the case. in fo’s opinion, tryg was not 
complying with regulations on price adjustments for 
residential customers when increasing prices above 
indexation between march 2016 and february 2020. 
the case is related to a part of the private portfolio in 
denmark.
based on this assessment the fo is concluding that 
certain customers may have a recovery claim against 
tryg. 
tryg does not agree with the fo’s assessment as the 
company believes it has followed the guidelines stated 
by the danish fsa in terms of price increases. tryg is in 
a process with the fo in order to gain a better under-
standing of the fo assessment of the case.
other
companies in the tryg group are party to a number of 
disputes. 
management believes that the outcome of these dis-
putes will not affect the group’s financial position sig-
nificantly beyond the obligations recognized in the sta-
tement of financial position at 31 december 2020.

acquisition of activities
2020
there have been no acquisions in 2020. 
recommended cash offer for rsa
in november 2020 tryg made a recommended cash offer together with intact (a leading canadian insu-
rer), to acquire rsa insurance group plc. as part of the transaction, tryg will take over rsa’s swedish and 
norwegian businesses and co-own rsa’s danish business on a 50/50 economic basis for a considera-
tion of £4.2bn to be paid by tryg.
the offer is provided in gbp and thus the consideration for the business taken over by tryg is fixed in 
gbp. this foreign currency exposure will persist from the time of the offer and until closing of the acqu-
isition.
in order to eliminate the foreign currency exposure related to the acquisition tryg enters into derivatives 
to buy gbp and sell dkk that mirrors the possibility of non-occurrence of the acquisition, i.e. the deri-
vatives have a knock-out option that is automatically triggered if the acquisition does not occur. such 
derivatives are often referred to as deal contingent derivatives (dcf). if the acquisition is not concluded 
the forwards will lapse without any payments. 
the transaction is expected to be closed during h1 2021, following shareholders’ and regulatory ap-
proval. during 2020, some transaction costs in the amount of dkk 323m related to the acquisition have 
been recognized in the balance sheet and will be included in the purchase price upon completion of the 
acquisition as the acquired business initially will be accounted for under the equity method until the 
swedish and norwegian businesses will be separated from the danish business through a demerger 
expected to be completed in q1 2022. please refer to the management’s review for further information 
on the recommended cash offer.
the dcf contracts have a notional value of £4.2bn and will be settled upon closing of the acquisition at 
any time in the period from 17 may to the end of november 2021. the cost of the contracts being dkk 
1.3bn is built into the contracts as additional forward points compared to marked based forward rates 
and thus is only paid if the acquisition is concluded.
the dcfs are measured at fair value and have a fair value of nil at initial recognition. the basis for the 
estimate of the fair value is the change in the marked based forward rates, assessment of the probability 
of the acquisition being concluded and the cost of the contracts. tryg has assessed that as at 31 decem-
ber 2020 the fair values were immaterial.

29 accounting policies
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the international financial report-
ing standards (ifrs) as  adopted by the eu on 31 
december 2020 and the additional danish disclosure 
requirements of the danish financial business act on 
annual reports prepared by listed financial services 
companies the annual report of the parent company 
is prepared in accordance with the executive order on 
financial reports presented by insurance companies 
and lateral pension funds issued by the danish fsa. 
the deviations from the recognition and measurement 
requirements of ifrs are:
• 
 the danish fsa’s executive order does not 
allow provisions for deferred tax of contin-
gency reserves allocated from untaxed funds. 
deferred tax and the other comprehensive 
income of the parent company have been 
adjusted accordingly on the transition to ifrs.
change in accounting policies
tryg has not implemented any new significant ac-
counting policies or ifrs standards in 2020.
the accounting policies have been applied consist-
ently with last year.
accounting regulation
implementation of changes to accounting standards 
and interpretation in 2020 
the international accounting standards board (iasb) 
has issued several changes to the international 
accounting standards, and the international financial 
reporting interpretations committee (ifric) has also 
issued a number of interpretations. 
no standards have been implemented for the first time 
for the accounting year that began on 1 january 2020 
that will have a significant impact on the group. see 
below regarding ifrs 9 ‘financial instruments’
there has not been implemented any new or amended 
standards and interpretations that have affected the 
group significantly.
future orders, standards and interpretations that 
the group has not implemented, and which have 
still not entered into force but could affect the group 
significantly:
• 
 ifrs 9 ‘financial instrumentsa)
• 
 ifrs 17 ‘insurance contractsb)
a)   enters into force for the accounting year commencing  
1 january 2018 - insurance companies are allowed to 
postpone the implementation to 1 january 2023 if certain 
criteria are met.
b)   expected to enter into force for the accounting year com-
mencing 1 january 2023.
the implementation of ifrs 9 ‘financial instruments’ 
is not expected to significantly change the group’s 
financial position. 
regarding ifrs 9 the assessment of no significant 
impact on the statement of financial position or profit 
and loss is based on the assumption that tryg already 
carry all financial instruments at fair value through 
profit and loss. the implementation of ifrs 9, will 
not affect tryg’s recognition and measurement. tryg 
has postponed the implementation of ifrs 9 to 1 
january 2023 when ifrs 17 insurance contracts will 
be applicable. tryg can postpone ifrs 9 due to the fact 
that our activities are predominantly connected with 
insurance and that our liabilities connected with insur-
ance is relatively greater than 80 per cent of the total 
liabilities. the impact of ifrs 17 (insurance contracts) 
is currently being assessed in a structured and formal 
manner and is expected to be concluded in due course 
ahead of the implementation date. whilst the tryg 
group anticipates minor changes in certain of its key 
figures, such as premiums growth and claims ratio as 
a result of changes to the defintions of premiums and 
costs under ifrs 17 (insurance contracts), tryg group 
currently expects that the implementation of ifrs 
(insurance contracts) will not significantly change the 
tryg group’s financial position, including in relation to 
its technical result or profit/loss after tax.
the changes will be implemented going forward from 
the effective date.
significant accounting estimates and assess-
ments
the preparation of financial statements under ifrs re-
quires the use of certain critical accounting estimates 
and requires management to exercise its judgement 
in the process of applying the group’s accounting 
policies. the areas involving more judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the consolidated financial statements 
are:
• 
 liabilities under insurance contracts
• 
 valuation of defined benefit plans 
• 
 fair value of financial assets and liabilities
• 
 valuation of property 
• 
 business combinations
• 
 measurement of goodwill, trademarks and 
customer relations
• 
 control of subsidiaries 
liabilities under insurance contracts
estimates of provisions for insurance contracts repre-
sent the group’s most critical accounting estimates, as 
these provisions involve several uncertainty factors.
claims provisions are management’s best estimate 
based on actuarial and statistical projections of claims 
and administration of claims including a margin 
incorporating the uncertainty related to the range of 
actuarial scenarios and other short and long-term 
risks not reflected in standard actuarial models. the 
projections are based on tryg’s knowledge of historical 
developments, payment patterns, reporting delays, 
duration of the claims settlement process and other 
factors that might influence future developments in 
the liabilities.
the group makes claims provisions, in addition to 
provisions for known claims, which cover estimated 
compensation for losses that has incurred, but are not 
yet reported to the group (known as ibnr reserves) 
and future developments in claims which are known to 
the group but are not finally settled. claims provisions 
also include direct and indirect claims settlement costs 
or loss adjustment expenses that arise from events 
that have occurred up to the statement of financial 
position date even if they have not yet been reported 
to tryg.
the calculation of the claims provisions is therefore 
inherently uncertain and, by necessity, relies upon the 
making of certain assumptions about factors such as 
court decisions, amendments to legislation, social in-
flation and other economic trends, including inflation. 
the group’s actual liability for losses may be subject 
to material positive or negative deviations relative to 
the initially estimated claims provisions.
claims provisions are discounted. as a result, initial 
changes in discount rates or changes in the duration of 
the claims provisions could have positive or negative 
effects on earnings. discounting affects the motor 
third-party liability, general third-party liability, work-
ers’ compensation classes, including sickness and 
personal accidents, in particular.
the financial supervisory authority’s discount curve, 
which is based on eiopa’s yield curves, is used to 
discount danish, norwegian and swedish claims provi-
sions in relation to the relevant functional currencies.
several assumptions and estimates underlying the 
calculation of the claims provisions are mutually de-
pendent. this has the greatest impact on assumptions 
regarding interest rates and inflation.
defined benefit pension schemes
the group has terminated our defined-benefit plan in 
norway as of 01 january 2020. a defined-benefit plan 
is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
depending on age, years of service and salary.
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 99
financial statements - contents
notes
as part of the termination of the defined-benefit plan, 
an agreement of compensation to the employees 
covered by the plan was agreed. a liability has been 
established to cover the expected compensation to 
be paid to the employees upon retirement from the 
company. if the employee leaves before retirement 
only a part of the compensation is paid. 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities
measurements of financial assets and liabilities for 
which prices are quoted in an active market or which 
are based on generally accepted models with observa-
ble market data are not subject to material estimates. 
for securities that are not listed on a stock exchange, 
or for which no stock exchange price is quoted that 
reflects the fair value of the instrument, the fair value 
is determined using a current otc price of a similar 
financial instrument or using a model calculation. the 
valuation models include the discounting of the instru-
ment cash flow using an appropriate market interest 
rate with due consideration for credit and liquidity 
premiums. the fair value of deal contingent deriva-
tives (dcf) that tryg has entered into in connection 
with a recommended cash offer together with intact 
(a leading canadian insurer), to acquire rsa insurance 
group plc is further explained in note 26.
valuation of property
the fair value is calculated based on a market-deter-
mined rental income, as well as operating expenses 
in proportion to the property’s required rate of return 
in per cent. investment property is recognised at fair 
value. the calculation of fair value is based on market 
prices, taking into consideration the type of property, 
location and maintenance standard, and based on a 
market- determined rental income as well as operating 
expenses in proportion to the property’s required rate 
of return. cf. note 12, 13 and 15.
business combinations
in business combinations, significant assessments 
are made when considering the fair value of the assets 
required and liabilities assumed and when identifying 
intangible assets, such as trademarks, customer 
relations and goodwill as part of the transactions.
measurement of goodwill, trademarks and  
customer relations
goodwill, trademarks and customer relations was 
acquired in connection with acquisition of businesses. 
goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units un-
der which management manages the investment. the 
carrying amount is tested for impairment at least an-
nually. impairment testing involves estimates of future 
cash flows and is affected by several factors, including 
discount rates and other circumstances dependent 
on economic trends, such as customer behaviour and 
competition. cf. note 11.
  
control of subsidiaries
control of subsidiaries is assessed yearly. hence 
whether a subsidiary should still be part of the consol-
idation on line by line basis or as a single line item in 
the balance sheet. 
description of accounting policies
recognition and measurement
the annual report has been prepared under the his-
torical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation 
of owner-occupied property, where increases are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and re-
valuation of investment property, financial assets held 
for trading and financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value are 
recognised in the income statement.
assets are recognised in the statement of financial 
position when it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the group, and the value of such 
assets can be measured reliably. liabilities are recog-
nised in the statement of financial position when the 
group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a prior event, and it is probable that future econom-
ic benefits will flow out of the group, and the value of 
such liabilities can be measured reliably.
on initial recognition, assets and liabilities are meas-
ured at cost, with the exception of financial assets, 
which are recognised at fair value. measurement 
after initial recognition is affected as described below 
for each item. anticipated risks and losses that arise 
before the time of presentation of the annual report 
and that confirm or invalidate affairs and conditions 
existing at the statement of financial position date are 
considered at recognition and measurement.
income is recognised in the income statement as 
earned, whereas costs are recognised by the amounts 
attributable to this financial year. value adjustments 
of financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement unless otherwise described below.
all amounts in the notes are shown in millions of dkk, 
unless otherwise stated.
consolidation
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of tryg a/s (the parent company) 
and the enterprises (subsidiaries) controlled by the 
parent company. the parent company is regarded as 
controlling an enterprise when it 
i)    exercises a controlling influence over the relevant 
activities in the enterprise in question, 
ii)   is exposed to or has the right to a variable return on 
its investment, and 
iii)  can exercise its controlling influence to affect the 
variable return.
enterprises in which the group directly or indirectly 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights 
and exercises significant influence but no controlling 
influence are classified as associates.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
based on the financial statements of tryg a/s and its 
subsidiaries. the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared by combining items of a uniform nature.
the financial statements used for the consolidation 
are prepared in accordance with the group’s account-
ing policies.
on consolidation, intra-group income and costs, 
intra-group accounts and dividends, and gains and 
losses arising on transactions between the consolidat-
ed enterprises are eliminated.
items of subsidiaries are fully recognised in the con-
solidated financial statements.
business combinations
newly acquired or newly established enterprises are 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date of acquisition and the date of forma-
tion, respectively. the date of acquisition is the date 
on which control of the acquired enterprise actually 
passes to tryg. divested or discontinued enterpris-
es are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income up to the date of disposal or 
the settlement date. the date of disposal is the date 
on which control of the divested enterprise actually 
passes to a third party.
the purchase method is applied for new acquisitions 
if the group gains control of the acquired enterprise. 
subsequently, identifiable assets, liabilities and con-
tingent liabilities in the acquired enterprises are meas-
ured at fair value at the date of acquisition. non-cur-
rent assets which are acquired with the intention of 
selling them are, however, measured at fair value less 
expected selling costs. restructuring costs are recog-
nised in the pre-acquisition balance sheet only if they 
constitute an obligation for the acquired enterprise. 
the tax effect of revaluations is taken into account. 
the acquisition price of an enterprise consists of the 
fair value of the price paid for the acquired enterprise. 
if the final determination of the price is conditional 
upon one or more future events, such events are rec-
ognised at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
costs relating to the acquisition are recognised in the 
income statement as incurred.
any positive balances (goodwill) between the acqui-
sition price of the acquired enterprise, the value of 
minority interests in the acquired enterprise and the 
fair value of previously acquired equity investments, on 
the one hand, and the fair value of the acquired assets, 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 100
financial statements - contents
notes
liabilities and contingent liabilities, on the other hand, 
are recognised as an asset under intangible assets, and 
are tested for impairment at least once a year. if the 
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, it is impaired to the lower recoverable amount.
in the event of negative balances (negative goodwill), 
the calculated fair values, the calculated acquisition 
price of the enterprise, the value of minority interests 
in the acquired enterprise and the fair value of previ-
ously acquired equity investments are revalued. if the 
balance is still negative, the amount is recognised as 
income in the income statement.
if, at the date of acquisition, there is uncertainty as to 
the identification or measurement of acquired assets, 
liabilities or contingent liabilities or the determination 
of the acquisition price, initial recognition is based on 
a preliminary determination of values. the preliminar-
ily determined values may be adjusted or additional 
assets or liabilities may be recognised up to 12 months 
after the acquisition, provided that new information 
has come to light regarding matters existing at the 
date of acquisition which would have affected the 
determination of the values at the date of acquisition, 
had such information been known.
 
generally, subsequent changes in estimates of condi-
tional acquisition prices are recognised directly in the 
income statement.
currency translation
a functional currency is determined for each of 
the reporting entities in the group. the functional 
currency is the currency used in the primary economic 
environment in which the reporting entity operates. 
transactions in currencies other than the functional 
currency are transactions in foreign currencies.
on initial recognition, transactions in foreign curren-
cies are translated into the functional currency using 
the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curren-
cies are translated using the exchange rates applicable 
at the statement of financial position date. translation 
differences are recognised in the income statement 
under price adjustments.
on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the 
group’s foreign operations are translated using 
the exchange rates applicable at the statement of 
financial position date. income and expense items are 
translated using the average exchange rates for the 
period. exchange rate differences arising on transla-
tion are classified as other comprehensive income and 
transferred to the group’s translation reserve. such 
translation differences are recognised as income or 
as expenses in the period in which the activities are 
divested. all other foreign currency translation gains 
and losses are recognised in the income statement.
the presentation currency in the annual report is dkk.
segment reporting
segment information is based on the group’s man-
agement and internal financial reporting system and 
supports the management decisions on allocation 
of resources and assessment of the group’s results 
divided into segments.
the operational business segments in the tryg are pri-
vate, commercial, corporate and sweden. private en-
compasses the sale of insurances to private individuals 
in denmark and norway. commercial encompasses 
the sale of insurances to small and medium sized 
businesses, in denmark and norway. corporate sells 
insurances to industrial clients primarily in denmark, 
norway and sweden. in addition, corporate handles 
all business involving brokers. sweden encompasses 
the sale of insurance products to private individuals 
in sweden as well as sale of product insurances in the 
nordic region.
geographical information is presented based on the 
economic environment in which the tryg group op-
erates. the geographical areas are denmark, norway 
and sweden.
segment income and segment costs as well as seg-
ment assets and liabilities comprise those items that 
can be directly attributed to each individual segment 
and those items that can be allocated to the individual 
segments on a reliable basis. unallocated items 
primarily comprise assets and liabilities concerning 
investment activity managed at group level. 
key ratios
earnings per share (eps) are calculated according 
to ias 33. this and other key ratios are calculated in 
accordance with recommendations and ratios issued 
by the the danish finance society and the executive 
order on financial reports for insurance companies 
and multi-employer occupational pension funds 
issued by the danish financial supervisory authority.
income statement
premiums
premium income represents gross premiums written 
during the year, net of reinsurance premiums and ad-
justed for changes in premium provisions, correspond-
ing to an accrual of premiums to the risk period of the 
policies, and in the reinsurers’ share of the premium 
provisions.
premiums are calculated as premium income in ac-
cordance with the risk exposure over the cover period, 
calculated separately for each individual insurance 
contract. the calculation is generally based on the pro 
rata method, although this is adjusted for an unevenly 
divided risk between lines of business with strong 
seasonal variations or for policies lasting many years.
the portion of premiums received on contracts that 
relate to unexpired risks at the statement of financial 
position date is reported under premium provisions.
the portion of premiums paid to reinsurers that 
relate to unexpired risks at the statement of financial 
position date is reported as the reinsurers’ share of 
premium provisions.
technical interest
according to the danish fsa’s executive order, technical 
interest is presented as a calculated return on the year’s 
average insurance liability provisions, net of reinsurance. 
the calculated interest return for grouped classes of 
risks is calculated as the monthly average provision plus 
an actual interest from the present yield curve for each 
individual group of risks. the interest is applied accord-
ing to the expected run-off pattern of the provisions. 
insurance technical interest is reduced by the portion 
of the increase in net provisions that relates to un-
winding.
claims
claims are claims paid during the year adjusted for 
changes in claims provisions less the reinsurers’ share. 
in addition, the item includes run-off gains/losses in 
respect of previous years. the portion of the increase 
in provisions which can be ascribed to unwinding is 
transferred to insurance technical interest.
claims are shown inclusive of direct and indirect 
claims handling costs, including costs of inspecting 
and assessing claims, costs to combat and mitigate 
damage and other direct and indirect costs associated 
with the handling of claims incurred.
changes in claims provisions due to changes in yield 
curve and exchange rates are recognised as a price 
adjustment.
tryg hedges the risk of changes in future pay and price 
figures for provisions for workers’ compensation. tryg 
uses zero coupon inflation swaps acquired with a view 
to hedging the inflation risk. value adjustments of 
these swaps are included in claims, thereby reducing 
the effect of changes to inflation expectations under 
claims. 
bonus and premium discounts
bonuses and premium discounts represent anticipat-
ed and refunded premiums to policyholders, where 
the amount refunded depends on the claims record, 
and for which the criteria for payment have been de-
fined prior to the financial year or when the insurance 
was taken out.
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 101

notes
insurance operating costs
insurance operating costs represent acquisition costs 
and administration expenses less reinsurance com-
missions received. expenses relating to acquiring and 
renewing the insurance portfolio are recognised at the 
time of writing the business. underwriting commission 
is recognised when a legal obligation occurs. admin-
istration expenses are all other expenses attributable 
to the administration of the insurance portfolio. 
administration expenses are accrued to match the 
financial year.
share-based payment
the tryg group’s incentive programmes comprise an 
employee bonus scheme and incentive programmes 
for executive board, risk takers and other employees.
employee bonus scheme
according to the remuneration policy, the group’s 
employees can be granted a bonus in the form of 
free shares. when the bonus is granted, employees 
can choose between receiving shares or cash. the 
expected value of the shares will be expensed over the 
performance period. the scheme will be treated as a 
complex financial instrument, consisting of the right 
to cash settlement and the right to request delivery 
of shares. the difference between the value of shares 
and the cash payment is recognised in equity and is 
not remeasured. the remainder is treated as a liability 
and is remeasured until the time of exercise, such that 
the total recognition is based on the actual number of 
shares or the actual cash amount.  
conditional shares
other risk takers have been allotted conditional shares in 
accordance with the incentive programme for risk takers.
equity-settled conditional shares are measured at the 
fair value at the allotment date and recognised under 
staff costs over the period from the allotment date 
until the end of the deferral period (the transfer date), 
where the holder receive free shares.
the shares are recognised at market value and are 
accrued from one to four years.
matching shares
as part of the matching shares-program for the ex-
ecutive board members, members of the board have 
bought investment shares in tryg a/s at market price, 
using taxed funds, for up to the amount decided by the 
supervisory board. 
other incentive program participants who are not risk 
takers have also bought investment shares as part of 
their incentive program.
the purchase of investment shares entitles the holder 
to a number of matching shares, corresponding to the 
number of investment shares which the holder has 
bought. the shares (matching shares) are provided 
free of charge, four (executive board) or three years 
(other participants) after the time of purchase of the 
investment shares. the holder may not sell the shares 
until six months after the matching date.
the shares are recognised at market value and are 
accrued over the four and tree year maturation 
period, based on the market price at the time of 
acquisition. recognition is from the end of the month 
of acquisition under staff expenses with a balancing 
entry directly in equity. if the holder retires during the 
maturation period but remains entitled to shares, 
the remaining expense is recognised in the current 
accounting year. 
investment activities
income from associates includes the group’s share of 
the associates’ net profit. 
income from investment properties before fair value 
adjustment represents the profit from property opera-
tions less property management expenses. 
interest and dividends represent interest earned and 
dividends received during the financial year. realised 
and unrealised investment gains and losses, including 
gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, 
value adjustment of investment property, foreign 
currency translation adjustments and the effect of 
movements in the yield curve used for discounting, are 
recognised as value adjustments.
investment management charges represent expenses 
relating to the management of investments including 
salary and management fees on the investment area. 
the external investors share of the result in kapital-
foreningen tryg invest funds and tryg invest real 
estate are either deducted (in case of a profit) from or 
added (in case of a loss) to the investment result.
other income and costs
other income and costs include income and expenses 
which cannot be ascribed to the group´s insurance 
portfolio or investment assets, including the sale 
of products for velliv, pension & livsforsikring a/s, 
danske bank and depreciations of intangibles assets 
identified in business combinations.
discontinued and divested business
discontinued and divested business is consolidated 
in one item in the income statement. discontinued 
and divested business includes gross premiums, gross 
claims, gross costs, profit/loss on ceded business, 
insurance technical interest net of reinsurance, invest-
ment return after insurance technical interest, other 
income and costs and tax in respect of the discontin-
ued business. any reversal of earlier impairment is 
recognised under other income and costs.
the statement of financial position items concerning 
discontinued activities are reported unchanged under 
the respective entries whereas assets and liabilities 
concerning divested activities are consolidated under 
one item as assets held for sale and liabilities held for 
sale.
statement of financial position
intangible assets
goodwill
goodwill is acquired in connection with acquisition of 
business. goodwill is calculated as the difference be-
tween the cost of the undertaking and the fair value of 
acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities at the time of acquisition. goodwill is allo-
cated to the cash-generating units under which man-
agement manages the investment and is recognised 
under intangible assets. goodwill is not amortised but 
is tested for impairment at least once per year.
trademarks and customer relations
trademarks and customer relations have been identi-
fied as intangible assets on acquisition. the intangible 
assets are recognised at fair value at the time of 
acquisition and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the expected economic lifetime of 5–15 years.
software
acquired computer software licences are capitalised 
on the basis of the costs incidental to acquiring and 
bringing to use the specific software. the costs are 
amortised based on an estimated economic lifetime of 
up to 8 years. 
costs for group developed software that are directly 
connected with the production of identifiable and 
unique software products, where there is sufficient 
certainty that future earnings will exceed the costs in 
more than one year, are reported as intangible assets. 
direct costs include personnel costs for software 
development and directly attributable relevant fixed 
costs. all other costs connected with the development 
or maintenance of software are continuously charged 
as expenses.
after completion of the development work, the asset is 
amortised according to the straight-line method over 
the assessed economic lifetime, though over a maxi-
mum of 8 years. the amortisation basis is reduced by 
any impairment and write-downs.
assets under construction
group-developed intangibles are recorded under the 
entry “assets under construction” until they are put 
into use, whereupon they are reclassified as software 
and are amortized in accordance with the amortization 
periods stated above.

fixed assets
operating equipment
fixtures and operating equipment are measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any accu-
mulated impairment losses. cost encompasses the 
purchase price and costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the relevant assets until the time when 
such assets are ready to be brought into use.
depreciation of operating equipment is calculated 
using the straight-line method over its estimated 
economic lifetime as follows:
• 
it, 4 years
• 
vehicles, 5 years
• 
furniture, fittings and equipment, 5-10 years
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
expected economic lifetime, however maximally the 
term of the lease.
gains and losses on disposals and retired assets are 
determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amounts. gains and losses are recognised in the 
income statement. when revalued assets are sold, 
the amounts included in the revaluation reserves are 
transferred to retained earnings.
leasing
right-of-use assets
at inception of a contract, tryg assesses whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. it has the following 
prerequisites:
• 
the underlying asset is identifiable
• 
 the group has the right to obtain substantially 
all the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use
• 
 the group has the right to direct the use of the 
asset
tryg recognises a right-of-use asset and a correspond-
ing lease liability with respect to all lease agreements 
in which it is the lessee, excluding short-term leases 
(defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or 
less) and leases of low value assets.
at inception or on reassessment of a contract that 
contains lease components, tryg allocates the consid-
eration in the contract to each lease component based 
on their relative stand-alone prices.
right-of-use asset (rou asset) and lease liability are 
recognised at the lease commencement date. the 
rou asset is initially measured the cost, which com-
prises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for 
• 
 lease payments made at or before the com-
mencement date 
• 
 any initial direct cost incurred
• 
 estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the 
underlying asset or to restore the underlying 
asset
• 
 lease incentives received
rou assets are tested for impairment. 
lease liability
the lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted by using the rate 
implicit in the lease. if this rate cannot be readily 
determined, tryg uses its incremental borrowing 
rate. subsequently, the lease liability is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method and 
is presented as part of other debt. it is remeasured 
when there is a change in future lease payments. a 
corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying 
amount of the rou asset.
land and buildings
land and buildings are divided into owner-occupied 
property and investment property. the group sold the 
owner-occupied property in høje taastrup and have 
no longer any owner occupied properties. all remai-
ning properties are classified as investment property.
investment property
properties held for renting yields that are not occupied 
by the group are classified as investment properties.
investment property is recognised at fair value. fair 
value is based on market prices, adjusted for any 
differences in the nature, location or maintenance 
condition of specific assets. if this information is not 
available, the group uses alternative valuation meth-
ods such as discounted cash flow projections and 
recent prices in the market.
the fair value is calculated on the basis of market-spe-
cific rental income per property and typical operating 
expenses for the coming year. the resulting operating 
income is divided by the required return on the proper-
ty in per cent, which is adjusted to reflect market inter-
est rates and property characteristics, corresponding 
to the present value of a perpetual annuity. the value 
is subsequently adjusted with the value in use of the 
return on prepayments and deposits and adjustments 
for specific property issues such as vacant premises or 
special tenant terms and conditions. cf. note 15.
changes in fair values are recorded in the income 
statement.
impairment test for intangible assets, property and 
operating equipment
operating equipment and intangible assets are 
assessed at least once per year to ensure that the 
depreciation method and the depreciation period 
that is used are connected to the expected economic 
lifetime. this also applies to the salvage value. write-
down is performed if impairment has been demon-
strated. 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more of-
ten if there are indications of impairment, and impair-
ment testing is performed for each cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. the present value is 
normally established using budgeted cash flows based 
on business plans. the business plans are based on 
past experience and expected market developments.
equity investments in group undertakings
the parent company’s equity investments in subsid-
iaries are recognised and measured using the equity 
method. the parent company’s share of the enter-
prises’ profits or losses after elimination of unrealised 
intra-group profits and losses is recognised in the in-
come statement. in the statement of financial position, 
equity investments are measured at the pro rata share 
of the enterprises’ equity.
subsidiaries with a negative net asset value are 
recognised at zero value. any receivables from these 
enterprises are written down by the parent compa-
ny’s share of such negative net asset value where the 
receivables are deemed irrecoverable. if the negative 
net asset value exceeds the amount receivable, the re-
maining amount is recognised under provisions if the 
parent company has a legal or constructive obligation 
to cover the liabilities of the relevant enterprise.
net revaluation of equity investments in subsidiaries is 
taken to reserve for net revaluation under equity if the 
carrying amount exceeds cost.
the results of foreign subsidiaries are based on trans-
lation of the items in the income statement using aver-
age exchange rates for the period unless they deviate 
significantly from the transaction day exchange rates. 
income and costs in domestic enterprises denomi-
nated in foreign currencies are translated using the 
exchange rates applicable on the transaction date.
statement of financial position items of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates 
applicable at the statement of financial position date.
when it is assessed that the parent company no longer 
has control over the subsidiary, it will be transferred 
to either assets held for sale or unquoted shares and 
when sold, it will be derecognised. 
   
equity investments in associates
associates are enterprises in which the group has signif-
icant influence but not control, generally in the form of 
an ownership interest of between 20% and 50% of the 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 103
financial statements - contents
notes
voting rights. equity investments in associates are meas-
ured using the equity method and the carrying amount 
of the investment represents the group’s proportionate 
share of the enterprises’ net assets. significant transac-
tion costs are recognised as part of the acquisition price. 
profit after tax from equity investments in associates 
is included as a separate line in the income statement. 
income is made up after elimination of unrealised 
intra-group profits and losses.
associates with a negative net asset value are 
measured at zero value. if the group has a legal or con-
structive obligation to cover the associate’s negative 
balance, such obligation is recognised under liabilities.
investments
investments include financial assets at fair value 
which are recognised in the income statement. the 
classification depends on the purpose for which the 
investments were acquired. management determines 
the classification of its investments on initial recogni-
tion and re-evaluates this at every reporting date.
financial assets measured at fair value with recog-
nition of value adjustments in the income statement 
comprise assets that form part of a trading portfolio 
and financial assets designated at fair value with value 
adjustment via the income statement.
financial assets at fair value recognised in income 
statement
financial assets are recognised at fair value on initial 
recognition if they are entered in a portfolio that is 
managed in accordance with fair value. derivative 
financial instruments are similarly classified as finan-
cial assets held for sale, unless they are classified as 
security. 
realised and unrealised profits and losses that may 
arise because of changes in the fair value for the cate-
gory financial assets at fair value are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise.
financial assets are derecognised when the rights to 
receive cash flows from the financial assets have ex-
pired, or if they have been transferred, and the group 
has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership. financial assets are recognised and 
derecognised on a trade date basis, the date on which 
the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
the fair values of quoted securities are based on stock 
exchange prices at the statement of financial position 
date. for securities that are not listed on a stock ex-
change, or for which no stock exchange price is quot-
ed that reflects the fair value of the instrument, the 
fair value is determined using valuation techniques. 
these include the use of similar recent arm’s length 
transactions, reference to other similar instruments or 
discounted cash flow analysis.
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
the group’s activities expose it to financial risks, 
including changes in share prices, foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates and inflation. forward exchange 
contracts and currency swaps are used for currency 
hedging of portfolios of shares, bonds, hedging of 
foreign entities and insurance statement of financial 
position items. interest rate derivatives in the form 
of futures, forward contracts, repos, swaps and fras 
are used to manage cash flows and interest rate 
risks related to the portfolio of bonds and insurance 
provisions. share derivatives in the form of futures 
and options are used from time to time to adjust share 
exposures.
derivative financial instruments are reported from 
the trading date and are measured in the statement 
of financial position at fair value. positive fair values 
of derivatives are recognised as derivative financial 
instruments under assets. negative fair values of 
derivatives are recognised under derivative financial 
instruments under liabilities. positive and negative 
values are only offset when the company is entitled 
or intends to make net settlement of more financial 
instruments.
calculation of value is generally performed based on 
rates supplied by danske bank with relevant informa-
tion providers and is checked by the group’s valuation 
technicians. discounting based on market interest 
rates is applied in the case of derivative financial 
instruments involving an expected future cash flow.
recognition of the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being 
hedged. the group designates certain derivatives as 
hedges of investments in foreign entities. changes in 
the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as net investment hedges in foreign entities 
and which provide effective currency hedging of the 
net investment are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. the net asset value of the foreign entities 
estimated at the beginning of the financial year is 
hedged 90-100% by entering into short-term forward 
exchange contracts according to the requirements of 
hedge accounting. changes in the fair value relating to 
the ineffective portion are recognised in the income 
statement. gains and losses accumulated in equity are 
included in the income statement on disposal of the 
foreign entity.
reinsurers’ share of provisions for insurance contracts
contracts entered into by the group with reinsurers 
under which the group is compensated for losses on 
one or more contracts issued by the group and that 
meet the classification requirements for insurance 
contracts are classified as reinsurers’ share of provi-
sions for insurance contracts. contracts that do not 
meet these classification requirements are classified 
as financial assets.
the benefits to which the group is entitled under its 
reinsurance contracts held are recognised as assets 
and reported as reinsurers’ share of provisions for 
insurance contracts.
amounts receivable from reinsurers are measured 
consistently with the amounts associated with the 
reinsured insurance contracts and in accordance with 
the terms of each reinsurance contract.
changes due to unwinding are recognised in insurance 
technical interest. changes due to changes in the yield 
curve or foreign exchange rates are recognised as 
price adjustments.
the group continuously assesses its reinsurance as-
sets for impairment. if there is objective evidence that 
the reinsurance asset is impaired, the group reduces 
the carrying amount of the reinsurance asset to its re-
coverable amount. impairment losses are recognised 
in the income statement.
receivables
total receivables comprise accounts receivable from 
policyholders and insurance companies as well as other 
accounts receivable. other receivables primarily contain 
accounts receivable in connection with property.
receivables that arise because of insurance contracts 
are classified in this category and are reviewed for im-
pairment as a part of the impairment test of accounts 
receivable.
receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
are subsequently assessed at amortised cost. the in-
come statement includes an estimated reservation for 
expected unobtainable sums when a clear indication 
of the asset impairment is observed. the reservation 
entered is assessed as the difference between the 
carrying amount of an asset and the present value of 
expected future cash flows.
other assets
other assets include current tax assets and cash at 
bank and in hand. current tax assets are receivables 
concerning tax for the year adjusted for on-account 
payments and any prior-year adjustments. cash at 
bank and in hand is recognised at nominal value at the 
statement of financial position date.
prepayments and accrued income
prepayments include expenses paid in respect of 
subsequent financial years and interest receivable. 
accrued underwriting commission relating to the sale 
of insurance products is also included.

equity
share capital
shares are classified as equity when there is no obliga-
tion to transfer cash or other assets. costs directly at-
tributable to the issue of equity instruments are shown 
in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
revaluation reserves
revaluation of owner-occupied property is recognised 
in other comprehensive income unless the revaluation 
offsets a previous impairment loss.
foreign currency translation reserve
assets and liabilities of foreign entities are recognised 
using the exchange rate applicable at the statement of 
financial position date. income and expense items are 
recognised using the average monthly exchange rates 
for the period. any resulting differences are recognised 
in other comprehensive income. when an entity is 
wound up, the balance is transferred to the income 
statement. the hedging of the currency risk in respect 
of foreign entities is also offset in other comprehensive 
income in respect of the part that concerns the hedge.
contingency fund reserves
contingency fund reserves are recognised as part of 
retained earnings under equity. the reserves may only 
be used when so permitted by the danish financial 
supervisory authority and when it is for the benefit of 
the policyholders. the norwegian contingency fund 
reserves include provisions for the norwegian natural 
perils pool and security reserve. the danish and 
swedish provisions comprise contingency fund pro-
visions. deferred tax on the norwegian and swedish 
contingency fund reserves is allocated.
dividends
proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the 
time of adoption by the shareholders at the annual 
general meeting (date of declaration). 
own shares
the purchase and sale sums of own shares and 
dividends thereon are taken directly to retained 
earnings under equity. own shares include shares 
acquired for incentive programmes and share buyback 
programme.
proceeds from the sale of own shares in connection 
with the exercise of share options or matching shares 
are taken directly to equity.
subordinate loan capital
subordinate loan capital is recognised initially at fair 
value, net of transaction costs incurred. subordinate 
loan capital is subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transac-
tion costs) and the redemption value is recognised in 
the income statement over the borrowing period using 
the effective interest method.
provisions for insurance contracts
premiums written are recognised in the income 
statement (premium income) proportionally over the 
period of coverage and, where necessary, adjusted to 
reflect any time variation of the risk. the portion of 
premiums written on in-force contracts that relates to 
unexpired risks at the statement of financial position 
date is reported as premium provisions. premium 
provisions are generally calculated according to a best 
estimate of expected payments throughout the agreed 
risk period; however, as a minimum as the part of the 
premium calculated using the pro rata temporis princi-
ple until the next payment date. adjustments are made 
to reflect any risk variations. this applies to gross as 
well as ceded business.
claims and claims handling costs are expensed in the 
income statement as incurred based on the estimat-
ed liability for compensation owed to policyholders 
or third parties sustaining losses at the hands of 
the policyholders. they include direct and indirect 
claims handling costs that arise from events that have 
occurred up to the statement of financial position date 
even if they have not yet been reported to the group. 
claims provisions are estimated using the input of as-
sessments for individual cases reported to the group 
and statistical analyses for the claims incurred but 
not reported and the expected ultimate cost of more 
complex claims that may be affected by external fac-
tors (such as court decisions). the provisions include 
claims handling costs.
claims provisions are discounted. discounting is 
based on a yield curve reflecting duration applied to 
the expected future payments from the provision. 
discounting affects the motor liability, professional 
liability, workers’ compensation and personal accident 
and health insurance classes, in particular.
 
provisions for bonuses and premium discounts etc. 
represent amounts expected to be paid to policy-
holders in view of the claims experience during the 
financial year.
claims provisions are determined for each line of 
business based on actuarial methods. where such 
business lines encompass more than one business 
area, short-tailed claims provisions are distributed 
based on number of claims reported while long-tailed 
claims provisions are distributed based on premiums 
earned. the models currently used are chain-lad-
der, bornhuetter-ferguson, the loss ratio method. 
chain-ladder techniques are used for lines of business 
with a stable run-off pattern. the bornhuetter-fergu-
son method, and sometimes the loss ratio method, 
are used for claims years in which the previous run-off 
provides insufficient information about the future run-
off performance.
the provision for annuities under workers’ compensa-
tion insurance is calculated on the basis of a mortality 
corresponding to the g82 calculation basis (official 
mortality table).
in some instances, the historic data used in the actuar-
ial models is not necessarily predictive of the expected 
future development of claims. for example, this is 
the case with legislative changes where an a priori 
estimate is used for premium increases related to the 
expected increase in claims. in connection with leg-
islative changes, the same estimate is used for deter-
mining the change in the level of claims. subsequently, 
this estimate is maintained until new loss history 
materialises which can be used for re-estimation.
several assumptions and estimates underlying the 
calculation of the claims provisions are mutually 
dependent. most importantly, this can be expected to 
be the case for assumptions relating to interest rates 
and inflation.
workers’ compensation is an area in which explicit 
inflation assumptions are used, with annuities for 
the insured being indexed based on the workers’ 
compensation index. an inflation curve that reflects 
the market’s inflation expectations plus a real wage 
spread is used as an approximation to the workers’ 
compensation index.
for other lines of business, the inflation assump-
tions, because present only implicitly in the actuarial 
models, will cause a certain lag in predicting the level 
of future losses when a change in inflation occurs. on 
the other hand, the effect of discounting will show 
immediately as a consequence of inflation changes to 
the extent that such changes affect the interest rate.
other correlations are not deemed to be significant.
liability adequacy test
tests are continuously performed to ensure the 
adequacy of the insurance provisions. in performing 
these tests, current best estimates of future cash flows 
of claims, gains and direct and indirect claims handling 
costs are used. any deficiency results in an increase 
in the relevant provision, and the adjustment is recog-
nised in the income statement.
employee benefits
pension obligations
the group operates various pension schemes. 
the schemes are funded through contributions to 
insurance companies or trustee-administered funds. 
in norway, the group operated a defined-benefit plan 
which was closed at 01 january 20. in denmark, the 
annual report 2020 | tryg a/s | 105
financial statements - contents
notes
group operates a defined-contribution plan. a de-
fined-contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further contributions. in sweden, the 
group complies with the industry pension agreement, 
ftp-planen. ftp-planen is primarily a defined-ben-
efit plan as regards the future pension benefits. 
försäkringsbranschens pensionskassa (fpk) is unable 
to provide sufficient information for the group to use 
defined-benefit accounting. the plan is on that basis 
accounted for as a defined-contribution plan. as part 
of the termination of the defined-benefit plan in nor-
way, an agreement of compensation to the employees 
covered by the plan was agreed. a liability has been 
established to cover the expected compensation to 
be paid to the employees upon retirement from the 
company. if the employee leaves before retirement 
only a part of the compensation is paid. there is no 
future actuarial assumptions related to the liability, 
only uncertainty is whether the employees stays to 
retirement or not.    
other employee benefits
employees of the group are entitled to a fixed 
payment when they reach retirement and when they 
have been employed with the group for 25 and for 40 
years. the group recognises this liability at the time of 
signing the contract of employment.
in special instances, the employee can enter into a 
contract with the group to receive compensation for 
loss of pension benefits caused by reduced working 
hours. the group recognises this liability based on 
statistical models.
income tax and deferred tax
the group expenses current tax according to the tax 
laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. current 
tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recog-
nised in the statement of financial position as estimat-
ed tax on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for 
change in tax on prior years’ taxable income and for 
tax paid under the on-account tax scheme.
deferred tax is measured according to the statement 
of financial position liability method on all timing 
differences between the tax and accounting value of 
assets and liabilities. deferred income tax is measured 
using the tax rules and tax rates that apply in the rele-
vant countries on the statement of financial position 
date when the deferred tax asset is realised, or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
deferred income tax assets, including the tax value 
of tax losses carried forward, are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be realised against which the temporary differences 
can be offset.
deferred income tax is provided on temporary differ-
ences concerning investments, except where tryg con-
trols when the temporary difference will be realised, 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not be realised in the foreseeable future.
other provisions
provisions are recognised when the group has a legal 
or constructive obligation because of an event prior 
to or at the statement of financial position date, and 
it is probable that future economic benefits will flow 
out of the group. provisions are measured at the best 
estimate by management of the expenditure required 
to settle the present obligation. provisions for restruc-
turings are recognised as obligations when a detailed 
formal restructuring plan has been announced prior 
to or at the statement of financial position date at the 
latest to the persons affected by the plan.  
own insurance is included under other provisions. the 
provisions apply to the group’s own insurance claims 
and are reported when the damage occurs according 
to the same principle as the group’s other claims 
provisions. 
debt
debt comprises debt in connection with direct 
insurance and reinsurance, amounts owed to credit 
institutions, current tax obligations, debt to group 
undertakings and other debt. derivative financial 
instruments are assessed at fair value according to the 
same practice that applies to financial assets. other 
liabilities are assessed at amortised cost based on the 
effective interest method.
debt related to leasing and the external investors 
share of kapitalforeningen tryg invest funds and ti 
real estate kl are included in other debt. the external 
investors share of kapitalforeningen tryg invest funds 
relates to shares, bonds and investment properties.  
cash flow statement
the consolidated cash flow statement is presented 
using the direct method and shows cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities as well 
as the group’s cash and cash equivalents at the 
beginning and end of the financial year. no separate 
cash flow statement has been prepared for the parent 
company because it is included in the consolidated 
cash flow statement.
cash flows from operating activities are calculated 
whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and 
gross cash payments are disclosed.
cash flows from investing activities comprise 
payments in connection with the purchase and sale 
of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment 
as well as financial assets and deposits with credit 
institutions.
 
cash flows from financing activities comprise changes 
in the size or composition of tryg’s share capital and 
related costs as well as the raising of loans, repay-
ments of interest-bearing debt and the payment of 
dividends.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and de-
mand deposits.
other 
the amounts in the report are disclosed in whole num-
bers of dkkm, unless otherwise stated. the amounts 
have been rounded and consequently the sum of the 
rounded amounts and totals may differ slightly.

contractual obligations, contingent liabilities and collateral
the danish companies in the tryg group are jointly taxed with tryghedsgruppen smba. the companies 
and the other jointly taxed companies are liable for any obligations to withhold taxes at source on inte-
rest, royalties, dividends and income taxes etc. in respect of the jointly taxed companies.
companies in the tryg group are party to a number of disputes in denmark, norway and sweden.
management believes that the outcome of these disputes will not affect the group’s financial position 
over and above the receivables and liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at  
31 december 2020.

swedish general insurance
comprises tryg forsikring a/s, swedish branch.
total reserve ratio

divided by premium income.
unwinding
unwinding of discounting takes place with the passage 
of time as the expected time to payment is reduced. 
the closer the time of payment, the smaller the 
discount. this gradual increase of the provision is not 
recognised under claims, but under technical interest 
in the income statement.
alternative performance measures
until the sale of certain owner occupied properties 
by the tryg group in 2016, pursuant to the executive 
order issued by the danish financial supervisory au-
thority on the financial reports for insurance compa-
nies and multi-employer occupational pension funds, 
the tryg group has calculated the gross expense ratio, 
the combined ratio and the operating ratio by adding a 
hypothetical market rent to and deducting the actual 
depreciation from operating expenses. previously, in 
addition the tryg group has in its financial statements 
presented a gross expense ratio without these adjust-
ment as an alternative performance measure, howev-
er, subsequent to 2016 this alternative performance 
measure is not relevant and not presented as the tryg 
group does not have owner occupied properties.
 
the following financial measures included in this
