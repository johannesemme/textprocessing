covid-19 presented 
significant challenges for  
our customers, people and 
business. we are proud of the 
great commitment of all our 
employees, which contributed 
to the resilience of the group. 
during the year, our top priority was 
the health and wellbeing of our 
employees, while at the same time 
taking the required actions to protect 
the health of our business. 
 
throughout the year, our on-trade 
customers in particular were severely 
impacted by the pandemic. we were 
impressed by the tremendous 
resilience and flexibility of our 
people, which allowed us to stabilise 
the business, support our customers 
and help societies. read more about 
our wider response to the covid-19 
challenges on pages 12-14, 
including our specific actions in 
relation to societies and customers. 
a resilient company 
the significantly strengthened 
performance of the group in recent 
years was a key prerequisite for the 
high degree of resilience – in terms 
of our organisation and people, our 
financial position and our portfolio – 
which helped us navigate through 
the uncharted waters of the 
pandemic.  
 
organisation & people 
resilience  
early on, we were able to build on 
and adapt the way we work as a 
company.  
 
from the central office, we provided 
clear direction to the regions and 
markets with three priorities: 
protecting the health and safety  
of employees and maintaining 
service to customers; protecting 
operating profit and cash; and 
ensuring our readiness for better 
times. subsequently, we empowered 
our country management teams to 
translate these priorities into local 
action plans – recognising that  
while the pandemic was global, 
government and consumer responses 
were very local.  
 
across the group, our employees 
showed a high degree of flexibility 
and engagement, quickly adapting to 
the changing market environment 
and operating conditions, and finding 
safe and efficient ways of working. 
be it in markets or functions, 
everyone went the extra mile, 
despite working under very difficult 
circumstances.  
 
we are confident that being a 
purpose-driven company with a high 
level of employee satisfaction and 
engagement was crucial for our 
ability to navigate through these 
uncharted waters.

2020 was a challenging year, significantly impacted 
by covid-19. during the year, the health and 
wellbeing of our people was our first priority,  
followed by protecting the health of our business. 
flemming besenbacher, chair

turned the focus onto reducing costs 
and preserving our top line.  
 
regarding costs, we were able to 
leverage ocm, our well-established 
cost management system, to identify 
and execute cost savings.  
 
in terms of top line, our on-trade 
customers suffered and we saw a 
major channel shift – from on-trade 
to off-trade and e-commerce. due 
to the lower volumes and the 
negative price/mix, revenue declined 
organically by 8.4%. thanks to our 
cost reduction efforts, the organic 
decline in operating profit was 
confined to 3.1%, while reported 
operating margin increased by 70bp 
to 16.6%.  
 
in april, we suspended our full-year 
guidance for organic growth in 
operating profit due to the high level 
of volatility and uncertainty. in 
august, we issued a new guidance 
and, thanks to the resilience and 
strong performance of our global 
organisation, subsequently upgraded 
our guidance twice – in september 
and october.  
 
we entered the crisis with a strong 
balance sheet and an organisation 
skilled in proactive cash management. 
by maintaining focus on all elements 
of working capital and reducing non-
essential capex, and supported by 
good earnings, we delivered a solid 
free cash flow of dkk 5.1bn. 
 
our strong financial position enabled 
us to carry out inorganic transactions, 
including the acquisitions of 
marston’s brewing activities in the 
uk, wernesgrüner brewery in 
germany and the purchase of the 
brooklyn brand rights in our 
markets. we also merged our 
businesses in china, see page 23. 
 
furthermore, we made significant 
cash returns to our shareholders. in 
march, we paid a total dividend of 
dkk 3.1bn, and from january to 
mid-august our share buy-backs 
amounted to dkk 2.9bn. on 5 
february 2021, we initiated a 3-
month share buy-back programme 
of dkk 750m. read more about the 
share buy-back programmes on 
page 26. 
 
at the annual general meeting on 
15 march 2021, the supervisory 
board will propose a 5% increase in 
the dividend to dkk 22.0 per share 
and that 2.9m treasury shares be 
cancelled.  
 
portfolio resilience 
in recent years, our sail’22  
choices have improved the strategic 
health of the group and made our 
markets and product portfolio more 
resilient. we have rationalised and 
strengthened our brand portfolio, and 
today we have an attractive portfolio 
of categories and brands, as 
showcased on page 10. in particular, 
our investments in and focus on 
building the craft & speciality and 
alcohol-free brew categories have 
delivered strong growth.  
 
craft & speciality grew by 1%, 
despite the category being more 
skewed towards the severely 
impacted on-trade channel. alcohol-
free brews grew by 11%, supported 
by increased awareness of health 
and wellbeing among consumers, 
possibly fuelled by the pandemic. 
 
respond and reset 
our strategic priorities (see pages 
30-34) remain valid and will be 
instrumental for our growth 
aspirations, although we expect the 
challenges and uncertainty of 2020 
to continue for some time to come. 
consequently, we are taking steps to 
reorient the company for the 
sustained uncertainty.  
 
there are two elements to this.  
respond is focused on being ready 
for and responsive to changes in 
consumer and customer demands.  
reset addresses our cost base to 
align it with the changed market 
environment. unfortunately, as part 
of this we have had to depart with 
good colleagues. read more about 
respond and reset on pages 13-14. 
  
advancing sustainability 
we are continuing to drive progress 
towards our ambitious targets in our 
sustainability programme together 
towards zero. to ensure the right 
focus for our activities, in 2020 we 
updated our materiality assessment 
and carried out a comprehensive 
water risk assessment in partnership 
with wwf.  
 
recognising the impact of climate 
change on our business, we have 
become a supporter of the task 
force on climate-related financial 
disclosures (tcfd). in this report, we 
take the first steps in disclosing 
climate-related risk to our business, 
using the tcfd framework.  
 
as part of our annual reporting  
suite, along with the annual report 
and the remuneration report, our 
sustainability report contains a 
wealth of data, insights into our 
achievements to date and our future 
plans, a summary of which can be 
found in this report on pages 6 and 
33-35. 
 
changes to the supervisory 
board 
at the annual general meeting, the 
supervisory board will propose 
henrik poulsen, former ceo of 
Ørsted, as a new member. the 
supervisory board will also propose 
that henrik poulsen become deputy 
chairman of the supervisory board, 
replacing lars fruergaard jørgensen. 
lars fruergaard jørgensen will 
remain as a member of the 
supervisory board. in addition, 
domitille doat-le bigot has notified 
the supervisory board that she is not 
standing for re-election at the 
annual general meeting. 
 
thank you 
we will remember 2020 for the 
significant challenges presented to 
everybody by covid-19. we are 
deeply impressed by the high level of 
engagement and commitment of our 
colleagues during the year. we want 
to take this opportunity to say thank 
you to each and every one –  
current employees and those who 
unfortunately had to leave the group.  
 
we would also like to acknowledge 
our shareholders for their support 
and trust during the year.  
 
finally, we would like to thank all our 
suppliers and customers – not least 
our highly-challenged on-trade 
customers – for their cooperation 
during the difficult times in 2020. we 
will continue to support our on-trade 
customers the best way we can and 
we hope for a brighter and more 
cheerful 2021.

highlights
covid-19 was a stress test for our sail’22 strategy. 
notwithstanding the immense hardship posed by the 
pandemic for many people, including our on-trade 
customers, our strategic priorities proved resilient.

carlsberg group annual report 2020   in brief
for a number of years, our chinese business 
has delivered consistently strong results. 
despite the significant nationwide lockdown 
at the beginning of 2020 and subsequent 
local lockdowns during the remainder of 
the year, volumes and revenue/hl grew. key 
drivers were the premium brands, our big 
city strategy, and strong performance in 
e-commerce and modern off-trade.
growing  
in china
our alcohol-free brew and craft & 
speciality portfolios demonstrated their 
strength during the year, delivering 
growth of 11% and 1% respectively. our 
international speciality brand 1664 blanc 
saw impressive growth of 8%, while 
grimbergen declined by 2%, impacted by 
challenges in france. our international 
cider brand, somersby, grew by 2%.

across our markets, we developed innovative 
ways to support our on-trade customers during 
the challenging period of covid-19, including 
digital solutions enabling them to leverage online 
channels such as online delivery platforms, 
launch their own website for takeaway, and 
navigate the world of digital and social marketing. 
another initiative was adopt a keg, which 
rewarded consumers buying carlsberg for home 
consumption with free draught beer that could be 
redeemed at local on-trade outlets.
supporting  
the on-trade
our purpose of brewing for a better  
today and tomorrow is deeply rooted in 
our culture. we took pride in being able to 
assist local communities in the fight against 
covid-19. our many initiatives included the 
production of hand sanitiser, donations of 
protective and testing equipment and alcohol-
free beverages to healthcare workers, and 
financial donations to local organisations.

while results in 2020 were 
impacted by covid-19, the 
group showed a high degree 
of financial resilience thanks to 
our funding the journey 
culture and discipline. 
the market decline and prolonged 
on-trade closures in many markets 
impacted our top line negatively. 
however, our well-embedded 
funding the journey culture, with its 
relentless focus on costs and early 
intervention, enabled us to partly 
offset this headwind, limiting the 
decline in operating profit. the 
operating margin and roic 
improved, free cash flow was solid 
and financial leverage of 1.51x was 
well within our target of below 2x 
nibd/ebitda. read about the 
results on pages 15-17 and in the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
we also continued to return cash to 
shareholders by delivering on our 
dividend policy and conducting share 
buy-backs. total cash return to 
shareholders in 2020 amounted to 
dkk 6bn. read more on page 26.

an attractive 
beer portfolio
our brands
our beer portfolio spans  
our core beer brands, craft  
& speciality brands and 
alcohol-free brews.
core beer
our local power brands each have a 
long history in their markets, enjoying 
high levels of consumer loyalty.
the importance of core beer was 
evidenced even further during the 
covid crisis, as consumers turned to 
these well-known brands – often in 
multipacks – when doing their off- 
or online shopping.
our core international brands were 
impacted by covid-19 government 
measures in significant markets. 
tuborg volumes grew by 15% 
in russia and increased slightly 
in china, but this was offset by 
challenges in other large markets, 
such as india and nepal, and total 
brand volumes declined by 9%. 
carlsberg volumes were down 10%, 
impacted by the market declines 
in india, malaysia and denmark 
and the closure of the night 
entertainment channel in china.
craft & speciality (c&s)
our c&s portfolio includes our 
international speciality brands,  
local craft brands and the 
international cider brand somersby. 
this attractive portfolio has 
delivered strong growth in recent 
years, supporting the continued 
margin progression of the group.
despite severe restrictions  
imposed on the on-trade in 2020, 
our c&s volumes grew by 1%, 
with particularly strong growth in 
markets such as poland, norway, 
switzerland, russia and china.
alcohol-free brews (afb)
afb was positively impacted  
by an acceleration in consumer 
awareness of health and wellbeing, 
as the pandemic took its toll  
across the world.
driven by good results for the  
afb offerings of our local power 
brands in western europe and 
eastern europe, our afb volumes 
continued the positive trajectory, 
growing by 11%.

the covid-19 pandemic 
affected lives worldwide. from 
the beginning, we had three 
priorities: protecting our 
people, protecting earnings 
and cash, and preparing for 
the rebound. 
below, we summarise the impact of 
covid-19 on our business and our 
mitigating actions – in light of our 
three priorities – during the year.  
 
market impact 
beer is most often enjoyed in social 
settings, and markets across our 
regions were therefore impacted by 
restrictions and lockdowns, which 
prevented consumers from engaging 
in social activities. some markets 
benefited from populations not being 
able to travel, while others suffered 
from lack of tourism or temporary 
ruralisation, as migrant workers left 
the cities.  
 
on-trade 
for the group, the on-trade channel 
accounts for around 25% of volumes 
(2019 figures). exposure is at the 
same level in western europe, above 
average in asia and very small in 
eastern europe. across our markets, 
the on-trade in particular was 
affected by a range of government 
interventions, including lockdowns, 
restrictions on people gathering etc., 
although the length and severity of 
these measures differed between 
markets. 
 
in local markets, we found ways to 
support our on-trade customers. 
these included support for developing 
on-line delivery and take-away 
platforms, and encouraging 
consumers to return to their on-trade 
outlet by donating free draught beer.  
 
off-trade 
the impact on the off-trade varied 
significantly between markets, 
depending on government actions 
and their influence on consumer 
behaviour. in some markets, off-
trade volumes grew by double-digit 
percentages, while other markets 
saw double-digit-percentage decline.

overall, off-trade volumes increased, 
though not enough to offset the 
volume decline in the on-trade. 
 
e-commerce 
during the year, we saw rapid 
acceleration on e-commerce and 
digital platforms. our third-party  
e-commerce sales were up by 
approximately 60%, with particularly 
strong growth in asia. 
 
supporting our people  
during the year, our people worked 
under very difficult circumstances, 
whether at our breweries, in sales or 
from home. a total of 1,756 covid-
19 cases were recorded among our 
40,000 or so employees. very sadly, 
five employees died from the 
infection. 
 
our first priority was to protect the 
physical health of our people. in 
order to minimise the risk of 
infection, we implemented several 
initiatives. at the breweries, these 
included working in shifts and 
expanding the use of protective 
equipment. at our offices, we put in 
place rigorous procedures to 
minimise the risk of infection, and 
many employees worked from home. 
 
our second priority was to strengthen 
communication and safeguard the 
mental wellbeing of our people. we 
strengthened and increased our 
overall communication, including 
within the leadership team, setting 
priorities and aligning objectives 
across markets and functions. for 
the many employees required to 
work remotely, we offered virtual 
training and tools to help them cope 
with the new challenges.  
 
we intensified the top management 
communication by introducing 
regular ceo video messages on the 
intranet, virtual townhalls and 
fireside chat with the executive 
committee. 
 
supporting communities 
during the crisis, it was very 
important for us to support and 
contribute to the communities as 
best as we could. in local markets, 
our businesses engaged in the 
production of hand sanitiser, donated 
protective and testing equipment and 
alcohol-free beverages to healthcare 
workers, and made financial 
donations to local organisations. 
 
in addition, our largest shareholder, 
the carlsberg foundation, made 
donations amounting to more than 
dkk 100m to support covid-19-
related research, culture and civil 
society. 
 
securing the financial 
health of the business 
group volumes were down 
organically by 3.8% and revenue/hl 
was -5%. the former was due to 
declines in western europe and asia, 
while the latter was impacted by 
channel mix due to the decline in the 
on-trade as well as channel shift 
within the off-trade, increased 
demand for multipacks and 
mainstream brands, and country mix 
characterised by growth in markets 
with lower-than-average price levels. 
 
responding to the impact of covid-
19 on revenue, significant changes 
were implemented to safeguard the 
financial health of our company, 
both in terms of protecting the year’s 
results and cash, and ensuring that 
we will be able to capture long-term 
growth opportunities. 
 
safeguarding operating profit 
as early as january, we started 
taking steps to reduce costs.  
 
in the supply chain, we reduced the 
production planning cycle from one 
month to 1-2 weeks and the number 
of skus to increase flexibility in the 
light of unpredictable supply and 
demand. this led to sharper focus, 
less complexity and larger batch sizes. 
 
we reinforced our funding the 
journey culture, accelerated 
efficiencies and initiated further cost 
reductions. a key enabler was our 
well-embedded operating cost 
management (ocm) toolkit, with 15 
specific cost groups for which we 
rigorously initiated actions and 
monitored savings and gap-closing 
progress. our early actions led to 
significant cost reductions during the 
year, with savings achieved in almost 
all cost groups, including professional 
services, travel, entertainment, 
people and marketing spend. some 
savings will be permanent, while 
others, including marketing, will not. 
our many actions limited the organic 
decline in operating profit to 3.1%. 
 
notwithstanding covid-19, our 
long-term strategic priorities and 
ambitions remain intact, and we 
continued to support and invest in 
our brands and activities to safe-
guard the long-term health of the 
group and our growth opportunities.  
 
protecting cash and liquidity  
to protect cash flow and secure 
strong liquidity and financial 
flexibility, the group implemented 
several initiatives, such as further 
stepping up our trade working capital 
management and reducing or 
deferring capital expenditures.  
 
in march, we established a new 
short-term bank credit facility, and 
in march and june respectively we 
issued two bonds at very attractive 
rates. read about our financial 
performance, cash and liquidity on 
pages 15-17. 
 
our strong balance sheet, combined 
with the measures taken to protect 
cash and liquidity during the crisis, 
meant that the group’s financial 
position remained very strong 
throughout the year and that we 
were able to engage in m&a 
transactions despite the covid-19 
headwind.  
 
preparing for the rebound 
the future remains uncertain, 
including the longer-term impact on 
the global economy and consumer 
spending. for the beer industry, the 
longer-term impact on the on-trade 
is uncertain, as are longer-term 
changes in consumer preferences in 
terms of channels, brands and price 
points. 
 
while our sail’22 strategy (see 
pages 30-35) remains unchanged, 
we reshaped and reoriented our 
organisation and plans to allow us to 
meet the known and unknown 
challenges we will face going forward. 
 
respond for top-line growth 
we will respond to the challenges 
ahead of us by sharpening our focus 
and building increased flexibility into 
our planning. we are prioritising 
fewer brands and activities. within 
core beer, we are intensifying the 
focus on our local power brands and 
international premium brands, such 
as carlsberg and tuborg. with 
respect to innovation, we are 
targeting our efforts towards more 
focused and efficient initiatives.  
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   review and expectations 
14 
 
using our value management 
approach, we will ensure that we  
hit the right price points. we are 
working with and supporting the on-
trade to prepare for the new reality.  
in addition, we are investing in  
and expanding our e-commerce 
activities.  
 
reset for the future 
recognising the need to reset, we 
initiated a review of our total cost 
base towards the end of the year. 
this led to a significant reduction in 
costs in our central, regional and 
support functions as well as in the 
supply chain. unfortunately, this 
meant that we had to depart with 
valued colleagues.  
 
in our markets, we are ensuring the 
right structures to accommodate a 
potentially smaller on-trade and 
changes within off-trade subchannels. 
we also scrutinised all other non-
essential spending and anticipate 
targeted reductions going forward. 
  
the learnings from the covid-19 
pandemic, including a high degree of 
flexibility, rapid adaptation to sudden 
and very new challenges, and new 
ways of working, have been positive. 
we are taking steps to ensure that 
these learnings are embedded in our 
future ways of working. 
+8% 
1664 blanc volume growth  
despite covid-19, in 2020 we 
continued to invest in our key 
strategic priorities, including the 
launch of a new global 
communication platform for 1664 
blanc – good taste with a twist – in 
order to invigorate this iconic french 
speciality beer. the campaign 
modernises the brand’s premium 
credentials and realigns it with its 
french heritage. recognising covid-
19’s impact on consumers’ lives, an  
 
online video series, chef at home, 
was a key part of the new platform. 
the videos were produced to elevate 
stay-at-home moments by offering 
tasty yet simple recipes inspired by 
french cuisine but with a twist. 
when developing the campaign, our 
central team liaised with the brand’s 
largest markets, including china and 
russia. 1664 blanc grew strongly in 
both markets.

2020 was a challenging and 
very volatile year for the 
group, significantly impacted 
by the covid-19 pandemic. 
as a result of the high level of 
volatility and uncertainty during the 
year, we had to suspend the full-
year guidance in april and did not 
issue new guidance until august, 
after which we issued two earnings 
upgrades. see table on the right-
hand side. 
 
volumes 
group beer volumes were 110.1m hl, 
declining organically by 2.8%, as 
they were impacted by covid-19 in 
most markets. non-beer volumes 
were 20.0m hl, declining organically 
by 8.7%. in addition to covid-19, 
non-beer volumes were impacted by 
lower sales of soft drinks at the 
german/danish border.  
 
total volumes declined organically 
by 3.8%, while reported decline was 
3.6% due to the acquisition of 
marston’s brewing activities in the 
uk in october. 
income statement 
revenue was dkk 58.5bn. organic 
decline was 8.4%. revenue per hl 
declined organically by 5%. price/mix 
was negatively impacted by country, 
channel, product and packaging mix, 
and in russia by higher promotions. 
reported revenue declined by 11.2% 
due to currencies, mainly related to 
the russian, norwegian and chinese 
currencies.  
 
gross profit was dkk 28.4bn. the 
organic decline was 10%, while cogs 
per hl improved organically by 3%, 
positively impacted by efficiencies 
and country and product mix. the 
gross margin declined by 110bp to 
48.4%, as supply chain efficiencies 
were not enough to offset the 
under-absorption of fixed costs and 
the channel and product mix. the 
gross margin was also impacted by 
country mix. 
 
operating expenses declined 
organically by 14% as a result of 
tight cost control enabled by our 
operating cost management toolkit. 
the main areas in which costs fell 
were marketing, travel, supply chain 
and employee-related costs.  
 
reported operating expenses as a 
percentage of revenue declined by 
200bp to 32.2%. excluding marketing 
expenses, operating expenses 
declined organically by 13%.  
operating profit before depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment losses 
(ebitda) declined by 2.4% 
organically and in reported terms by 
6.1%. the ebitda margin improved 
by 130bp to 24.1%.  
 
operating profit declined organically 
by 3.1%. we saw solid growth in asia 
and eastern europe, while operating 
profit declined in western europe. 
reported operating profit was dkk 
9.7bn, corresponding to a decline of 
7.3%. the reported operating margin 
improved by 70bp to 16.6%.

section 1 in the consolidated 
financial statements contains more 
details on operating activities.  
 
net special items (pre-tax) amounted 
to dkk -247m (2019: dkk +501m). 
special items were positively impacted 
by reversal of provisions made in 
purchase price allocations in previous 
years, offset mainly by restructuring 
costs, including costs related to the 
reset for the future initiative (see 
page 14), and impairment of brands, 
including the angkor brand in 
cambodia. special items were also 
impacted by one-off costs related to 
covid-19, including safety measures 
and donations. read more about net 
special items in section 3.1 in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
financial items, net, amounted to 
dkk -411m against dkk -738m in 
2019. excluding currency gains and 
losses, financial items, net, amounted 
to dkk -550m (2019: dkk -650m), 
positively impacted by lower other 
financial expenses. currency gains 
were mainly related to usd/eur 
deposits in eastern europe. read 
more about net financial items in 
section 4.1 in the consolidated 
financial statements.  
 
tax totalled dkk -2,233m against 
dkk -2,751m in 2019. the effective 
tax rate of 24.7% was positively 
impacted by the net impact of tax-
exempt and non-deductible special 
items. excluding these, the effective 
tax rate would have been 25.7%. 
read more about tax in section 6 in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
 
non-controlling interests were dkk 
778m (2019: dkk 908m), mainly 
impacted by challenging market 
conditions in malaysia and the new 
carlsberg marston’s brewing 
company in the uk, of which the 
group owns 60%. read more about 
non-controlling interests in section 
5.3 in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
the carlsberg group’s share of 
consolidated profit (net profit) was 
dkk 6,030m against dkk 6,569m in 
2019. the decline was due to lower 
operating profit and special items, 
partly offset by lower financial 
expenses, net, and the lower tax rate.  
 
adjusted net profit (adjusted for 
special items after tax) was dkk 
6,363m (2019: dkk 6,160m). 
 
statement of financial 
position 
assets 
total assets amounted to dkk 
118,816m at 31 december 2020 (31 
december 2019: dkk 123,063m). 
the decline was mainly due to lower 
intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment and trade receivables, 
partly offset by an increase in cash. 
 
intangible assets amounted to dkk 
66,061m at 31 december 2020 (31 
december 2019: dkk 70,027m). 
the decline was mainly due to the 
depreciation of currencies in eastern 
europe and asia. 
 
property, plant and equipment 
totalled dkk 26,299m (31 
december 2019: dkk 27,607m). 
the decline of dkk 1,308m was 
primarily due to depreciation, lower 
capex and currencies. 
 
current assets amounted to dkk 
18,996m (31 december 2019: dkk 
17,948m). trade receivables 
declined by dkk 1,614m, mainly 
attributable to lower sales due to 
covid-19 and higher provisions for 
bad debt. inventories of dkk 
4,613m were slightly below last year 
(31 december 2019: dkk 4,751m). 
cash and cash equivalents amounted 
to dkk 8,093m (31 december 2019: 
dkk 5,222m), positively impacted 
by the two eur 500m bonds issued 
in march and june respectively. 
 
section 2 in the consolidated 
financial statements contains more 
details on assets. 
 
equity and liabilities 
equity 
equity amounted to dkk 43,362m 
at 31 december 2020 (31 december 
2019: dkk 46,034m), dkk 39,308m 
of which was attributed to 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s and 
dkk 4,054m to non-controlling 
interests. 
 
the net change in equity of dkk  
-2,672m was explained by the 
consolidated profit of dkk 6,808m, 
non-controlling interests of dkk 
3,758m, which were impacted by fair 
value adjustments of contingent 
considerations, and acquisition of 
entities of dkk 1,027m, offset by 
the dividend payout, including non-
controlling interests of dkk -
3,898m, the share buy-backs of 
dkk -2,900m and foreign exchange 
adjustment in other comprehensive 
income of dkk -7,640m. 
 
liabilities 
total liabilities were dkk 75,454m 
against dkk 77,029m at 31 
december 2019. the decline was 
impacted by lower trade payables 
and other liabilities. 
 
long- and short-term borrowings 
increased by dkk 5,259m compared 
with 31 december 2019. the 
increase was due to the issuance of 
two eur 500m bonds in march and 
june respectively. at 31 december 
2020, long-term borrowings were 
dkk 29,291m (31 december 2019: 
dkk 20,879m) and short-term 
borrowings were dkk 959m (31 
december 2019: dkk 4,112m). 
section 4 in the consolidated 
financial statements contains more 
details on borrowings. 
 
tax liabilities, retirement benefit 
obligations etc. were dkk 17,714m 
(31 december 2019: dkk 22,839m). 
the decline was mainly due to fair 
value adjustments of contingent 
considerations. 
 
current liabilities excluding short-
term borrowings decreased to dkk 
27,490m (31 december 2019: dkk 
29,199m). trade payables declined 
by dkk 551m, impacted by 
currencies partly offset by trade 
payables acquired in connection with 
the acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities in the uk. other current 
liabilities, excluding deposits on 
returnable packaging, declined by 
dkk 889m, impacted by lower 
bonus accruals and vat. 
 
cash flow  
free cash flow amounted to dkk 
5,057m versus dkk 9,962m in 
2019, mainly impacted by the lower 
ebitda, a lower net contribution 
from the change in working capital 
and acquisitions.  
 
net cash flow amounted to dkk 
3,247m (2019: dkk -331m). the 
increase from 2019 was mainly due 
to external financing of dkk 5,060m 
(2019: dkk -935m), impacted by 
two bond placings of eur 500m in 
march and june and lower non-
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   review and expectations 
17 
 
controlling interests of dkk -877m 
(2019: dkk -2,520m), partly offset 
by higher dividends of dkk 3,093m 
paid to shareholders in march (2019: 
dkk 2,738m) and a lower share 
buy-back in 2020 of dkk 2,900m 
compared to dkk 4,100m in 2019. 
 
cash flow from operating 
activities 
cash flow from operating activities 
amounted to dkk 10,928m against 
dkk 12,239m in 2019.  
 
ebitda was dkk 14,085m (2019: 
dkk 15,007m).  
 
the change in trade working capital 
was dkk +1,321m (2019: dkk 
+491m), mainly due to strong cash 
management discipline and lower 
trade receivables, the latter impacted 
by lower sales. average trade 
working capital to revenue for the 
year was -18.6% compared to  
-16.8% for 2019, supported by  
the lower revenue. 
 
the change in other working capital 
was dkk -1,033m (2019: dkk 
+634m), mainly impacted by lower 
vat payable, change in provisions 
and a reclassification to trade 
working capital.  
 
restructuring costs paid amounted 
to dkk -531m (2019: dkk -445m). 
net interest etc. paid amounted to 
dkk -424m (2019: dkk -894m). 
the decline was mainly due to the 
settlement of financial instruments. 
corporation tax paid was dkk  
-1,958m (2019: dkk -2,234m). 
the decrease versus last year was 
mainly due to lower earnings. 
 
cash flow from investing 
activities 
cash flow from investing activities 
was dkk -5,871m against dkk  
-2,277m in 2019.  
 
operational investments totalled 
dkk -3,835m (2019: dkk  
-2,824m). in 2019, operation 
al investments were impacted by  
the disposal of the brewery sites in 
norway and germany.  
 
acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets 
(capex) amounted to dkk -4,396m 
(2019: dkk -4,588m). excluding the 
purchase of the brooklyn brand 
rights, capex declined by dkk 1.0bn 
to dkk 3.6bn due to lower sales 
capex, fewer returnable glass bottles, 
fewer investments in draught lines, 
and cancellations or postponements 
of non-business-critical projects.  
 
total financial investments amounted 
to dkk -2,036m (2019: dkk 
+551m). the increase was due to the 
acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities, the prepayment for the 
acquisition of wernesgrüner brewery 
and lower dividends received. read 
more about the acquisitions in section 
5.2 in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
return on invested capital 
return on invested capital (roic) 
improved by 10bp to 8.9%, mainly 
driven by the lower effective tax rate 
and supported by lower capital 
employed. the latter was positively 
impacted by trade working capital, a 
lower capex/depreciation ratio and 
currencies. 
 
roic excluding goodwill improved by 
80bp to 23.2%. 
 
financing 
at 31 december 2020, gross 
financial debt amounted to  
dkk 30,250m and net interest-
bearing debt to dkk 21,263m.  
the difference of dkk 8,987m 
mainly comprised cash and cash 
equivalents of dkk 8,093m. at 31 
december 2020, the average 
duration was 5.6 years. 
 
the net interest-bearing 
debt/ebitda ratio increased to 
1.51x (1.25x at year-end 2019). 
read more about net interest-bearing 
debt in section 4.2 in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
of the gross financial debt, 97% 
(dkk 29,291m) was long term, i.e. 
with maturity of more than one year 
from 31 december 2020.  
to secure continued strong liquidity 
and financial flexibility, we issued a 
10-year eur 500m bond with a 
coupon of 0.625% on 4 march and a 
7-year eur 500m bond with a 
coupon of 0.375% on 16 june. 81% 
of the net financial debt was 
denominated in eur and dkk (after 
swaps). read more about our funding 
and liquidity in section 4.7 in the

western europe had a volatile 
year. covid-19 severely 
impacted results in q2 and q4, 
while q3 brought some relief 
due to fewer restrictions 
during the summer months. 
western europe is our largest region, 
accounting for almost half of our 
operating profit. we are the second 
largest brewer in the region, with a 
particularly strong presence in the 
central and northern parts, where we 
hold no. 1 and 2 positions in several 
markets.  
 
in the nordic markets, we are mainly 
competing against local or regional 
players. elsewhere, we are in 
competition with large global 
players. 
 
our western europe region also 
includes our global export and 
licence business. 
 
regional results 
the western europe region had a 
challenging and volatile year. the 
region delivered strong results in q3, 
including beer volume growth 
supported by favourable weather, 
while q2 and q4 were challenging, 
with declining volumes due to 
restrictions and lockdowns, which 
particularly impacted the on-trade 
channel. 
 
beer volumes declined organically  
by 4.8%, while the organic decline in 
total volumes was 7.3%. the decline 
in non-beer volumes was due to the 
lost german/danish border trade 
from 1 january 2020, compounded 
by the impact from on-trade 
closures. the positive acquisition 
impact of 40bp came from the 
acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities, which was consolidated 
from the end of october. 
 
revenue/hl was reduced organically 
by 6%, impacted in all markets by 
channel mix and, for the region, by 
country mix. revenue declined 
organically by 12.8%, while reported 
revenue declined by 13.1% due to a 
negative currency impact, mainly 
related to the norwegian krone,

partly offset by the stronger swiss 
franc. 
 
we achieved significant cost savings 
within supply chain, logistics, 
marketing and administration, 
though these savings were 
insufficient to cover the revenue 
decline. operating profit therefore 
declined organically by 17.2%. the 
development was particularly bad in 
q2 and q4 due to the severe 
covid-19-related market situation.  
 
the operating margin was 15.8%  
(-120bp). some markets delivered 
good operating margin improvement, 
though this was offset by the 
significant headwinds in some 
markets. 
 
the nordics 
our danish off-trade volumes grew, 
though not enough to compensate 
for lower on-trade and border 
volumes. mainly due to the change 
to german/danish border trade in 
soft drinks from 1 january 2020, 
total volumes in denmark declined 
by more than 25%. excluding the lost 
border trade, volumes declined by 
mid-single-digit percentages due to 
restrictions and lockdowns.  
 
our norwegian business delivered 
solid double-digit-percentage 
volume growth, supported by good 
weather during the summer, 
domestic tourism and less border 
trade in sweden due to the closure of 
the border. our local power brand

speciality performed particularly 
well. 
 
despite the swedish government 
imposing less restrictive covid-19 
measures than most other  
countries, the on-trade channel  
was nevertheless negatively 
impacted. coupled with the decline  
in the norwegian border trade, our 
volumes were down by high-single-
digit percentages. 
 
france 
in france, our business had a 
challenging year, with volumes 
declining by double-digit 
percentages. the on-trade channel 
was severely impacted by restrictions 
and lockdowns in q2 and q4. in 
addition, our brewery in obernai  
was unable to run at normal 
capacity utilisation in h1 due to 
covid-19 constraints, negatively 
impacting our promotional activities 
in the off-trade and market share.  
in h2, volumes and market shares 
improved following a normalisation 
of the supply chain and our 
promotional activities. 
 
switzerland 
our business in switzerland saw solid 
volume growth in the off-trade, but 
as the business is skewed towards 
the on-trade channel, total volumes 
were severely impacted by the 
lockdowns, declining by double-digit 
percentages. the brand mix was 
positive due to growth of local and 
international craft & speciality 
brands and alcohol-free beverages. 
 
poland 
in poland, we delivered solid revenue 
growth due to volume growth and 
positive price/mix. although the beer 
market declined slightly, it was less 
impacted by covid-19 than most 
other western european markets 
due to a relatively small on-trade 
channel. our craft & speciality, with 
brands such as somersby and 
zatecky, and alcohol-free brews, 
especially within the flavoured 
subcategory, did particularly well. 
 
the uk 
in the uk, our off-trade volumes 
grew. due to the prolonged 
lockdown of the on-trade, total 
volumes declined by high-single-
digit percentages. in may, the group 
announced the acquisition of 
marston’s brewing activities in the 
uk. the transaction was completed 
at the end of october and the 
integration is progressing well. 
 
other markets 
in germany, our volumes were  
flat for the year. in december,  
we announced the acquisition  
of wernesgrüner brewery, the 
integration of which was concluded 
already in january 2021. 
 
markets such as greece and italy, 
being highly dependent on the on-
trade and tourism, were severely 
impacted by the pandemic.  
 
our bulgarian business performed 
well, growing volumes in a declining 
market. the local power brand 
pirinsko and craft & speciality brands 
such as somersby and zatecky gus 
saw strong growth. 
 
engaging 
in m&a  
during the year, we strengthened our footprint 
in western europe through the acquisitions of 
marston’s brewing activities in the uk, 
wernesgrüner brewery in germany and the 
rights to the brooklyn brand in all our markets 
across our three regions. in the uk, the new 
combined business, of which carlsberg owns 
60%, will significantly strengthen our business. 
carlsberg marston’s brewing company has a 
strong portfolio of international, national and 
regional beer brands within lager and ale that 
brings our customers a wider choice. the 
business will also benefit from the extended 
distribution to the marston’s pub estate. in 
addition, the merger will result in substantial 
revenue and cost synergies.

the impact of covid-19 
differed significantly between 
our asian markets. the 
important chinese market 
recovered well during the year, 
contributing to the solid 
regional performance.  
the importance of asia for the group 
has increased significantly over the 
past decade, during which we have 
expanded our presence in the region 
organically and through acquisitions.  
 
today, we have an attractive overall 
position, with no. 1 and 2 positions 
in six markets. china is the group’s 
largest market in terms of volume, 
revenue and operating profit. the 
competitive landscape varies 
significantly between markets, with 
global players and local brewers 
both present. 
 
sail’22 specifically targets asia as a 
key contributor to the group’s top- 
and bottom-line growth, with 
premiumisation a key element, 
driven by both our international 
 
brands and premiumisation of our 
local power brands. consequently, a 
significant proportion of our sail’22 
investments is allocated to the 
region.  
 
regional results 
the development in asia varied 
significantly between markets and 
during the year. our chinese 
business was severely impacted by 
covid-19 in q1, but rebounded in 
q2. the other markets in the region 
were impacted slightly later, with a 
significant negative impact seen in 
q2. a few markets have since 
experienced some degree of rebound, 
though the situation towards the end 
of the year remained challenging in 
most markets. 
 
total volumes declined organically 
by 5.9%, as the recovery in china 
could not offset the market declines 
elsewhere in the region. 
 
revenue/hl grew by 1%, curbing the 
decline in organic revenue to 5.0%.

country and channel mix. reported 
revenue declined by 7.9% due to the 
devaluation of most asian currencies 
against dkk. 
 
the cost mitigation actions in asia 
were substantial and very successfully 
executed. consequently, operating 
profit grew organically by 5.0% and 
the operating margin improved 
strongly, by 220bp to 23.5%. 
 
marketing investments as a 
percentage of revenue for the full 
year were slightly down year on 
year, but with a significant difference 
between h1 and h2. in h1, we 
reduced marketing investments early 
on to mitigate the covid-19 impact, 
while in h2 investments were back at 
the level we believe is required to 
sustain long-term sustainable 
growth in our asian business. 
china  
our chinese business performed very 
well in a highly volatile environment. 
following a very challenging q1 in 
which china was impacted by 
covid-19, the business rebounded 
in q2, and as a result our full-year 
volumes grew modestly, while the 
overall market declined.  
 
the key drivers for the year were 
expanded distribution of the wusu 
brand outside its home province, 
solid growth of our premium brands 
and continued big city growth.  
 
despite the negative channel mix 
resulting from the change from 
traditional off-trade to modern off-
trade, revenue/hl increased by high-
single-digit percentages due to 
strong growth of premium brands, 
and further enhanced in q4 by 
strong growth of the wusu brand

outside its home province and the 
change in discount accruals.  
 
the material asset restructuring of 
our chinese assets was concluded in 
december, following which most of 
the group’s chinese assets and those 
of chongqing brewery company 
(cbc) are now owned by chongqing 
jianiang brewery co. (jianiang).  
 
jianiang is owned 49% directly by  
the carlsberg group and 51% by  
cbc, the latter being listed on  
the shanghai stock exchange. 
carlsberg is the controlling 
shareholder in cbc, owning 60%  
of the shares. consequently, 
carlsberg’s total economic  
interest in jianiang following the 
restructuring is 79%. 
 
india and nepal 
2020 was a very challenging year  
for our businesses in india and 
nepal, where the beer markets were 
significantly impacted by 
government lockdowns and 
restrictions.  
 
in both markets, our breweries were 
forced to close during q2 and 
distribution was severely restricted  
or even prohibited.  
 
the situation improved slightly  
in h2, but volumes remained 
depressed. consequently, full-year 
volumes declined significantly, by 
approximately 40% in india and 
approximately 50% in nepal. 
 
vietnam, laos and cambodia  
in a highly volatile vietnamese 
market impacted by the pandemic, 
compounded by severe flooding in 
the central part of the country – our 
stronghold – in q4, our volumes 
declined by mid-single-digit 
percentages. our local power brand 
huda continued to perform well. 
 
in laos, our total volumes declined 
slightly as growing soft drinks 
volumes largely compensated for 
lower beer and water volumes. the 
market was impacted by covid-19 
in h1, but recovered from may 
onwards. lack of tourists in the 
country continues to impact the on-
trade sector. 
 
cambodia was impacted by 
restrictions and a significant decline 
in tourism. in addition, our beer 
volumes declined, especially at the 
beginning of the year. while we 
continued our work on rebuilding the 
business, the additional challenges 
brought by covid-19 led us to 
revalue the angkor brand, resulting 
in an impairment charge. volumes 
grew in q4, mainly driven by the soft 
drinks business, in spite of new 
covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions 
in december. 
 
malaysia and singapore 
malaysia was negatively impacted 
by restrictions related to the on-
trade, distribution and production, 
the last of these leading to a 
closure of our brewery in q2.  
 
in singapore, our volumes declined 
modestly while a change in channel 
mix, due to on-trade restrictions, 
impacted price/mix negatively. 
 
 
tuborg in china 
since its launch in 2012, tuborg has 
been on a remarkable journey in 
china. targeting young adult 
chinese consumers, the brand has 
successfully positioned itself as the 
favourite beer for high-energy 
social explorers, and today tuborg 
is the second largest international 
beer brand in china. with sales 
skewed to the on-trade, our big city 
expansion has been an important 
 
growth driver in recent years, with 
around half of brand volumes now 
sold outside our stronghold in 
western china. to ensure the 
continued relevance of the brand, we 
launched tuborg white in 2019 and 
tuborg pure draft in 2020. from 
2015 to 2019, tuborg delivered 
strong growth of around 10% cagr, 
while in 2020 volumes were flat due 
to the challenges of covid-19.

the eastern europe region  
was less impacted by covid-
19 due to low on-trade 
exposure. responding to the 
promotional pressure in 
russia, we successfully grew 
volumes and strengthened our 
market share. 
eastern europe is our smallest 
region, accounting for around one-
fifth of operating profit. our two 
main markets in the region are 
russia and ukraine, accounting for 
67% and 20% respectively of regional 
volumes. 
 
we have no. 1 or 2 positions in all 
markets in eastern europe. in russia 
and ukraine, the competitive 
environment is split between a strong 
presence of global players and a  
large number of small, local brewers. 
 
in light of the relatively small size of 
the region, from 1 january 2021 the 
region has been expanded to include 
some of the former western europe 
markets and our export and licence 
business, changing its name to

regional results 
in eastern europe, the impact of 
covid-19 was relatively modest due 
to low on-trade exposure. however, 
particularly towards the end of the 
year, markets were negatively 
impacted by a change in channel, 
customer and product mix as a result 
of weakening consumer confidence. 
 
all markets, with the exception of 
ukraine, delivered total volume 
growth for the year. for the region, 
beer volumes grew organically by 
5.3%. non-beer volumes grew 
strongly by 22.6%, mainly due to 
growth of energy drinks across the

region. total volumes were up 
organically by 6.2%. 
 
revenue grew organically by 1.0%. 
revenue/hl of -5% was impacted by 
the higher level of promotional 
activities in russia to regain some of 
the market share lost in recent years. 
 
the region delivered strong organic 
operating profit growth of 10.9%, 
driven by strong performance in all 
markets outside russia. the 
operating margin increased by 
220bp to 19.2%. we achieved 
significant cost savings across the 
region. combined with a favourable 
development in costs of goods sold, 
we were able to more than offset the 
impact of the high level of 
promotional investments in russia. 
 
russia 
the russian beer market grew 
slightly in 2020 despite covid-19, 
due to a relatively small on-trade 
channel and supported by very 
favourable weather during the 
summer.  
 
the competitive environment 
remained challenging. t the end of 
q1, we kicked off our changed 
commercial priorities with the aim of 
turning around the volume trajectory 
and restoring our market share.  
 
for the year, volumes grew by 9%. 
revenue/hl declined by high-single-
digit percentages due to the higher 
level of promotions and a negative 
channel and packaging mix. 
 
ukraine 
in ukraine, our volumes declined 
slightly, largely in line with the 
market. revenue/hl developed 
negatively, mainly due to channel 
and brand mix, and a higher level of 
promotions. our local mainstream 
brands, 1664 blanc and alcohol-free 
brews did well, while carlsberg and 
tuborg were impacted by the 
restrictions imposed on the on-trade. 
 
other markets 
the other markets in the region – 
kazakhstan, belarus and azerbaijan 
– delivered double-digit revenue 
growth driven by solid volume 
growth and improved revenue/hl due 
to price increases and growth of craft 
& speciality and alcohol-free brews.

sail’22 has clear priorities for 
how we intend to deliver 
shareholder value: by growing 
operating profit organically, 
improving return on invested 
capital and ensuring optimal 
capital allocation.  
our capital allocation principles are 
well defined: 
1. 
investing in our business to drive 
long-term sustainable growth. 
2. 
targeting nibd/ebitda of 
below 2.0x. 
3. 
targeting an adjusted payout 
ratio of around 50% (adjusted 
for special items after tax). 
4. 
distributing excess cash to 
shareholders through share 
buy-backs and/or extraordinary 
dividends. 
5. 
deviating from the above if 
value-enhancing acquisition 
opportunities arise. 
 
delivering on capital 
allocation principles 
despite the headwind posed by 
covid-19, we delivered on these 
priorities again in 2020.  
driving long-term growth 
responding to the impact of covid-
19 on revenue, significant changes 
were implemented to safeguard the 
financial health of our company, both 
in terms of protecting the year’s 
results and cash, and ensuring that 
we will be able to capture long-term 
growth opportunities.  
 
consequently, we continued to 
support and invest in our brands and 
activities. examples include the launch 
of tuborg line extensions in china 
(see page 23) and the launch of a 
new global communication platform 
for 1664 blanc (see page 14). 
 
leverage 
due to our efforts to protect operating 
profit and cash in 2020, net interest-
bearing debt to ebitda at the end of 
the year was 1.51. 
 
this leverage was achieved even 
though we carried out share buy-
backs, in total amounting to dkk 
2.9bn, and completed several m&a 
transactions during the year.  
 
dividend payout 
in march, we paid out a dividend of 
dkk 21 per share, equal to a 17% 
increase on the previous year. in total, 
the dividend amounted to dkk 3.1bn, 
corresponding to an adjusted payout 
ratio of approximately 50%, in line 
with our dividend policy. 
 
as a result of the continued low 
financial leverage, at the annual 
general meeting in march the 
supervisory board will propose an 
increase in dividend of 5% to dkk 22 
per share. this corresponds to an 
adjusted payout ratio of 50%. 
 
share buy-back in 2020 
from february to august, the  
group carried out a share buy-back 
programme amounting to dkk 
2.5bn, following the announcement 
on 4 february 2020 outlining the 
intention to buy back shares worth 
dkk 5bn over a 12-month period. 
the buy-back programme was to be 
split into two tranches of around six 
months each. 
 
under the first tranche, the group 
bought 2,897,021 shares at an 
average repurchase price of dkk 863 
per share, in total dkk 2.5bn.  
 
due to m&a activities and the 
continued uncertainty related to 
covid-19, the second dkk 2.5bn 
tranche of the buy-back was not 
initiated. 
 
combined with the share buy-back 
in january 2020 related to the 2019 
share buy-back programme, 
3,290,522 b shares were repurchased 
in fiscal 2020 at a total purchase 
price of dkk 2.9bn.  
 
at the annual general meeting on 
15 march 2021, the supervisory 
board will recommend that 
2,900,000 treasury shares not used 
for hedging of incentive programmes 
be cancelled.  
 
share buy-back in 2021 
due to the continued business 
uncertainty related to the covid-19 
pandemic, especially at the beginning 
of 2021, the group intends to 
execute the 2021 share buy-back 
programme quarter by quarter. 
consequently, from 5 february until 
23 april, the group intends to buy 
back carlsberg b shares amounting 
to dkk 750m. on 28 april, in 
connection with the q1 trading 
statement, we will provide 
information on the next quarterly 
share buy-back in 2021. 
 
more information regarding the share 
buy-back can be found in the 2020 
financial statement announcement of 
5 february 2021. 
 
value-enhancing m&a 
in addition to the share buy-back, we 
also engaged in m&a transactions 
during the year, amounting to dkk 
3.2bn in total.  
 
in june, we acquired the rights to  
the brooklyn brand in our markets.  
in october, we completed the 
acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities in the uk (see section 5.2  
in the consolidated financial 
statements), and in germany we 
acquired wernesgrüner brewery.  
in china, we merged our chinese 
businesses, see page 22.

in most markets, the covid-
19 pandemic continues to 
impact business performance, 
which means a challenging 
start to 2021.  
the uncertainty related to the extent 
and length of the pandemic, further 
government actions, consumer 
reactions and macroeconomic 
developments remains high and may 
have significant implications for 
business performance. as a result, 
2021 guidance is: 
 
• organic growth in operating profit 
within the range of 3% to 10%.  
 
the earnings outlook is based on the 
following assumptions related to 
covid-19: 
 
• in western europe, the on-trade 
channel will likely be impacted by 
restrictions well into q2, with a 
gradual recovery of the on-trade 
during the quarter. we are 
assuming that most restrictions will 
be lifted before the summer 
season.  
• in asia, the impact of covid-19 
varies by market. the chinese 
market is assumed to be back to its 
normal trajectory, though with 
some local disruptions, including 
during the chinese new year 
celebrations. in other markets, such 
as india and nepal, the situation 
remains very difficult and highly 
volatile, though in most markets 
we are assuming a slow recovery 
during h1, driven by a gradual 
lifting of restrictions.  
• in central & eastern europe , the 
markets in the southern part of the 
region, which have relatively higher 
on-trade exposure, will likely 
continue to be impacted by 
restrictions well into q2, though we 
are assuming that most restrictions 
will be lifted before the summer 
season. in russia, the on-trade 
channel is relatively small. 
however, consumer sentiment is 
increasingly being impacted by the 
consequences of the pandemic, and 
the competitive environment 
remains fierce.  
 
based on the spot rates at 4 
february, we assume a translation 
impact of around dkk -200m for 
2021. 
 
other relevant assumptions are: 
• financial expenses, excluding 
currency losses or gains, are 
expected to be around dkk 600m. 
• the reported effective tax rate is 
expected to be around 25%. 
• capital expenditure at constant 
currencies is expected to be dkk 
4.0-4.5bn.

while covid-19 had a 
significant impact on our 
business in 2020, our sail’22 
strategy proved resilient 
during the pandemic. 
we introduced our seven-year 
strategy – sail’22 – in 2016.  
 
the key elements of sail’22 are 
shown below.  
the strategic priorities are further 
outlined in the 2016 annual report, 
available online at 
www.carlsberggroup.com. 
 
strategy remains 
covid-19 was a stress-test for 
sail’22 and our strategic priorities, 
which proved resilient during a very 
challenging year. notwithstanding 
the fact that we are now five years 
into the sail’22 period, we continue 
to see many opportunities within the 
framework, and we fully expect to 
keep our strategy for all seven years.  
 
sharpening focus 
each year, specific opportunities and 
plans evolve. in addition, covid-19 
made new emphases appropriate.  
while staying in line with our 
strategic priorities, we will further 
sharpen our focus on key brand, 
category and channel priorities, 
aspire to even better in-market 
execution, maintain even tighter 
control of costs, and develop even 
more flexibility in our ability to plan 
and amend plans.  
 
this will require us to continuously 
evolve the way we best achieve our 
winning, team-based performance 
culture. 
 
on the following pages, we provide 
further detail on the role and impact 
of our strategic priorities in 2020. 
 
our strategy 
sharpened 
strategic focus 
 
strengthen   
the core
the importance of strong 
market positions, local power 
brands, execution capabilities 
and, in particular, our ability to 
control costs became evident 
in 2020.
changes in consumer 
behaviour…
across our markets, covid-19 drove 
changes in consumer behaviour, with 
increased demand in the off-trade 
for more mainstream brands and 
multipack offerings at the early 
stages of the pandemic, changing 
towards a pick-up of demand for 
more premium offerings later on. 
in addition, online shopping saw 
significant growth rates.
… emphasised the importance 
of our core business
our focus on strengthening our 
core business was amplified by the 
pandemic, as seen by the strength 
of our local power brands, our 
improved digital capabilities and, 
in particular, our well-embedded 
funding the journey culture with 
its relentless focus on costs and 
efficiency.
our local power brands are an important part of 
our business. these brands have long histories 
and deep roots in their local markets. aside 
from seeing increased interest from consumers 
looking for more authenticity, we premiumise 
the local power brands by launching “crafty” 
line extensions and alcohol-free variants. while 
results in 2020 were impacted by covid-19, 
the resilience of these brands was evidenced by 
growth brands such as frydenlund (norway), 
astra (germany), pirinsko (bulgaria), dali and 
wusu (china), baltika and zatecky gus (russia) 
and derbes (kazakhstan). 
leveraging local 
power brands
2020 was a strong year for our  
russian business in terms of volumes 
and market share. in response to high 
competition pressure in the market, we 
took significant promotional actions to 
protect our volumes and improve our 
market share. at the same time, we 
pursued the sail’22 growth priorities 
of craft & speciality and alcohol-free 
brews and stepped up our commercial 
capabilities, resulting in volume growth 
of 9%.

leverage our strongholds
our funding the journey culture, with its focus 
on costs and cash, played a key role in 2020. as 
part of this, we have in recent years successfully 
implemented our operating cost management 
(ocm) toolkit across the group, improving our 
cost planning, increasing transparency and 
enabling detailed follow-up on operating costs. 
we began taking actions to offset the negative 
top-line impact of covid-19 when the virus hit 
china very early in 2020. when the disease turned 
into a pandemic, we intensified our cost reduction 
actions, successfully leveraging our ocm toolkit, 
which played a key role in reducing the negative 
impact on earnings. see pages 13 and 15.

covid-19 drove a rapid acceleration of 
e-commerce and digital platforms. albeit still from 
a low base, third-party e-commerce sales were up 
by around 60%, mainly driven by asia. carl’s shop 
– our b2b e-commerce platform – also showed 
very good results. the ability to use advanced 
analytics to tailor the most relevant experience for 
each on-trade customer helped to grow value per 
order and strengthen customer loyalty.

although growth was

continued to support the 
growth priorities of sail’22.
resilient performance for 
our growth categories… 
on-trade is an important channel 
for the craft & speciality (c&s) 
category. despite the severe impact 
of government restrictions, our c&s 
portfolio grew by 1%. our alcohol-
free brews (afb) grew by 11%, with 
continued growth in western and 
eastern europe, while the category 
remained small in asia. afb 
benefited from increasing consumer 
awareness of health and wellbeing, 
further amplified by covid-19. 
… while many markets in 
asia were under pressure
all markets in asia were impacted 
by covid-19, albeit at different 
speeds and magnitudes. following 
a difficult q1, we saw strong 
performance in china, and we 
remain confident that the region 
will rebound once the pandemic has 
been contained.
the roll-out of draughtmaster across western 
europe continued and was almost completed 
in the nordics, while trials were initiated in 
asia. in 2020, we improved the equipment 
with a digital layer, delivering unique real-
time consumption data. while volumes 
were impacted by covid-19 restrictions, 
these actually served to further highlight 
the customer advantages of draughtmaster, 
with less beer expiring thanks to the 31-day 
keg life and faster re-opening thanks to the 
self-cleaning system. draughtmaster outlets 
also benefited from a better mix of c&s 
compared with outlets with traditional steel 
keg installations.
draughtmaster  
driving  
premiumisation
our alcohol-free brews are wide-ranging, 
including lagers, ipas and wheat beers. 
we are targeting new as well as already 
penetrated consumer occasions, leveraging 
our core beer and c&s brands to drive 
growth for our alcohol-free volumes. 
poland is a good example of this strategy, 
with somersby, zatecky and okocim 
alcohol-free variants all driving local afb 
volume growth of 42% in 2020.

our cooperation with brooklyn dates  
back to 2004, when we began importing 
the brand to denmark. since then, we have 
developed a close cooperation with this great 
new york craft brewer. in 2020, we further 
strengthened the collaboration when we 
acquired the rights to the brooklyn brand in 
our markets. the deal will reduce complexity 
and increase profitability, supporting future 
growth of the brand.

culture. it describes our approach 
and performance in relation to our 
most material social, environmental 
and ethical issues, including progress 
against the four ambitions of our 
sustainability programme, together 
towards zero. the report also 
elaborates on how we live by our 
compass and conduct our business 
responsibly, and how we support 
and develop our team-based 
performance culture.
the sustainability report carries 
an assurance statement by pwc 
on selected indicators. it serves 
as our annual communication on 
progress to the united nations 
global compact and is, as such, 
our disclosure in accordance with 
section 99a of the danish financial 
statements act.
our business depends on a long-term, 
sustainable supply of crops, mainly barley 
and rice. we invest in next-generation 
crops through the work of scientists at 
the carlsberg research laboratory. their 
ground-breaking efforts include developing 
high-yielding barley varieties with 
additional sustainable process benefits, 
accounting for significant co2 savings 
when fully implemented. 
novel climate-tolerant varieties are also 
being developed that offer improved heat 
tolerance, salinity tolerance and drought 
resistance. several promising genetic 
variants are currently being evaluated 
in drought trials in australia and russia, 
where we are seeing more than 10% higher  
yield levels with limited water supply.  
a specific focus has also been obtaining 
barley varieties targeting the very fertile 
soils in russia, resulting in malting barley 
varieties with extract levels 1-2 percentage 
points higher than those of standard  
elite varieties.

the flexibility, agility and ability of our 
people to quickly adjust to the new reality 
that affected all areas of our business is a 
testimony to the embedding of our team-
based, performance-driven culture across 
all our markets and functions. during the 
year, our focus was on the physical safety 
and mental wellbeing of colleagues, and we 
conducted local pulse surveys to check on 
employee wellbeing and enable local leaders 
to respond to covid-19 challenges and  
better support their teams.

team-based performance
everyone must be treated with respect in 
our workplace and we have a zero tolerance 
approach to bullying, abuse, threats or any form 
of harassment, whether it be physical, verbal, 
sexual or psychological. our code of ethics & 
conduct protects this value and clearly states 
the consequences if anyone breaks the rules. 
we support and encourage anyone who may 
have experienced harassment to talk to their 
manager, their manager’s manager or their local 
hr team – or to report it via our confidential 
speak up line – so we can take action.

zero carbon footprint
our ambitious carbon targets, approved by the science-based 
targets initiative, are in line with the latest climate science to limit 
global warming to 1.5°c. in 2020, we reduced relative brewery carbon 
emissions by 12%. since 2015, our relative brewery carbon emissions 
are down by 39% while our full relative value chain (beer-in-hand) 
emissions have been reduced by 7%.
zero water waste
water is an essential ingredient in our products, and other key 
ingredients like grains and hops need it to grow. at 2.8 hl/hl in 2020, 
we have made a 18% improvement in water efficiency from our 2015 
baseline. we assessed water risk across 81 of our breweries using 
wwf's leading water risk filter tool and also used its scenario 
analysis tool to understand our global water risk in a changing climate.
zero irresponsible drinking
our targets include 100% distribution of alcohol-free brews to expand 
consumer choice and 100% of our markets to improve on responsible 
drinking year on year. all our beers and ciders carry messages or icons 
advising consumers not to drink-drive and not to drink when underage 
or pregnant. in 2020, ingredients were listed on 99% of our packaging 
globally, while nutritional information was provided on 67%.
zero accidents culture
the health and safety of our people always come first, and we 
believe all accidents are preventable. we manage key risks through 
our health and safety management systems, stringent standards, 
training and compliance with our life saving rules. in 2020, the  
lost-time accident rate declined to 3.0 from 3.7 in 2019. however,  
we deeply regret the death of a contract worker in russia.

we consider any form of bribery to be 
dishonest, morally wrong and unacceptable. 
our anti-bribery and corruption policy and 
manuals spell out our zero-tolerance approach 
and guide employees on what constitutes a 
bribe and how to deal with specific situations. 
in 2020, we introduced new online training on 
anti-bribery and corruption for people in roles 
such as sales, procurement and finance. over 
19,100 employees completed the course, which 
includes real-life examples, experiences and 
dilemmas.

our dedicated team at the dazhulin brewery in 
china has made it its mission to dramatically 
reduce water waste. applying best practices 
from across the group, it reduced the amount 
of water used to produce a hectolitre of beer 
by 18% – from 2.7 to 2.2 hl/hl – in just four 
months. this brings the brewery close to 
achieving our 2022 target to explore going 
below 2.0 hl/hl at sites with high water risk. 
saving water also means saving energy, and 
combined with a move to 100% renewable 
electricity, the efficiencies almost halved the 
brewery’s carbon emissions.

2020: -7% 
 
gross brand contribution from core beer 
core beer accounts for 82% of own beer revenue and is key to our 24 
no. 1 or 2 market positions. ensuring continued relevance of our local 
power brands, including premiumisation, is an important part of the core 
beer priority of sail’22. we measure our success by our ability to grow 
gross brand contribution from core beer. impacted by covid-19, growth 
in recent years was not repeated in 2020, declining by 7%. 
 
 
 
 
2018: +26% 
2019: +16%

win in craft & speciality 
craft & speciality is an attractive category across our regions, driven by 
global consumer trends of premiumisation, authenticity and heritage. 
positively contributing to price/mix and margins, our ambition is to 
grow the category. the strength of our brands became clear in 2020, 
when our craft & speciality portfolio volumes grew by 1% despite the 
negative impact on the important on-trade channel from covid-19.

win in alcohol-free brews 
alcohol-free brews continued to grow in western and eastern europe, 
further supported in 2020 by increased consumer health awareness due to 
covid-19. our attractive portfolio of alcohol-free brews leverages the 
well-established market position of our local power brands. in 2020, 
total volume growth of our alcohol-free brews was 11%, with growth of 
16% in western europe and 14% in eastern europe.

in 2020, asia accounted for 31% of group volumes and 36% of operating 
profit. growing in asia, and particularly china, is a priority of sail’22. 
china recovered impressively from covid-19, as did laos, while 
markets such as india, nepal and malaysia suffered throughout the 
year. we saw strong growth for 1664 blanc, while tuborg was 
impacted by the severe market decline in india. operating profit grew

organic growth in operating profit 
we aim to deliver organic growth in operating profit by 
delivering top-line growth and margin improvement. in 2020, 
covid-19-related lockdowns and restrictions prevented us 
from continuing the organic growth trajectory of recent years. 
our relentless focus on costs and early intervention enabled us 
to partly offset the top-line decline, containing the organic 
operating profit decline to 3.1%.

roic improvement 
we aim to continuously improve return on invested capital 
(roic) by improving earnings and reducing invested capital. in 
2020, roic improved by 10bp to 8.9%, mainly driven by the 
lower effective tax rate and supported by lower capital 
employed. the latter was positively impacted by trade working 
capital, a lower capex/depreciation ratio and currencies. 
excluding goodwill, roic increased by 80bp to 23.2%.

optimal capital allocation 
our capital allocation targets include nibd/ebitda of below 
2.0x and an adjusted dividend payout ratio of around 50%. at 
the end of 2020, nibd/ebitda was 1.51x. in 2020, the 
dividend per share was dkk 21. for 2020, the proposed 
dividend per share is dkk 22, equal to an adjusted payout ratio 
of 50%. in addition, in 2020 we carried out share buy-backs 
amounting to dkk 2.9bn in total. total cash return to 
shareholders in fiscal 2020 was dkk 6.0bn. read more about

climate change is already 
affecting our operations and 
markets. across our regions, 
we see its impact through land 
degradation, spells of hot, dry 
weather, and intense rainfall. 
we are working to understand the 
related risks and opportunities, and to 
mitigate impact on our business.  
 
our annual sustainability report 
details our approach and performance 
against the ambitious targets of 
together towards zero, and our 
actions to live up to the ambitious 
targets of the paris agreement on 
climate change to limit the increase 
in global average temperature to a 
maximum of 1.5°c.  
 
in 2020, we broadened the scope of 
our climate-related reporting by 
embracing the recommendations of 
the task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures (tcfd). in the

every three years, and most recently in 2020, we carried out a materiality assessment to identify the most 
important sustainability management topics, risks and impacts. in 2020, climate change was among the 
highest-ranking issues for us to address. 
working with wwf, we used the water risk filter scenarios to understand how water risks across our 
breweries may evolve by 2030 and 2050 and identify priority sites for investments and community 
partnerships. 
we also updated our assessment of our beer-in-hand value chain footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions) to measure our progress from the 2015 baseline and identify where to focus our efforts.

in conducting our business and 
executing our strategy, we 
seek to manage risks in such a 
way as to minimise their 
threats while making the best 
use of their opportunities. 
our business is subject to a number 
of risks and uncertainties that could 
have both short-term and long-term 
implications for the group.  
 
the purpose of our risk management 
approach is to address these risks 
and uncertainties in due time. 
 
governance structure 
the supervisory board is ultimately 
responsible for risk management, 
and it has appointed the audit 
committee to act on its behalf in 
monitoring the effectiveness of the 
group’s risk management.  
 
while recurring risks are evaluated 
on a quarterly basis, monitoring is 
mainly performed in connection with 
the half-year reviews.  
 
the audit committee has adopted 
guidelines for key areas of risk, 
monitors developments and ensures 
that plans are in place for managing 
individual risks, including strategic, 
operational, financial and compliance 
risks.  
 
the executive committee (excom) 
is responsible for reviewing the 
overall risk exposure associated with 
the group’s activities.  
 
short-term risk assessment 
risks are assessed according to a 
two-dimensional heat map that 
estimates the impact of the risk on 
operating profit or brand/image and 
the likelihood of the risk 
materialising.  
 
based on this assessment, excom 
identifies the high-risk issues for the 
coming year. excom assigns risk 
owners, who are responsible for 
mitigating the risks through a 
programme of risk management 
activities.  
 
local and functional risk assessment 
follows the same principles and 
methodology as group-level risk 
assessment.  
 
risk reporting is incorporated in 
regular business reviews, and group 
risk management is responsible for 
the framework and group finance 
for facilitating and following up on 
risk action plans for the most 
significant risks in connection with 
regular business reviews. 
 
mid- and long-term risk 
assessment 
a review of mid- and long-term 
risks is conducted annually at group 
level.  
 
based on input from various central 
functions, including finance, legal, 
sustainability, human resources and 
investor relations, and regional 
teams, the group strategy team 
identifies risks within the areas of 
commercial & competition, 
governance, consumer, 
macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, reputation, supply 
chain and climate.  
for climate-related risks, in 2020 we 
initiated the process of tcfd 
reporting, see page 36. 
 
based on this risk identification, 
excom will evaluate and assess the 
group’s risk exposure, applying our 
two-dimensional heat map 
methodology, and determine 
appropriate actions.

description 
covid-19 continues to affect our 
people and our business. while 
government interventions vary by 
geography, lockdowns and other 
restrictive measures affect off-take 
in both the on-trade and off-trade 
channels. further, supply chains may 
be impacted by raw material 
shortages and the ability to brew 
and distribute our products. 
depending on geography and go-
to-market models, our markets may 
therefore be impacted in terms of 
volume, mix, margin and cash flow 
performance.  
 
despite the distribution of vaccines, 
we therefore anticipate a prolonged 
impact in 2021 from covid-19.  
 
mitigation 
our first priority will remain the 
health and safety of our employees. 
 
in 2021, our operating plan is based 
on our sail’22 priorities. in addition, 
we will continue to apply the 
learnings and ways of working from 
2020. these include more frequent 
planning cycles, utilising our sales 
and operation planning (s&op) 
practices to enable fast adaptation 
and response to changing market 
demand and supply-chain 
circumstances. 
 
further, we will continue our 
scenario planning for the mid term, 
pre-empting multiple possible 
outcomes in terms of business 
impact. 
 
based on the scenario planning, we 
will continue to protect our operating 
profit and cash position, leveraging 
funding the journey, including our 
operating cost management (ocm) 
toolkit. read more about our cost 
mitigation actions in 2020 on pages 
13 and 15. 
 
our actions and activities will 
continue to be tailored to local 
markets to ensure an appropriate 
response to country-specific 
challenges and situations.

in continuation of the covid-19 risk, 
the pandemic has led to increased 
macroeconomic uncertainty. 
 
although the consequences for our 
business may be more longer-term, 
we must prepare now for this greater 
uncertainty. 
 
mitigation 
due to the current market volatility, 
our planning is more short-term and 
highly flexible to allow appropriate 
actions within a short time horizon. 
 
when the pandemic is under control, 
we will again become more longer 
term and reinstate our more 
thorough three-year planning cycle 
with its quarterly reviews and 
updates, while continuing to embed 
the positive learnings of covid-19 
and benefiting from the actions 
taken to reset our business and 
reduce costs (see pages 13-14).

disagreements with partners on the 
operational management and 
strategic direction of partnerships 
may limit our ability to manage the 
growth and risk profile of our

our partners’ potential pursuit of  
goals and priorities different from 
those of the group might result in 
disagreements, thereby affecting 
operational and financial 
performance.  
 
see section 5.1 in the consolidated

details of our partnerships and the 
related financial risks. 
 
mitigation 
the group continuously seeks to 
promote a fair and mutually 
beneficial development of the 
partnerships in order to ensure their 
continued success.  
 
we seek to have an ongoing 
dialogue with our partners to  
identify issues at an early  
stage. the relevant members of 
excom are actively involved in 
partner relationships, participating  
in the ongoing dialogues to ensure 
constructive negotiations and

policies may lead to fines, claims, 
and brand and reputation damage.  
 
in recent years, the group has 
experienced competition-law dawn 
raids in a few jurisdictions. non-
compliance with competition law is a 
real and growing risk, and the group 
is party to certain lawsuits and 
disputes. these and their significance 
are described in section 3.3 of the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
mitigation 
we continuously strengthen the 
group-wide control framework 
covering legal compliance areas, 
including, but not limited to, 
competition law, anti-bribery & 
corruption, trade sanctions and data 
protection.  
 
we regularly review and update 
relevant group legal and compliance 
policies, and conduct compulsory 
training of all relevant employees.  
 
we actively set a strong tone from 
the top and have developed toolkits 
to help managers in all markets to 
understand their role in shaping 
ethical behaviour every day.  
 
we have stepped up our training 
approach and updated our e-
learning modules in the areas of 
anti-bribery & corruption, 
competition law and data protection, 
the latter to reflect gdpr 
requirements. employees are 
required to complete these e-
learning modules on an ongoing 
basis in order to further create 
awareness of relevant risks and how 
to mitigate them.  
 
in 2021, we will review, simplify and 
rationalise the suite of compliance 
policies, manuals, guidance etc. to 
facilitate greater understanding and 
awareness by the wider business of 
the behaviour expected of all 
employees to reduce compliance 
risk. in addition, we will further 
enhance the compliance control 
framework.

description 
like all other businesses, the 
carlsberg group relies heavily on 
technology and it infrastructure  
for its day-to-day business. a cyber 
attack or non-availability of it 
systems could have severe financial, 
regulatory and reputational 
consequences for our business. 
 
mitigation 
our it security organisation has 
regular dialogue with the supervisory 
board and excom to agree on risk 
mitigation plans and activities.  
 
as the cyber security threat 
assessment has intensified in recent 
years, we have strengthened our 
protective work to counter the risk. 
 
to further progress our protection 
against cyber security threats, a 
chief information security officer 
was appointed to lead an 
independent cyber security function 
within our it organisation.  
 
furthermore, we are developing and 
deploying a wide array of advanced 
defensive technologies, as well as 
continuing to embed our risk 
management framework at all layers 
of the organisation.  
 
we undertake regular testing of our 
security controls via an ongoing 
series of technological audits and 
breach simulations. 
 
tax 
 
risk movement

description 
given the group’s international 
presence and business set-up, its 
activities involve a high level of 
cross-border and inter-company 
transactions as well as different legal 
structures within and across markets. 
 
the increasing focus on corporate 
tax payments may increase the risk 
of tax audits, which could lead to 
reassessments of taxable income. 
 
in addition, changes in the legal and 
regulatory environment, as well as 
internal structures, may increase the 
risk of non-compliance with local 
and global tax laws and regulations. 
 
mitigation 
the group generates substantial 
revenues for governments through 
payment of corporate income tax, 
withholding taxes and indirect taxes 
such as excise duties. we pay  
taxes as required by law, and the 
foundation for handling our tax 
affairs is our tax policy, which 
stipulates good corporate citizenship 
and tax transparency. 
 
in 2020, we updated our tax policy 
to align with best practice and ensure 
common understanding across the 
group. the tax policy is approved by 
the supervisory board, while the 
executive committee exercises 
oversight of the tax affairs in the 
group. 
 
we are continuously strengthening 
our tax control framework and 
improving reporting transparency. 
this includes documentation of 
inter-company transactions to 
ensure compliance with tax 
legislation and improving data 
quality for vat and product 
classification for excise duties.

our governance framework 
aims to ensure value creation, 
safeguard active and 
transparent stewardship across 
the group and reduce risk. 
the basis of our corporate 
governance includes in particular the 
danish companies act, the danish 
financial statements act, ifrs, the 
eu market abuse regulation, 
nasdaq copenhagen a/s’ rules for 
issuers of shares, local legislation, 
the company’s articles of 
association and the rules of 
procedure for the supervisory board. 
 
the group has policies for a number 
of key areas, including, but not 
limited to, anti-bribery & corruption, 
labour & human rights, diversity & 
inclusion, competition law, trade 
sanctions, data protection, risk 
management, finance, marketing,  
 
corporate communication, 
responsible drinking and public & 
government affairs.  
 
the supervisory board is responsible 
for overseeing that the executive 
committee has an adequate system

compliance with these policies. 
 
recommendations on 
corporate governance  
the recommendations of the danish 
committee on corporate governance 
form part of nasdaq copenhagen 
a/s’ rules for issuers of shares. the 
company complies with all but three 
of the recommendations, as 
explained below. 
 
with respect to the recommendation 
to publish quarterly reports, the 
group publishes full- and half-year 
reports. the supervisory board finds 
that half-year financial reporting is 
more appropriate due to the 
seasonality of the group’s business 
and the fact that the group 
historically has seen high volatility in 
quarterly earnings and margins as a 
result of phasing of certain 
commercial activities, etc.  
 
the supervisory board considers the 
high volatility to be potentially 
misleading for understanding 
underlying group performance. the 
company issues q1 and q3 trading 
statements, which include volume 
and revenue data, along with 
comments on sales performance in 
the quarter.  
 
regarding the recommendation that 
a majority of the members of a 
board committee should be 
independent, in 2020 the audit 
committee and the remuneration 
committee complied with this, while 
two of the four nomination 
committee members were 
independent. 
 
with respect to the recommendation 
to include external assistance in the 
board evaluation at least every third 
year, the supervisory board 
evaluation in 2020 was not 
facilitated by an external advisor due 
to the challenges posed by the 
covid-19 pandemic.  
 
the company’s statutory report on 
corporate governance includes the 
full list of the recommendations, with 
comments on the group’s position on 
each recommendation. 
 
the annual general 
meeting  
the 2020 annual general meeting 
(agm) took place on 16 march. the 
minutes of the meeting are available 
on www.carlsberggroup.com. 
 
rules and deadlines applying to the 
agm and other general meetings 
are stipulated in the company’s 
articles of association, which are 
available on www.carlsberggroup.com 
along with other agm-related 
information. 
 
 
governance structure 
the supervisory board has 
established three board committees: 
the audit, nomination and 
remuneration committees. for the 
time being, the supervisory board 
considers these committees to be 
sufficient; however, each year the 
supervisory board considers whether 
the number and scope of the 
committees are appropriate. the 
board committees prepare and 
facilitate supervisory board 
decisions.  
 
the supervisory board hires and 
supervises the executive board, 
which consists of the ceo and the 
cfo, who are not members of the 
supervisory board.  
 
the group also has an executive 
committee (excom), which, in 
addition to the ceo and the cfo, 
consists of a wider group of 
executive vice presidents, portrayed 
on pages 49-50. while the executive 
board members are formally 
registered as executive directors of 
the company, excom collectively

company’s strategic plans. 
 
composition of the 
supervisory board  
the supervisory board currently has 
ten members elected by the general 
meeting and, in accordance with the 
danish companies act, five members 
elected by the employees. none of 
the members of the supervisory 
board are or have been involved in 
the executive management of the 
group. 
 
the members elected by the general 
meeting are elected individually and 
for a term of one year. re-election is 
possible.  
 
five of the ten members elected by 
the general meeting are independent 
and have an international business 
background in addition to 
competences related to fmcg, 
digital, finance, esg, supply chain, 
procurement and emerging markets.  
 
the other five members are affiliated 
to the carlsberg foundation, the 
company’s largest shareholder, and 
have an academic background. 
these members are bearers of the 
carlsberg group culture and the 
heritage and values stemming from 
founder j.c. jacobsen, and the 
supervisory board sees these 
members as patrons of the same.

the carlsberg 
foundation 
 
the carlsberg foundation is the 
company’s largest shareholder. 
according to its charter, the foundation 
must own shares equivalent to at least 
51% of the votes in carlsberg a/s. at 
31 december, the carlsberg foundation 
held 30% of the capital and 76% of the 
votes in carlsberg a/s. 
 
the foundation is a long-term, value-
oriented shareholder, supporting the 
group in creating sustainable value 
growth through the execution of 
sail’22 and adherence to the 
company’s capital allocation priorities. 
 
the foundation participates pro rata in 
the share buy-back programmes (see 
page 26), and in 2020 total cash 
returns received by the foundation 
amounted to dkk 1.8bn.  
 
the dividends from carlsberg a/s are 
given back to society by granting funds 
to foster and support academic research 
within natural sciences, humanities and 
social sciences, and funds for cultural 
and socially beneficial purposes. in 
2020, this included covid-19-related 
grants amounting to more than dkk 
100m. the foundation also grants 
funds to the carlsberg research 
laboratory.

the employee representatives are 
elected for a term of four years. 
they hold the same rights and 
obligations as the members elected 
by the general meeting. the current 
employee representatives were 
elected in 2018 and the next election 
will take place in 2022. 
 
the supervisory board believes that 
the composition of the board 
ensures an appropriate level of 
diversity and breadth in the 
members’ approach to their duties, 
thereby helping to ensure that 
decisions are well considered and 
that both short- and long-term 
perspectives are taken into account. 
 
each year, the supervisory board 
considers the skills that should be 
represented on the supervisory 
board on the basis of a 
recommendation from the 
nomination committee. these skills 
are described in the specification of 
competences, available on 
www.carlsberggroup.com.  
 
the nomination committee and the 
supervisory board take the 
description of the required skills into 
consideration when recommending 
new candidates for the supervisory 
board.  
 
information on the supervisory 
board members is available on 
pages 46-48. detailed cvs can be 
found on www.carlsberggroup.com. 
 
diversity 
the supervisory board believes that 
its members should be chosen for 
their competences and recognises 
the benefits of diversity in respect of 
experience, culture, international 
experience and gender.  
 
diversity is therefore of high priority 
for the supervisory board and it has 
laid down the following specific 
objectives in relation to international 
experience and gender: 
• with regard to international 
experience, the objective is that 
50% or more of the supervisory 
board members elected by the 
general meeting should have 
substantial international experience 
from managing large corporations 
or institutions.  
• the proportion of the under-
represented gender (currently 
women) on the supervisory board 
should reach at least 40% of the 
members elected by the general 
meeting no later than 2021. the 
gender target applies to the boards 
of all danish carlsberg group 
companies that are required to set 
such objectives. 
 
the supervisory board fulfils the 
objective regarding international 
experience.  
 
regarding the gender target, 
currently three supervisory board 
members elected by the general 
meeting are women, i.e. 30%. hence, 
the objective with regard to gender 
diversity on the supervisory board is 
currently not met. the supervisory 
board will continue to work towards 
increasing the number of women on 
the supervisory board. 
 
at carlsberg breweries a/s, the four 
supervisory board members elected 
by the general meeting are men, 
being the members of the chairship 
and of the executive board of 
carlsberg a/s. at carlsberg 
danmark a/s and carlsberg supply 
company danmark a/s, one of 
three supervisory board members is 
a woman.  
 
the 2020 sustainability report 
contains information on our work 
with diversity and inclusion in the 
carlsberg group. 
 
the work of the 
supervisory board  
the supervisory board monitors that 
the executive board observes the 
goals, strategies and business 
procedures established by the board. 
 
the chair and deputy chair of the 
supervisory board constitute the 
chairship. the specific duties of the 
chair – and, in his absence, the 
deputy chair – are set out in the 
rules of procedure. in 2020, the 
chairship and the executive board 
held nine meetings.  
 
the supervisory board of carlsberg 
a/s also held nine meetings, of 
which one focused solely on covid-
19 crisis management and strategic 
implications. 
 
the executive board always attends 
the supervisory board meetings and, 
in order to improve transparency, the 
members of excom are also invited 
and attend when it makes sense. 
this gives the supervisory board 
better insight into the business.  
 
in connection with most supervisory 
board meetings, the supervisory 
board and excom have “board 
update” sessions at which key people 
from the group present a market, a 
function or another relevant topic. in 
2020, these covered updates on 
carlsberg’s covid-19 plans, 
perspective and impact on employees 
and business, digital including 
draughtmaster, internal audit, 
research, it security, market share 
development across markets and 
brands, and our business in russia.  
 
due to covid-19, most supervisory 
board meetings in 2020 were 
conducted virtually as a necessary 
alternative to physical meetings.  
 
supervisory board 
evaluation process 
each year, the chair of the 
supervisory board heads a 
structured evaluation of the board’s 
work, accomplishments and 
composition. in addition, the 
supervisory board considers, based 
on input from the nomination 
committee as well as the board 
evaluation process, whether its 
members’ expertise should be 
updated or strengthened with respect 
to their duties and whether the 
board members – in light of their 
other management positions – have 
adequate time to fulfil their duties as 
carlsberg board members.  
 
the conclusions of the 2020 
evaluation were that all members 
allocate sufficient time for their 
board work and duties and that all 
members are well prepared for the 
meetings. 
 
during the evaluation process in 
2020, the supervisory board 
members generally expressed that 
they find the pre-read material and 
presentations of a high quality, that 
the topics and agendas cover 
relevant matters adequately, that 
meetings are well planned and the 
time and discussions well prioritised, 
and that they appreciate the open 
discussions at the supervisory board 
meetings with the executive board 
and other management members.  
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   governance 
43 
 
 
the supervisory board also agreed 
that the cooperation with the 
executive board, in line with previous 
years, worked well and expressed 
satisfaction with management’s fast 
and resolute covid-19 management, 
including crisis and action plans, and 
the way the group steered through 
the turbulence and high degree of 
volatility and uncertainty posed by 
the pandemic. 
 
covid-19 required some adjustments 
to the supervisory board’s ways of 
working. the digital nature of 
meetings to some extent hampered 
the fruitful discussions that usually 
take place during meetings. 
nevertheless, the supervisory board 
is of the opinion that the virtual 
meetings were an acceptable 
alternative to physical meetings and 
that the quality of discussions and 
decision-making were not 
compromised.  
 
with respect to the three board 
committees, the supervisory board 
found them to be adequate and 
working well.  
 
the evaluation process led to a  
short catalogue of ideas for the 
supervisory board work. together 
with management, the ideas will be 
considered and, where relevant, 
implemented. 
 
board committees 
 
the nomination committee  
in 2020, the nomination committee 
consisted of four members. the 
nomination committee is appointed 
for one year at a time. two 
committee members qualify as being 
independent, while the other two 
members do not. 
 
the nomination committee works 
according to terms of reference, 
which are reviewed and approved 
annually by the supervisory board.

the remuneration committee  
the work of the remuneration 
committee is described in the 
remuneration report. 
 
the audit committee  
in 2020, the audit committee 
consisted of four members, all 
qualifying as being independent of 
the company. the audit committee 
is appointed for one year at a time. 
the committee has the relevant 
financial expertise and necessary 
experience of the company’s sector. 
 
the audit committee works according 
to terms of reference and a detailed 
annual meeting plan, which are 
reviewed and approved by the 
supervisory board prior to the 
beginning of each financial year.  
 
the supervisory board approved the 
audit committee meeting plan for 
2021 and the current terms of 
reference at the supervisory board 
meeting in december 2020. the 
terms of reference are available on 
the company’s website.  
 
in 2020, the audit committee had 
particular focus on a number of 
areas, including:  
• monitoring the effectiveness of the 
control environment and overseeing 
the progress on improving and 
further developing the effectiveness 
of the controls over financial 
reporting. 
• monitoring the external financial 
reporting and the work of the 
external auditors. 
• reviewing the progress of the work 
of the group internal audit 
function. 
• reviewing the work regarding 
speak up matters (see page 45). 
• managing financial risk. 
• reviewing the risk management 
process. 
• reviewing the new tax policy. 
 
auditing 
to safeguard the interests of 
shareholders and the general public, 
an independent auditor is appointed 
at the annual general meeting 
following a proposal from the 
supervisory board, which is based on 
a recommendation from the audit 
committee. 
  
internal control and risk 
management related to 
the financial reporting 
process 
 
overall control environment 
the supervisory board and excom 
have overall responsibility for the 
carlsberg group’s control 
environment.  
 
the audit committee is responsible 
for monitoring the effectiveness of 
the internal control and risk 
management systems related to the 
financial reporting process.  
 
the group has a number of policies 
and procedures in key areas of 
financial reporting, including the 
finance policy, the accounting 
manual, the controller manual, the 
use of auditors policy, the chart of 
authority, the risk management 
policy, the financial risk 
management policy, the corporate 
governance policy, the information 
security & acceptable use policy, 
the records management & 
personal data protection policy, the 
stock exchange compliance policy, 
the tax policy, and the code of 
ethics and conduct. 
the policies and procedures apply to 
all subsidiaries, and similar 
requirements are set out in 
collaboration with the partners in 
joint ventures. 
 
the group’s control framework for 
financial reporting is designed to 
reduce and mitigate financial risks 
identified and ensure reliable internal 
and external financial reporting. it 
defines who is responsible and 
provides assurance that key risks are 
covered by mitigating internal 
control assertions.  
 
as a consequence of the group’s 
growth due to acquisitions, systems 
and processes are not standardised 
across entities. the current state of 
the control environment has 
improved in 2020 and is at an 
acceptable level, but not yet where 
the group wants it to be.  
 
the group will continue to 
strengthen the control environment 
through further standardisation, 
increased automation, strong 
analytics and transparent 
governance.  
 
the framework is monitored through 
entities’ self-assessment of the 
effectiveness of the implemented 
controls and continuous testing of 
performance by an established 
central internal control team. the 
monitoring of the performance of the 
controls focuses on the quality of the 
controls, the effectiveness with which 
they are performed and the efficiency 
of the overall controlling processes.

risk assessment 
with the implementation of the 
control framework for financial 
reporting, the group has identified 
the risks that could have a direct or 
indirect material impact on the 
financial statements. group entities 
are required to document transaction 
processes and the controls in place 
to cover the key risks identified. the 
minimum requirements for 
documenting the risks must be set 
out in the framework and visualised 
in the processes. 
 
group entities are required to 
reassess their controls biannually 
and must update changes to the 
control framework for financial 
reporting, including new risks and 
controls. 
 
control activities 
the group has implemented a 
formalised financial reporting process 
for the strategy process, budget 
process, estimates and monthly 
reporting on actual performance. the 
accounting information reported by 
all group companies is reviewed by 
controllers with regional or functional 
in-depth knowledge of the individual 
companies/functions and by technical 
accounting specialists. 
 
controllers are continuously updated 
on best practice relating to internal 
financial controls, and trained in new 
accounting and reporting 
requirements.  
 
the entities in the group are 
dependent on it systems. any 
weaknesses in the system controls  
or it environment are compensated 
for by manual controls in order to 
mitigate any significant risk relating 
to the financial reporting.  
 
during 2019, a programme was 
initiated for most entities in western 
europe aimed at standardising 
financial reporting processes and 
implementing various tools. the 
programme was carried out as 
planned in 2020 and will continue in 
2021. 
 
the group has established a quality 
assurance team in order to ensure 
the quality of the controls that are 
part of the outsourced processes, 
including their performance. 
 
information and 
communication 
the group has established 
information and communication 
systems to ensure accounting and 
internal control compliance. during 
the risk assessment process, group 
entities are required to report on 
missing or inadequate controls.  
each entity assesses any need for 
compensating controls, or for design 
and implementation of new controls. 
 
furthermore, group entities have 
mapped controls on segregation of 
duties to implement necessary 
compensating controls, and are now 
implementing stronger remediated 
controls for segregation of duties in 
the erp systems. 
 
monitoring 
the audit committee’s monitoring 
covers both the internal control 
environment and business risk. 
monitoring of the internal control 
environment is covered by the 
group’s control framework for 
financial reporting.  
 
the financial risks are assessed and 
reviewed at multiple levels in the 
group, including monthly 
performance review meetings at 
excom level, periodic review of 
control documentation, and audits 
performed by group internal audit. 
 
group internal audit 
group internal audit provides 
objective and independent 
assessment of the adequacy, 
effectiveness and quality of the 
group’s internal controls. group 
internal audit works in accordance 
with a charter, which is reviewed on 
an annual basis and approved by the 
audit committee.  
 
taking into account the annual 
review of business risks (see pages 
37-39), an internal audit plan is 
drawn up for the year. the plan is 
reviewed and approved by the audit 
committee. in 2020, group internal 
audit conducted audits mainly in the 
areas of financial reporting controls, 
compliance (internal and external 
regulation), information technology 
and third-party risk management. 
 
speak up 
the carlsberg group has a speak up 
system that enables employees to 
report misconduct. reports typically 
relate to suspected violations of the 
carlsberg code of ethics and 
conduct.  
 
the speak up system is operated by 
an external provider and allows 
concerns to be brought to the 
attention of the group speak up 
review team anonymously, 
confidentially and via multiple 
channels. 
 
the speak up review team is 
responsible for reviewing all reported 
speak up matters. furthermore, an 
integrity committee, chaired by the 
cfo, oversees the follow-up of 
major speak up investigations and 
provides a report to excom and the 
audit committee at least quarterly. 
 
the speak up summary report also 
contains an overview of other open 
and closed investigations and the 
time taken to resolve cases. 
 
the misconduct investigation 
handbook was updated in 2020 to 
clarify how investigations should be 
undertaken. during 2019, there was 
also a campaign to raise awareness 
of the various speak up channels 
available. a new campaign will be 
launched in 2021. 
 
since the establishment of the speak 
up system, some reports and their 
subsequent investigation have led to 
disciplinary sanctions, including 
dismissal on the basis of violation of 
the code of ethics and conduct and/ 
or group policies.  
 
the incidents have not had any 
material impact on the financial 
results of the group except for those 
items recognised in the statement of 
financial position. 
 
more information regarding the 
speak up system, including reported 
concerns and disciplinary actions, 
can be found in the sustainability 
report.

52 
 
 
this annual report contains 
forward-looking statements, 
including statements about the 
group’s sales, revenues, earnings, 
spending, margins, cash flow, 
inventory, products, actions, plans, 
strategies, objectives and guidance 
with respect to the group's future 
operating results.  
 
forward-looking statements include, 
without limitation, any statement 
that may predict, forecast, indicate 
or imply future results, performance 
or achievements, and may contain 
the words “believe, anticipate, 
expect, estimate, intend, plan, 
project, will be, will continue, will 
result, could, may, might”, or any 
variations of such words or other 
words with similar meanings.  
 
any such statements are subject to 
risks and uncertainties that could 
cause the group’s actual results to 
differ materially from the results 
discussed in such forward-looking 
statements.  
 
prospective information is based on 
management’s then current 
expectations or forecasts. such 
information is subject to the risk that 
such expectations or forecasts, or the 
assumptions underlying such 
expectations or forecasts, may 
change. 
 
the group assumes no obligation to 
update any such forward-looking 
statements to reflect actual results, 
changes in assumptions or changes in 
other factors affecting such forward-
looking statements.  
 
some important risk factors that 
could cause the group’s actual results 
to differ materially from those 
expressed in its forward-looking 
statements include, but are not 
limited to: economic and political 
uncertainty (including interest rates 
and exchange rates), financial and 
regulatory developments, demand 
for the group’s products, increasing 
industry consolidation, competition 
from other breweries, the availability 
and pricing of raw materials and 
packaging materials, cost of energy, 
production- and distribution-related 
issues, information technology 
failures, breach or unexpected 
termination of contracts, market-
driven price reductions, market 
acceptance of new products, changes 
in consumer preferences, launches of 
rival products, stipulation of fair 
value in the opening balance sheet of 
acquired entities, litigation, 
environmental issues and other 
unforeseen factors.  
 
new risk factors can arise, and it 
may not be possible for management 
to predict all such risk factors, nor to 
assess the impact of all such risk 
factors on the group’s business or 
the extent to which any individual 
risk factor, or combination of factors, 
may cause results to differ materially 
from those contained in any forward-
looking statement.  
 
accordingly, forward-looking 
statements should not be relied on 
as a prediction of actual results.

58.5bn 
revenue (dkk) 
revenue declined by 11.2%, amounting to  
dkk 58,541m (2019: dkk 65,902m). revenue 
was negatively impacted by covid-19 in most 
markets and by negative currency 
developments, mainly in russia, norway and 
china. 
 
 
48.4% 
gross margin 
cost of sales per hl improved organically by 
3%, positively impacted by country and product 
mix. 
 
the gross margin declined by 110bp to 48.4%, 
as supply chain efficiencies were not enough to 
offset the under-absorption of fixed costs and 
the channel and product mix. the gross margin 
was also impacted by country mix.  
 
9.7bn 
operating profit (dkk) 
operating expenses, including marketing 
investments, declined organically by 14% as a 
result of tight cost control. the main areas in 
which costs fell were marketing, travel, supply 
chain and administration, including employee-
related costs. reported operating expenses as 
a percentage of revenue declined by 200bp. 
excluding marketing expenses, operating 
expenses declined organically by 13%.  
 
operating profit before depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment losses (ebitda) 
declined by 2.4% organically and by 6.1% in 
reported terms. the ebitda margin improved 
by 130bp to 24.1%. 
 
the asian and eastern european regions 
delivered solid organic operating profit growth 
and strong operating margin improvements, 
while operating profit declined in western 
europe.  
 
operating profit before special items was  
dkk 9,699m (2019: dkk 10,465m). the 
group’s operating margin increased by 70bp  
to 16.6%.  
 
 
6.0bn 
net profit (dkk) 
special items, net, amounted to dkk -247m 
(2019: dkk 501m). special items were 
positively impacted by reversal of a provision 
made in a purchase price allocation, offset 
mainly by restructuring costs related to reset 
for the future, and write-down of a brand in 
cambodia. 
 
financial items, net, amounted to dkk -411m 
against dkk -738m in 2019. excluding 
currency gains and losses, financial expenses, 
net, amounted to dkk 550m (2019: dkk 
650m), positively impacted by lower other 
financial expenses. 
 
tax totalled dkk -2,233m against dkk  
-2,751m in 2019. the effective tax rate of 
24.7% was positively impacted by tax-exempt 
and non-deductible special items. excluding 
these, the effective tax rate would have been 
25.7%. 
 
consolidated profit was dkk 6,808m 
compared to dkk 7,477m in 2019. the decline 
was due to lower operating profit and special

expenses, net, and the lower tax rate. 
 
the carlsberg group’s share of consolidated 
profit was dkk 6,030m (2019: dkk 6,569m). 
 
non-controlling interests were dkk 778m 
(2019: dkk 908m), impacted by challenging 
market conditions in malaysia, and the new 
joint venture with marston's in the uk, of 
which the group owns 60%.

operating cash flow (dkk) 
cash flow from operating activities amounted 
to dkk 10,928m against dkk 12,239m in 
2019.  
 
the change in trade working capital was dkk 
+1,321m (2019: dkk +491m), mainly due to 
lower trade receivables, impacted by lower 
sales as a result of the increased covid-19-
related restrictions towards the end of the year. 
average trade working capital to revenue 
improved from -16.8% in 2019 to -18.6%.  
 
the change in other working capital was dkk  
-1,033m (2019: dkk +634m), partly impacted 
by phasing and lower vat payable.   
 
restructuring costs paid amounted to dkk  
-531m (2019: dkk -445m). net interest etc. 
paid amounted to dkk -424m (2019: dkk  
-894m). the decline was mainly due to the 
settlement of financial instruments. 
 
corporation tax paid was dkk -1,958m (2019: 
dkk -2,234m). the decrease versus last year 
was mainly due to lower earnings.  
 
5.1bn 
free cash flow (dkk) 
free cash flow amounted to dkk 5,057m 
(2019: dkk 9,962m), while free operating cash 
flow amounted to dkk 7,093m (2019: dkk

operational investments totalled dkk -3,835m 
(2019: dkk -2,824m), impacted by the 
purchase of the brooklyn brand rights. in 2019, 
operational investments were impacted by the 
disposal of the brewery site in norway.  
 
total financial investments amounted to dkk  
-2,036m (2019: dkk +551m), impacted by 
the acquisition of marston’s brewing activities, 
the prepayment of the purchase price for 
wernesgrüner brewery, germany, and lower 
dividends received. 
 
total cash flow to investments in entities and 
brand rights, including acquisition of non-
controlling interests, amounted to dkk 3.2bn 
(2019: dkk 1.7bn). for 2020, this primarily 
included the acquisitions of marston’s brewing 
activities in the uk, and the acquisition of 
wernesgrüner brewery and the brooklyn brand 
rights.  
 
 
3.2bn 
acquisitions (dkk) 
the cash flow for the purchase of the brooklyn 
brand rights was included in operational 
investments.  
 
the cash consideration paid on acquisition of 
60% of marston’s brewing activities in the uk 
and the prepayment on the acquisition of 
wernesgrüner brewery amounted to dkk 
2.4bn and was recognised as financial 
investments in the cash flow statement. 
 
the prepayment on the acquisition of 
wernesgrüner brewery was recognised as a 
non-current receivable. the transaction was 
completed on 1 january 2021.  
 
total cash flow to investments in brand rights 
and entities thereby amounted to dkk 3.2bn.

section 1.1  
segmentation of 
operations 
revenue  
the group’s revenue arises primarily from the 
sale of beverages to our customers. revenue 
from brand licensing, sale of by-products and 
other revenue in aggregate accounts for around 
3% of the group’s revenue and is not considered 
material. revenue declined by dkk -7,361m in 
2020 and was negatively impacted by the 
lower volumes in western europe and asia and 
deterioration in price/mix in western europe 
and eastern europe, along with a negative 
currency impact in all three regions.  
 
not allocated revenue, dkk 25m (2019: dkk 
72m), consisted of dkk 1,112m (2019: dkk 
1,355m) in revenue and dkk -1,087m (2019: 
dkk -1,283m) from eliminations of sales 
between the geographical segments. 
 
revenue in denmark was impacted by lower 
sales of soft drinks at the german/danish 
border. 
 
the dkk value of revenue in russia for 2020 
was impacted by the 11.4% decrease in the 
average rub/dkk rate. 
 
changes to segmentation 
the group’s regional structure was changed 
effective 1 january 2021, with the aim of 
rebalancing the european regions in terms of 
size and number of business units.  
 
the segmentation used in the annual report 
2020 is unchanged. please refer to section 9.5

segmentation of 
operations 
operating profit before  
special items 
not allocated operating profit before special 
items, dkk -1,183m (2019: dkk -1,476m), 
related to central costs not managed by the 
regions, including costs of developing branding 
activities to support the sail’22 initiatives and 
general costs of centralised functions as well  
as various eliminations of dkk 62m (2019: 
dkk 71m). 
 
volumes 
organic growth in total volumes was impacted 
by declining volumes in western europe and 
asia primarily due to covid-19, partly offset 
by growth in eastern europe.  
 
non-controlling interests 
the group’s non-controlling interests consist of 
lao brewery, chongqing brewery group, 
carlsberg malaysia group and other minor 
interests, primarily in the asia region. also 
included are two months of earnings in the 
newly established carlsberg marston's brewing 
company limited. non-controlling interests 
are not individually material to the group’s 
total profit. 
 
non-controlling interests hold 40% of the 
shares in carlsberg marston's brewing 
company limited, which includes marston’s 
brewing activities and the group’s activities in 
the uk.  
 
the material asset restructuring whereby 
carlsberg and chongqing brewery co. 
contributed their controlled assets to 
chongqing jianiang brewery was completed in 
december 2020. the transaction had an 
immaterial impact on the allocation of the 
consolidated profit for the year between the 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s and non-
controlling interests for 2020.  
 
with the full-year effect of these transactions, 
non-controlling interests’ share of the result in 
carlsberg marston's brewing company 
limited, uk, and chongqing brewery group, 
china, is expected to increase for 2021. the 
transactions are described in more detail in 
sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
the group considers all terms and activities in 
contracts with customers in order to determine the 
performance obligation, the transaction price and the 
allocation of the transaction price.  
 
if the consideration in a contract includes a variable 
amount, the group estimates the consideration to 
which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring 
goods to the customer. the variable consideration is 
estimated at contract inception based on expected 
sales volumes using historical and year-to-date sales 
data and other information about trading with the 
individual customer or with a group of customers.  
 
the group estimates discounts using either the 
expected value method or the most likely amount 
method, depending on which method better predicts 
the amount of consideration to which it will be 
entitled.  
 
the most likely amount method is used for contracts 
with a single contract sum, while the expected value 
method is used for contracts with more than one 
threshold due to the complexity and the activities 
agreed with the individual customer.  
 
certain contracts related to specific major events that 
are held within such a short time period that it is not 
possible to sell all the goods during the event (e.g. 
football matches) give the customer the right to 
return the goods within a specified period.  
 
the group uses the expected value method to 
estimate the goods that will not be returned, as this 
method best predicts the amount of variable 
consideration to which the group will be entitled. for 
goods that are expected to be returned, the group 
recognises a refund liability instead of revenue. 
 
management makes judgements when deciding 
whether supporting activities with a customer should 
be classified as a discount or a marketing expense. 
generally, activities with the individual customer are 
accounted for as a discount, whereas costs related to 
broader marketing activities are classified as 
marketing expenses. 
 
whether the group is acting as a principal or an agent 
is evaluated by management on a country-by-
country basis. the group has concluded that it is the 
principal in its revenue arrangements because it 
controls the goods before transferring them to the 
customer.  
 
excise duties, taxes and fees 
the classification of duties, taxes and fees paid to 
local authorities or brewery organisations etc. 
requires judgements on the classification to be made 
by management. 
 
locally imposed duties, taxes and fees are typically 
based on product type, alcohol content, consumption 
of certain raw materials, such as glue, plastic or 
metal in caps, and energy consumption. these are 
classified as either sales- or production-related. 
 
excise duties are generally imposed by the tax 
authorities as taxes on consumption and are collected 
by the group on behalf of the authorities when the 
goods are transferred to the customers and thereby 
ready for consumption.  
 
taxes and fees related to the input/use of goods in 
production, distribution etc. are recognised as part of 
the cost of the goods or services purchased. the type 
of authority or organisation imposing the duty, tax or 
fee and the objective of these are key factors when 
determining the classification.

section 1.1 (continued) 
segmentation of

accounting 
policies 
revenue 
recognition and measurement 
revenue from contracts with customers comprises 
sales of goods, royalty income, rental income from 
non-stationary equipment, service fees and sales of 
by-products. 
 
revenue from the sale of own-produced finished 
goods, goods for resale (third-party products) and 
by-products is recognised at the point in time when 
the control of goods and products is transferred to 
the customer, which is generally upon delivery. for 
contracts providing the customer with a right of return 
within a specified period, the group considers the 
timing of recognition.  
 
royalty and licence fees are recognised when earned 
according to the terms of the licence agreements. 
 
revenue from contracts with customers is measured 
at an amount that reflects the expected consideration 
for those goods. amounts disclosed as revenue 
exclude discounts, vat and excise duties collected on 
behalf of authorities.  
 
the group considers whether contracts include 
separate performance obligations to which a portion 
of the transaction price needs to be allocated. in 
determining the transaction price, the group considers 
the effects of variable consideration. no element of 
financing is deemed present, as payment is generally 
made on the basis of cash on delivery or up to 30 
days of credit. 
 
variable consideration 
the group offers various discounts depending on the 
nature of the customer and business.  
 
discounts comprise off-invoice discounts, volume- and 
activity-related discounts, including specific promotion 
prices offered, and other discounts. furthermore, 
discounts include the difference between the present 
value and the nominal amount of on-trade loans to 
customers, cf. section 1.5.  
 
off-invoice discounts arise from sales transactions 
where the customer immediately receives a reduction 
in the sales price. this also includes cash discounts 
and incentives for early payments. 
 
volume- and activity-related discounts is a broad 
term covering incentives for customers to sustain 
business with the group over a longer time and may 
be related to a current campaign or a sales target 
measured in volumes or total value. examples include 
discounts paid as a lump sum, discounts for meeting 
certain sales targets or progressive discounts offered 
in step with increasing sales to a customer. 
 
other discounts include listing fees, i.e. fees for 
certain listings on shelves, in coolers or in favourable 
store locations, as specific promotions of this nature 
are closely related to the volumes sold. 
segment information 
the group’s beverage activities are segmented 
according to the three geographical regions where 
sales take place. these regions make up the group’s 
reportable segments.  
 
the segmentation reflects the geographical and 
strategic management, decision and reporting 
structure applied by the executive committee for 
monitoring the group’s strategic and financial targets. 
segments are managed based on business 
performance measured as operating profit before 
special items. 
 
not allocated comprises income and expenses 
incurred for ongoing support of the group’s overall 
operations and strategic development. the expenses 
include costs of running central functions and 
marketing, including global sponsorships.   
 
the non-beverage segment, comprising research and 
real estate activities, is managed separately and 
therefore shown separately instead of geographically 
segmented. 
 
the geographical allocation of revenue and non-
current assets is based on the selling entities’ domicile 
and comprises countries individually accounting for 
more than 10% of the group’s consolidated revenue 
as well as the domicile country.  
 
decisions on restructuring, acquisition and divestment 
of entities included in special items as well as on 
financing (financial income and expenses) and tax 
planning (income tax) are made based on information 
for the group as a whole and therefore not 
segmented. 
reported figures 
reported figures are analysed by looking at the 
impact of organic growth, net acquisitions and foreign 
exchange effects.  
 
the net acquisition effect is calculated as the effect of 
acquisitions and divestments, including any share 
obtained from an increase/decrease in ownership of 
associates and joint ventures, for a 12-month period 
from the acquisition/divestment date.  
 
the foreign exchange effect is calculated as the 
difference between the figures for the current 
reporting period translated at the current exchange 
rates and at the exchange rates applied in the 
previous reporting period.  
 
organic growth is the remaining growth that is not 
related to acquisitions, divestments or foreign 
exchange effects.

commodity risks are associated in particular 
with purchasing of cans (aluminium), malt 
(barley), glass, paper, sugar and energy. the 
management of commodity risks is coordinated 
centrally and aimed at achieving stable and 
predictable prices in the medium term, and 
avoiding capital and liquidity being tied up 
unnecessarily. 
 
as the underlying markets for the specified 
categories vary, so does the way in which they 
are hedged against price increases.  
 
the most common form of hedging is fixed-
price purchase agreements with suppliers in 
local currencies.  
 
it is group policy to fix the prices of 70% of 
malt (barley) purchases for a given year no 
later than at the end of the third quarter of the 
previous year and to hedge up to around 90% 
at the beginning of the year. a significant part 
of the group’s exposure for 2020 was therefore 
hedged through fixed-price purchase 
agreements entered into during 2019. likewise, 
the majority of the exposure for 2021 has been 
hedged during 2020. the percentage that is 
hedged or at fixed prices is higher for western 
europe and eastern europe than for asia, 
which is partly due to the timing of the harvest 
season in asia. 
 
in the majority of purchase agreements for 
cans, the group’s purchase price is variable and 
based on the global market price of aluminium 
(london metal exchange, lme). the group  
is thereby able to hedge the underlying 
aluminium price risk by applying a hedge ratio  
of 1:1. 
 
in 2020, the majority of the aluminium price 
risk was hedged with financial instruments or 
with fixed prices via the suppliers to the group. 
the same has been done for 2021. the fair 
values of the financial instruments are specified 
in section 4.8. 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
at least once a year, management assesses whether 
the standard cost of inventories approximates the 
actual cost. during the year, the standard cost is 
revised if it deviates by more than 5% from the actual 
cost. indirect production overheads are calculated on 
the basis of relevant assumptions as to capacity 
utilisation, production time and other factors. 
 
management also assesses the impact on standard 
cost of government and other grants received to fund 
operating activities. this includes assessing the terms 
and conditions of grants received and the risk of any 
repayment. 
 
the calculation of the net realisable value of 
inventories is relevant to packaging materials, point-
of-sale materials and spare parts. the net realisable 
value is normally not calculated for beer and soft 
drinks due to their limited shelf-life, which means 
that slow-moving goods must be scrapped instead.  
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
cost of sales comprises cost of materials used in 
own-produced finished goods, including malt 
(barley), hops, glass, cans, other packaging materials, 
direct labour, indirect production overheads and 
standard cost variations. further, it comprises 
purchased finished goods that include cost of point-
of-sale materials and third-party products sold to 
customers. 
 
indirect production overheads comprise indirect 
supplies, wages and salaries, amortisation of brands 
and software, as well as maintenance and 
depreciation of machinery, plant and equipment used 
for production. 
 
the cost of purchased finished goods, raw and 
packaging materials and point-of-sale materials 
includes the purchase cost and costs directly related 
to bringing inventories to the relevant place of sale 
and getting them ready for sale, for example 
insurance, freight and duties.

section 1.2 (continued) 
operating 
expenses, 
inventories and 
deposit liabilities 
inventories are measured at the lower of standard 
cost (own-produced finished goods) and weighted 
average cost (other inventories), or net realisable 
value. the net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price less costs of completion and costs necessary to 
make the sale, also taking into account marketability, 
obsolescence and developments in expected selling 
price. 
 
the cost of scrapped/impaired goods is expensed in 
the function (line item) responsible for the loss, i.e. 
losses during distribution are included in distribution  
expenses, while scrapping of products due to sales 
not meeting forecasts is included in sales expenses. 
 
 
1.2.2 deposits on returnable 
packaging materials 
deposits on returnable packaging materials 
amounted to dkk 1,276m (2019: dkk 
1,545m). the capitalised value of returnable 
packaging materials was dkk 1,791m (2019: 
dkk 2,102m). the decline in deposits is a 
consequence of the lower volumes sold, which 
led to a lower need for reinvestment and 
thereby a lower capitalised value of returnable 
packaging materials. 
 
the capitalised value of returnable packaging 
materials exceeds the deposits because each of 
the returnable packaging items circulates a 
number of times in the market and some 
markets have regulations that require the 
deposit value to be set lower than the cost of 
the returnable packaging materials.  
 
 
accounting estimates  
and judgements 
management assesses the local business model to 
determine whether the group has a legal or 
constructive obligation to accept returns of packaging 
materials from the market and the level of control. this 
entails the group considering, among other things, the 
return rate and the annual circulation in the individual 
markets. these factors are assessed annually. 
returnable packaging materials controlled by the 
group are capitalised as property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated over the expected useful life.  
 
the deposit on returnable packaging materials is 
estimated based on movements during the year in 
recognised liabilities, loss of returnable packaging 
materials in the market, planned changes in 
packaging types and historical information about 
return rates. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
returnable packaging materials that the group 
controls through a legal or constructive obligation are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment. 
 
returnable packaging materials are depreciated over 
3-10 years. the accounting policies for property, plant 
and equipment are further described in section 2.3. 
 
the obligation to refund deposits on returnable 
packaging materials is measured on the basis of 
deposit price, an estimate of the number of bottles, 
kegs, cans and crates in circulation, and expected 
return rates. 
 
 
1.2.3 sales and distribution 
expenses  
total sales and distribution expenses decreased 
by 14% in reported terms and by 11% organically, 
as a result of tight cost control in response to the 
covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions.

marketing expenses consist of expenses for brand 
marketing and trade marketing. 
 
brand marketing is an investment in the group’s 
brands and consists of brand-specific investments in 
the development of communication vehicles, the use 
of these to drive the sale of branded products, sales 
campaigns and sponsorships. 
 
trade marketing is promotional activities directed 
towards customers, such as the supply of point-of-
sale materials, promotional materials and trade 
offers. 
 
sales expenses comprise costs relating to general 
sales activities, write-downs for bad debt losses, 
wages and salaries as well as depreciation and 
impairment of sales equipment. distribution expenses 
comprise costs incurred in distributing goods, wages 
and salaries, and depreciation and impairment of 
distribution equipment. 
 
 
1.2.4 other operating

other operating activities are secondary to the 
principal activities of the group and include 
income and expenses relating to rental 
properties, restaurants, on-trade loans, 
research activities, and gains and losses on 
disposal of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment. on-trade loans, net, are 
impacted by impairment of outstanding loans

foreign exchange 
risk related to 
earnings 
the majority of the group’s activities take place 
outside denmark and in currencies other than 
dkk. foreign exchange risk is therefore a 
principal financial risk for the group, and 
exchange rate fluctuations can have a 
significant impact on the income statement.  
 
transaction risks on purchases  
and sales 
the group is exposed to transaction risks on 
purchases and sales in currencies other than 
the local functional currencies. the group aims 
to hedge 70-90% of future cash flows in 
currencies other than the local functional 
currency on a four-quarter rolling basis.  
 
the eur/dkk exposure is considered to be 
limited and is not hedged. 
 
western europe  
for the entities in western europe, a major 
part of the purchases in foreign currencies is in 
eur. this also applies for markets with a 
functional currency other than eur.  
 
hedging of eur against the local currencies 
will effectively eliminate a significant part of 
the currency risk in the entities’ operating profit 
in local currency. at group level, these hedges 
are effectively a hedge of (parts of) the revenue 
in the relevant currency and are accounted 
for as cash flow hedges, cf. section 4.8. the 
hedged amounts and the sensitivity analysis 
regarding these hedges are shown in  
section 4.6.4. 
 
asia 
the transaction risk is considered to be less 
significant due to lower sales and purchases in 
currencies other than the local functional 
currencies as well as the high correlation 
between usd and most of the asian currencies. 
furthermore, the currencies are expensive to 
hedge and, in some cases, not possible to 
hedge at all. as a consequence, the risk is not 
hedged. 
 
eastern europe 
baltika breweries and the other entities in 
eastern europe have expenses in both usd and 
eur, and appreciation of rub and other 
currencies vis-à-vis eur and usd has a 
positive impact on operating profit, while 
depreciation has a negative effect. the group 
has chosen not to systematically hedge the 
transaction risk due to the significant cost of 
hedging these currencies over a longer period 
of time. for 2020 and 2021, the group has 
chosen to hedge a portion of baltika breweries’ 
and carlsberg ukraine’s expenses in usd. the 
volatility of the eastern european currencies 
will continue to affect operating profit 
measured in both dkk and local currencies. 
furthermore, some of the entities in eastern 
europe hold intercompany deposits in eur and 
usd. the revaluation of these is recognised in 
financial items. 
 
translation risk 
the group is exposed to risk from translation 
of foreign entities into the group’s presentation 
currency, dkk.  
 
the single largest translation exposure in 
respect of operating profit in 2020 was rub 
due to the double-digit depreciation of the 
currency compared with 2019. looking into 
2021, the largest exposure in terms of ebit 
and currency volatility is cny, while rub 
remains the single largest exposure on 
translation of net investments in foreign 
entities. 
 
the exposure to fluctuations in eur/dkk is 
considered to be limited due to denmark’s fixed 
exchange rate policy towards eur and is 
consequently not hedged.  
 
the group has chosen not to hedge the 
exposure arising from translation of revenue or 
earnings in foreign currencies. to reduce the 
risk, the group has raised debt denominated in 
the currencies in which the group generates 
significant earnings and cash flow. 
impact on operating profit 
developments in exchange rates between dkk 
and the functional currencies had a negative 
impact of 3.9% on operating profit measured in 
dkk.

cash flow from 
operating 
activities 
change in trade working capital amounted to 
dkk 1,321m (2019: dkk 491m), primarily due 
to a decline in trade receivables due to lower 
sales and increased impairments. this was 
partly offset by a decrease in deposit liabilities. 
 
other working capital decreased by  
dkk 1,033m (2019: increase of dkk 634m), 
mainly impacted by lower vat payable and 
changes in provisions.  
 
the change in on-trade loans amounted to 
dkk 339m (2019: dkk 50m). 
 
restructuring costs paid amounted to  
dkk -531m (2019: dkk -445m), a large  
part of which relates to termination benefits  
to employees made redundant due to 
optimisations and reorganisations across  
the group. 
 
net interest etc. paid amounted to dkk -424m 
(2019: dkk -894m). the decrease in net 
interest was mainly due to settlements of 
derivative financial instruments as well as lower 
interest income.  
income tax paid amounted to dkk -1,958m 
(2019: dkk -2,234m). the decrease in tax 
paid was the result of lower operating profit in 
some markets, mainly laos, greece, norway 
and russia. 
 
cash flow from disposal of property, plant  
and equipment and intangible assets was  
dkk 222m (2019: dkk 1,714m). in 2019, the 
cash flow included the proceeds from disposal 
of the former brewery sites in trondheim, 
norway, and hamburg, germany, totalling 
dkk 1,503m. 
 
average trade working capital improved from  
-16.8% to -18.6% of revenue, primarily due to

section 1.5 
trade receivables 
and on-trade 
loans 
the group’s non-current receivables consist 
mainly of on-trade loans that fall due more 
than one year from the reporting date. as at 
31 december 2020, it also includes the 
prepayment for the acquisition of 
wernesgrüner brewery, germany. of the total 
non-current receivables, dkk 258m (2019: 
dkk 207m) falls due more than five years 
from the reporting date. 
 
the carrying amount of receivables 
approximates their fair value. for on-trade 
loans, the fair value is calculated as discounted 
cash flows using the interest rate at the 
reporting date. 
 
on-trade loans 
under certain circumstances, the group grants 
loans to on-trade customers in france, the uk, 
switzerland, germany and sweden. on-trade 
loans are spread across a large number of 
customers/debtors and consist of several types 
of loan, including loans repaid in cash or 
through reduced discounts and guarantees for 
loans provided by third parties, cf. section 3.3. 
the operating entities monitor and control 
these loans in accordance with group 
guidelines.  
 
the average effective interest rate on loans to 
the on-trade was 3.2% (2019: 4.5%).

trade receivables

other receivables 
other receivables primarily comprise vat and 
similar government receivables, interest 
receivables and other financial receivables, 
which are associated with low risk. the credit 
risk related to other receivables remains almost 
unchanged compared with previous years, as 
they are less impacted by the covid-19 
pandemic.

1.5.1 credit risk 
in 2020, receivables not past due amounted  
to 74% (2019: 77%) of total gross receivables. 
the closure of on-trade businesses and other 
covid-19 restrictions are impacting our 
customers, increasing in particular the past-due 
share of gross loans to on-trade customers  
to 51% (2019: 29%). total impairment losses 
on trade loans were dkk 499m (2019:  
dkk 214m). 
 
the past-due share for trade receivables has 
increased from 21% to 23%.  
 
the credit risk is being closely managed in the 
markets and assessed in light of the changing 
restrictions, and the covid-19 impact on the 
global risk pattern is being evaluated at group 
level. 
 
throughout the year and continuing into 2021, 
our customers in most markets were impacted 
by lockdowns, full or partial closure of on-
trade businesses, restrictions on cultural and 
sports activities, social distancing and other 
government restrictions in response to the 
covid-19 pandemic.   
 
this makes our customers extremely vulnerable 
and dependent on ongoing government support 
in the form of subsidies and extended payment 
terms.  
 
the increased credit risk on both trade 
receivables and on-trade loans already seen 
across all markets in 2020 is expected to 
continue into 2021.  
 
the estimated impairment losses consider  
the expected impact both from the continuing 
restrictions and when government financial 
support schemes and extended payment terms 
come to an end when markets reopen. 
 
the distribution of receivables broken down by 
country is affected by market-specific changes 
in payment patterns. for receivables from sale 
of goods and services, the distribution is 
furthermore impacted by the amounts of 
receivables sold.  
 
the relative share of receivables in the uk has 
increased following the acquisition of marston’s 
brewing activities. the overall level of 
receivables sold is similar to 2019.

section 1.5 (continued) 
trade receivables 
and on-trade 
loans 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
on-trade loan agreements are complex, cover several 
aspects of the customer relationship and may vary 
from agreement to agreement. management 
assesses the recognition and classification of income 
and expenses for each agreement, including the 
allocation of payments from the customer between 
revenue, discounts, interest (other operating activities) 
and repayment of the loan. 
 
management also assesses both individually and on a 
portfolio basis whether developments in local 
conditions for on-trade customers could impact the 
expected credit losses. 
 
exposure to credit risk on receivables is managed 
locally, and credit limits are set as deemed 
appropriate for the customer, taking into account the 
current local market conditions. 
 
the local entities assess the credit risk and adhere to 
group guidelines, which include setting credit limits, 
encouraging cash payment, purchasing credit 
insurance and taking collateral. 
 
in assessing credit risk, management analyses the 
need for impairment of trade receivables and on-
trade loans due to customers’ inability to pay. many 
customers are currently dependent on government 
subsidies and support in the form of extended 
payment terms. the credit risk has thereby increased 
significantly during 2020 and is expected to continue 
to increase into 2021.  
 
at year-end 2020, management has therefore 
assessed the lifetime expected credit losses for both 
trade receivables and on-trade loans, while in 
previous years expected credit losses were applied to 
on-trade loans. 
 
expected credit losses are assessed for portfolios of 
receivables based on customer segments, historical 
information on payment patterns, terms of payment, 
concentration maturity, the impact of continuing 
covid-19 restrictions and the expected impact of 
government schemes coming to an end when 
markets reopen. the expected impact includes the 
risk of insolvencies due to lack of liquidity when the  
extended government payment terms cease. the 
portfolios are based on on-trade and off-trade 
customers, and on-trade receivables and loans.  
 
on-trade loans carry a higher risk than trade 
receivables and are concentrated on a few markets. 
the local entities manage and control these loans in 
accordance with group guidelines. 
 
the credit risk on on-trade loans can be reduced 
through collateral and pledges of on-trade movables 
(equipment in bars, cafés etc.). the fair value of the 
pledged on-trade movables cannot be estimated 
reliably but is assessed to be insignificant, as they 
cannot readily be used again. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less loss 
allowance or impairment losses. trade receivables 
comprise sale of goods and services as well as short-
term on-trade loans to customers. other receivables 
comprise vat receivables, loans to partners, 
associates and joint ventures, interest receivables and 
other financial receivables. 
 
regarding the on-trade loans, any difference 
between the present value and the nominal amount 
at inception is treated as a prepaid discount to the 
customer, and is recognised in the income statement 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 
 
the market interest rate is used as the discount rate, 
corresponding to the money market rate based on 
the maturity of the loan with the addition of a risk 
premium. the effective interest on these loans is 
recognised in other operating activities, net. the 
amortisation of the difference between the discount 
rate and the effective interest rate is included as a 
discount in revenue. 
 
the group applies the simplified approach to measure 
expected credit losses. this entails recognising a 
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade 
receivables. loss rates are determined based on 
grouping of trade receivables sharing the same credit 
risk characteristics and past due days.  
regarding on-trade loans and loans to associates, a 
loss allowance is recognised based on 12-month or 
lifetime expected credit losses, depending on whether 
a significant increase in credit risk has arisen since 
initial recognition.

118.8bn 
total assets (dkk) 
total assets decreased by dkk 4.2bn, mainly 
due to a decrease in intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, which was partly 
offset by an increase in cash and the acquisition 
of marston’s brewing activities. 
 
intangible assets amounted to dkk 66.1bn at 
31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 70.0bn), and 
were impacted by the depreciation of the 
russian rouble and the impairment of a brand in  
cambodia, and partly offset by the purchase of 
the brooklyn brand rights and goodwill from the 
marston’s acquisition.  
 
property, plant and equipment decreased by 
dkk 1.3bn to dkk 26.3bn (2019: dkk 
27.6bn), mainly impacted by depreciation and 
changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 
current assets increased by dkk 1.0bn to dkk 
19.0bn. the increase was mainly driven by an 
increase in cash of dkk 2.9bn and partly offset 
by lower receivables and inventories. 
 
3.6bn 
capex (dkk) 
capex, excluding the purchase of the brooklyn 
brand rights, declined by dkk 1.0bn due to lower 
investment in sales capex, fewer returnable glass 
bottles due to lower demand, less need for 
capacity expansions in draught lines, and general 
cancellation and postponement of projects that 
are not business critical at a time when the group 
is impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. capex 
to amortisation and depreciation, excluding right-
of-use assets, decreased to 90% (2019: 111%). 
including purchase of the brooklyn brand rights, 
the ratio amounts to 110%.  
 
8.9% 
roic  
return on invested capital (roic) increased by

section 2.1 
segmentation of 
assets and 
returns 
at year-end, invested capital was down by  
dkk 4.6bn, primarily due to the depreciation of 
the russian rouble. the decrease was partly 
offset by the acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities, which increased consolidated assets 
by dkk 3.3bn, and by the acquisition of the 
brooklyn brand rights.  
both acquisitions had a limited impact on 
average invested capital, as carlsberg 
marston’s brewing company has only been 
included for two months and the brooklyn 
brand rights for six months. 
 
the impact on total assets from fluctuations in 
the russian rouble was a decrease of dkk 
7.5bn (2019: increase of dkk 4.0bn). 
 
non-current assets comprise intangible assets

section 2.2 
impairment 
2.2.1 recognised impairments 
in 2020 and 2019, the impairment tests of 
goodwill and brands with indefinite useful life 
were prepared at the reporting date.   
 
impairment losses of dkk 200m relating to the 
angkor brand (cambodia), a minor local brand 
of dkk 31m, other intangible assets of dkk 
4m and dkk 124m (2019: dkk 124m) relating 
to property, plant and equipment have been 
recognised. the impairment loss on the angkor 
brand is due to a significant decline in volumes 
impacted by covid-19 restrictions in the 
market.  
 
in 2019, impairment losses primarily related to 
steel keg installations and filling lines in the 
nordic countries, which were impacted by the 
roll-out of the draughtmaster system.  
 
in 2020, the group recognised reversal of 
impairment losses of dkk 2m (2019: dkk 3m) 
in eastern europe relating to assets that have 
been brought back into production.  
 
impact of covid-19 
the covid-19 pandemic and the consequent 
impact on volumes, earnings and cash flows 
indicate possible impairment of non-current 
assets. 
 
the group has carefully assessed the expected 
recovery from the pandemic in terms of both 
volumes and earnings. since the beverage 
industry is resilient and volumes have to some 
extent shifted from on-trade to off-trade, it is 
expected that these will shift back to the on-
trade and earnings return to the level before 
the pandemic. the expected timing and speed 
of the recovery differ from market to market, 
depending on the extent of government 
restrictions as well as consumer behaviour.  
 
with the exception of the angkor brand, the 
assessment has not identified any indication of 
impairment of non-current assets as a result of 
the covid-19 pandemic.   
 
significant amounts of goodwill and brands 
goodwill and brands with indefinite useful life 
relating to the acquisitions of baltika 
breweries, kronenbourg, chongqing brewery 
group and the 40% non-controlling interest in 
carlsberg breweries a/s each accounted for 
10% or more of the total carrying amount of 
goodwill and brands with an indefinite useful 
life at the reporting date. 
 
goodwill from these acquisitions has been 
allocated to cgus based on the geographical 
segmentation.  
 
the international brands acquired with the 40% 
non-controlling interest in carlsberg breweries 
a/s and the baltika brand are individually 
material and specified in section 2.2.3. 
 
 
 
accounting estimates  
and judgements 
identification of cash-generating units 
the group’s management structure reflects the 
geographical segments, cf. section 1.1, and decisions 
are made by the regional managements responsible 
for performance, operating investments and growth 
initiatives in their respective regions.  
 
there is significant vertical integration of the 
production, logistics and sales functions, supporting 
and promoting optimisations across the group or 
within regions. 
 
assets, other than goodwill and brands with regional 
and global presence, are allocated to individual cash-
generating units (cgus), being the level at which the 
assets generate largely independent cash inflows. as 
the group operates with local sales and production 
organisations, the cash inflows are generated mostly 
locally, and the cgus are therefore usually identified 
at country level. 
 
within 12 months from the date of acquisition, the 
determination of cgu allocation is made, and cash 
inflows are assessed in connection with the purchase 
price allocation. 
 
goodwill  
goodwill does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows on its own and is therefore allocated to the 
group’s geographical segments, which is the level at 
which it is monitored for internal management 
purposes.  
 
at the time of acquisition of entities, goodwill is 
allocated to a cgu, cf. section 5.2. the structure and 
groups of cgus are reassessed every year. the group 
gained control of marston’s brewing activities in 2020 
and of the acrospires activities in 2019. the goodwill 
recognised on these acquisitions was allocated to the 
western europe cgu.  
 
brands 
cash flows for brands are separately identifiable and 
are therefore tested individually for impairment. this 
test is performed in addition to the test for 
impairment of goodwill.  
 
the following brands are considered significant when 
comparing their carrying amount with the total 
carrying amount of brands with indefinite useful life: 
• baltika brand 
• international brands 
 
international brands is a group of brands recognised 
in connection with the acquisition of the 40% non-
controlling interest in carlsberg breweries a/s and 
allocated to western europe. the amount is not 
allocated to individual brands.

section 2.2 (continued) 
impairment  
corporate assets 
the group has identified capitalised software relating 
to the group’s erp systems as corporate assets, and 
as such these are peripheral to the generation of cash 
inflow. the group’s erp landscape is closely linked to 
the internal management structure, and the identified 
assets are therefore tested for impairment at the cgu 
level to which goodwill is allocated. 
 
other non-current assets 
other non-current assets are tested for impairment 
when indications of impairment exist. 
 
for property, plant and equipment, management 
performs an annual assessment of the assets’ future 
application, for example in relation to changes in 
production structure, restructurings or brewery 
closures. in 2020, the assessment also included the 
impact of the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
for investments in associates and joint ventures, 
examples of indications of impairment are loss-
making activities or major changes in the business 
environment. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
goodwill and brands with indefinite useful life are 
subject to an annual impairment test, performed 
initially before the end of the year of acquisition. 
 
the test is performed at the level where cash flows 
are considered to be generated: either at cgu level or 
at the level of a group of cgus. all assets are tested 
if an event or circumstance indicates that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. if an asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised. the recoverable 
amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. 
 
for all assets, the value in use is assessed based on 
budget and target plan with reference to the expected 
future net cash flows. the assessment is based on the 
lowest cgu affected by the changes that indicate 
impairment. the cash flow is discounted by a 
discount rate adjusted for any risk specific to the 
asset, if relevant to the applied calculation method. 
 
impairment losses on goodwill and brands, significant 
losses on property, plant and equipment, associates 
and joint ventures, and losses arising on significant 
restructurings of processes and structural adjustments 
are recognised as special items. minor losses are 
recognised in the income statement in the relevant 
line item. 
 
impairment of goodwill is not reversed. impairment of 
other assets is reversed only to the extent of changes 
in the assumptions and estimates underlying the 
impairment calculation. impairment is only reversed 
to the extent that the asset’s new carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount of the asset 
after amortisation/depreciation had the asset not 
been impaired.

the average cash flow growth in the forecast 
period reflects the significant risk adjustments 
included in the forecast specifically for the 
impairment test. the risk adjustment considers 
only negative alternative scenarios to account 
for the particular uncertainty related to the 
continued impact on earnings and cash flow 
from the covid-19 pandemic, the time and 
speed of the recovery, and the volatile 
macroeconomic and competitive situation in 
eastern europe.  
 
potential upsides are not identified and 
adjusted in the cash flows used for impairment 
testing. growth is projected in nominal terms 
and therefore does not translate into cash flow 
at the same growth rate in the group’s 
presentation currency, dkk. 
 
western europe 
the region primarily comprises mature beer 
markets, and market volumes tend to be flat. 
in recent years, the region has seen improving 
beer category dynamics through innovations, 
increased interest in craft & speciality beers and 
alcohol-free brews, and an overall improved 
category perception. 
 
the region is generally characterised by well-
established retail structures and a strong 
tradition of beer consumption. consumption is 
generally resilient, but the on-trade tends to 
suffer in a weak macroeconomic environment. 
in 2020 however, the region suffered as a 
result of lockdowns across markets due to 
covid-19. these will continue into 2021 but 
are not expected to have a significant long-
term effect. 
 
in the short term, the focus will be on 
recovering and regaining ground after the 
covid-19 pandemic, and secondly on 
improving margins by driving a positive 
price/mix development and reducing the cost 
base across the value chain. this process is part 
of the sail’22 initiatives. 
 
asia 
the importance of asia for the group has 
increased significantly over the past decade, 
during which the group has strengthened its 
presence in the region, both organically and 
through acquisitions. 
 
the asian markets are very diverse but offer 
prospects for volume and value growth, 
underpinned by young populations, 
urbanisation, rising disposable income levels, 
growing economies and, in some markets, 
relatively low per capita beer consumption. 
however, as many asian markets are emerging 
markets, development is subject to volatility. 
 
both the on-trade and off-trade channels are 
generally characterised by a strong traditional 
outlet segment but with the modern outlet 
segment growing in most markets.

section 2.2 (continued) 
impairment  
in 2020, markets in the region were impacted 
by covid-19 at different times and to 
different extents, with some markets already 
seeing a strong rebound in the second half of 
the year. 
 
the focus in the region is on revenue growth. 
activities include the continued expansion of 
our international premium brands, in particular 
tuborg, 1664 blanc and carlsberg, and the 
strengthening and premiumisation of our local 
power brands in combination with a continued 
focus on costs and efficiencies. 
 
eastern europe 
the two main markets in the region are russia 
and ukraine, which account for 67% and 20% 
respectively of regional volumes.  
 
in recent years, the modern off-trade, 
consisting of hypermarkets and supermarkets, 
has grown significantly and now accounts for 
approximately 50% of the market in russia. 
another growing channel is the so-called beer 
boutiques, which is estimated to account for 
around 20% of the market. 
 
the region saw limited impact from covid-19 
due to the low on-trade exposure.  
 
the competitive environment has been 
challenging in recent years, particularly in 
russia, which has seen an increased focus on 
volume. to offset previous years’ volume 
declines caused by the focus on value in this 
market, the group chose to focus more on 
volume, which resulted in significant volume 
growth in 2020. we expect the focus on 
volume and the related margin pressure to 
continue in the coming year. 
 
management expects the current 
macroeconomic situation and developments to 
continue in the short term, with inflation 
stabilising at the current level. in the medium 
to long term, interest rates are expected to 
decline and stabilise at a level slightly lower 
than currently observed in the market, 
although still with some volatility.   
 
new segmentation for 2021 
as described in section 9.5, the group’s 
segmentation and regional split of entities 
changed as of 1 january 2021, and the 
allocation of cgus changed accordingly. this 
change will not have any impact on the 
conclusion of the impairment test of goodwill.  
 
 
 
accounting estimates  
and judgements 
goodwill 
the value in use is the discounted value of the 
expected future risk-adjusted cash flows. this 
involves developing multiple probability-weighted 
scenarios to reflect different outcomes in terms of 
timing and amount. 
 
key assumptions 
the cash flow is based on the budget and target 
plans for the next three years. cash flows beyond the 
three-year period are extrapolated using the terminal 
period growth rate. the budget and plans for 2021-
2023 take a cautious view of the extent and speed of 
the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic.  
 
the probability weighting applied is based on past 
experience and the uncertainty of the prepared 
budget and target plans.  
potential upsides and downsides identified during the 
budget process and in the daily business are reflected 
in the future cash flow scenarios for each cgu. 
 
the risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using a 
discount rate that reflects the risk-free interest rate 
for each cgu with the addition of a spread. the 
interest rates used in the impairment tests are based 
on observable market data. please refer to the 
description of discount rates in section 2.2.3. 
 
the key assumptions on which management bases its 
cash flow projections are: 
• volumes 
• sales prices 
• input costs 
• operating investments 
• terminal period growth 
 
 
the assumptions are determined at cgu level and are 
based on past experience, external sources of 
information and industry-relevant observations for 
each cgu. local conditions, such as expected 
developments in macroeconomic and market 
conditions specific to the individual cgus, are 
considered. the assumptions are challenged and 
verified by management at cgu and group level.  
 
the budget and target plan process take into account 
events or circumstances that are relevant to reliably 
project the short-term performance of each cgu. 
examples include significant campaign activities, 
changes in excise duties etc., which may have a 
short-term impact but are non-recurring. given their 
short-term nature, they are not taken into 
consideration when estimating the terminal period 
growth rate.  
 
impact of covid-19 
for 2020, the current and expected future impact of 
the covid-19 pandemic has been carefully 
considered. the beverage industry is generally 
resilient, and it is expected that volumes and earnings 
will recover to pre-pandemic levels within the next 
few years. the decline in earnings in 2020 is 
therefore not expected to continue in the long term.  
 
however, to avoid overlooking any long-term impact, 
additional risk adjustments have been made for the 
uncertainty regarding the recovery from the 
pandemic.  
 
likewise, any impact on the development in volumes, 
sales prices, input cost and operating investments has 
been considered. such impact primarily relates to the 
expected timing of a given development when this 
has been slowed down by the pandemic.  
 
volumes 
projections are based on past experience, external 
market data, planned commercial initiatives, such as 
marketing campaigns and sponsorships, and the 
expected impact on consumer demand and the level 
of premiumisation. if relevant, the projections are 
adjusted for the expected changes in the level of 
premiumisation. no changes in market share are 
assumed in the medium or long term. 
 
demographic expectations general to the industry, 
such as the development in population, consumption 
levels, generation-shift patterns, rate of urbanisation  
and of macroeconomic trends, are also considered in 
medium- and long-term projections. 
 
events and circumstances can impact the timing of 
volumes entering the market. this can be affected by  
excessive stocking related to an increase in excise 
duties, campaign activities, and the timing of national 
holidays and festivals. such short-term effects are 
not material to volume projections and do not impact 
the long-term projections. 
 
sales prices 
the level of market premiumisation and the locally 
available portfolio are key drivers in identifying price 
points. when planning pricing structures, factors 
including price elasticity, local competition and 
inflation expectations can also impact the projection.  
 
increases in excise duties are typically passed on to 
the customers immediately or with a delay of no 
more than a few months. since the increase is a 
pass-through cost and thereby compensated for by 
price increases at the time of implementation, it does 
not impact the long-term sales price growth and is 
therefore not taken into consideration in the 
projections unless circumstances specifically indicate  
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   consolidated financial statements 
75 
 
section 2.2 (continued) 
impairment  
otherwise. no changes to duties in the short or 
medium term are taken into consideration unless 
there is a firm plan to introduce changes.  
 
input costs 
input costs in the budget and target plans are based 
on past experience and on: 
• contracted raw and packaging materials 
• contracted services within sales, marketing,  
production and logistics  
• planned commercial investments 
• cost optimisations not related to restructurings 
• expected inflation  
 
in the long term, projections follow the level of 
inflation unless long-term contracts are in place. 
 
operating investments  
projections are based on past experience of the level 
of necessary maintenance of existing production 
capacity, including replacement of parts. this also  
includes planned production line overhauls and  
improvements to existing equipment. non-contracted 
capacity increases and new equipment are not  
included. 
 
terminal period growth 
growth rates are projected to be equal to or below 
the expected rate of general inflation and assume no 
nominal economic growth. the projected growth 
rates and the applied discount rates are compared to 
ensure a sensible correlation between the two.

in 2020, significant brands represented 55% 
(2019: 60%) of the total carrying amount of 
brands with indefinite useful life. the decrease 
in the carrying amount of the baltika brand 
compared with 2019 is due only to the 
depreciation of rub.  
 
other brands comprise a total of 19 brands 
(2019: 18 brands) that individually are not 
material compared with the total carrying 
amount. 
 
baltika breweries 
despite covid-19, the russian beer market 
grew slightly again in 2020, due to the 
relatively small on-trade sector and supported 
by very favourable weather during the summer. 
 
showing a positive trend in 2020, the baltika 
brand has performed broadly in line with the 
growth projections made when the expected 
future growth for the brand was reassessed 
when the brand was impaired in 2017. 
 
angkor brand 
the angkor brand was recognised in 
connection with the acquisition of cambrew 
brewery, cambodia, in 2018.  
 
following the acquisition, the volumes have not 
developed as expected due to failed attempt to 
relaunch the brand combined with the impact 
of covid-19.  
 
the long-term expectations therefore remain 
significantly below the expectations at the time 
of acquisition, which is why the brand has been 
impaired by dkk 200m to dkk 86m.  
 
 
 
accounting estimates  
and judgements 
brands 
the test for impairment of brands is performed using 
the relief from royalty method and is based on the 
expected future cash flows generated from the 
royalty payments avoided for the individual brand for 
the next 20 years and projections for subsequent 
years. 
 
the risk-free cash flows are discounted using a 
discount rate reflecting the risk-free interest rate with 
the addition of the risk premium associated with the 
individual brand.  
 
key assumptions  
the key assumptions on which management bases its 
cash flow projection include the expected useful life, 
revenue growth, a theoretical tax amortisation 
benefit, the royalty rate and the discount rate. 
 
expected useful life 
management has assessed that the value of brands 
with indefinite useful life can be maintained for an 
indefinite period, as these are well-established brands 
in their markets, some of which have existed for 
centuries. the beer industry is characterised as being 
very stable with consistent consumer demand and a 
predictable competitive environment, and is expected 
to be profitable for the foreseeable future. control of 
the brands is legally established and is enforceable 
indefinitely.  
 
in management’s opinion, the risk of the useful life of 
these brands becoming finite is minimal because of 
their individual market positions and because current 
and planned marketing initiatives are expected to 
sustain their useful life. 
 
revenue growth 
at the time of acquisition of any individual brand, a 
revenue growth curve is forecast based on a long-
term strategic view of the risk and opportunities 
relevant to the brand. the curve is forecast for a 20-
year horizon. this horizon reliably reflects the lengthy 
process of implementing brand strategies to support a 
brand occupying its intended place in the group’s 
portfolio. the forecast period applied is comparable 
with the common term of the majority of licence 
agreements to which the group is party.  
 
in the local markets, the product portfolio usually 
consists of local power brands and international 
premium brands. when projecting revenue growth for 
local brands, in addition to their commercial strength 
– such as market share and segment position – the 
forecast takes into consideration the demographics of 
the primary markets, including expected 
developments in population, consumption levels, 
generation-shift patterns, rate of urbanisation, beer 
market maturity, level of premiumisation, 
circumstances generally limiting the growth 
opportunities for alcoholic beverages etc.  
 
for brands with global or regional presence, 
enhanced investments in product development and 
marketing are expected. the expected growth rate for 
these brands is generally higher than for more 
localised brands, and is usually highest early in the 
20-year period.

section 2.2 (continued) 
impairment  
depending on the nominal growth expectations for 
the individual brand, the revenue growth in individual 
years may be above, equal to or below the forecast 
inflation level in the markets where the brand is 
present. 
 
when preparing budgets, consideration is given to 
events or circumstances that are relevant to reliably 
project the short-term performance of each brand. 
examples include significant campaign activities, 
changes in excise duties etc., which may have a 
short-term impact but are non-recurring and quickly 
absorbed by the business. since the impact is not 
material to the long-term projections, it is not taken 
into consideration when estimating the long-term 
and terminal period growth rates. please refer to the 
description of the impact of increases in excise duties 
in the description of sales prices in section 2.2.2. 
 
in 2020, the current drop in revenue due to the 
covid-19 pandemic and the expected recovery from 
this have been carefully considered. as the beverage 
industry is generally resilient, the decline in revenue in 
2020 is expected to have only a short-term impact. 
revenue is expected to recover to pre-pandemic 
levels in the medium and long term. the timing of the 
recovery has been carefully considered, particularly 
for brands with lower headroom to the carrying 
amount.  
 
tax benefit 
the theoretical tax benefit applied in the test uses tax 
rates and amortisation periods based on current 
legislation. the impairment test applies tax rates in 
the range of 15-31% and amortisation periods of 5-
10 years. 
royalty rate 
royalties generated by a brand are based on the 
group’s total income from the brand and are earned 
globally, i.e. the income is also earned outside the 
cgu that owns the brand. if external licence 
agreements for the brand already exist, the market 
terms of such agreements are taken into 
consideration when assessing the royalty rate that 
the brand is expected to generate in a transaction 
with independent parties. the royalty rate is based on 
the actual market position of the individual brand in 
the global, regional and local markets, and assumes 
a 20-year horizon. this term is common to the 
beverage industry when licensing brands. 
 
for some brands, the share of the total beer market 
profit exceeds the volume share to an extent that 
creates significant market entry barriers for 
competing brands and justifies a higher royalty rate. 
 
in 2020, the royalty rate for one of the brands was 
adjusted downwards from 15% to 13% due to 
increased competition in the market and declining 
margins.

discount rates 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of 
capital (wacc) that reflects the risk-free interest rate 
with the addition of a risk premium relevant to each 
brand. 
 
the risk-free interest rates used in the impairment 
tests are based on observed market data. for 
countries where long-term risk-free interest rates are 
not observable or valid due to specific national or 
macroeconomic conditions, the interest rate is 
estimated based on observations from other markets 
and/or long-term expectations expressed by 
international financial institutions considered reliable 
by the group.  
 
the added credit risk premium (spread) for the risk-
free interest rate is fixed at market price or slightly 
higher, reflecting the expected long-term market 
price. the aggregate interest rate, including spread, 
thereby reflects the long-term interest rate applicable 
to the group’s investments in the individual markets. 
 
interest rates applied in eastern europe 
in recent years, the macroeconomic situation has 
deteriorated significantly in eastern europe, resulting 
in interest rates and inflation increasing to a level 
significantly higher than the group’s long-term 
expectations.  
 
in 2020, observable interest rates and inflation have 
normalised to the level expected by key international 
financial institutions. the observable risk-free interest 
and inflation have therefore been applied in the 
impairment test for 2020. 
 
the group continues to monitor market 
developments and compare these with the 
expectations of key international financial institutions 
to determine if the observable data can be applied.  
 
the use of expected future interest rates in previous 
years in lieu of appropriate observable interest rates 
did not impact the conclusion of the impairment test 
because the relationship between discount rates and 
growth rates (the real interest rate) was expected to 
be constant. expectations for the long-term real 
interest rate remain a key assumption for the 
impairment testing in general, and for cgus with 
exposure to the russian market in particular.  
 
the impairment test of the baltika brand is sensitive 
to changes in the real interest rate. since no expected 
future long-term real interest rate can be directly 
observed, the estimate of a real interest rate is 
subjective and associated with risk. 
 
interest rates applied in western europe 
western europe is experiencing very low interest 
rates, which in several countries are even lower than 
inflation, resulting in negative real interest rates. the 
group generally applies a growth rate in the terminal 
period that is equal to or slightly lower than expected 
inflation. management does not expect assets and 
cgus subject to impairment testing to have a 
negative real interest rate in perpetuity.  
 
to avoid applying negative real interest rates in 
perpetuity, the discount rate used to calculate net 
present value of the cash flows in the terminal period 
has been adjusted to incorporate an interest rate that 
is at least equal to the expected rate of inflation. 
 
 
2.2.4 sensitivity tests 
sensitivity tests have been performed to 
determine the lowest forecast and terminal 
period growth rates and/or highest discount 
rates that can occur in the groups of cgus and 
brands with indefinite useful life without 
leading to any impairment loss.  
 
the risk-free interest rates observable for 
western europe remained low at the end of 
2020. the sensitivity tests calculate the impact 
of higher interest rates and allow for a double-
digit percentage-point increase in risk-free 
interest rates.  
 
due to a challenging macroeconomic situation 
in some cgus and groups of cgus, the group 
performed additional sensitivity tests to ensure 
that no potential impairment had been 
overlooked. these additional sensitivity tests 
did not identify any potential impairment.  
 
goodwill 
the test for impairment of goodwill did not 
identify any cgus or groups of cgus to which 
goodwill is allocated where a reasonably 
possible negative change in a key assumption 
would cause the carrying amount to exceed the 
recoverable amount.  
 
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   consolidated financial statements 
77 
 
section 2.2 (continued) 
impairment  
the goodwill allocated to eastern europe was 
primarily recognised when the group 
completed the step acquisition of the remaining 
50% of the baltic beverage holding group from 
scottish & newcastle in 2008. however, the 
impairment test includes 100% of the cash flow 
generated by eastern europe, resulting in the  
recoverable amount significantly exceeding the 
carrying amount. 
 
brands 
following the impairment losses recognised in 
2017 and 2015 for the baltika brand, a 
reasonably possible negative change in a key 
assumption would cause the carrying amount 
to exceed the recoverable amount. the 
sensitivity to changes in the assumptions is 
shown in the table below. 
 
key assumptions 
the key assumptions relevant to the 
assessment of the recoverable amount are: 
• volume  
• price  
• discount rate 
 
the assumptions for volume and pricing are 
closely linked, which, together with the 
presence of multiple sub-brands in different 
geographies within each brand, makes 
individual sensitivity testing on the basis of 
these two assumptions highly impractical. 
instead, sensitivity testing is performed for the 
overall revenue growth rate, in both the 
forecast period and the terminal period. 
the sensitivity test for the maximum decline in 
growth rate in the forecast period assumes a 
year-on-year decline in the nominal growth 
rate, thereby estimating the accumulated effect 
of a negative change for the full forecast 
period.  
 
the sensitivity tests were completed with all 
other assumptions unchanged, as it is relevant 
to assess the sensitivity to, for example, a 
decline in the growth rate independently of 
changes in the discount rate. this is because 
the growth rate in itself might be impacted by 
changes in brand strategy and other market 
factors. 
 
the sensitivity calculated also assumes a 
straight-line impact despite the fact that 
changes in market dynamics and adjustments 
to these will in practice have different impacts 
in the individual years and might not apply in 
the long term. 
 
interest rates in western europe have been low 
for several years and are currently lower than 
inflation. an increase in the interest rates 
without a corresponding change in inflation 
would result in a lower recoverable amount for 
brands and could potentially lead to 
impairment. management considers the risk of 
a significant write-down to be very low. 
 
baltika brand 
the baltika brand was written down to its 
recoverable amount at the end of 2017. as a 
result, even a small negative change in the key 
assumptions could lead to further impairment.  
 
at 31 december 2020, the carrying amount of 
the baltika brand was dkk 4,876m (2019: 
dkk 6,402m). the decline in the carrying 
amount is due to the depreciation of rub.  
 
changes in the market dynamics in russia and 
the increasingly challenging competitive 
environment could have a significant negative 
impact on the recoverable amount. 
macroeconomic recovery could lead to further 
premiumisation or localisation, which could 
drive consumers towards international brands 
or local/regional brands. 
 
an increase in the real interest rate from the 
current level (2.7%), either because of a higher 
interest rate or lower inflation, could 
significantly reduce the recoverable amount.  
 
a 1 percentage point increase in the risk-free 
interest rate would result in a reduction in the 
recoverable amount of dkk 0.7bn, and a 1 
percentage point decrease in the terminal 
growth rate would result in a reduction in the 
recoverable amount of dkk 0.3bn. the 
combined effect of a 1 percentage point 
negative change in the interest rate, the 
terminal growth rate and the average growth 
rate in the forecast period (year on year) would 
result in a reduction in the recoverable amount 
of dkk 1.3bn. 
 
angkor brand 
as the angkor brand was written down to the 
recoverable amount in 2020, a reasonably 
possible negative change in the key 
assumptions could lead to further impairment.  
 
following the impairment, the carrying amount 
of the brand amounts to dkk 86m. any 
increase in the risk-free interest rate or 
decrease in the terminal growth rate would 
therefore result in a minor additional 
impairment.

other intangible assets include software, land 
use rights and beer delivery rights.  
 
right-of-use assets  
the group leases various properties and 
warehouses, production equipment, cars and 
trucks. lease terms are negotiated on an 
individual basis and contain a wide range of 
different terms and conditions. 
 
at 31 december 2020, the carrying amount of 
right-of-use assets amounted to dkk 1,382m. 
during the year, additions amounted to dkk 
476m and depreciation to dkk 396m. 
 
lease expenses recognised in the income 
statement, relating to short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets, amounted to dkk 
44m. such contracts comprise the lease of 
copy and printing machines, coffee machines, 
small it devices and similar equipment. 
 
for disclosures of the interest expenses and 
lease liabilities, please refer to sections 4.1, 
4.4.1 and 4.7. 
 
capital commitments  
the group has entered into various capital 
commitments that will not take effect until 
after the reporting date and have therefore not 
been recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements. capital commitments amounted to 
dkk 41m (2019: dkk 56m). 
 
  
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
useful life and residual value of intangible  
assets with finite useful life and property,  
plant and equipment  
useful life and residual value are initially assessed 
both in acquisitions and in business combinations. 
 
management assesses brands and property, plant 
and equipment for changes in useful life. if an 
indication of a reduction in the value or useful life 
exists, such as changes in production structure, 
restructuring and brewery closures, the asset is tested 
for impairment. if necessary, the asset is written 
down or the amortisation/depreciation period is 
reassessed and, if necessary, adjusted in line with the 
asset’s changed useful life. when changing the 
amortisation or depreciation period due to a change 
in the useful life, the effect on amortisation/ 
depreciation is recognised prospectively as a change 
in accounting estimates. 
 
 
lease and service contracts 
at inception of a contract, management assesses 
whether the contract is or contains a lease. 
management considers the substance of any service 
being rendered to classify the arrangement as either a 
lease or a service contract. particular importance is 
attached to whether fulfilment of the contract 
depends on the use of specific assets. the assessment 
involves judgement of whether the group obtains 
substantially all the economic benefits from the use 
of the specified asset and whether it has the right to 
direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. if 
these criteria are satisfied at the commencement 
date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are 
recognised in the statement of financial position. 
 
in determining the lease term, management considers 
all the facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option or 
not to exercise a termination option. extension or 
termination options are only included in the lease 
term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended 
or not terminated. the term is reassessed if a 
significant change in circumstances occurs. the 
assessment of purchase options follows the same 
principles as those applied for extension options.  
 
the lease payment for cars and trucks often includes 
costs of service and insurance. if these costs are not 
objectively accessible, the group estimates the costs 
when separating the service component from the 
lease.

section 2.3 (continued) 
intangible assets 
and property, 
plant and 
equipment  
 
accounting 
policies 
cost  
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
are initially recognised at cost and subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation or 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
 
cost comprises the purchase price and costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition until the date when the 
asset is available for use. the cost of acquired brand 
rights is accounted for using the accumulated cost 
approach if the total consideration includes an earn-
out dependent on the brands’ future performance.  
 
the cost of self-constructed assets comprises direct 
and indirect costs of materials, components, sub-
suppliers, wages and salaries, and capitalised 
borrowing costs on specific or general borrowings 
attributable to the construction of the asset, and is 
included in plant and machinery. 
 
research and development costs are recognised in 
the income statement as incurred. development costs 
of intangible assets, for example software, are 
recognised as other intangible assets if the costs are 
expected to generate future economic benefits.  
 
for assets acquired in business combinations, 
including brands and property, plant and equipment, 
cost at initial recognition is determined by estimating 
the fair value of the individual assets in the purchase 
price allocation. 
 
goodwill is only acquired in business combinations 
and is measured in the purchase price allocation. 
goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual 
impairment test, cf. section 2.2. 
 
where individual components of an item of property, 
plant and equipment have different useful lives, they 
are accounted for as separate items.  
 
subsequent costs, for example in connection with 
replacement of components of property, plant and 
equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of 
the asset if it is probable that the costs will result in 
future economic benefits for the group. the replaced 
components are derecognised from the statement of 
financial position and recognised as an expense in the 
income statement. costs incurred for ordinary repairs 
and maintenance are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. 
 
useful life, amortisation, depreciation and 
impairment losses  
useful life and residual value are determined at the 
acquisition date and reassessed annually. if the 
residual value exceeds the carrying amount, 
depreciation is discontinued.  
 
amortisation and depreciation are recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the 
assets, taking into account any residual value. the 
expected useful life and residual value are determined 
based on past experience and expectations of the 
future use of assets. 
 
depreciation is calculated on the basis of the cost less 
the residual value and impairment losses. 
 
amortisation and depreciation are recognised as cost 
of sales, sales and distribution expenses, and 
administrative expenses depending on the use of the 
asset. 
 
the expected useful life is as follows:  
 
   
brands with 
finite useful life 
normally 20 years 
   
   
software 
normally 3-5 years. group-wide 
systems developed as an integrated 
part of a major business development  
programme: 5-7 years 
   
   
delivery rights 
depending on contract; if no contract 
term has been agreed, normally not 
exceeding 5 years

impairment losses of a non-recurring nature are 
recognised under special items. 
 
leases 
at the commencement date, the group recognises a 
lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset 
at the same amount, except for short-term leases of 
12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. 
 
a right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, 
which consists of the initial lease liability and initial 
direct costs less any lease incentives received. the 
group has applied the practical expedient option 
allowed under ifrs by using a portfolio approach for 
the recognition of lease contracts related to assets of 
the same nature and with similar lease terms, i.e. cars 
and trucks.  
 
subsequently, the right-of-use asset is measured at 
cost less depreciation and impairment losses and 
adjusted for remeasurement of the lease liability. the 
right-of-use asset is depreciated over the earlier of 
the lease term or the useful life of the asset. the 
impairment testing of right-of-use assets follows the 
same principles as those applied for property, plant 
and equipment, cf. section 2.2. 
 
right-of-use assets are recognised as property, plant 
and equipment. 
 
the group has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 
months or less and leases of low-value assets. lease 
payments related to such leases are recognised in the 
income statement as an expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. 
 
government grants and other funding 
grants and funding received for the acquisition of 
assets and development projects are recognised in the 
statement of financial position by deducting the grant 
from the carrying amount of the asset. the grant is 
recognised in the income statement over the life of 
the asset as a reduced depreciation charge.

special items, income 
in 2020, the group recognised reversal of 
provisions made in purchase price allocations in 
a prior year (dkk 586m) and a gain on 
disposal of the last part of the former brewery 
site in hamburg, germany (dkk 62m). 
 
in 2019, the group recognised gains on the 
disposal of a brewery site in trondheim, 
norway, and the former brewery site in 
hamburg, germany. 
 
special items, expenses 
in 2020 and 2019, the group carried out 
various restructuring projects as part of the 
continued focus on cost and efficiency 
initiatives.  
 
the covid-19 pandemic had a negative 
impact on the group’s performance in 2020, 
with government impositions such as 
lockdowns, travel restrictions, limited social 
gatherings and social distancing resulting in the 
closure or reduced operation of on-trade 
outlets and other businesses. to ensure that 
the group is fit for the post-covid-19 reality, 
a programme to reset the business was 
initiated. the restructuring projects entailed 
changes within almost all functions, including 
termination of employees.  
 
in addition, costs incurred to ensure the health 
and safety of our employees, such as personal 
protective equipment, hand sanitiser and 
masks, and donations to local communities 
during the pandemic have been recognised as 
special items. these costs are considered to be 
by nature non-recurring and collectively 
significant to the group’s performance.

section 3.1 (continued) 
special items 
the year was also impacted by write-downs, 
primarily of the angkor brand and brewing 
equipment in cambodia due to a significant 
decline in volumes following an unsuccessful 
attempt to relaunch the brand coupled with the 
impact of covid-19 restrictions in the market.  
 
in 2019, special items also included an increase 
in provisions retained by the group on disposal 
of a former brewery site in previous years. 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
the use of special items entails management  
judgement in the separation from ordinary items. 
management carefully considers individual items and 
projects (including restructurings) in order to ensure 
the correct distinction and split between operating 
activities and significant income and expenses of a 
special nature.  
 
management initially assesses the entire restructuring 
project and recognises all present costs of the project. 
the projects are assessed on an ongoing basis, with 
additional costs possibly being incurred during the 
lifetime of the project. 
 
the estimate includes expenses related to termination 
of employees, onerous contracts, break fees and 
other obligations arising in connection with 
restructurings. management reassesses the useful life 
and residual value of non-current assets used in an 
entity undergoing restructuring. 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
special items include significant income and expenses 
of a special nature in terms of the group’s revenue-
generating activities that cannot be attributed directly 
to the group’s ordinary operating activities.  
 
special items also include significant non-recurring 
items, including termination benefits related to 
retirement of members of the executive committee, 
impairment of goodwill and brands, significant 
provisions in relation to certain disputes and lawsuits, 
gains and losses on the disposal of activities and 
associates, revaluation of the shareholding in an 
entity held immediately before a step acquisition of 
that entity, and transaction costs in a business 
combination.  
 
significant restructuring of processes and structural 
adjustments are included in special items. 
 
special items are shown separately from the group’s 
ordinary operations to facilitate a better 
understanding of the group’s financial performance.

section 3.2   
provisions 
restructuring provisions relate to termination 
benefits to employees made redundant, 
primarily as a result of a restructuring project 
accounted for as special items.  
 
the restructuring provision in 2020 of dkk 
274m primarily related to reset for the future. 
other restructurings mainly relates to 
kronenbourg, ringnes, carlsberg sverige and 
certain local supply companies. 
  
other provisions of dkk 3,846m related to 
ongoing disputes and lawsuits, profit sharing in 
france and employee obligations other than 
retirement benefits. the provision has been 
impacted by reversal of provisions made in 
purchase price allocations in previous years, as 
described in section 3.1, and reversal of 
provisions in relation to real estate and other 
contractual obligations that did not materialise, 
in total dkk 1,136m. 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
in connection with restructurings, management 
assesses the timing of the costs to be incurred, which 
influences the classification as current or non-current 
liabilities.  
 
provision for onerous contracts is based on agreed 
terms with the other party and expected fulfilment of 
the contract, based on the current estimate of 
volumes, use of raw materials etc.  
 
management assesses provisions, contingent assets 
and liabilities, and the likely outcome of pending or 
probable lawsuits etc. on an ongoing basis. the 
outcome depends on future events, which are by 
nature uncertain. in assessing the likely outcome of 
lawsuits and tax disputes etc., management relies on 
external legal advice and established precedents. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
provisions, including profit-sharing provisions, are 
recognised when, as a result of events arising before 
or at the reporting date, the group has a legal or a 
constructive obligation and it is probable that there 
may be an outflow of economic benefits to settle the 
obligation. 
 
provisions are discounted if the effect is material to  
the measurement of the liability. the group’s average 
borrowing rate is used as the discount rate.  
 
restructuring costs are recognised when a detailed, 
formal restructuring plan has been announced to 
those affected no later than at the reporting date. on 
acquisition of entities, restructuring provisions in the 
acquiree are only included in the opening balance 
when the acquiree has a restructuring liability at the 
acquisition date.  
 
a provision for onerous contracts is recognised when 
the benefits expected to be derived by the group from 
a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of 
meeting its obligations under the contract.

section 3.3  
contingent  
liabilities 
the group operates in very competitive 
markets where consolidation is taking place 
within the industry and among our customers 
and suppliers, all of which in different ways 
influences our business.  
 
in the ordinary course of business, the group is 
party to certain lawsuits, disputes etc. of 
varying content and scope, some of which are 
referred to below. the resolution of these 
lawsuits, disputes etc. is associated with 
uncertainty, as they depend on relevant 
applicable proceedings, such as negotiations 
between the parties affected, government 
actions and court rulings. 
 
in 2020, the german supreme court overruled 
the higher regional court of düsseldorf, which 
in 2019 had ruled in favors of carlsberg 
deutschland in relation to the competition case 
from 2014, in which the federal cartel office in 
germany issued a decision and imposed a fine 
of eur 62m for alleged infringement of the 
competition rules in 2007. the german 
supreme court referred the competition case 
back to a new senate for full new proceedings. 
in 2018 and 2019, the group's associate super 
bock in portugal received three separate 
statements of objections from the local 
competition authority. two of these cases are 
still awaiting a final decision, whereas the third 
case has been dropped by the portuguese 
competition authority without any consequence 
for super bock. 
 
a private consumer protection organisation in 
portugal has made public that it intends to 
raise a civil claim of eur 400m against super 
bock for compensation to portuguese 
consumers for alleged harm on account of 
super bock’s alleged anticompetitive practices.  
 
in 2018, a dawn raid was conducted at the 
group’s subsidiary in india. at 31 december 
2020, the case was still ongoing, and carlsberg 
india is still awaiting the final decision of the 
competition authorities, which could entail a 
fine. 
 
the group is party to arbitration proceedings in 
singapore with a partner who is the non-
controlling shareholder of the group entities in 
question. the dispute relates to the 
shareholders’ agreement between carlsberg 
and the partner. 
although no final rulings have been made in 
the ongoing cases, there is still significant risk 
related to these cases due to the inherent 
uncertainty. 
 
management and the general counsel 
continuously assess these risks and their likely 
outcome. it is the opinion of management and 
the general counsel that, apart from items 
recognised in the statement of financial 
position, the outcome of these lawsuits, 
disputes etc. cannot be reliably estimated in 
terms of amount or timing. the group does not 
expect the ongoing lawsuits and disputes to 
have a material impact on the group’s financial 
position, net profit or cash flow, in excess of 
items recognised in the statement of financial 
position.  
 
guarantees and commitments 
the group has issued guarantees for loans etc. 
raised by third parties (non-consolidated 
entities) of dkk 304m (2019: dkk 395m). in 
2020 and 2019, no guarantees were issued for 
loans raised by associates and joint ventures. 
 
certain guarantees etc. are issued in connection 
with disposal of entities and activities, and in 
connection with on-trade loans. apart from 
items recognised in the statement of financial 
position or disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements, these guarantees etc. will 
not have a material effect on the group’s 
financial position. 
 
capital commitments, lease liabilities and 
service agreements are described in section 2.3.

net interest-bearing debt was dkk 21.3bn, an 
increase of dkk 2.5bn versus year-end 2019.  
the financial position was impacted by lower-

19 impact on the business and the issue of two 
bonds for a total of eur 1bn.   
 
the leverage ratio, measured as net interest-

39.3bn of which was attributable to 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s and dkk 4.1bn 
to non-controlling interests.  
 
the change in equity of dkk -2.6bn was the 
result of the consolidated profit of dkk 6.8bn, 
foreign exchange on translation of dkk 7.6bn, 
the dividend payout of dkk 3.9bn, the share 
buy-back of dkk 2.9bn, acquisition of entities 
of dkk 1.0bn and non-controlling interests of 
dkk 3.8bn. 
 
the non-controlling interests were impacted by 
the acquisition of 60% of marston’s brewing 
activities in the uk, the simultaneous disposal 
of 40% of the group's subsidiaries in the uk, 
and the injection of the group’s chinese entities 
into chongqing jianiang, cf. section 5.3.

of the gross financial debt at year-end, 97% 
(2019: 84%) was long term, i.e. with maturity 
of more than one year. 
 
long-term and short-term borrowings 
amounted to dkk 30.3bn at 31 december 
2020 (2019: dkk 25.0bn). long-term 
borrowings totalled dkk 29.3bn (2019: dkk 
20.9bn) and short-term borrowings totalled 
dkk 1.0bn (2019: dkk 4.1bn). the increase 
in long-term borrowings is mainly due to the 
issue of a 10-year eur 500m bond maturing 
in march 2030 and a 7-year eur 500m bond 
maturing in june 2027. both bonds were 
issued to secure continued strong liquidity and

section 4.3  
capital  
structure  
4.3.1 capital structure 
management regularly assesses whether the 
group’s capital structure is in the interests of 
the group and its shareholders. 
 
the overall objective is to ensure a continued 
development and strengthening of the group’s 
capital structure that supports long-term 
profitable growth and a solid increase in key 
earnings and ratios. this includes assessment 
of and decisions on the split of financing 
between share capital and borrowings, which is 
a long-term strategic decision to be made in 
connection with significant investments and 
other transactions. 
 
carlsberg a/s’ share capital is divided into two 
classes (a shares and b shares). combined 
with the carlsberg foundation’s position as 
majority shareholder (in terms of control), 
management considers that this structure will 
remain advantageous for all of the 
shareholders, enabling and supporting the 
long-term development of the group. 
 
the group targets a leverage ratio below 2.0x. 
at the end of 2020, the leverage ratio was 
1.51x (2019: 1.25x). the group currently uses 
share buy-back programmes to return excess 
cash to shareholders. 
 
the share buy-back programmes are initiated 
based on a cautious evaluation of the group’s 
funding flexibility and credit resources 
available. the size and duration of each 
programme depend on the expected organic 
and inorganic investments needed to grow the 
business and the group’s intention to maintain 
a leverage ratio below 2.0x. 
the group generally intends to cancel treasury 
shares that are not used for hedging of 
incentive programmes. 
 
the group is rated by moody’s investors 
service and fitch ratings. management 
assesses the risk of changes in the group’s 
investment-grade rating as an element in 
strategic decisions on capital structure. 
identification and monitoring of risks that could 
change the rating were carried out on an 
ongoing basis throughout the year.  
 
 
4.3.2 share capital 
at the annual general meeting on 16 march 
2020, it was decided to reduce the share 
capital of carlsberg a/s by a nominal amount 
of dkk 88,000,000 to a nominal amount of 
dkk 2,963,136,120 by cancelling 4,400,000 
of the b shares held by the company, each 
with a nominal value of dkk 20. the 
cancellation was completed on 14 april 2020. 
these shares had been repurchased as part of 
the company’s share buy-back programme 
running from 6 february 2019 to 30 january 
2020.  
 
 
4.3.3 equity 
dividends 
the group proposes a dividend of dkk 22.00 
per share (2019: dkk 21.00 per share), 
amounting to dkk 3,259m (2019:  
dkk 3,204m). the proposed dividend has  
been included in retained earnings at  
31 december 2020.

dividends to be paid out in 2021 for 2020, net 
of dividends on treasury shares held at 31

share buy-back and treasury shares 
as of 31 january 2020, the company had 
repurchased 393,501 b shares under the share 
buy-back programme initiated in 2019 at a 
total purchase price of dkk 0.4bn.  
 
on 4 february 2020, the company announced 
its intention to continue the share buy-back 
programme and repurchase shares worth dkk 
5bn over a 12-month period. in the first 
tranche, which was finalised on 7 august 2020, 
the company repurchased 2,897,021 b shares 
at a total purchase price of dkk 2.5bn. due to 
the continued uncertainties related to covid-
19, and the acquisitions of marston’s brewing 
activities and the brooklyn brand rights, the 
board decided not to initiate the second 
tranche of the share buy-back.  
 
according to the authorisation of the annual 
general meeting, the supervisory board may, 
in the period until 13 march 2023, allow the 
company to acquire treasury shares up to a 
total holding of 10% of the nominal share 
capital at a price quoted on nasdaq 
copenhagen at the time of acquisition with a 
deviation of up to 10%. the permitted holding 
of treasury shares covers those acquired in 
share buy-back programmes. the company 
holds no class a shares.

4.3.4 other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income has mainly been 
impacted by a negative foreign exchange 
adjustment from the depreciation of rub. 
 
 
4.3.5 financial risk management 
the group’s activities mean it is exposed to a 
variety of financial risks, including market risk 
(foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and 
commodity risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
these risks are described in the following 
sections: 
 
• foreign exchange risk: sections 1.3 and 4.6 
• interest rate risk: section 4.5  
• commodity risk: section 1.2.1 
• credit risk: sections 1.5.1 and 4.4.2  
• funding and liquidity risk: section 4.7 
 
the group’s financial risks are managed by 
group treasury in accordance with the 
financial risk management policy approved by 
the supervisory board as an integrated part of 
the overall risk management process. the risk 
management governance structure is described 
in the management review. 
 
to reduce exposure to these risks, the group 
enters into a variety of financial instruments 
and generally seeks to apply hedge accounting 
to reduce volatility in the income statement. 
 
debt instruments and deposits in foreign 
currency reduce the overall risk, but will not as 
a general rule achieve the objective of reducing 
volatility in specific items in the income 
statement.

policies 
borrowings 
borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less 
transaction costs and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
accordingly, the difference between the fair value less 
transaction costs and the nominal value is recognised 
under financial expenses over the term of the loan. 
lease liability 
the lease liability is measured at the present value of 
the remaining lease payments at the reporting date, 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate for 
similar assets, taking into account the terms of the 
leases. a remeasurement of the lease liability, for 
example a change in the assessment of an option to 
purchase, results in a corresponding adjustment of 
the related right-of-use assets, cf. section 2.3. 
 
extension or termination options are included in the 
lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be 
extended or not terminated. consequently, all cash 
outflows that are reasonably certain to impact the 
future cash balances are recognised as lease liabilities 
at initial recognition of lease contracts. the group 
reassesses the circumstances leading to it not 
recognising extension or termination options on an 
ongoing basis. 
 
 
4.4.2 cash 
cash and cash equivalents include short-term 
marketable securities with a term of three 
months or less at the acquisition date that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value. short-term bank deposits amounted to 
dkk 353m at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 
188m). the average interest rate on these 
deposits was 2.7% (2019: 4.3%).  
 
during 2020, the group had an increased focus 
on liquidity and maintaining sufficient cash at 
bank to better protect against the uncertainties 
and increased risks in relation to covid-19. 
total cash at bank amounted to dkk 8,093m 
in 2020 (2019: dkk 5,222m).

assessment of credit risk 
the group is exposed to credit risk on cash and 
cash equivalents (including fixed deposits), 
investments and derivative financial 
instruments with a positive fair value, due to 
uncertainty as to whether the counterparty will 
be able to meet its contractual obligations as 
they fall due. 
 
the group has established a credit policy under 
which financial transactions may be entered 
into only with financial institutions with a solid 
credit rating.  
 
the group primarily enters into financial 
instruments and transactions with the group’s 
relationship banks, i.e. banks extending loans 
to the group. group treasury manages and 
monitors the group’s gross credit exposure to 
banks and operates with individual limits on 
banks, based on rating and access to netting of 
assets and liabilities. 
 
exposure to credit risk  
the carrying amount of dkk 8,093m (2019: 
dkk 5,222m) represents the maximum credit 
exposure related to cash and cash equivalents.  
 
the credit risk on receivables is described in 
section 1.5.1.

section 4.5  
interest rate risk 
the group’s exposure to interest rate risk is 
considered limited. at the reporting date, 127% 
of the net financial debt consisted of fixed-rate 
borrowings with interest rates fixed for more 
than one year (2019:100%). as 110% of the 
group’s net debt is in eur, the interest rate 
exposure primarily relates to the development 
in the interest rates for eur. 
the share of fixed-rate net financial debt in 
cny is negative (-78%) as the cash position 
exceeds the total debt. for usd and eur, the 
share is positive (225% and 111% respectively) 
as the cash position exceeds the current debt.  
 
the interest rate risk is measured by the 
duration of the net financial debt. the target is 
to have a duration between three and eight 
years. at 31 december 2020, the duration was 
5.6 years (2019: 4.4 years). interest rate risk is 
mainly managed using fixed-rate bonds. 
sensitivity analysis 
it is estimated that a 1 percentage point 
interest rate increase would lead to a decrease 
in interest expenses of dkk 60m (2019: dkk 
0m). the impact is due to the relatively high 
portion of cash. the analysis assumes a 
parallel shift in the relevant yield curves. 
 
if the market interest rate had been  
1 percentage point higher at the reporting date, 
it would have led to a financial gain of dkk 
1,242m (2019: dkk 865m), and a similar loss 
had the interest rate been 1 percentage point 
lower. however, since all fixed-rate borrowings 
are measured at amortised cost, there is no 
impact on other comprehensive income or the 
income statement. 
 
the sensitivity analysis is based on the financial 
instruments recognised at the reporting date.  
 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift 
in interest rates and that all other variables 
remain constant, in particular foreign exchange 
rates and interest rate differentials between the 
different currencies. the analysis was 
performed on the same basis as for 2019. the 
group did not enter into any new interest rate 
swaps in 2020 or 2019.

section 4.6  
foreign exchange 
risk related to 
net investments 
and financing 
activities 
4.6.1 currency profile of 
borrowings 
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk 
on borrowings denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currency of the local 
entities reporting the debt, as well as the risk 
that arises when net cash inflow is generated in 
one currency and loans are denominated and 
have to be repaid in another currency. 
 
4.6.2 hedging of net investments  
in foreign subsidiaries 
the group holds a number of investments in 
foreign subsidiaries where the translation of net 
assets to dkk is exposed to foreign exchange 
risks. the group hedges part of this foreign 
exchange exposure by entering into forward 
exchange contracts (net investment hedges). 
this mainly applies to net investments in chf, 
cny, myr, nok and pln. the basis for 
hedging is reviewed at least once a year, and 
the two parameters, risk reduction and cost, 
are balanced. in economic terms, having debt 
in foreign currency or creating synthetic debt 
via forward exchange contracts constitutes 
hedging of the dkk value of future cash flows 
arising from operating activities or specific 
transactions. 
 
the most significant net risk relates to foreign 
exchange adjustment of net investments in 
rub. this is because of the size of the net 
investments in rub combined with the 
currency’s high volatility. 
 
where the fair value adjustments of forward 
exchange contracts do not exceed the fair 
value adjustments of the investment, the 
adjustments of the financial instruments are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. at 
31 december 2020, all adjustments of financial 
instruments have been recognised in other 
comprehensive income. fair value adjustments 
of loans designated as strategic intra-group 
loans have also been recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
the fair value of derivatives used as  
net investment hedges recognised at  
31 december 2020 amounted to dkk 84m 
(2019: dkk -91m). the closing balance in the 
equity reserve for currency translation of 
hedges of net investments amounted to 
dkk -1,611m (2019: dkk -1,628m). positive 
fair values of derivatives are recognised as 
other receivables and negative values as other 
liabilities.

section 4.6 (continued) 
foreign exchange 
risk related to 
net investments 
and financing 
activities 
4.6.3 exchange rate risk on cash 
and borrowings 
the main principle for funding of subsidiaries is 
that cash, loans and borrowings should be 
denominated in local currency or hedged to 
local currency to avoid foreign exchange risk. 
however, in some group entities, net debt is 
denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the local entity without 
the foreign exchange risk being hedged. this 
applies primarily to a few entities in eastern 
europe that hold cash and loans in eur and 
usd and in this way obtain proxy hedging of 
the foreign exchange risk associated with the 
purchase of goods in foreign currency in these 
markets.  
 
 
4.6.4 impact on financial 
statements and sensitivity 
analysis  
 
impact on income statement 
for the impact of currency on operating profit 
and financial items, please refer to sections 1.3 
and 4.1 respectively. 
impact on statement  
of financial position 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will 
affect the level of debt, as funding is obtained 
in a number of currencies. in 2020, net 
interest-bearing debt increased by dkk 297m 
(2019: decreased by dkk 14m) due to changes 
in foreign exchange rates.  
 
sensitivity analysis 
an adverse development in the exchange rates 
would, all other things being unchanged, have 
had the hypothetical impact on the income 
statement and other comprehensive income 
(oci) for 2020 illustrated in the tables. the 
calculations have been made based on items 
in the statement of financial position at  
31 december 2020.

income statement 
the hypothetical impact ignores the fact that 
the subsidiaries’ initial recognition of revenue, 
cost and debt would be similarly exposed to 
the exchange rate developments. 
 
other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income is affected by 
changes in the fair value of currency derivatives 
designated as cash flow hedges of future 
purchases and sales.  
applied exchange rates 
the average exchange rate was calculated 
using the monthly exchange rates weighted 
according to the phasing of the revenue per 
currency throughout the year. 
 
 
section 4.7  
funding and 
liquidity risk 
the group's overall objective is to ensure 
continuous access, at the right price, to the 
financial resources needed for operations and 
growth.  
 
liquidity risk results from the group’s potential 
inability to meet the obligations associated 
with its financial liabilities, for example settle-
ment of financial debt and paying suppliers.  
 
the aim is to ensure effective liquidity 
management, which involves obtaining 
sufficient committed credit facilities to ensure 
adequate financial resources and, to some 
extent, tapping a range of funding sources. 
 
diversified funding sources 
the group is diversifying its access to funding 
to avoid relying on one single source of 
funding. 
 
at 31 december 2020, bonds accounted for 
89% of the gross funding.

section 4.7 (continued) 
funding and 
liquidity risk 
the group still has access to a committed eur 
2bn revolving credit facility (rcf) maturing in 
2025 that is currently not being utilised. in 
addition, the group has committed cash pool 
bank overdraft facilities to cover the day-to-
day liquidity needs and uncommitted access to 
the euro commercial paper (ecp) market, 
which provides short-term funding.  
 
funding strategy and reaction to 
covid-19 
since march 2020 and the first covid-19 
lockdowns in western europe, the group has 
maintained a central cash position of minimum 
eur 200m as a safety measure. in addition, a 
special effort has been made to improve cash 
flow forecasting, including introducing frequent 
short-term cash flow updates. 
 
in march, carlsberg issued a 10-year eur 
500m bond and secured a eur 500m bank 
loan as a precaution against the market 
uncertainty. in addition, carlsberg issued a 7-
year eur 500m bond in june, which was used 
to repay the bank loan issued in march.  
 
credit resources available 
the group uses the term “credit resources 
available” to determine the adequacy of access 
to credit facilities. 
 
the credit resources available include cash and 
unutilised credit facilities with more than 12 
months to maturity less utilised credit facilities 
with less than 12 months to maturity and 
uncommitted working capital facilities.  
 
net financial debt is used internally to monitor 
the group’s credit resources available. net 
financial debt is the group’s net interest-
bearing debt, excluding interest-bearing assets 
other than cash, as these assets are not 
actively managed in relation to liquidity risk. 
net financial debt is shown in section 4.2. 
at 31 december 2020, the group had total 
credit resources available of dkk 22,013m, 
consisting of cash and cash equivalents of dkk 
8,093m plus committed unutilised non-current 
credit facilities of dkk 14,879m less utilisation 
of current facilities of dkk -959m. including 
current credit facilities of dkk 1,186m, total 
committed unutilised credit facilities amounted 
to dkk 16,065m.  
 
credit resources available increased by dkk 
6.0bn compared with 2019, primarily due to 
the issuance of the two bonds for a total of 
eur 1.0bn. both bonds were issued to secure 
continued strong liquidity and financial 
flexibility.  
 
the credit resources available and the access to 
unused committed credit facilities are 
considered reasonable in light of the group’s 
current needs in terms of financial flexibility. 
 
in addition to efficient working capital manage-
ment and credit risk management, the group 
mitigates liquidity risk by arranging borrowing 
facilities with solid financial institutions. 
 
the group uses cash pools for day-to-day 
liquidity management in most of the entities in 
western europe, as well as intra-group loans 
to subsidiaries. eastern europe and asia are 
less integrated in terms of cash pools, and 
liquidity is managed via intra-group loans.  
 
the table lists the contractual maturities of 
financial liabilities, including estimated interest 
payments and excluding the impact of netting 
agreements, and thus summarises the gross 
liquidity risk.

section 4.7 (continued) 
funding and 
liquidity risk 
the risk implied by the values reflects the one-
sided scenario of cash outflows only. trade 
payables and other financial liabilities originate 
from the financing of assets in ongoing 
operations, such as property, plant and 
equipment, and investments in working capital, 
for example inventories and trade receivables. 
 
the nominal amount/contractual cash flow of 
gross financial debt totalled dkk 30,426m 
(2019: dkk 25,144), whereas the total 
carrying amount was dkk 30,250m (2019: 
dkk 24,991m). the difference between these 
amounts arises at initial recognition and is 
treated as a cost that is capitalised and 
amortised over the duration of the borrowings. 
the interest expense is the contractual cash 
flows expected on the gross financial debt 
existing at 31 december 2020.  
 
the cash flow is estimated based on the 
notional amount of the above-mentioned 
borrowings and expected interest rates at 
year-end 2020 and 2019. interest on debt 
recognised at year-end 2020 and 2019 for 
which no contractual obligation exists (current 
borrowing and cash pools) has been included 
for a two-year period. the synthetic interest 
on lease liabilities has also been included for a 
two-year period. the interest applied to the 
part of the debt where no contractual 
obligation exists is 2.5% (2019: 1%). 
 
 
section 4.8  
derivative 
financial 
instruments 
the group enters into various derivative 
financial instruments to hedge foreign 
exchange and commodity risks, cf. sections 1.2 
and 1.3, and seeks to apply hedge accounting 
when this is possible. hedging of future, highly 
probable forecast transactions is designated as 
cash flow hedges.  
 
the group monitors the cash flow hedge 
relationships twice a year to assess whether 
the hedge is still effective. 
 
positive fair values of derivatives are recognised 
as other receivables and negative values as 
other liabilities. 
 
the impact on other comprehensive income 
and the fair value of derivatives classified as 
cash flow hedges is presented in the cash flow 
hedge table.  
 
cash flow hedges comprise aluminium hedges, 
where the hedged item is aluminium cans that 
will be used in a number of group entities in 
2021. the hedging instrument is aluminium 
swaps.  
 
the impact on other comprehensive income 
from other instruments relates to hedges of 
group entities’ exposure to changes in 
aluminium prices. 
 
the impact on other comprehensive income 
from exchange rate instruments relates to 
hedges of group entities’ purchases and sales 
in currencies other than their functional 
currencies.

as of 31 december 2020, the hedging reserve 
within equity included dkk 843m in relation to 
cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting is 
no longer applied. 
 
fair value adjustments of derivative financial 
instruments that are not designated either as 
net investment hedges or as cash flow hedges 
are recognised in financial income and 
expenses. 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
when entering into financial instruments, 
management assesses whether the instrument is an 
effective hedge of recognised assets and liabilities, 
expected future cash flows or financial investments. 
the effectiveness of recognised hedging instruments 
is assessed at least twice a year.  
 
fair values of derivative financial instruments are 
calculated on the basis of level 2 input consisting of 
current market data and generally accepted valuation 
methods. internally calculated values are used, and 
these are compared with external market quotes on a 
quarterly basis. for currency and aluminium 
derivatives, the calculation is as follows: 
a) the forward market rate is compared with the 
agreed rate on the derivatives, and the difference 
in cash flow at the future point in time is 
calculated. 
b) the amounts are discounted to present value.  
 
when entering into a contract, management assesses 
whether the contract contains embedded derivatives 
and whether they meet the criteria for separate 
classification and recognition. the group currently 
does not have any embedded derivatives that meet 
the criteria for separate classification and recognition. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the trade date and 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the 
reporting date. 
 
the accounting for subsequent changes in fair value 
depends on whether the derivative is designated as 
one of:  
• fair value hedges of the fair value of recognised 
assets or liabilities  
• cash flow hedges of particular risks associated with 
the cash flow from forecast transactions  
• net investment hedges of currency fluctuations in 
subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures. 
 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are 
presented in other receivables or payables, and 
positive and negative values are offset only when the  
group has the right and the intention to settle several 
financial instruments net.  
 
changes in the fair value of a fair value hedge and of 
derivative financial instruments not designated in a 
hedge relationship are recognised in financial income 
or expenses in the income statement.  
 
changes in the effective portion of the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments that are designated 
and qualify as a cash flow hedge are recognised in 
the hedging reserve within equity. when the hedged 
transaction materialises, amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the same item as the hedged item. 
 
derivatives designated as and qualifying for 
recognition as a cash flow hedge of financial 
investments are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. on complete or partial disposal of the 
financial investment, the portion of the hedging 
instrument that is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and relates to that financial investment is 
recognised in the income statement when the gain or 
loss on disposal is recognised. 
 
hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures are accounted for in the 
same way as cash flow hedges.

section 5.1 
investment model 
and risks 
market access 
in the beer industry, access to local markets is 
highly dependent on establishing good 
relationships with customers in the on- and 
off-trade channels, national distributors, local 
suppliers and relevant authorities governing the 
beverage industry. often, the most efficient 
way of establishing such relations is by 
acquiring a local brewer or engaging with a 
local partner that already has the relevant 
relationships.   
 
therefore, when the group expands its 
business, it often does so in collaboration with 
a local partner. such a partnership can take 
different legal forms and impacts the 
consolidated financial statements to a varying 
degree accordingly.   
 
investment model 
entering into a partnership can reduce the 
financial exposure and mitigate the business 
risks associated with entering new markets or 
expanding the activities in an existing market. 
the financial exposure, however, varies 
depending on the structure of the partnership. 
business and financial success, and the related 
risks, depend on the ability of the group and 
the local partner to forge a strong and aligned 
cooperation. 
 
in some markets, the group enters as a non-
controlling shareholder, providing a degree of 
financing and contributing knowledge of the 
beer industry. the group thus leaves the 
controlling influence with the partner and 
recognises the investment as an associate. 
 
other investments are structured as joint 
ventures, where the group and the local 
partner jointly make the operational decisions 
and share strategic and tactical responsibility.  
 
more commonly, the group structures its 
partnerships such that it exercises management 
control, usually by way of majority of the 
voting rights. these investments are fully 
consolidated subsidiaries, which are just as 
important as other types of partnership for 
success in the local markets, but mean that the 
group has increased financial exposure. 
investments in businesses in which the group 
exercises management control often involve 
put and/or call options or a similar structure. 
impact on financial statements 
investments in associates and joint ventures are 
consolidated in the financial statements using 
the equity method. the accounting risks 
associated with these entities are limited to 
the investment made, the proportionate share 
of the net profit and any specific additional 
commitments to banks or other parties, as well 
as specific guarantees or loans the group 
provides to the partnership.  
 
in businesses where the group exercises 
management control, the consolidated 
financials are impacted by full exposure to the 
earnings and other financial risks. from an 
accounting point of view, the group treats any 
put options held by partners in such entities as 
if they had already been exercised by the 
partner, i.e. anticipating that the acquisition will 
occur. the accounting impact is that the non-
controlling interests are not recognised, and no 
part of net profits or equity is attributed to 
them. instead, the dividends the partner 
receives from the business are – for accounting 
purposes – classified as financial expenses.

section 5.1 (continued) 
investment model 
and risks 
common to all partnerships is the risk of 
disagreement and, ultimately, dissolution. 
disagreements with partners on the operational 
management and strategic directions of 
partnerships may limit our ability to manage 
the growth and risk profile of our business. the 
group continuously seeks to promote a fair and 
mutually beneficial development of the 
partnerships, which is crucial for the 
development to be successful. however, in 
certain partnerships the partners’ pursuit of 
goals and priorities that are different from 
those of the group might result in 
disagreements, affecting operational and 
financial performance. such different goals and 
priorities can become more pronounced in the 
period before a partner has the right to exit the 
partnership. 
 
a dissolution will initially impact the accounting 
treatment of an investment. the accounting 
treatment will depend on whether the group or 
our partner is exiting the business. in the long 
term, however, the impact can be significant to 
the operation of the local entity and the 
collaboration with customers, distributors, 
authorities etc. if the partner was instrumental 
in managing these relationships. therefore, the 
risk of a partnership dissolution may have a 
negative impact on the underlying business and 
the financial performance recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements.

acquisitions and 
disposals 
acquisition of entities  
 
marston’s brewing activities 
in october 2020, carlsberg uk and marston’s 
plc injected their respective brewing activities 
into a jointly owned company named carlsberg 
marston’s brewing company limited.  
 
carlsberg is the controlling shareholder with a 
shareholding of 60%.  
 
the jointly owned company was formed to 
strengthen the group’s presence in the 
important uk market through a stronger beer 
portfolio. the calculated goodwill represents 
staff competences and synergies from expected 
optimisations of sales and distribution, supply 
chain and procurement, possible product 
innovations, the increase in market share and 
access to new customers.  
 
the total cost of the acquisition comprises the 
cash consideration paid, a contingent 
consideration and the fair value of the 40% of 
carlsberg uk businesses that were effectively 
transferred to marston’s plc when the 
carlsberg entities were injected into the jointly 
owned company. 
 
the purchase price allocation of the fair value 
of identified assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is ongoing. adjustments are therefore 
expected to be made to several items in the 
opening balance, including brands and 
property, plant and equipment. the accounting 
treatment of the acquisition will be completed 
within the 12-month period required by ifrs.

accounting estimates  
and judgements 
assessment of control  
the classification of entities where carlsberg controls 
less than 100% of the voting rights is based on an 
assessment of the contractual and operational 
relationship between the parties. this includes 
assessing the conditions in shareholder agreements, 
contracts etc. consideration is also given to the extent 
to which each party can govern the financial and 
operating policies of the entity, how the operation of 
the entity is designed, and which party possesses the 
relevant knowledge and competences to operate the 
entity. 
 
another factor relevant to this assessment is the 
extent to which each of the parties can direct the 
activities and affect the returns, for example by 
means of rights, reserved matters or casting votes. 
 
purchase price allocation  
for acquisitions of entities, the assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the acquiree are recognised 
using the acquisition method. the most significant 
assets acquired generally comprise goodwill, brands, 
property, plant and equipment, receivables and 
inventories. 
 
no active market exists for the majority of the 
acquired assets and liabilities, in particular in respect 
of acquired intangible assets. accordingly, 
management makes estimates of the fair value of 
acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. 
depending on the nature of the item, the determined 
fair value of an item may be associated with 
uncertainty and possibly adjusted subsequently. 
 
the unallocated purchase price (positive amount) is 
recognised in the statement of financial position as 
goodwill and allocated to the group’s cash-
generating units.   
 
brands 
the value of the brands acquired and their expected 
useful life are assessed based on the individual 
brand’s market position, expected long-term 
developments in the relevant markets and 
profitability. the estimated value includes all future 
cash flows associated with the brand, including the 
related value of customer relations etc.  
 
management determines the useful life based on the 
brand’s relative local, regional and global market 
strength, market share, and the current and planned 
marketing efforts that are helping to maintain and 
increase its value. when the value of a well-
established brand is expected to be maintained for an 
indefinite period in the relevant markets, and these 
markets are expected to be profitable for a long 
period, the useful life of the brand is determined to be 
indefinite. 
 
brands are measured using the relief from royalty 
method, under which the expected future cash flows 
are based on key assumptions about expected useful 
life, royalty rate, growth rate and a theoretically 
calculated tax effect. a post-tax discount rate is used 
that reflects the risk-free interest rate with the 
addition of a risk premium associated with the 
particular brand. the model and assumptions applied 
are consistent with those used in impairment testing, 
and are described in further detail in section 2.2.3. 
 
customer agreements and portfolios  
the value of acquired customer agreements and 
customer portfolios is assessed based on the local 
market and trading conditions. for most entities, 
there is a close relationship between brands and 
sales. consumer demand for beer and other 
beverages drives sales, and therefore the value of a 
brand is closely linked to consumer demand, while 
there is no separate value attached to customers 
(shops, bars etc.), as their choice of products is driven 
by consumer demand. the relationship between 
brands and customers is carefully considered so that 
brands and customer agreements are not both 
recognised on the basis of the same underlying cash 
flows.  
 
property, plant and equipment  
the fair value of land and buildings, and standard 
production and office equipment is based, as far as 
possible, on the fair value of assets of similar type 
and condition that may be bought and sold in the 
open market.  
 
property, plant and equipment for which there is no 
reliable evidence of the fair value in the market (in 
particular breweries, including production equipment) 
are valued using the depreciated replacement 
method. 
 
this method is based on the replacement cost of a 
similar asset with similar functionality and capacity. 
the calculated replacement cost is then reduced to 
reflect functional and physical obsolescence. the 
expected synergies and the user-specific intentions 
for the expected use of assets are not included in the 
determination of the fair value. 
 
acquisition of marston’s brewing activities  
purchase price allocation 
management believes that the purchase price for 
marston’s brewing activities accounted for in the 
consolidated financial statements reflects the best 
estimate of the total fair value of the business. the 
fair value of the contingent consideration is primarily 
based on the expected development in market 
conditions.  
 
the provisional opening balance recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements is based on the 
carrying amounts at the time of injection of marston’s 
plc’s brewing activities into a newly established 
entity held by the joint venture.  
 
the purchase price allocation of the identified assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities will be completed 
within 12 months of the acquisition. this is primarily 
expected to impact the value of brands, property, 
plant and equipment, trade loans and trade 
receivables.  
 
brands 
the value of the brands will be estimated using the 
group’s principle described above. it is expected that 
significant brands will be assumed to have an 
indefinite useful life. 
 
property, plant and equipment 
the fair value and expected useful life of the brewery 
equipment and related buildings of the six acquired 
breweries will be determined with assistance from 
leading external engineering experts in the brewery 
industry.

section 5.2 (continued) 
acquisitions  
and disposals  
trade loans and receivables 
the fair value of the trade loans and receivables will 
be estimated in line with the group’s principle for 
assessment of credit risk and recognition of 
impairment losses to reflect the amount that is 
expected to be collected. the valuation will take into 
consideration the expected increase in losses in the 
on-trade segment due to the restrictions and 
lockdowns under covid-19.  
 
goodwill 
goodwill will be allocated to the cgu covering the 
western europe region in line with the allocation of 
the group’s existing uk business.  
 
  
 
accounting 
policies 
acquisitions 
the acquisition date is the date when the group 
effectively obtains control of an acquired subsidiary 
or significant influence over an associate or a joint 
venture. 
 
the cost of a business combination comprises the fair 
value of the consideration agreed upon, including the 
fair value of any consideration contingent on future 
events. 
 
in a step acquisition, the group gains control of an 
entity in which it already held a shareholding. the 
shareholding held before the step acquisition is 
remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date, 
added to the fair value of the consideration paid for 
the shareholding acquired in the step acquisition and 
accounted for as the total cost of the shareholding in 
the acquired entity. the gain or loss on the 
remeasurement is recognised in the income statement 
under special items.  
 
goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection 
with the acquisition of an entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities belonging to the foreign entity and 
translated into the foreign entity’s functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the transaction date. 
 
the acquired entities’ identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the 
acquisition date. 
 
identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they 
are separable or arise from a contractual right. 
deferred tax on revaluations is recognised. 
 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities on initial recognition at the acquisition date 
are subsequently adjusted up until 12 months after 
the acquisition. the effect of the adjustments is 
recognised in the opening balance of equity, and the 
comparative figures are restated accordingly if the 
amount is material. 
 
changes in estimates of contingent purchase 
considerations are recognised in the income 
statement under special items, unless they qualify for 
recognition directly in equity.  
 
disposals  
gains or losses on the disposal or liquidation of 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated 
as the difference between the sales price and the 
carrying amount of net assets (including goodwill) at 
the date of disposal or liquidation, foreign exchange 
adjustments recognised in other comprehensive 
income, and costs to sell or liquidation expenses.  
 
 
 
 
section 5.3 
non-controlling 
interests 
material asset restructuring in china 
in december 2020, carlsberg and chongqing 
brewery co. completed a material asset 
restructuring and contributed their controlled 
chinese assets to chongqing jianiang brewery.  
 
chongqing jianiang brewery is jointly owned by 
chongqing brewery co. (51%) and the carlsberg 
group (49%). the ownership remains unchanged 
following the completion of the restructuring, 
and the ownership of the listed company 
chongqing brewery co. is also unchanged at 
60%. the group thereby directly and indirectly 
holds 79% of chongqing jianiang brewery.  
 
at completion, the group’s ownership of the 
assets it injected (previously 70-100% owned) 
thereby declined to 56-79%, while the group’s 
ownership of the assets injected by chongqing 
brewery co. increased from 60% to 79%.  
effectively, the transactions thereby exchange 
shareholdings of the injected entities between 
the group and the non-controlling shareholders 
in chongqing brewery co.  
 
the fair value of the entities injected by the 
carlsberg group exceeds that of the entities 
injected by chongqing brewery co. in addition 
to the exchange of shareholdings, chongqing 
brewery co. will therefore pay a cash amount to 
the group. the amount will be determined 
based on 2020 earnings and paid in april 2021.  
 
the transaction is accounted for as an equity  
transaction with the non-controlling interests 
and resulted in a net increase in equity for  
transactions with non-controlling interests

non-controlling 
interests 
non-controlling interests and a corresponding 
decrease for shareholders in carlsberg a/s.  
 
the transaction was completed in december 
2020 and had an insignificant impact on the 
allocation of profit for december 2020.  
at completion, the transferred shareholdings 
impacted the allocation of equity between 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s and non-
controlling interests by dkk 553m.  
 
changes in the uk as a result of the 
acquisition of marston’s brewing 
activities 
in october 2020, carlsberg uk and marston’s 
plc injected their respective brewing activities 
into a jointly owned company named carlsberg 
marston’s brewing company limited. the 
transaction is further described in section 5.2. 
carlsberg is the controlling shareholder in the 
joint venture with a shareholding of 60%, having 
effectively transferred 40% of its businesses in 
the uk.  
 
the fair value of the transferred shareholding is 
part of the total consideration paid for the 
brewing activities injected by marston’s plc. at 
completion, the transferred shareholding 
impacted the allocation of equity between 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s and non-
controlling interests by dkk 730m.  
  
section 5.4 
contingent 
considerations 
contingent considerations relate to options 
held by non-controlling interests in subsidiaries 
to sell their shares to the group and to deferred 
payments in the acquisition of entities 
depending on market developments. 
 
at the end of the reporting period, the 
contingent considerations primarily related to 
put options on the shares in carlsberg south 
asia pte ltd (the parent company holding 
100% and 90% of the shares in the businesses 
in india and nepal respectively), in brewery 
alivaria, belarus, in a craft brewery in western 
europe, and to the contingent consideration in 
the acquisition of marston’s brewing activities.  
 
in accordance with the group’s accounting 
policy, shares subject to put options are 
consolidated as if the shares had already been 
acquired. the ownership percentage at which 
these subsidiaries are consolidated therefore 
differs from the legal ownership interest 
retained by the group. both the legal and  
the consolidated ownership is stated in section 
10. 
 
the carrying amount of contingent 
considerations is determined in accordance with 
the terms of the agreements made with the 
holders of the options. therefore, not all are 
measured at fair value.  
 
the valuation of put options at fair value 
decreased due to the covid-19 impact on the 
businesses. the size of the decline differs from 
market to market depending on the impact of 
the pandemic, government actions, including 
lockdowns, and the expected time to return to 
the market conditions and earnings seen before 
the outbreak. interest rates of 4.8-7.4% and 
residual growth rates of 4.0-5.0% were applied 
in the valuation of contingent considerations. 
 
other contingent considerations are linked to 
the development in the share price of selected 
beverage companies.  
 
movements during the year comprise 
acquisition of entities and fair value 
adjustments of contingent considerations, net 
of exercised put options during the year. 
 
of the contingent considerations, dkk 5bn 
(2019: dkk 9bn) is expected to fall due within 
one to five years, whereas the rest will fall due 
within 12 months. the majority of the 
contingent considerations are expected to fall 
due within the next few years. 
 
in one of the agreements, the partner can 
initiate the put option process from 1 january 
2021. our partner has not yet initiated the put 
option process, and it is not expected that the 
options will be exercised during 2021.  
 
transactions in 2019 
in 2019, the remaining outstanding shares in 
caretech limited (the parent company in the 
cambrew group) were acquired. the related 
contingent consideration was derecognised. a 
loss of dkk 526m was recognised in equity on 
exercise of these put options.

section 5.4 (continued) 
contingent 
considerations 
 
 
accounting estimates  
and judgements 
the fair value of contingent considerations linked to 
put options is calculated on the basis of level 3 input 
consisting of non-observable data, such as entity-
specific discount rates and industry-specific 
expectations of price developments, and generally 
accepted valuation methods, including discounted 
cash flows and multiples. 
 
estimates are based on updated information since 
initial recognition of the contingent consideration, 
including new budgets and sales forecasts, discount 
rates etc. the assumptions applied are in line with 
those used in the impairment tests as described in 
section 2.2, but reflecting the different models and 
valuation techniques needed. 
 
the fair values of other contingent considerations are 
measured at the expected future price of certain 
selected shares.  
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
on acquisition of non-controlling interests, i.e. 
subsequent to the group obtaining control, acquired 
net assets are not measured at fair value. the 
difference between the cost and the non-controlling 
interests’ share of the total carrying amount, including 
goodwill, is transferred from the non-controlling 
interests’ share of equity to equity attributable to 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s. the amount deducted 
cannot exceed the non-controlling interests’ share of 
equity immediately before the transaction. 
 
on disposal of shareholdings to non-controlling 
interests, the difference between the sales price and 
the share of the total carrying amount, including 
goodwill acquired by the non-controlling interests, is 
transferred from equity attributable to shareholders in 
carlsberg a/s to the non-controlling interests’ share 
of equity. 
 
fair value adjustments of put options granted to non-
controlling interests are recognised directly in the 
statement of changes in equity.  
 
other contingent considerations (earn-outs), which 
are not linked to a future transfer of additional 
shareholdings, are measured in accordance with the 
terms of the contract with the seller. the revaluation 
of such contingent considerations is recognised in 
special items.  
 
 
 
section 5.5 
associates and 
joint ventures 
investments in associates and joint ventures 
include the businesses in portugal (60%) and 
myanmar (51%) and five associates in china 
(each 50%). the total investment in these 
associates amounted to dkk 2,589m at 31 
december 2020 (2019: dkk 2,658m).  
 
in 2019, the group increased its ownership of 
super bock, portugal, to 60%. nevertheless, 
super bock remains an associate of the group 
due to the ownership structure. please refer to 
section 10 for further details.  
 
despite the legal 51% ownership share in 
myanmar carlsberg, the entity is classified as 
an associate due to the structure of the 
agreement with the partner. 
for associates in which the group holds an 
ownership interest of less than 20%, the group 
participates in the management of the 
company and is therefore exercising significant 
influence.

accounting 
policies 
investments in associates and joint ventures are 
recognised according to the equity method, which 
entails measurement at cost and adjustment for the 
group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of the associate after the date 
of acquisition. the share of the result must be 
calculated in accordance with the group’s accounting 
policies. the proportionate share of unrealised intra-
group profits and losses is eliminated. investments in 
associates and joint ventures with negative net asset 
values are measured at dkk 0.  
 
if the group has a legal or constructive obligation to 
cover a deficit in the associate or joint venture, the 
deficit is recognised under provisions. any amounts 
owed by associates and joint ventures are written 
down to the extent that the amount owed is deemed 
irrecoverable.

24.7% 
tax rate 
the tax rate is down from 26.9% in 2019. 
 
section 6.1  
income tax 
the nominal weighted tax rate for the group is 
calculated as domestic tax rates applicable to 
profits in the entities as a proportion of each 
entity’s share of the group’s profit before tax. 
 
the nominal weighted tax rate declined 
compared with 2019, as russia (tax rate 20%) 
and laos (tax rate 20%) contributed a 
proportionally larger share, countered by 
norway (tax rate 22%). 
  
the effective tax rate of 24.7% (2019: 26.9%) 
was positively impacted by the non-taxable 
and non-deductible transactions in special 
items. excluding these items, the effective tax 
rate would be 25.7%.  
 
the group’s total tax cost at the effective tax 
rate was dkk 354m higher than the group’s 
nominal weighted tax, negatively impacted by 
withholding taxes (particularly on dividends), 
non-capitalised tax assets and non-deductible 
expenses (particularly marketing expenses and 
intercompany charges).  
it is not possible to deduct all interest and fair 
value adjustments arising in denmark due  
to thin capitalisation rules. tax on such 
adjustments therefore fluctuates from year  
to year. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
income tax comprises current tax and changes in 
deferred tax for the year, including changes as a 
result of a change in the tax rate. the tax expense 
relating to the profit/loss for the year is recognised  
in the income statement, while the tax expense 
relating to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
 
if the group obtains a tax deduction on computation 
of the taxable income in denmark or in foreign 
jurisdictions as a result of share-based payment 
programmes, the tax effect of the programmes is 
recognised in tax on profit/loss for the year. 
however, if the total tax deduction exceeds the total 
expense, the tax benefit of the excess deduction is 
recognised directly in equity.

section 6.2 
tax assets and 
liabilities 
of the total deferred tax assets recognised, 
dkk 201m (2019: dkk 312m) related to tax 
loss carryforwards, the utilisation of which 
depends on future positive taxable income 
exceeding the realised deferred tax liabilities. it 
is management’s opinion that these tax loss 
carryforwards can be utilised.  
 
tax assets not recognised of dkk 936m (2019: 
dkk 678m) primarily related to tax losses that 
are not expected to be utilised in the 
foreseeable future. of these, tax losses that 
will not expire amounted to dkk 962m (2019: 
dkk 472m). remaining tax losses of dkk 
355m (2019: dkk 206m) will expire within five 
years. 
 
deferred tax of dkk 41m (2019: dkk 54m) 
was recognised in respect of the tax of 5% 
payable on planned dividends from certain 
entities in eastern europe.  
 
planned distribution of reserves for other 
subsidiaries will not trigger a significant tax 
liability based on current tax legislation. 
 
deferred tax on temporary differences relating 
to investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures was recognised at dkk 0m (2019: 
dkk 180m). the deferred tax plus the additional 
tax on the gain on the group’s internal transfer 
of shares is expected to materialise within the 
next few years.

accounting estimates 
and judgements 
the group recognises deferred tax assets, including 
the expected tax value of tax loss carryforwards, if 
management assesses they can be offset against 
positive taxable income in the foreseeable future. this 
judgement is made annually and based on budgets 
and business plans for the coming years, including 
planned commercial initiatives. 
 
carlsberg operates in a large number of tax 
jurisdictions where tax legislation is highly complex 
and subject to interpretation. management makes 
judgements on uncertain tax positions to ensure 
recognition and measurement of tax assets and 
liabilities.  
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
current tax payable and receivable are recognised in 
the statement of financial position as tax computed 
on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax 
on the taxable income of prior years and for tax paid 
on account respectively. 
deferred tax on all temporary differences between 
the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and 
liabilities is measured using the balance sheet liability 
method. however, deferred tax is not recognised on 
temporary differences relating to goodwill that is not 
deductible for tax purposes or on office premises and 
other items where temporary differences, apart from 
business combinations, arise at the acquisition date 
without affecting either profit/loss for the year or 
taxable income.  
 
where alternative tax rules can be applied to 
determine the tax base, deferred tax is measured 
based on the planned use of the asset or settlement 
of the liability. deferred tax is recognised on expected 
dividend payments from subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures in countries levying withholding tax on 
distributions.  
 
deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards 
are recognised under other non-current assets at the 
expected value of their utilisation, either as a set-off 
against tax on future income or as a set-off against 
deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and 
jurisdiction. 
 
deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are offset if the 
entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax liabilities and tax assets or intends either to settle 
current tax liabilities and tax assets or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that the assets will be utilised. 
 
deferred tax is measured according to the tax rules at 
the reporting date and at the tax rates applicable 
when the deferred tax is expected to materialise as 
current tax.  
 
the change in deferred tax as a result of changes in 
tax rates is recognised in the income statement. 
changes to deferred tax on items recognised in 
other comprehensive income are, however, 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

reset 
to prepare for a new post-covid-19-
reality, we initiated a review and reset of 
our total cost base towards the end of the 
year, called reset for the future. 
 
 
 
pensions 
defined benefit obligations were affected 
by lower discount rates across all markets 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, and 
by the transfer of the large medical 
insurance scheme to the municipal 
government, releasing the group from the 
obligation.

section 7.1 
staff costs 
staff costs decreased for several entities in 2020 
as a consequence of lower performance-related 
payouts due to covid-19 and compared with 
the relatively high payouts for 2019 due to good 
financial performance. this was partly offset by  
increased redundancies etc.  
during 2020, the average number of employees 
decreased due to terminations as part of reset 
for the future, partly offset by the acquisition of 
marston’s brewing activities. as the restructurings 
and acquisition were completed in the second 
half of the year, the full impact is not visible in 
the average number of employees for the year.

section 7.2 
remuneration 
the remuneration of the supervisory board, 
the executive directors and key management 
personnel is described in detail in the 
remuneration report. 
 
the remuneration of key management 
personnel decreased in 2020, primarily as a 
result of the covid-19 impact on the kpis 
measured in both short- and long-term 
incentive programmes. 
 
in 2020, the supervisory board received total 
remuneration of dkk 9.86m (2019: dkk 
9.59m), comprising fixed salary only. 
 
all elements except for share-based payments 
are classified as short-term employee benefits. 
share-based payments are classified as a 
long-term employee benefit. 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
staff costs are recognised in the financial year in 
which the employee renders the related service.  
 
the cost of share-based payments, which is 
expensed over the vesting period of the programme 
according to the service conditions, is recognised in 
staff costs and provisions or equity, depending on 
how the programme is settled with the employees. 
 
key management personnel comprise the executive 
committee, excluding the executive directors. other 
management personnel included in the share-based 
payment schemes comprise vice presidents and other 
key employees in central functions as well as the 
management of significant subsidiaries. 
section 7.3 
share-based 
payments 
the group has set up share-based incentive 
programmes to attract, retain and motivate the 
group’s executive directors and other levels of 
management personnel, and to align their 
interests with those of the shareholders. there 
is no share-based incentive programme for the 
supervisory board. 
 
the group has two types of share-based 
payment: share options and performance 
shares. share options entitle the holder to 
purchase class b shares in carlsberg a/s at a 
predetermined price after completing three 
years of service. share options are exercisable 
for five years.  
 
entitlement to performance shares also 
requires fulfilment of service in the vesting 
period (2-3 years), but does not have any 
exercise price.  
 
instead, the shares are transferred to the 
recipients based on achievement of the kpis 
attached to the shares. performance shares 
have been awarded under three programmes 
that differ in terms of kpi structure and vesting 
period.  
performance shares 
the number of performance shares granted is 
the maximum number of performance shares 
that can vest. the number of shares 
outstanding at the end of the period is the 
number expected to vest, based on the extent 
to which the vesting conditions are expected to 
be met. the number of shares expected to vest 
is revised on a regular basis. 
 
regular performance shares 
in 2020, 190 employees (2019: 192 
employees) across the group were awarded 
performance shares. 
 
vesting is subject to achievement of four kpis: 
total shareholder return, adjusted eps  
growth, organic revenue growth and growth in 
roic. the average share price at vesting was 
dkk 770 (2019: dkk 803). the average 
contractual life at the end of 2020 was 1.2 
years (2019: 1.5 years).

fund & grow performance shares 
the fund & grow performance share 
programme was set up in 2018 to align the 
initiatives driven by group management in our 
sail’22 strategy with the interests of our 
shareholders. shares were granted to 204 
employees across the group, not including the 
executive directors. the programme vested in 
2020 with all kpis fully achieved.  
 
share options 
no share options have been granted since 
2016. the outstanding options are all 
exercisable at the end of the reporting period. 
the average contractual life was 2.8 years 
(2019: 3.6 years).

accounting estimates 
and judgements 
the volatility of performance shares is based on the 
historical volatility of the price of carlsberg a/s’ class 
b shares over the previous three years. for share 
options, the volatility is based on similar data over 
the previous eight years. 
 
the share price and the exercise price of share 
options are calculated as the average price of 
carlsberg a/s’ class b shares on nasdaq copenhagen 
during the first five trading days after publication of 
carlsberg a/s’ financial statements. 
 
the risk-free interest rate is based on danish 
government bonds of the relevant maturity. the 
expected life is based on exercise at the end of the 
exercise period. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
the fair value of granted performance shares is 
estimated using a stochastic (quasi-monte carlo) 
valuation model of market conditions and a black-
scholes call option-pricing model of other conditions, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the performance shares were granted. 
 
on initial recognition of performance shares, an 
estimate is made of the number of awards expected 
to vest and subsequently revised for any changes. 
accordingly, recognition is based on the number of 
awards that ultimately vest.

section 7.4 
retirement 
benefit 
obligations  
and similar 
obligations 
a number of employees are covered by 
retirement benefit plans. the nature of the 
plans varies depending on labour market 
conditions in the individual countries. benefits 
are generally based on wages/salaries and 
length of employment. 
 
retirement benefit obligations cover both 
present and future retirees’ entitlement to 
retirement benefits.  
 
defined contribution plans 
a defined contribution plan is a post-
employment benefit plan under which the 
group pays contributions to a separate 
independent company. the group’s legal or 
constructive obligation is limited to the 
contributions.  
 
61% (2019: 61%) of the group’s retirement 
benefit costs related to defined contribution 
plans. in 2020, the expense recognised in 
relation to these contributions was dkk 303 
(2019: dkk 300m). 
 
defined benefit plans 
the defined benefit plans guarantee employees 
a certain level of pension benefits for life. the 
pension is based on seniority and salary at the 
time of retirement. the group assumes the risk 
associated with future developments in interest 
rates, inflation, mortality and disability etc.  
 
the most significant plans are in the uk and 
switzerland, representing 50% and 38% 
respectively (2019: 47% and 39%), while the 
eurozone countries represented 5% (2019: 5%) 
of the gross obligation at 31 december 2020. 
 
the majority of the obligations are funded, 
with assets placed in independent pension 
funds, mainly in switzerland and the uk. in 
some countries, primarily germany, sweden 
and china, the obligation is unfunded. the 
retirement benefit obligations for these 
unfunded plans amounted to dkk 1,589m 
(2019: dkk 1,802m) or 12% (2019: 13%) of 
the gross obligation. 
 
in 2020, the group’s obligation, net, on defined 
benefit plans decreased by dkk 365m 
compared with 2019 because of general 
decreases in the net obligation across the 
group. two particularly significant factors in 
this were the dkk 213m decrease in china, as 
a result of the municipal government in 
xinjiang assuming responsibility for the long-
term medical insurance scheme, and the dkk 
305m net decrease in switzerland, reflecting 
higher benefits paid out and an increase in the 
assets plan. this effect was partially offset by 
changes in actuarial assumptions in the uk, 
primarily lower discount rates, as an effect of 
the covid-19 pandemic, which increased the 
net obligation, mainly due to actuarial losses of 
dkk 150m.

income for 2020 totalled dkk -429m (2019: 
net gain of dkk 681m), comprising foreign 
exchange adjustment, dkk 129m, and net 
actuarial loss, dkk 300m, which in 2019 
included reversal of an asset ceiling in the uk 
of dkk 66m.  
 
the accumulated actuarial loss and foreign 
exchange adjustment recognised at 31 
december 2020 was dkk 3,287m (2019: dkk 
3,710m), with actuarial net losses of dkk 
3,733m (2019: dkk 3,734m). 
 
assumptions applied 
in 2020, the discount rate used for the defined 
benefit plans in western europe was 
determined by reference to market yields on 
corporate bonds. in the asian countries, where 
no deep market in high-quality corporate 
bonds exists, the discount rate was determined 
by reference to market yields on government 
bonds. 
 
the mortality tables used in carlsberg uk are 
s3pma/s3pfa tables for post-retirement and 
amc00/afc00 for pre-retirement, both with 
cmi_2019 projections, while the swiss entities 
use bvg 2015 for valuation of their retirement 
benefit obligations. 
 
sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is based on a change in 
one of the assumptions, while all other 
assumptions remain constant. this is highly 
unlikely, however, as a change in one 
assumption would probably affect other 
assumptions as well. when calculating the 
obligation on the basis of a changed 
assumption, the same method has been 
applied as when calculating the defined benefit 
obligation. 
 
expected maturity and duration 
defined benefit obligations are primarily 
expected to mature after five years. the  
expected duration of the obligations at year-
end 2020 was 21 years. the duration is 
calculated using a weighted average of the 
duration divided by the obligation.

retirement 
benefit 
obligations  
and similar 
obligations 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
the value of the group’s defined benefit plans is 
based on valuations from external actuaries. the 
valuation is based on a number of actuarial 
assumptions, including discount rates, expected return 
on plan assets, expected growth in wages and 
salaries, mortality and retirement benefits. 
 
the present value of the net obligation is calculated 
by using the projected unit credit method and 
discounting the defined benefit plan by a discount 
rate for each country. the discount rate is determined 
by reference to market yields on high-quality 
corporate bonds. where high-quality corporate bonds 
are not available, the market yields on government 
bonds are used instead. 
 
mortality assumptions are based on the group 
entity’s best estimate of the mortality of plan 
members during and after employment, and include 
expected changes in mortality. due to the broad 
range of entities comprising the retirement benefit 
obligation, several different mortality tables are used 
to calculate the future retirement benefit obligation. 
 
contributions paid to a defined contribution plan are 
recognised in the income statement in the period 
during which services are rendered by employees. 
any contributions outstanding are recognised in the 
statement of financial position as other liabilities. 
 
the group’s net obligation recognised in the 
statement of financial position in respect of defined 
benefit plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair 
value of plan assets calculated by a qualified actuary.  
 
the present value is determined separately for each 
plan by discounting the estimated future benefits that 
employees have earned in return for their service in 
the current and prior years. 
 
the costs of a defined benefit plan are recognised in 
the income statement and include service costs, net 
interest based on actuarial estimates and financial 
expectations at the beginning of the year.  
 
service costs comprise current service cost and past 
service cost. current service cost is the increase in the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from employee services in the current 
period. past service cost is the change in the present 
value of the obligation regarding employee services in 
prior years that arises from a plan amendment or a 
curtailment. past service costs are recognised 
immediately, provided employees have already 
earned the changed benefits.  
realised gains and losses on curtailment or 
settlement are recognised under staff costs. 
 
interest on retirement benefit obligations and the 
interest on return on plan assets are recognised as 
financial income or financial expenses. 
 
differences between the development in retirement 
benefit assets and liabilities and realised amounts at 
year-end are designated as actuarial gains or losses 
and recognised in other comprehensive income. as 
they will never be reclassified to the income 
statement, they are included in retained earnings. 
 
if a retirement benefit plan constitutes a net asset, 
the asset is recognised only if it offsets future refunds 
from the plan or will lead to reduced future payments 
to the plan. 
 
realised gains and losses on the adjustment of 
retirement benefit obligations as a result of 
termination of a significant number of positions in 
connection with restructurings are recognised under 
special items.

earnings per

during 2020, the group repurchased a total of 
2.9m b shares under the share buy-back 
programme. the continued share buy-back 
programme decreased the average number of 
shares by 4.3m. this increased adjusted 
earnings per share by dkk 1.2. the adjustment 
for special items after tax more than offset the 
lower profit for the year compared with the 
previous year and increased adjusted earnings 
per share by dkk 1.4. 
 
for all share-based incentive instruments, the 
average market price of carlsberg b shares 
exceeded the exercise price and the fair value 
at the grant date. as a result, diluted earnings 
per share included all share-based incentive 
instruments that could potentially dilute 
earnings in the future.

related parties 
related parties exercising control 
the carlsberg foundation, h.c. andersens 
boulevard 35, 1553 copenhagen v, denmark, 
exercises control over carlsberg a/s. the 
foundation holds 29.6% of the shares and 
75.6% of the voting power in carlsberg a/s, 
excluding treasury shares. 
 
the following transactions took place between 
the carlsberg foundation and the group in 
2020: 
 
the carlsberg foundation received a dividend 
of dkk 21.00 per share from carlsberg a/s, 
the same as every other shareholder. the 
dividend received amounted to dkk 970m. 
 
through its pro-rata participation in the share 
buy-back programme, the carlsberg 
foundation sold b shares to carlsberg a/s at a 
fair value of dkk 880m. the foundation 
thereby reduced its shareholding to 29.6% at 
31 december 2020 (2019: 29.4%). the shares 
were sold back at the average weekly share 
buy-back market prices. 
 
funding and grants 
carlsberg a/s received statutory grants and 
further funding from the carlsberg foundation, 
dkk 30.3m, for the basic research and 
development activities at the carlsberg 
research laboratory (2019: dkk 39m). of the 
total grants, dkk 22m (2019: dkk 41m) was 
deferred to be used for research projects in the 
future. 
 
in 2020, the carlsberg foundation contributed 
dkk 52m that will be used to support the 
rebuilding of the carlsberg visitor centre during 
2021 and 2022 to better showcase carlsberg’s 
rich history and value creation.  
 
other activities 
carlsberg a/s held the annual general 
meeting at ny carlsberg glyptotek at a cost of 
dkk 0.2m. furthermore, ny carlsberg 
glyptotek received event products free of 
charge from the group as part of the 
sponsorship of certain events at an 
accumulated value of dkk 0.01m. 
 
the group’s delivery of beer and soft drinks to 
the carlsberg foundation is charged at 
ordinary listing price minus a discount. in 2020, 
the deliveries amounted to dkk 0.1m (total 
sales of goods) (2019: dkk 0.2m). 
 
carlsberg a/s leases parking spaces from the 
carlsberg foundation to provide parking for 
employees at the research laboratory and 
visit carlsberg. furthermore, carlsberg 
breweries a/s leases storage facilities in the 
researcher apartments. these lease 
agreements are with subsidiaries of the 
foundation. both of the annual lease 
payments amount to dkk 0.2m and the leases 
are on market terms. 
 
it is estimated that the benefit for the carlsberg 
group corresponds to the value of the other 
activities provided to the carlsberg foundation, 
which in turn corresponds to what each party 
would have had to pay to have the same 
deliverables provided by external parties. 
 
other related parties 
related parties also comprise carlsberg a/s’ 
supervisory board and executive board, their 
close family members and companies in which 
these persons have significant influence. during 
the year, there were no transactions between 
these parties and the group, except for 
remuneration as disclosed in section 7 of the 
consolidated financial statements.

on 1 january 2021, the group completed the 
minor acquisition of wernesgrüner brewery, 
germany, which will be fully consolidated as of 
the acquisition date.  
 
apart from this and the events recognised or 
disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements, no events have occurred after the

segmentation 
the regional structure of the group 
changed as of 1 january 2021 to rebalance 
the european regions in terms of size and

the segmentation changed on the same 
date (in line with the structure). 
 
 
 
section 9.1  
significant 
accounting 
estimates and 
judgements 
in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements, management makes various 
accounting estimates and judgements that 
form the basis of presentation, recognition and 
measurement of the group’s assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. the estimates and 
judgements made are based on historical 
experience and other factors that management 
assesses to be reliable, but that, by nature, are 
associated with uncertainty and unpredictability 
and may therefore prove incomplete or 
incorrect. 
section 9.2  
general 
accounting 
policies 
the group’s 2020 consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance 
with ifrs as adopted by the eu and further 
requirements in the danish financial 
statements act. 
 
the consolidated financial statements are 
presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is the 
parent company’s functional currency, and all 
values are rounded to the nearest dkk million, 
except when otherwise stated.  
 
the accounting policies set out below have 
been used consistently in respect of the 
financial year and the comparative figures. 
 
defining materiality 
significant items are presented individually in 
the financial statements as required by ias 1. 
other items that are considered relevant to 
stakeholders and necessary for an 
understanding of the group’s business model, 
including research, real estate and geographical 
diversity, are also presented individually in the 
financial statements. 
 
the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared as a consolidation of the financial 
statements of the parent company, carlsberg 
a/s, and its subsidiaries according to the 
group’s accounting policies. 
 
entities over which the group exercises 
significant influence, but which it does not 
control, are considered associates. significant 
influence is generally obtained by direct or 
indirect ownership or control of less than 50% 
of the voting rights or participation in the 
management of the company. the assessment 
of whether carlsberg a/s exercises control or 
significant influence includes potential voting 
rights exercisable at the reporting date. entities 
that by agreement are managed jointly with 
one or more other parties are considered joint 
ventures.  
 
on consolidation, intra-group income and 
expenses, shareholdings, balances and 
dividends, and realised and unrealised gains are 
eliminated. unrealised gains on transactions 
with associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated in proportion to the group’s 
ownership share of the entity.

unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 
way as unrealised gains to the extent that 
impairment has not taken place.  
 
the accounting items of subsidiaries are 
included in full in the consolidated financial 
statements. non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsidiaries’ profit/loss for the year and of 
equity are included in the group’s profit/loss 
and equity but are disclosed separately. 
entities acquired or established in the year are 
recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date of acquisition or 
formation. entities disposed of or discontinued 
are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement until the date of disposal or 
discontinuation. the comparative figures are 
not restated. 
 
foreign currency translation  
a functional currency is determined for each of 
the reporting entities in the group. the 
functional currency is the primary currency 
used for the reporting entity’s operations. 
transactions denominated in currencies other 
than the functional currency are considered 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
 
on initial recognition, transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated to the functional currency at the 
exchange rates at the transaction date. foreign 
exchange differences arising between the 
exchange rates at the transaction date and at 
the date of payment are recognised as financial 
income or expenses. 
 
receivables, payables and other monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates at the 
reporting date. the difference between the 
exchange rates at the reporting date and at the 
date at which the receivable or payable arose 
or the exchange rate in the latest consolidated 
financial statements is recognised as financial 
income or expenses. 
 
on recognition of entities with a functional 
currency other than the presentation currency, 
the income statement and statement of cash 
flows are translated at the exchange rates at 
the transaction date, and the statement of 
financial position items are translated at the 
exchange rates at the reporting date. foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation of 
the opening balance of equity, and of the 
income statement on the reporting date, are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and 
attributed to a separate translation reserve in 
equity. foreign exchange differences arising on 
the translation of the proportionate share of 
associates and joint ventures are likewise 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
 
foreign exchange adjustment of balances with 
entities that are considered part of the 
investment in the entity is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. correspondingly, 
foreign exchange gains and losses on the part 
of loans and derivative financial instruments 
that are designated as hedges of investments in 
foreign entities, and that effectively hedge 
against corresponding foreign exchange gains 
and losses on the investment in the entity, are 
also recognised in other comprehensive income 
and attributed to a separate translation reserve 
in equity. 
 
when the gain or loss from a complete or 
partial disposal of an entity is recognised, the 
share of the cumulative exchange differences 
recognised in other comprehensive income is 
recognised in the income statement. the same 
approach is adopted on repayment of balances 
that constitute part of the net investment in the 
entity. 
 
income statement 
the presentation of the group’s income 
statement is based on the internal reporting 
structure, as ifrs does not provide a specific 
disclosure requirement. 
 
special items are not directly attributable to 
ordinary operating activities and are shown 
separately in order to facilitate a better 
understanding of the group’s financial 
performance. 
 
cash flow 
cash flow is calculated using the indirect 
method and is based on operating profit before 
special items adjusted for depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment losses. cash flow 
cannot be derived directly from the statement 
of financial position and income statement. 
financial ratios and non-ifrs  
financial measures 
the group uses certain additional financial 
measures to provide management, investors 
and investment analysts with additional 
measures to evaluate and analyse the 
company’s results. these non-ifrs financial 
measures are defined and calculated by the 
group, and therefore may not be comparable 
with other companies’ measures. 
 
the non-ifrs financial measures disclosed in 
the annual report are: 
 
• earnings per share, adjusted, and payout 
ratio, adjusted 
• organic development 
 
the danish finance society does not 
acknowledge use of special items and states 
that adjustments of tax should be based on the 
marginal tax rate. when calculating financial 
measures, the group uses operating profit 
before special items as well as the effective tax 
rate for measures adjusted for tax. 
 
other financial ratios are calculated in 
accordance with the danish finance society’s 
online guidelines on the calculation of financial 
ratios, “recommendations and financial 
ratios”, unless specifically stated.

9.2.1 reporting under the esef 
regulation 
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic 
format (esef regulation) has introduced a 
single electronic reporting format for the 
annual financial reports of issuers with 
securities listed on the eu regulated markets. 
 
the combination of xhtml format and ixbrl 
tags enables the annual financial reports to be 
read by both humans and machines, thus 
enhancing accessibility, analysis and 
comparability of the information included in the 
annual financial reports. 
 
the group’s ixbrl tags have been prepared in 
accordance with the esef taxonomy, which is 
included in the esef regulation and developed 
based on the ifrs taxonomy published by the 
ifrs foundation. 
 
the line items in the consolidated financial 
statement are tagged to elements in the esef 
taxonomy. for financial line items that are not 
directly defined in the esef taxonomy, an 
extension to the taxonomy has been created. 
extensions are anchored to elements in the 
esef taxonomy, except for extensions that are 
subtotals. 
the annual report submitted to the danish 
financial supervisory authority (the officially 
appointed mechanism) consists of the xhtml 
document together with the technical files, all 
of which are included in the zip file carl-
2020-12-31.zip. 
 
key definitions 
xhtml (extensible hypertext markup 
language) is a text-based language used to 
structure and mark up content such as text, 
images and hyperlinks in documents that are 
displayed in a web-browser. 
 
ixbrl tags (or inline xbrl tags) are hidden 
metainformation embedded in the source code 
of an xhtml document that enables the 
conversion of xhtml-formatted information 
into a machine-readable xbrl data record 
using appropriate software.  
 
a financial reporting taxonomy is an electronic 
dictionary of business reporting elements used 
to report business data. a taxonomy element is 
an element defined in a taxonomy that is used 
for the machine-readable labelling of 
information in an xbrl data record.

section 9.3  
changes in 
accounting 
policies 
changed accounting policies  
and classification in the annual 
report 2020

to the consolidated financial statements for

that were adopted as of 1 january 2020:  
 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 “definition of 
material” 
• amendments to ifrs 3 “business 
combinations” 
• amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7 
“interest rate benchmark reform” 
• amendments to “references to the 
conceptual framework in ifrs standards”  
 
the, amendments had no impact on the

that are not material and/or relevant for the 
group or do not change the accounting policies 
applied in 2020.

adopted by the eu in early 2021. the group 
will adopt the amendment when it becomes 
mandatory. 
 
the implemented amendments are not 
expected to have any significant impact on the 
financials or the group’s accounting policies, as 
they cover areas that are not material and/or 
relevant for the group or do not change the 
accounting policies applied in 2020.

section 9.5  
new segmentation 
new segmentation for 2021 
the regional structure of the group changed as 
of 1 january 2021, with the aim of rebalancing 
the european regions in terms of size and 
number of business units.  
 
ifrs 8 requires that an entity discloses 
information about its operating segments, 
including profit and loss for each reportable 
segment. these segment disclosures should 
follow the “management approach”, meaning 
they should be the same segments as are 
regularly reported to management. 
 
the disclosure in the annual report follows the 
same regional segmentation as was used in the 
internal reporting to the executive committee 
throughout 2020. 
 
as the management structure was unchanged 
during 2020, the segmentation used in the 
annual report 2020 continues without any 
changes compared with 2019.  
 
the segmentation changed as of 1 january 
2021, when the new management structure 
took effect. to provide transparency, it has 
been decided to disclose the effect of the  
new segmentation had it become effective at  
1 january 2020 and as it will be disclosed in 
the comparative figures for 2020 in the annual 
report 2021. 
the effect of the new segmentation 
with the new segmentation the entities in the 
baltic and balkan countries, greece and italy 
(collectively known as the southern europe & 
baltics markets) as well as carlsberg export & 
license move from the western europe region 
to eastern europe. 
 
eastern europe will then be renamed central & 
eastern europe to better reflect its new 
composition.

please see section 10 in the consolidated financial 
statements for a list of companies in the carlsberg group. 
 
 
accounting estimates 
and judgements 
indications of impairment of investments in 
subsidiaries are assessed annually by management. 
impairment tests are conducted in the same way as 
for goodwill in the group, cf. section 2.2 in the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
it is management’s assessment that no indications of 
impairment existed at year-end 2020. impairment 
tests have therefore not been carried out for 
subsidiaries. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
dividends on investments in subsidiaries are 
recognised in the income statement of the parent 
company in the financial year in which the dividend is 
declared. 
 
investments in subsidiaries are measured at the lower 
of cost and recoverable amount. 
 
share-based payments granted to employees of the 
company’s subsidiaries and the recharge of losses to 
the subsidiaries in connection with the employees’ 
exercise of share-based awards are recognised as 
contributions to and reductions of the investment in 
the subsidiaries respectively.

share capital 
share capital 
at the annual general meeting on 16 march 
2020, it was decided to reduce the share 
capital of carlsberg a/s by a nominal amount 
of dkk 88,000,000 to a nominal amount of 
dkk 2,963,136,120 by cancelling of 
4,400,000 of the b shares of the company, 
each with a nominal value of dkk 20. the 
cancellation was completed on 14 april 2020. 
these shares had been repurchased as part  
of the company’s share buy-back programme 
running from 6 february 2019 to  
30 january 2020.  
dividends 
the proposed dividend of dkk 22.00 per share 
(2019: dkk 21.00 per share), amounting to  
dkk 3,259m (2019: dkk 3,204m), has been 
included in retained earnings at 31 december 
2020. 
 
dividends to be paid out in 2021 for 2020, 
net of dividends on treasury shares held at  
31 december 2020, will amount to dkk 
3,192m. dividends paid out in 2020 for 2019, 
net of dividends on treasury shares, amounted 
to dkk 3,093m (paid out in 2019 for 2018: 
dkk 2,728m). dividends paid out to 
shareholders in carlsberg a/s do not impact

as of 31 january 2020, the company had 
repurchased 393,501 b shares under the share 
buy-back programme initiated in 2019 at a

on 4 february 2020, the company announced 
its intention to continue the share buy-back 
programme to repurchase shares worth dkk 
5bn over a 12-month period. in the first 
tranche, which was finalised on 7 august, the 
company repurchased 2,897,021 b shares at a 
total purchase price of dkk 2.5bn. due to the 
continued uncertainties related to covid-19 
and the acquisitions of marston’s brewing 
activities and the brooklyn brand rights, the 
board decided not to initiate the second 
tranche of the share buy-back.  
 
according to the authorisation of the annual 
general meeting, the supervisory board may, 
in the period until 13 march 2023, allow the 
company to acquire treasury shares up to a 
total holding of 10% of the nominal share  
capital at a price quoted on nasdaq 
copenhagen at the time of acquisition with a 
deviation of up to 10%. the permitted holding 
of treasury shares covers those acquired in 
share buy-back programmes. the company 
holds no class a shares.

accounting estimates 
and judgements 
carlsberg a/s recognises deferred tax assets, 
including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards, if 
management assesses that these tax assets can be 
offset against positive taxable income in the 
foreseeable future. this judgement is made annually 
and based on budgets and business plans for the 
coming years. 
 
 
 
accounting 
policies 
carlsberg a/s is the administration company and is 
subject to the danish rules on mandatory joint 
taxation of the carlsberg group’s danish companies. 
carlsberg a/s accordingly pays all income taxes to 
the tax authorities under the joint taxation scheme.  
 
danish subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation 
from the date when they are included in the 
consolidated financial statements and up to the date 
when they are excluded from the consolidation. the 
jointly taxed danish companies are taxed under the 
on-account tax scheme. 
 
on payment of joint taxation contributions, the 
current danish income tax is allocated between the 
danish jointly taxed companies in proportion to their 
taxable income. companies with tax losses receive 
joint taxation contributions from other companies 
that have used the tax losses to reduce their own 
taxable profit (full absorption). 
 
tax on profit/loss for the year comprises profit/loss 
from real estate partnerships (joint ventures), as these 
are not individually taxed but included in the taxable 
income of the partners. in addition, tax on profit/loss 
and deferred tax are calculated and recognised as 
described in section 6 in the consolidated financial 
statements.

contingent 
liabilities  
and other 
commitments 
carlsberg a/s has issued guarantees to 
subsidiaries for pension obligations of dkk

supply company danmark and various other 
danish subsidiaries, and is jointly and severally 
liable for payment of vat and excise duties. 
 
carlsberg a/s is party to certain lawsuits, 
disputes etc. of various scopes. in 
management’s opinion, apart from items 
recognised in the statement of financial 
position or disclosed in the financial 
statements, the outcome of these lawsuits, 
disputes etc. will not have a material negative 
effect on the company’s financial position. 
 
section 4.8 
events after the

apart from the events recognised or disclosed 
in the financial statements, no events have 
occurred after the reporting date of importance 
to the financial statements. 
 
 
the 2020 financial statements of carlsberg

international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as adopted by the eu and further 
requirements in the danish financial 
statements act. 
 
the financial statements are presented in 
danish kroner (dkk), which is the presentation 
currency. 
 
the accounting policies for the parent 
company are the same as for the group, cf. 
section 9 in the consolidated financial 
statements and the individual sections. 
significant accounting estimates  
and judgements 
in preparing carlsberg a/s’ financial 
statements, management makes various 
accounting estimates and judgements that 
form the basis of presentation, recognition and 
measurement of the company’s assets and 
liabilities.  
 
the estimates and judgements made are based 
on historical experience and other factors that 
management assesses to be reliable, but that 
by their very nature are associated with 
uncertainty and unpredictability. these 
estimates and judgements may therefore prove 
incomplete or incorrect, and unexpected events 
or circumstances may arise. 
 
the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements made and accounting policies 
specific to the parent company are presented 
in the explanatory notes.

report on the audit of the 
financial statements 
 
our opinion 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company financial 
statements (pp [53-121] and [123-136]) give 
a true and fair view of the group’s and the 
parent company’s financial position at 31 
december 2020 and of the results of the 
group’s and the parent company’s operations 
and cash flows for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements in 
the danish financial statements act. 
 
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s 
long-form report to the audit committee and 
the board of directors. 
what we have audited 
the consolidated financial statements and 
parent company financial statements of 
carlsberg a/s for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 comprise income 
statement and statement of comprehensive 
income, statement of financial position, 
statement of changes in equity, statement of 
cash flows and notes, including summary of 
significant accounting policies for the group as 
well as for the parent company.  
 
collectively referred to as the “financial 
statements”. 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) and 
the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. 
 
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. 
 
independence 
we are independent of the group in 
accordance with the international ethics 
standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba 
code) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 
were not provided. 
 
appointment 
we were first appointed auditors of carlsberg 
a/s on 30 march 2017 for the financial year 
2017. we have been reappointed annually by 
shareholder resolution for a total period of 
uninterrupted engagement of four years 
including the financial year 2020. 
 
key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

key audit matter 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill and brands 
 
 
the principal risks are in relation to 
management’s assessment of the 
future timing and amount of cash 
flows that are used to project the 
recoverability of the carrying 
amount of goodwill and brands.  
there are specific risks related to 
macroeconomic conditions and 
volatile earnings caused by 
volume decline, intensified 
competition and changed 
regulations in key markets – 
conditions that could also result in 
management deciding to change 
brand strategy to drive business 
performance. 
 
bearing in mind the generally long-
lived nature of the assets, the 
significant assumptions are 
management’s view of prices, 
volumes, discount rates, growth 
rates, royalty rates, expected useful 
life and costs, and future 
free cash flows as well as the 
judgement in defining cash-
generating units (cgus). 
 
we focused on this, as there is a 
high level of subjectivity exercised by 
management in estimating future 
cash flows and the models 
used are complex. 
 
the key assumptions and  
accounting treatment are described 
in section 2.2 “impairment” in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
 
 
in addressing the risks, we walked through and tested relevant controls related 
to assessing the carrying amount of goodwill and brands. 
 
we considered the appropriateness of management’s defined cgus within the 
business. we evaluated whether there were factors requiring management to 
change its definition. we examined the methodology used by management to 
assess the carrying amount of goodwill and brands assigned to cgus, and the 
process for identifying cgus that require impairment testing to determine 
compliance with ifrs. 
 
we performed detailed testing for the assets where an impairment review was 
required or indications of impairment were identified. for those assets, we 
analysed the reasonableness of significant assumptions in relation to the 
ongoing operation of the assets. 
 
we corroborated estimates of future cash flows and challenged whether they 
are reasonable and supported by the most recent approved management 
budgets, including expected future performance of the cgus, and challenged 
whether these are appropriate in light of future macroeconomic expectations in 
the markets. 
 
we evaluated the assumptions used by management, including assessment of 
price and volume forecasts, discount rates and long-term growth rates, and 
tested the mathematical accuracy of the relevant value-in-use models 
prepared by management. we made use of our internal valuation specialists in 
the audit. further, we assessed the appropriateness of disclosures, including 
sensitivity analyses prepared for the significant assumptions. 
 
key audit matter 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
revenue recognition 
 
recognition of revenue is complex 
due to the variety of different 
revenue streams, ranging from sales 
of goods, royalty income and sales 
of by-products recognised when all 
significant risks and rewards have 
been transferred to the customer or 
in terms of the licence agreement. 
 
furthermore, the various discounts 
and locally imposed duties and fees 
in regard to revenue recognition are 
complex and introduce an inherent 
risk to the revenue recognition 
process. 
 
we focused on this area, as there is 
a risk of non-compliance with 
accounting standards due to 
complexity arising from different 
customer behaviours, structures, 
market conditions and terms in the 
various countries. 
 
revenue recognition and accounting 
treatment are described in section 
1.1 “segmentation of operations –
accounting estimates and 
judgements” in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
 
 
 
our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with the accounting 
standards. 
 
we tested the relevant controls, including applicable information systems and 
management’s monitoring of controls used to ensure the completeness, 
accuracy and timing of revenue recognised. 
 
we discussed the judgements related to the recognition and classification of 
revenue with management. further, we performed substantive procedures 
regarding invoicing, significant contracts, significant transaction streams 
(including discounts), and locally imposed duties and fees and cut-off at year-
end in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied. 
 
we applied data analysis in our testing of revenue transactions in order to 
identify transactions outside the ordinary transaction flow, including journal 
entry testing.

statement on the management review 
management is responsible for management’s 
review, pp [3-52] and [122]. 
 
our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover management’s review, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. 
 
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
management’s review and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review is 
materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
 
moreover, we considered whether 
management’s review includes the disclosures 
required by the danish financial statements 
act. 
 
based on the work we have performed, in our 
view, management’s review is in accordance 
with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in management’s 
review. 
management’s responsibilities for the 
financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act, and for such internal 
control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
in preparing the financial statements,  
management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
 
 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and 
the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also: 
 
• identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
• obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control. 
 
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 
 
• conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. however, future events or 
conditions may cause the group or the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
 
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
 
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. we are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit. we remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion. 
 
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
 
carlsberg group annual report 2020   financial statements 
141 
 
we identify during our audit. 
 
 
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
 
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
we describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication. 
 
 
report on compliance with 
the esef regulation  
as part of our audit of the financial statements 
we performed procedures to express an opinion 
on whether the annual report of carlsberg a/s 
for the financial year 1 january to 31  
december 2020 with the filename carl-
2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the commission 
delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the 
european single electronic format (esef 
regulation), which includes requirements 
related to the preparation of the annual report 
in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
management is responsible for preparing an 
annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation. this responsibility includes: 
• preparing the annual report in xhtml 
format; 
• the selection and application of appropriate 
ixbrl tags, including extensions to the esef 
taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to 
elements in the taxonomy, for all financial 
information required to be tagged, using 
judgement where necessary; 
 
• ensuring consistency between ixbrl-tagged, 
data and the consolidated financial 
statements presented in human-readable 
format; and 
• for such internal control as management 
determines necessary to enable the 
preparation of an annual report that is 
compliant with the esef regulation. 
 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable 
assurance on whether the annual report has 
been prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation based on 
the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a 
report that includes our opinion. the nature, 
timing and extent of procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material 
departures from the requirements set out in the 
esef regulation, whether due to fraud or 
error. the procedures include: 
• testing whether the annual report has been 
prepared in xhtml format; 
• obtaining an understanding of the company’s 
ixbrl tagging process and of internal control 
over the tagging process; 
• evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements; 
• evaluating the appropriateness of the 
company’s use of ixbrl elements selected 
from the esef taxonomy and the creation of 
extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been 
identified; 
• evaluating the use of anchoring of extension 
elements to elements in the esef taxonomy; 
and 
• reconciling the ixbrl-tagged data with the 
audited consolidated financial statements. 
 
in our opinion, the annual report of carlsberg 
a/s for the financial year 1 january to  
31 december 2020 with the file name carl-
2020-12-31.zip has been prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation.
