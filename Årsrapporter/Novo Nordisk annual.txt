letter from the chair
the devastating impact of covid-19 on societies and economies 
in 2020 intensified existing challenges such as inequality and 
poverty. however, in times of crisis, businesses play a critical role 
in mobilising resources and providing solutions. novo nordisk 
has worked hard to respond to the challenges, helping people 
with serious chronic diseases while also supporting society on a 
broader scale.
novo nordisk’s highest priority in 2020 was to 
ensure the safety of our employees and the 
uninterrupted supply of our life-saving medicines 
for patients. we achieved this, while also 
supporting society's response to the pandemic, 
most notably in denmark, where our headquarter 
presence meant we were able to assist the 
government in the rapid scale-up of coronavirus 
testing . at the same time, our scientists continued 
to make significant progress in discovering 
new therapies of the future, while our global 
rising to the 
challenge
commercial organisation embraced an increasingly 
digital new reality.
the world has been through one of the most 
difficult years in recent human history. despite 
the pandemic and the turbulent business 
environment, novo nordisk took important steps 
towards delivering on our purpose of driving 
change to defeat diabetes and other serious 
chronic diseases – a goal we are confident will 
translate into sustainable and profitable growth.

this does not mean that the road ahead is going 
to be easy . the pandemic has exacted an immense 
economic, as well as human, cost on societies 
and it is inevitable that public finances will remain 
fragile for many years. those fiscal constraints 
will put pressure on businesses that work closely 
with governments, including the pharmaceutical 
industry, and we will have to find new ways to 
ensure that our products are accessible to all 
those who need them.
beyond covid-19, two consistent priorities were 
high on the board’s agenda in 2020, namely 
scientific innovation and sustainability – both 
of which are vital to ensure the future of the 
company . it is therefore satisfying to see a healthy 
product pipeline, including the pioneering science 
that we consider to be the biggest contribution we 
can make to society . 
our research is now more broadly focused as we 
look to deliver treatments within therapy areas 
adjacent to our core competencies. specifically, 
this means looking beyond semaglutide, the glp-1 
molecule found in our new oral diabetes treat-
ment rybelsus® and the once-weekly injectable 
ozempic®. we are exploring novel ways to treat 
a range of conditions beyond diabetes, including 
cardiovascular disease – the world’s leading cause 
of death1 – obesity and most recently also as a 
potential treatment for alzheimer’s disease. in 
tandem with this push into new areas, we are also 
establishing more external alliances and partner-
ships to complement our in-house expertise .
above all, 2020 underscored the need for strong cor-
porate values and a shared sense of purpose . we are 
fortunate that both are well-established across our 
organisation, empowering our employees to keep 
delivering for both patients and investors, despite 
the unprecedented disruptions caused by covid-19 .
on behalf of the board of directors i would like to 
offer my thanks to all novo nordisk’s employees 
for their hard work and commitment during the 
exceptional challenges of 2020; to lars fruergaard 
jørgensen and his team for leading the company 
through a turbulent year in such a thoughtful and 
positive manner; and to our shareholders for their 
continued support .
helge lund
chair of the board of directors
it is increasingly clear that society expects more 
from businesses as the world grapples with 
climate change and environmental degradation, as 
well as the need for greater equity in healthcare. 
indeed, the pandemic has turbocharged many of 
these issues, with an effective alliance emerging 
between young people and investors that is 
prompting companies to pay far more attention to 
sustainability .
at novo nordisk, we have been focused on 
sustainability for many years – but we are 
determined to continue to raise our game . 
in the past year we launched a new social 
responsibility strategy, defeat diabetes, and 
initiated programmes within renewable power 
and recycling as part of our circular for zero 
environmental strategy .
employees from the novo nordisk 
research department volunteered 
to contribute to the fight against 
covid-19 and, together with staff from 
the danish health service, they helped 
to increase the testing capacity in 
denmark .
“above all, 2020 underscored 
the need for strong corporate 
values and a shared sense 
of purpose. we are fortunate 
that both are well-established 
across our organisation, 
empowering our employees 
to keep delivering for both 
patients and investors, 
despite the unprecedented 
disruptions caused by 
covid-19.”

letter from the ceo
the covid-19 pandemic has taken a terrible toll around the 
world – but the pain has not been shared equally. people with 
underlying conditions have been hit disproportionately hard 
by the virus, a fact that makes novo nordisk’s purpose of 
driving change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic 
diseases more meaningful than ever.
today, one in 11 people in the world has diabetes 
and if action is not taken to bend the curve, that 
figure is projected to rise to one in nine by 20451 . 
the risk posed by covid-19 to people living with 
diabetes and obesity is a clear wake-up call: we 
must continue to do more to tackle these diseases 
or risk vast future damage to millions of lives, as 
well as to broader societies and economies.
we measure our contribution to the fight against 
diabetes and other serious chronic diseases in our 
strategic aspirations for 2025 . appropriately, after 
a year as unparalleled as 2020, and as the world 
acknowledges the hundredth anniversary of the 
the power of 
purpose
discovery of insulin, the first of these is 'purpose 
and sustainability'. over the past year we have 
stepped up our commitment to our purpose by 
launching a new defeat diabetes social responsi-
bility strategy . this sets out our ambition to accel-
erate the prevention of type 2 diabetes, provide 
access to affordable care for vulnerable patients in 
every country and innovate to improve lives .
beyond defeating serious chronic diseases, we 
also aspire to have zero environmental impact .
in 2020, we took an important step by achieving 
our target of using 100% renewable power across 
global production – a key milestone on the road 
to our target of zero co2 emissions from all 
operations and transport by 2030 .

we now also ask that by the end of the decade, 
our direct suppliers use only renewable power 
when supplying us. it has been great to see some 
of our largest suppliers step up and meet this 
target already .
despite this encouraging progress, we can 
only fulfil our purpose and be respected for 
adding value to society if we deliver on our core 
contribution of scientific innovation. thanks to 
a strategy of targeted investment, our scientists 
are currently pursuing higher levels of innovation 
across more therapy areas than at any point in 
the company’s history. consequently, i believe we 
are now well-positioned for success in the short, 
medium and long term .
within diabetes, we are further raising the in-
novation bar with the roll-out of the world’s first 
once-daily glp-1 tablet, rybelsus®, while at the 
same time working on novel insulins, 100 years 
after the discovery of the molecule . our research 
& development (r&d) colleagues are also pursu-
ing greater weight loss in obesity, and in 2020 they 
demonstrated the potential of semaglutide 2 .4 mg 
in the step phase 3 clinical trial programme .
crucially, we also broadened our technology 
platforms and expanded our research into 
adjacent disease areas in 2020 including 
cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (nash) and alzheimer’s disease 
– areas of huge unmet medical need and a great 
burden for patients, families and society alike .
our continued focus on external innovation 
led to the significant acquisitions of corvidia 
therapeutics and emisphere technologies, 
strengthening our positions in cutting-edge areas 
of cardiovascular medicine and drug delivery 
respectively .
commercially, 2020 was a challenging year as 
lockdowns reduced the time doctors spent with 
their patients, leading to fewer initiations of 
new treatments. despite this, we expanded our 
leadership position in the diabetes market in terms 
of value, keeping us on track to reach a share 
of more than one third by 2025 . diabetes sales 
were driven by sales of glp-1 products (victoza®, 
ozempic® and rybelsus®), which offset mixed 
market conditions for insulins . we continued to 
help more people living with obesity, while making 
progress with our ambition to secure sustained 
growth within our biopharm division thanks to 
strong demand for our growth hormone and new 
haemophilia products .
i believe that our ability to meet the needs of our 
millions of patients during the pandemic in 2020 
comes as a consequence of our crystal-clear 
purpose and long-established company values . we 
are far from done and have many more millions 
of patients for whom treatment is not accessible 
today. so now is the time to continue to invest in 
our people and in our organisation, creating an 
inclusive, diverse and safe working environment 
in which colleagues have equal opportunities to 
thrive and fulfil their potential.
looking to the future, i am confident that our clear 
corporate strategy will make us a valued partner to 
society as the world continues on the long road to 
recovery from the pandemic .
in closing, i would like to thank my colleagues 
around the world for their agility and commitment 
during this most challenging of years . special thanks 
must go to our partners and collaborators, without 
whom we could not succeed. a sincere thank you 
goes to our board of directors for their continued 
support and constructive challenging of the organ-
isation. finally, i would like to send a thank you to 
our shareholders for their continuous support .

purpose and sustainability
adding value to society 
and to our future 
business
demands on companies are changing fast as the world is faced with 
extraordinary challenges. threats like the covid-19 pandemic and 
climate change mean that 'business as usual' is no longer an option. 
the stakes are high and we are determined to be a sustainable 
business by adding value to society and to our future business.
the rapid outbreak of covid-19 during 2020 put 
the potential vulnerability of people living with 
diseases, including diabetes and obesity, firmly in 
the spotlight . at the same time, climate change 
remains an urgent challenge . these challenges call 
for corporations to step up and take a leading role 
in delivering and adopting solutions .
in 2020 we addressed these challenges by 
increasing access to our medicines across the 
world, pursuing zero environmental impact, and 
taking steps towards creating a more sustainable 
and inclusive workplace.
responding to covid-19
during 2020, covid-19 led to a cascade of critical 
needs around the world and we used our exper-
tise, resources and global reach to contribute to 
the response. our highest priority was to ensure 
the safety of our employees and the uninterrupted 
supply of life-saving medicines for our patients . in 
addition, we focused our resources on donations 
towards global relief efforts and activated our re-
search and development organisation to perform 
covid-19 testing following a request for support 
from the danish government .
leading a sustainable business
our purpose is to drive change to defeat 
diabetes and other serious chronic diseases . 
to maximise our positive impact, we must offer 
solutions beyond providing medicines to help 
tackle the global societal challenges of growth 
in non-communicable diseases, lack of access to 
affordable care and the impacts of climate change. 
we are committed to being a sustainable business . 
to us, this means that we add value to society and 
to our future business . to achieve this ambition, 
we do business in a financially, environmentally 
and socially responsible way, as reflected in our 
articles of association and the novo nordisk way . 
this approach is integrated into every aspect of 
our decision-making, in strategies and actions, 
always keeping in mind what is best in the long 
term for the patients we serve, our shareholders, 
our employees, the communities in which we are 
present and the global society we are part of.   
with that, we lead towards our strategic 
aspirations within purpose and sustainability. 
this is what esg – environmental, social and 
governance – means to us .

and in the consolidated esg statement .

purpose and sustainability 
our 
environmental 
responsibility
to get there, we are adopting a circular mindset, 
designing products that can be re-used or 
recycled, reshaping our business practice to 
minimise consumption and eliminate waste, and 
working with suppliers who share our ambition. 
we call our environmental strategy circular for 
zero and we measure our progress based on use 
of resources, emissions and waste. the circular 
for zero strategy incorporates our entire value 
chain and is based on three pillars: circular supply, 
circular company and circular products .
circular supply
as part of our ambition to switch to circular 
sourcing and procurement, we collaborate with 
our environmental strategy, 
circular for zero and 2030 
ambitions
circular supply:
proactive collaboration with suppliers 
to embed circular thinking for reduced 
environmental impact across the value 
chain and move towards circular 
sourcing and procurement
circular products: 
upgrade existing and design new products 
based on circular principles and solve the 
end-of-life product waste challenge to  
close the resource loop
circular company:
eliminate environmental footprint from 
operations and drive a circular transition 
across the company aiming for zero 
environmental impact
each year, billions of novo nordisk tablets, 
vials and injection pens are distributed to 
patients and demand for them is growing. 
this puts us in the front line of some 
of the most challenging environmental 
issues including climate change, water 
and resource scarcity, pollution and plastic 
waste. our ambition is bold and simple: to 
have zero environmental impact.
suppliers to encourage them to shift to sustainably 
sourced materials, thus reducing our environmen-
tal impact. in 2020 we set an ambitious target that 
all our direct suppliers should source 100% renew-
able power by 2030 when supplying us. to achieve 
this, we will work with our suppliers to help them 
in this transition to renewable power. successful 
conversion among our 60,000 suppliers would 
result in around 300,000 tonnes of co2 being elim-
inated from our direct suppliers each year .
circular company
we work to reduce our environmental 
impact across all areas of our operations and 
transportation . in 2020, total co2 emissions across 
our operations and transportation were 170,000 
tonnes of co2, representing a 44% decrease from 
2019, due primarily to the implementation of 
renewable energy projects and impacts on travel 
from covid-19 .
co2 emissions from operations includes all 
production facilities, global office buildings 
and laboratories . in 2020, co2 emissions from 
production were 37,000 tonnes co2, a reduction 
of 57% versus 2019, primarily due to the 
implementation of various renewable energy 
initiatives . these projects include implementation 
of renewable heat and steam in kalundborg, 
wind power in france, algeria and russia, and 
solar power in the us. co2 emissions from office 
buildings and laboratories were 8,000 tonnes co2, 
a decrease of 38% versus 2019, due primarily to 
energy-saving projects and covid-19 shut-downs.
due to covid-19, co2 emissions from business 
flights were reduced to 19,000 tonnes co2, a 
reduction of 71% compared with 2019. during 
2021, we will focus on ensuring that emissions 
from business travel are minimised through 
the promotion of virtual collaboration with both 
colleagues and stakeholders . co2 emissions from 
our company cars in 2020 were 45,000 tonnes 
co2, 27% lower than in 2019, primarily due to 
fewer in-person meetings and less travel as a 
result of covid-19 . novo nordisk is a member 
of ev100 and has committed to transitioning to 
100% electric company cars by 2030 . in 2020, 
co2 emissions from product distribution were 
61,000 tonnes co2, a decrease of 24% compared 
with 2019, due to optimisation projects to move 
products shipped from air to sea freight . 
at the beginning of the year, we achieved our ambi-
tion of sourcing 100% renewable power in our glob-
al production when a new solar facility went online 
horns rev 3 wind farm, north sea, is one of the locations from 
which we receive renewable power

powering our entire us operations. in the process, 
we became the first pharmaceutical company in the 
renewable power initiative, re100, to do this.
in 2020, the energy consumption for our opera-
tions was 3,191,000 gj, an increase of 7% com-
pared with 2019, primarily due to a new produc-
tion site in north carolina . energy-saving projects 
implemented in 2020 within production sites are 
expected to result in annual savings of 94,000 gj .
water consumption at production sites was 
3,368,000 cubic meters, an increase of 7% compared 
with 2019 due to the new production site in north 
carolina . four production sites including china and 
brazil are in areas subject to water stress or high 
seasonal variations . these sites accounted for 11% 
of the total water consumption in 2020, and water 
consumption at these sites decreased by 15% in 
2020, despite adding new production sites. we will 
continue to focus on reducing water consumption 
across these sites .
we are committed to reducing waste and have a 
target of sending zero production waste to landfill 
by 2030 . in 2020, production sites had a total 
of 141,000 tonnes of waste, an increase of 14% 
compared with 2019. this increase was due to 
increased production in kalundborg .
93% of waste arising from our production was 
recycled, converted to biogas or incinerated in 
waste-to-energy plants. during 2020 less than 1% 
(1,000 tonnes) of our waste was sent to landfill.

circular products
we are working to ensure existing and new 
products are fit for circularity and have developed 
a circular design guideline within r&d to reduce 
the environmental footprint of our devices .
as part of circular for zero, we are seeking to 
address the end-of-life challenges associated 
with many of our medical devices. in late 2020, 
we initiated a pilot take-back scheme for medical 
devices in denmark with the aim of scaling globally 
in the future . through recycling our production 
waste, we have been able to successfully 
recycle insulin pens, providing materials for the 
manufacture of lamps and office furniture. we 
are pursuing greater re-use and recycling of our 
devices and aspire to achieve this in coming years .
“the danish association of pharmacies is 
very excited to be part of this important 
take-back project aiming to reduce the 
environmental impact from used insulin 
pens, which consist of valuable materials 
suitable for recycling. by recycling we avoid 
the negative climate impact from burning 
the material as normal waste.” 
– birthe søndergaard, danish association of pharmacies

purpose and sustainability
our social 
responsibility
at novo nordisk, it is our ambition to be 
respected for adding value to society. we 
aim to achieve this by adding value to the 
communities we are part of, delivering 
innovative solutions to patients, and by 
offering an inclusive, diverse, safe and 
ethical workplace.
today, one in every 11 people in the world is living 
with diabetes, a figure that is projected to rise to 
one in nine by 2045 if action is not taken1 . diabetes 
places a great burden on health systems, and we 
are committed to working with health authorities 
and other partners to prevent and treat the 
disease. in 2020 we launched a long-term social 
responsibility strategy, defeat diabetes, to help 
society rise to one of its biggest challenges . we 
recognise that we cannot defeat diabetes alone, 
but we can accelerate our actions to find solutions.
innovation
our key contribution is to discover and develop 
innovative biological medicines and make them 
accessible to patients throughout the world. 
in 2020, we reached an estimated total of 32.8 
million patients with our diabetes care products, 
up 9% from 2019 .
read more in the section on innovation and 
therapeutic focus .
access and affordability
we recognise that affordability of medicines can 
be a challenge and we know that some people 
in the us living with diabetes are increasingly 
finding it hard to pay for their healthcare, including 
our diabetes medicines . ensuring access and 
affordability is a responsibility we share with all 
involved in healthcare. during 2020, we continued 
our efforts to help patients in the us struggling to 
afford their novo nordisk insulins through a range 
of options, including:
–  follow-on brands: unbranded biologic versions 
of fast-acting (novolog®) and premix insulin 
(novolog® mix) at a 50% list price discount 
versus branded versions
–  my$99insulin: 30-day supply of a combination of 
novo nordisk insulin products (up to three vials 
or two packs of pens) for 99 usd for eligible 
patients
–  patient assistance program: free diabetes 
medication to people in need who meet certain 
eligibility criteria, including annual household 
income at or below 400% of government-
defined poverty level. programme expanded 
during covid-19
–  human insulin: for about 25 usd per vial at 
national pharmacies, including walmart and cvs
–  immediate supply program: a free, one-time, 
immediate supply of novo nordisk insulin (up to 
3 vials or 2 packs of pens) to eligible patients at 
risk of rationing
–  co-pay savings cards: to help defray high 
out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured 
patients .
during 2020, we reached more than one million 
people through affordability offerings in the us.
we also recognise that there are vulnerable 
patients in every country and to identify these 
groups we will initiate vulnerability assessments 
where we operate, excluding the us where we 
have already expanded our affordability offerings. 
we do this to identify how we can improve access 
to affordable care and capacity building. based on 
21 country assessments made in 2020, we have 
developed affordability plans in 19 countries.
vulnerable patient groups include people impact-
ed by humanitarian crises, people living in remote 
areas or in poorer parts of the world with ineffi-
cient healthcare systems and vulnerable popula-
tion groups, such as children and the elderly .
in 2020, we strengthened our access to insulin 
commitment by lowering the ceiling price (the 
maximum price within the commitment) from usd 
4 to usd 3 per human insulin vial in 76 countries . 
this covers least developed countries as defined

health coverage, as well as selected humanitarian 
organisations .
an estimated 3.2 million people were treated 
with insulin under this commitment in 2020. in 
2020, the average price of insulin sold under this 
commitment was 2.9 usd per vial, corresponding 
to 11 .6 cents per patient per day . beyond this 
commitment, we sold human insulin at or below 
the ceiling price in other countries, reaching an 
estimated another 3 .1 million people during 
2020 . our access to insulin commitment is only 
one element and it cannot stand alone . supply 
chain improvements and capacity building are 
also important in our efforts to provide access to 
affordable care to vulnerable patients. 
read more about our access to insulin 
commitment on novonordisk .com .
to further improve capacity building we extended 
our partnering for change partnership with 
the international committee of the red cross 
(icrc) and the danish red cross (drc), aimed 
at improving care for people living with chronic 
diseases in humanitarian crises and we launched 
an ambition that no child should die from type 
1 diabetes. to achieve this, we expanded our 
changing diabetes in children programme with 
the aim of reaching 100,000 children by 2030 . 
in 2020, we enrolled 2,601 additional children. 
in total, 469 healthcare professionals have been 
trained, 222 clinics established and 28,296 children 
across 14 countries have received care as part of 
the programme since 2009 .
prevention
in addition to the impact on patient lives,  diabetes 
also constitutes one of the biggest societal chal-
lenges. to help society rise to this challenge, we 
focus our efforts within diabetes and obesity pre-
vention where our expertise has the biggest impact. 
our aim is to find, pilot and scale effective interven-
tions to prevent diabetes and obesity, starting with 
early interventions and health inequalities in cities . 
within early interventions, our collaboration with 
unicef to prevent childhood overweight and 
obesity in mexico and colombia is progressing 
despite covid-19, and global advocacy on 
childhood malnutrition continues . 
within health inequality in cities, we have a public-
private partnership, cities changing diabetes, 
which aims to address diabetes prevention and 
treatment amongst vulnerable populations in 
urban settings . in 2020, cities changing diabetes 
reached 36 cities, up from 25 in 2019, spanning 
five continents and more than a hundred local 
partners across the public and private sectors .
donations and other contributions
during 2020 we increased our donations, partly to 
respond to covid-19. selected donations include:
– 165 dkk million to the antimicrobial resistance 
research (amr) action fund, the largest 
collective fund ever established to support vital 
research into antimicrobial resistance research 
and development1
–  138 dkk million to the world diabetes 
foundation (wdf), including a special one-off 
contribution of 50 dkk million in 2020
–  20 dkk million to the novo nordisk haemophilia 
foundation
helping society respond to covid-19
since the outbreak of covid-19, additional efforts 
have been focused on helping society .
in denmark, where we are headquartered, we 
supported the danish healthcare system in 
increasing national testing capacity and developed 
a covid-19 antibody test which is being used by 
the university of copenhagen to study the virus .
we offered free insulin for six months to the hu-
manitarian organisations that we normally supply, 
including unrwa and the red cross organisa-
tions, to support relief efforts in humanitarian 
settings in low- and middle-income countries.
employees
we aim to be an attractive employer that offers 
an inclusive, diverse, safe and ethical working 
environment in which all employees have equal 
opportunities to realise their potential .
at the end of 2020, the total number of 
people employed in novo nordisk was 45,323,

corresponding to 44,723 full-time positions, which 
is a 5% increase compared with 2019. the growth 
was mainly driven by international operations. 
diversity and inclusion
to deliver on our strategic aspirations it is crucial 
to have an inclusive and diverse organisation at 
all levels, including our board of directors . we 
fundamentally believe that diversity of people and 
inclusive leadership drive value for novo nordisk .
one element of our diversity and inclusion 
aspiration is to achieve a balanced gender 
representation at all managerial levels . while 
several initiatives have been launched to 
accelerate diversity and inclusion and drive gender 
balance, there has only been gradual change and 
we still have room for improvement. the gender 
distribution amongst managers in 2020 was 59% 
men and 41% women, compared with 40% women 
in 2019 . in senior management1 76% were men 
and 24% were women in 2020, compared with 
18% women in 2019. in our board of directors 
62% were men and 38% women. 
to accelerate diversity and inclusion and ensure 
accountability for driving progress, all levels 
throughout the organisation have implemented 
local action plans during 2020 . in addition, in 
2020 diversity and inclusion has been anchored in 
both short- and long-term incentive programmes . 
the strong stance on diversity and inclusion 
will continue in 2021 with a focus on realising 
continuous progress from the local action plans .
human rights and labour 
we are committed to fulfilling our responsibility 
to respect human rights, including labour rights 
across all our activities and business relationships 
as a minimum standard of business conduct . 
read more about our human rights commitment 
on novonordisk .com . 
since 2014, we have been a part of the living wage 
programme with an external global non-profit 
business network and consultancy. the objective is 
to ensure that all our employees are paid a living 
wage, i.e. adequate to purchase basic goods and 
services necessary to achieve a basic standard of 
living, based on calculations of living wages in the 
countries we operate in. in 2020 we analysed data 
for 74 countries compared with 12 countries in 
2019, and as a result of this analysis an action plan 
has been implemented .
read more about our global labour code of 
conduct for labour rights on novonordisk .com .
progress was made in regard to management of 
salient human rights issues beyond those already 
addressed by existing global standards and 
programmes . in 2020, manager and employee 
human rights training strengthened awareness of 
these issues, while the training scope covered all 
human rights and all company operations . in 2020, 
for patient safety and the right to health, we strove 
to increase the share of affiliates providing safety 
reporting on local websites to more than 96%. for 
availability and affordability aspects of the right to 
health, see progress above . 
to mitigate risks of exploitation of human 
biosamples used in pre-clinical research and 
ensure respect for donors’ rights to free 
and informed consent, we implemented a 
strengthened risk-based due diligence process . 
for local manufacturing projects, we implemented 
enhanced human rights due diligence 
requirements for all new high-risk business 
partners. for supply chains, we strengthened 
the human rights focus of our supplier audits, 
by updating the auditor toolbox and conducting 
training with an external expert organisation. 
read more about our due diligence on modern 
slavery risks on novonordisk .com .
health and safety and accident reporting
safety behaviour is part of our company values . in 
2020, the average frequency rate of occupational 
accidents involving absence was 1.3 per million 
working hours, compared with 2.2 in 2019. in

purpose and sustainability
governing 
sustainable 
business
in novo nordisk, sustainability 
considerations are integrated into our 
business, decision-making and governance 
structures. we strive to conduct our 
business in a responsible manner, in 
accordance with the novo nordisk way – a 
set of guiding principles which underpins 
every decision we make.
novo nordisk way
the novo nordisk way is a set of guiding principles 
which underpins every decision we make. we 
use a unique, systematic approach known as 
facilitation to ensure that everyone lives up to 
the novo nordisk way . in 2020, 26 facilitations 
were conducted, down from 32 in 2019 due 
to covid-19 travel restrictions . any issues are 
addressed locally, and consolidated insights are 
shared with executive management and the board 
of directors . the novo nordisk way also underpins 
our performance management and incentive 
programmes . 
the novo nordisk way states that we treat 
everyone with respect, meaning there is no 
acceptance of discrimination nor harassment . 
we have processes in place to encourage the 
reporting of any discrimination, harassment or 
retaliation, including an anonymous reporting 
hotline . we encourage all managers and 
employees to have an open dialogue on the 
matter .
company trust
the level of trust in novo nordisk among key 
stakeholders – people with diabetes, general 
practitioners and diabetes specialists – is an 
indicator of the extent to which we are living up to 
stakeholders’ expectations. 
our trust score, measured on a scale of 0-100, 
increased to 80 .6 in 2020 from 78 .2 in 2019 . the 
increase was the most significant improvement 
in a trust score in the pharmaceutical industry in 
2020 .
business ethics 
our approach to business ethics is about acting 
with integrity and in compliance with the novo 
nordisk way, our business ethics code of 
conduct and international and local standards 
for responsible business conduct . business 
ethics covers anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
data protection and human rights with the aim 
of minimising any potential risks to our business, 
people and society . 
annual training in business ethics is mandatory 
for all employees, including all new hires. in 2020, 
99% of employees completed and documented 
their training, with the remaining 1% missing 
mainly due to employees being on leave . in 2020, 
32 business ethics reviews were completed with 
107 findings, compared with 34 reviews with 
87 findings in 2019. consolidated findings are 
reported to our executive management and the 
audit committee . 
during covid-19, all audits outside denmark 
were conducted virtually. despite the changed 
approach for 2020, group internal audit assesses 
that the level of business ethics compliance is 
sound . management action plans and closure of 
findings progressed as planned, and there were 
no overdue management actions or findings at the 
end of the year . 
in 2020, we started developing data ethics 
principles and will implement these principles to 
ensure responsible and sustainable use of data . 
furthermore, data protection and human rights 
risks were integrated into the global business 
ethics risk reporting process in 2020 .
product quality and supplier audits
in 2020, as in 2019, there were no failed inspec-
tions among those resolved at year-end . during 
the year, 77 inspections were conducted, com-
pared with 66 in 2019. at year-end, 59 inspections 
were passed and 18 were unresolved, as final 
inspection reports had not been received or the

in 2020, a total of 177 supplier audits were 
conducted to assess compliance levels with our 
supplier standards. one critical finding was issued 
related to quality audits regarding handling of 
controlled waste. a follow-up audit has since been 
conducted, where the finding was found to have 
been closed satisfactorily .
in 2020, we had no product recalls from the 
market, compared with four in 2019.
corporate governance
as a foundation-owned company, being a 
sustainable business is integrated into our 
ownership structure. our foundation ownership 
supports the overarching imperative to be both 
commercially successful and responsive to the 
wider needs of society. the fact that we have 
a combination of foundation ownerships and 
stock listing enables us to embark on long-
term strategies while maintaining short-term 
transparency on performance .
the objective of the novo nordisk foundation is 
to provide a stable basis for the commercial and 
research activities of novo nordisk and support 
broader scientific, humanitarian and social 
purposes .
in addition to managing our business, our 
governing bodies set direction and ensure 
that sustainability is implemented in business 
decisions. in line with that, two consistent priorities 
were high on the board’s agenda in 2020, namely 
scientific innovation and sustainability – both of 
which are vital to the future of the company.

the corporate governance section of this report .
remuneration 
the variable remuneration of executives is 
designed to promote performance in line with the 
company’s strategy, purpose and ambition to be a 
sustainable business .
read more about the remuneration of our 
executives in the corporate governance section 
of this report .
sustainable tax approach
our overall guiding principle within tax is to have a 
sustainable tax approach (tax policy), emphasising 
our commercial approach to managing the impact 
of taxes while remaining true to our values of 
operating our business in a responsible and 
transparent manner. this means that we pay 
tax where value is generated and are always 
respecting international and domestic tax rules . 
as a global business, we conduct cross-border 
trading, which is subject to transfer pricing reg-
ulations . we apply a 'principal structure' in line 
with oecd principles, meaning all legal entities 
perform their functions on contract on behalf of 
the principals and are allocated an activity-based 
profit according to a benchmarked profit mar-
gin . the tax outcome of this operational model 
is reflected in the overview below, which shows 
our corporate income taxes by region . to ensure 
alignment between taxing authorities about the 
allocation of profit between our entities, we have 
advance pricing agreements in place for geogra-
phies representing more than 65% of our revenue 
worldwide.
our sustainable tax approach has been approved 
by the board of directors . read more about our 
sustainable tax approach on novonordisk .com .
in addition to corporate income taxes, we also pay 
other taxes . please refer to 'total tax contribution' 
in the esg statement .

financial and esg assurance
our financial reporting and the internal controls 
of financial reporting processes are audited by 
an independent audit firm elected at the annual 
general meeting . as part of our esg responsibility, 
we voluntarily include an assurance report from 
an independent external auditor for esg report-
ing in the annual report . the assurance provider 
reviews whether the esg performance information 
covers aspects that are deemed to be material 
and verifies the internal control processes for the 
information reported .
our internal audit function provides independent and 
objective assurance, primarily within internal control 
of financial processes, it security and business ethics. 
to ensure that the internal financial audit function 
operates independently of executive management, 
its charter, audit plan and budget are approved by 
the audit committee . the audit committee must ap-
prove the appointment, remuneration and dismissal 
of the head of the internal audit function .
read more about our corporate governance in 
the corporate governance section of this report .
materiality
we have a robust materiality process in place 
where material issues are determined and 
reassessed on an annual basis by management .
the three most material risk factors that can 
impact our ability to create value over time are 
defined by management as: 
–  product quality and patient safety
–  progress in the r&d pipeline and regulatory 
approval 
–  pricing and market access environment
read more in the risk management section of 
this report .
sustainability standards and performance
we strive to report on our esg performance in 
accordance with relevant disclosure standards.
one of these is the taskforce on climate-related 
financial disclosures (tcfd). here we take a 
stepwise approach to incorporate material climate-
related disclosures into our annual report . a 
summary of how we address the risks related to 
climate change can be found at our website and 
in our cdp disclosure report . as recommended 
by tcfd, we are integrating climate change 
scenarios of 2⁰c, consistent with meeting the paris 
agreement goal (representative concentration 
pathway ‘rcp 2.6’) and 4⁰c as an alternative high 
emission (rcp 8 .5) rcp to identify short-, medium- 
and long-term risks within our production and 
supply chain to ensure a steady supply of medicine 
to patients .
we strive to adhere to the disclosures of the social 
accountability standards board (sasb) which 
apply to our industry . we do this to demonstrate 
our commitment to being transparent and 
accountable for how we operate. we are fully or 
partially aligned to 20 of 25 metrics. in 2021 we 
will further assess our adherence and disclosure.
for the united nations sustainable development 
goals (sdgs), we focus our efforts on goal 3, 
'health' and goal 12, 'responsible consumption 
and production', as this is where we believe we can 
maximise our positive impact on the sdgs .

innovation and therapeutic focus
prioritising a pipeline 
of hope for serious 
chronic diseases
for almost a century, novo nordisk has 
pioneered scientific breakthroughs within 
serious chronic diseases. to ensure that we 
continue to deliver value to society, we are 
pursuing even higher levels of innovation, 
across more therapy areas and technology 
platforms and with more patients and 
partners than at any point in our history.
discovering ways to treat serious chronic diseases 
has never been more important . the covid-19 
pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of 
hundreds of millions of people with diabetes, 
obesity and other serious chronic diseases, 
underlining the urgency of addressing their unmet 
medical needs .
we are rising to the challenge by building on a 
successful track record in diabetes to pursue 
innovative approaches to fighting obesity 
and other serious chronic diseases, as well 
as expanding our therapy area focus . these 
approaches will rely not only on our cutting-edge 
protein and peptide engineering, but on novel 
technology platforms including oral delivery of 
biologics, stem cells, rna interference (rnai) and 
gene editing to further advance our innovative 
pipeline for long-term success .
shifting gears for future growth
our research & development (r&d) strategy is 
driven by targeted investment in novel products 
and technology platforms, resulting in higher 
levels of innovation across more therapy areas 
and with more external partners than at any point 
in our near 100-year history . in an increasingly 
competitive biopharmaceutical industry, this 
gear-shift is imperative to ensure that we retain 
a leading scientific position in the disruptive 
innovations that are set to transform medicine in 
the 21st century .
over the past decade, on average we have 
developed one novel product each year and our 
business has grown strongly. to secure future 
growth platforms, we expect to increase our r&d 
investments in near- and mid-term opportunities . 
by building on our core capabilities including 
our clinical trial expertise, large scale protein 
manufacturing base and commercial excellence, 
we strive to enable more products to be launched 
in future years .
in 2020 we had more than 43,500 patients partici-
pating in our clinical phase one to four trials – more 
than at any point in our history . and, despite the 
disruption caused to society and healthcare sys-
tems by covid-19, we safely maintained continuity 
of key clinical trials through remote monitoring of 
patients and by distributing trial products directly 
to them rather than via study sites where possible.
significant regulatory milestones in the past year 
included european and japanese approvals for 
rybelsus® – the first commercially available glp-1 
based medicine in a tablet – strengthening our 
leadership position in diabetes . the once-daily 
treatment represents a major technological 
advance for people living with type 2 diabetes and 
is now available in nine markets.
2025 strategic aspirations

raising the bar in diabetes research
with the number of people living with diabetes 
projected to increase from 463 million today to 
700 million in 20451, there remains an urgent 
need to find innovative and more convenient 
treatments . this includes novel forms of insulin, a 
molecule discovered 100 years ago in 1921 . one 
such candidate is insulin icodec, which during 
2020 was seen to be effective and well-tolerated 
in phase 2 trials. this once-weekly insulin might 
one day offer patients far fewer injections than 
the current option of once- or twice-daily basal 
insulins . 
within glp-1s we are building on our legacy by 
developing mono- and combination therapies that 
deliver higher efficacy and improved outcomes by 
demonstrating benefits on diabetes comorbidities. 
however, our efforts within diabetes research do 
not stop there. in late 2020, we initiated a phase 1 
trial to establish the safety of a glucose-sensitive 
insulin candidate . we hope that such a treatment 
might one day mimic the body’s own, naturally oc-
curring insulin by sensing and responding to blood 
sugar levels in the body . furthermore, together 
with massachusetts institute of technology, we are 
continuing to progress the development of sys-
tems enabling the oral delivery of macromolecules, 
including the tortoise shell-inspired, self-orienting 
oral device 'soma', with the ultimate ambition of 
one day delivering insulin in a tablet .
shaping the future of obesity treatment
we are also playing a leading role in discover-
ing new treatments for obesity, which is still not 
universally recognised as a serious chronic and 
progressive disease . this is despite the fact that 
people with obesity face a range of other health 
risks, from cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart 
disease to severe illness or complications from 
covid-19. among significant progress made in the 
past year was the phase 3 clinical trial programme 
step (semaglutide treatment effect in people with 
obesity), in which our glp-1 once weekly injectable 
semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated average weight 
loss of 17%-18% over 68 weeks in subjects with 
obesity without diabetes, when using a trial prod-
uct estimand (15%-17% weight loss reported when 
using a treatment policy estimand) . by leveraging 
glp-1 semaglutide treatment we hope to maxim-
ise the ability of people with obesity to achieve and 
maintain substantial weight loss. our aspiration is 
to close the gap between current pharmacological 
treatment options and bariatric surgery by using 
combination therapies based on our peptide 
innovation .
semaglutide – also the active ingredient in ry-
belsus® and ozempic® – exemplifies an important 
trend in medicine in the form of a more holistic 
approach to cardiometabolic diseases . the close 
association between type 2 diabetes, obesity, 
cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) means that 
the classical siloed approach to treating disease 
symptoms one by one is breaking down and that a 
molecule like semaglutide can potentially target a 
number of different therapeutic areas.
other serious chronic diseases
as a result, semaglutide is becoming a pipeline of 
opportunities within a single molecule. in addition 
to the results seen with semaglutide in diabetes 
and obesity, a recent phase 2 trial involving 
patients with nash showed that treatment with 
semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher 
percentage of patients achieving nash resolution 
compared to placebo and could potentially play 
a key role in preventing disease progression . 
furthermore, early-stage research supports 
investigating semaglutide as treatment for early 
alzheimer's disease . a pivotal phase 3 programme 
with oral semaglutide will be initiated in the first 
half of 2021. but, while such a molecule is every 
scientist's dream, our long-term innovation for the 
benefit of patients must go beyond semaglutide.
it is with this ambition that we are branching 
into areas of medicine that build upon our 
core capabilities . in cardiovascular therapy, this 
includes several approaches, including an anti-
il6 monoclonal antibody and a pcsk9 peptide-
based inhibitor, the latter of which would provide 
an alternative to existing forms of powerful 
cholesterol-lowering therapy. this molecule has 
just completed phase 1 studies .

harnessing external innovation
the acquisition in 2020 of us-based biotech 
company corvidia therapeutics further 
strengthens our pipeline by introducing the 
anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody, ziltivekimab, 
which has shown encouraging results in phase 
2 on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic 
kidney disease .
strategic investments of this nature reflect 
our ambition to establish a leading presence 
in new adjacent therapy areas – just as we 
do within diabetes, obesity, haemophilia and 
growth disorders. during 2020, we also acquired 
emisphere technologies, and with it proprietary 
technologies that enable the oral formulation 
of therapeutics – including the eligen® snac 
technology found in rybelsus® .
by continuing to work with a growing number 
of external partners and investing in novel 
technology platforms – including stem cell 
research, rna-interfering (rnai) therapeutics and 
gene editing – we aim to deliver innovation across 
a broader range of serious chronic diseases than 
ever before . these technologies are revolutionising 
what is possible in medicine and they will power 
the disruptive innovations of the future .
progressing the biopharm pipeline
external innovation is also playing an important 
role in the evolution of our biopharm business, a 
speciality care unit that encompasses treatments 
for rare blood and rare endocrine disorders, 
where unmet need remains high. our pipeline 
includes mim8 – a next generation treatment for 
haemophilia a, concizumab for the treatment of 
haemophilia a or b and once-weekly somapacitan 
for growth-related disorders. however, we are 
also collaborating with bluebird bio, which is 
pioneering the development of next-generation 
in vivo genome editing treatments for genetic 
diseases, including haemophilia .
looking to the future
our investment in stem cell-based, regenerative 
therapies lays the foundation for additional 
expansion into new areas such as parkinson’s 
disease, dry age-related macular degeneration 
and chronic heart failure . not to mention stem 
cell-based therapies potentially offering a path 
to curing type 1 diabetes – an aspiration at the 
heart of our purpose to defeat diabetes and other 
serious chronic diseases .
one thing common to our entire innovation 
strategy is a drive to maximise the potential of 
data and digital technology – spaces that we 
invested in throughout 2020 via recruitment and 
external collaboration . it is increasingly clear 
that excellence in digital science, just as much 
as expertise in biology, will be vital for success 
in biopharmaceutical r&d in the 21st century, as 
advances in analytics and real-world evidence 
move data-driven discovery to centre-stage in the 
hunt for new medicines.

commercial 
execution
–   strengthen diabetes

global value market share 
of 1/3
–   strengthen obesity 
leadership and double 
2019 reported sales
–   secure a sustained growth 
outlook for biopharm
commercial execution
delivering innovation 
to patients in the face 
of a pandemic
around the world, the number of people 
living with diabetes and other serious 
chronic diseases is growing fast and the 
need to supply improved treatments 
is critical. but ensuring that life-saving 
medicines reach all those who require them 
– from stockholm to shanghai and new 
york to nigeria – has demanded new ways 
of doing business in 2020 as the covid-19 
pandemic has disrupted societies and 
economies.
despite the challenging backdrop provided by 
the covid-19 pandemic, our commercial teams 
around the world have remained committed to 
delivering innovation to patients . by harnessing 
the power of digital technologies, they have 
shown it is possible to continue to grow market 
share and execute on key new product launches, 
while meeting the needs of our patients and 
customers . this includes the successful roll-out of 
rybelsus®, our glp-1 based medicine in a tablet . 
as a result, we remain on track to reach our goal 
of a global diabetes value market share of more 
than one third by 2025, after expanding our value 
market share by 0 .7 percentage points to 29 .3% 
in 2020. obesity treatment sales were impacted 
by the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 but are also 
on course to double from 2019 to 2025, while 
the biopharm division is building a platform for 
sustainable growth.
a victory for agility
our ability to maintain effective commercial 
operations during these exceptional times reflects 
our willingness to pursue new, simpler, agile ways 
of working. even before the pandemic hit, we 
were already adopting strategies to address the 
opportunity presented by the rise of digitisation 
in healthcare and the challenge of ensuring 
the affordability of our medicines. the effect of 
covid-19 has been to push the 'fast-forward' 
button on all these key activities, inspiring 
colleagues to adapt and evolve business practices 
faster than ever in 2020 .
the crisis underscores the importance of 
increasing our efforts in prevention and disease 
management for people with diabetes and obesity, 
as they are subject to an increased risk of severe 
symptoms and outcomes from covid-19 . with 
millions of patients depending on us, failing to 
meet their needs is simply not an option .
embracing virtual interactions
across the pharmaceutical industry the pandemic 
has created an unprecedented commercial 
environment in which traditional ways of delivering 
medical innovations could no longer continue . 
face-to-face contacts – whether between patients 
and doctors or companies and customers – 
became almost impossible in many countries for 
significant periods of 2020. this challenged some 
parts of our business, especially in the dynamic 
section of the market as fewer patients could 
be initiated onto new treatments in the face of 
widespread lockdowns and follow-up clinic visits 
were delayed.
but we quickly adapted to the new ways of 
communicating, by transitioning to virtual 
interactions with healthcare professionals and 
customers. as well as a far greater degree of 
virtual interactions, this involved making the 
majority of our commercial materials digital and 
shifting group presentations into a virtual setting 
– a particularly popular approach in china . we also 
moved our line-up of expert educational events to 
digital platforms, running a significant proportion 
of these virtually in 2020 .

source: iqvia data
this line-up of changes dovetailed with a dramatic 
rise in the use of telemedicine across primary and 
some secondary care in key markets including 
the us and the uk, as well as the transition of 
international medical congresses from physical 
to virtual platforms . fortunately, the inability to 
run physical congresses allowed many more 
healthcare professionals who would not normally 
attend in person to participate remotely and learn 
about the latest developments in their field.
a leading portfolio of diabetes medicines 
in diabetes, 2020 was a breakthrough year for our 
latest glp-1 products, with ozempic®, our once 
weekly injectable, now launched in 52 countries 
around the world and rybelsus®, our semaglutide-
based oral medicine, now launched in nine 
countries around the world. overall sales of glp-1 
products for type 2 diabetes (victoza®, ozempic® 
and rybelsus®) increased by 25 .9% in danish 
kroner and by 28 .7% in constant exchange rates .
glp-1 therapies are now helping millions of people 
to manage their disease, and the segment’s value 
share of the total diabetes market has grown to 
50.4% compared with 47.5% a year ago. the glp-
1 story shows how we are continuing to deliver 
meaningful advances for patients, despite having 
been in diabetes for nearly a century .
insulin sales across global markets were mixed, 
with growth across international operations 
being offset by declining sales in the us due to 
lower realised prices following higher rebates, 
launches of affordability programmes and changes 
in the medicare part d coverage gap legislation . 
measured by volume, we continue to be the 
world’s leading provider of insulin.
around the globe, the insulin market is becoming 
increasingly competitive, and we are adapting our 
commercial approach according to the needs of 
different markets. despite the challenges, one of 
our core strengths is a broad portfolio of products 
at different price points – from human insulin in

needs of different markets, for example by offering 
smaller pack sizes in out-of-pocket markets such 
as in india, where some customers struggle to 
afford monthly or quarterly purchases of their 
medicines .
we also know some people are struggling to 
afford their insulin in the us as well, and offer 
patients a range of options to help . we invested 
in raising awareness of novocare®, which provides 
patient affordability and access support, to ensure 
leonardo is living with type 1 diabetes in mexico,
studying in high school and doing triathlons .

that during a period of financial hardship and 
increased unemployment, patients are aware 
of the options available – including our patient 
assistance program, which offered a free 90-day 
supply of insulin for eligible patients who lost 
healthcare coverage due to covid-19 .
leading the way in obesity
obesity is a serious chronic disease that is closely 
linked to type 2 diabetes and which also poses 
a range of other health risks – from cancer and 
heart disease to severe outcomes from covid-19 . 
our ambition is to ensure that it is widely 
recognised as such and to offer medical treatment 
to help effective management of the disease. it 
has been encouraging to see more governments – 
including italy, germany, the uk and switzerland – 
taking steps during 2020 to recognise and address 
obesity as a chronic disease . but there is still more 
to be done to raise awareness and to fight the 
stigma and bias associated with obesity.
sales of saxenda® increased by 3 .3% in constant 
exchange rates, while declining by 1.3% in danish 
kroner in 2020. sales growth was negatively 
impacted by covid-19 as fewer patients initiated 
treatment. in october 2020 the united kingdom’s 
national institute for health and care excellence 
(nice) recommended saxenda® for certain people 
with obesity3; however, it is often not reimbursed 
and is paid for out of pocket by patients . in 
countries such as brazil, saudi arabia and south 
korea, fewer saxenda® prescriptions were filled 
due to patients cutting personal spending as 
the covid-19 pandemic took hold . in the us, 
meanwhile, growth was negatively impacted by a 
significant drop in doctor visits and fewer patients 
initiating treatment .
nonetheless, we remain confident in the difference 
we can make for people with obesity and we are 
well-placed to serve a growing demand as we 
aspire to transition from a single-product obesity 
offering to a portfolio of therapies in the future. 
in the near term, this is expected to be driven by 
semaglutide, 2.4 mg, which has proven effective 
in clinical trials, demonstrating weight loss of 
17%-18% in subject with obesity without diabetes, 
when using a trial product estimand (15%-17% 
weight loss reported when using a treatment 
policy estimand), and thus showing potential as a 
transformative treatment for obesity .
building in biopharm
sales of biopharm products increased by 0 .7% 
in constant exchange rates and declined 1 .3% 
in danish kroner. the growth as measured in 
constant exchange rates is following increasing 
demand for our growth hormone norditropin®, 
due in part to supply challenges for competing 
products in some countries . our haemophilia 
medicine novoseven®, however, experienced 
weaker sales, partly as a result of reduced elective 
surgeries and bleeds during covid-19 lockdowns. 
this was offset to some extent by the successful 
roll-out of the new haemophilia treatments 
esperoct® and refixia® .

development in costs and operating profit
the cost of goods sold increased by 4% measured 
in danish kroner and by 5% at cer to dkk 20,932 
million, resulting in an unchanged gross margin 
of 83 .5% measured in danish kroner compared 
to 2019. the unchanged gross margin reflects 
productivity improvements and a positive product 
mix driven by increased glp-1 sales . this is 
countered by a negative impact from lower 
realised prices in the us and a negative currency 
impact of 0 .3 percentage points .
sales and distribution costs increased by 3% 
measured in danish kroner and by 6% at cer 
to dkk 32,928 million . the increase in costs is 
driven by north america operations reflecting 
launch activities for rybelsus® and continued 
promotional activities for ozempic®, partly offset 
by lower promotional spend related to insulin. 
in international operations, promotional spend 
is related to launch activities for ozempic® and 
rybelsus® as well as the continued roll-out of 
saxenda® . covid-19 resulted in a reduction of the 
activity level and delay of promotional activities . 
research and development costs increased by 9% 
measured in danish kroner and by 10% at cer to 
dkk 15,462 million . the cost increase is driven by 
the amortisation of the priority review voucher for 
semaglutide 2 .4 mg in obesity in the third quarter 
of 2020. increased activities within other serious 
chronic diseases are driving the cost increase 
following progression of the early pipeline within 
cardiovascular disease and stem cell projects 
as well as patient recruitment to the ongoing 
cardiovascular outcomes trials, soul and select .
administration costs decreased by 1% measured in 
danish kroner and increased by 1% at cer to dkk 
3,958 million, reflecting broadly unchanged spend 
across administrative areas . 
other operating income (net) was dkk 460 million 
compared with dkk 600 million in 2019 following 
reduced royalty income . 
operating profit increased by 3% measured in 
danish kroner and by 7% at cer to dkk 54,126 
million . 
financial items (net) and tax
financial items (net) showed a net loss of dkk 996 
million compared with a net loss of dkk 3,930 
million in 2019 . 
in line with novo nordisk’s treasury policy, the 
most significant foreign exchange risks for novo 
nordisk have been hedged, primarily through 
foreign exchange forward contracts. the foreign 
exchange result was a net loss of dkk 747 million 
compared with a net loss of dkk 3,212 million 
in 2019. this reflects losses on non-hedged 
currencies driven by significant depreciations 
of several emerging market currencies, partially 
offset by gains on hedged currencies.
as per the end of december 2020, a positive 
market value of financial contracts of 
approximately dkk 1 .8 billion has been deferred 
for recognition in 2021 . for more information see 
note 4.3 in the financial statement. 
the effective tax rate is 20.7% in 2020 compared 
with an effective tax rate of 19.8% in 2019. in 2019, 
a tax reform was passed in switzerland which had 
positive impact on the effective tax rate, driven by 
a non-recurring increase to deferred tax assets .
cash flow and capital allocation
capital expenditure for property, plant and 
equipment was dkk 5.8 billion compared with dkk 
8.9 billion in 2019. the lower capital expenditure 
was mainly related to lower investments in 
the new production facility for diabetes active 
pharmaceutical ingredients in clayton, north 
carolina, us, which is now in the final stages of 
construction . 
free cash flow of dkk 28.6 billion compared with 
dkk 34.5 billion in 2019. the decrease is reflecting 
purchase of intangible assets of dkk 16 .3 billion, 
primarily related to the acquisitions of corvidia 
therapeutics inc . and emisphere technologies inc .
novo nordisk’s financial reserves were dkk 28.8 
billion by end of december 2020  comprising 
cash at bank and undrawn credit facilities less 
overdrafts and loans repayable within 12 months.

2021 outlook
the current expectations for 2021 are summarised 
in the table named 'outlook 2021' on this page .
for 2021, sales growth is expected to be 5% to 
9% at cer. the guidance reflects expectations 
for continued sales growth in international 
operations in line with the strategic aspiration of 
6-10% growth as well as growth in north america 
operations. the guidance reflects expectations 
for sales growth within diabetes care, mainly 
driven by the glp-1 products ozempic® and 
rybelsus®, as well as growth within obesity care. 
intensifying competition within both diabetes care 
and biopharm is also reflected in the guidance. 
furthermore, continued pricing pressure within 
diabetes care, especially in the us, is expected to 
negatively impact sales development . given the 
current exchange rates versus the danish krone, 
growth reported in dkk is expected to be around 4 
percentage points lower than at cer. 
operating profit growth is expected to be 4% to 
8% at cer. the expectation for operating profit 
growth primarily reflects the sales growth out-
look and continued investments in current and 
future growth drivers across the operating units, 
including the continued roll-out of ozempic® and 
rybelsus® as well as global investments in building 
an anti-obesity market and the expected launch 
of semaglutide 2 .4 mg in the us . furthermore, re-
sources are allocated to both early and late-stage 
pipeline activities, including expected initiations 
of several phase 3a clinical trial programmes in 
2021 . given the current exchange rates versus 
the danish krone, growth reported in dkk is now 
expected to be around 6 percentage points lower 
than at cer, mainly driven by the spot rate of the 
usd being 615 versus an average of 654 in 2020 . 
the current covid-19 pandemic causes 
uncertainty to the outlook regarding the number 
of patients initiating treatment and societal 
impacts such as the unemployment rate in the 
us, which is impacting healthcare insurance 
coverage . the outlook is based on a number of 
assumptions related to the severity and duration 
of impacts from covid-19 . consequently, volatility 
in quarterly results should be expected . 
for 2021, novo nordisk expects financial items 
(net) to amount to a gain of around dkk 0 .7 billion, 
reflecting the expected hedging gains of dkk 
1.1 billion mainly related to the us dollar with 
a hedging period of 11 months and associated 
hedging costs .
the effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in 
the range of 20-22% . 
capital expenditure is expected to be around 
dkk 8 .0 billion in 2021, primarily relating to 
investments in additional capacity for active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (api) production at 
existing manufacturing sites within diabetes care. 
the expected increase in capital expenditure 
reflects progress of r&d projects based on the 
oral technology platform . 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
losses are expected to be around dkk 6 .0 billion . 
the increase in depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment losses in 2021 reflects depreciation 
of the new production facility for diabetes active 
pharmaceutical ingredients in clayton, north 
carolina, us. the free cash flow is expected to be 
dkk 36-41 billion. the increase in free cash flow 
compared to 2020 reflects the impact from the 
acquisitions in 2020 . 
all of the above expectations are based on as-
sumptions that the global or regional macroeco-
nomic and political environment will not significant-
ly change business conditions for novo nordisk 
during 2021, including the potential implications 
from major healthcare reforms, and that the cur-
rency exchange rates, especially the us dollar, will

ne. neither does the guidance include the financial 
implications of significant business development 
transactions during the remainder of 2021 . 
novo nordisk has hedged expected net cash flows 
in a number of invoicing currencies and, all other 
things being equal, movements in key invoicing 
currencies will impact novo nordisk’s operating

financial statements.
forward-looking statements 
novo nordisk’s reports filed with or furnished to 
the us securities and exchange commission (sec), 
including this statutory annual report 2020 and 
form 20-f, which are both expected to be filed with 
the sec in february 2021 in continuation of the 
publication of this annual report 2020, and written 
information released, or oral statements made, 
to the public in the future by or on behalf of novo 
nordisk, may contain forward-looking statements. 
words such as ‘believe’, ‘expect, ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘plan’, 
‘strategy’, ‘prospect’, ‘foresee’, ‘estimate’, ‘project’, 
‘anticipate’, ‘can’, ‘intend’, ‘target’ and other words 
and terms of similar meaning in connection with 
any discussion of future operating or financial 
performance identify forward-looking statements. 
examples of such forward-looking statements 
include, but are not limited to:
–  statements of targets, plans, objectives or goals 
for future operations, including those related 
to novo nordisk’s products, product research, 
product development, product introductions 
and product approvals as well as cooperation in 
relation thereto, 
–  statements containing projections of or targets 
for revenues, costs, income (or loss), earnings 
per share, capital expenditures, dividends, 
capital structure, net financials and other 
financial measures, 
–  statements regarding future economic 
performance, future actions and outcome of 
contingencies such as legal proceedings, and
–  statements regarding the assumptions 
underlying or relating to such statements .
in this annual report 2020, examples of forward-
looking statements can be found under the 
section related to our ‘strategic aspirations’ and 
elsewhere.
these statements are based on current plans, 
estimates and projections . by their very nature, 
forward-looking statements involve inherent risks 
and uncertainties, both general and specific. novo 
nordisk cautions that a number of important 
factors, including those described in this annual 
report 2020, could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those contemplated in any 
forward-looking statements.
factors that may affect future results include, but 
are not limited to, global as well as local political 
and economic conditions, including interest rate 
and currency exchange rate fluctuations, delay or 
failure of projects related to research and/or devel-
opment, unplanned loss of patents, interruptions 
of supplies and production, product recalls, unex-
pected contract breaches or terminations, govern-
ment-mandated or market-driven price decreases 
for novo nordisk’s products, introduction of com-
peting products, reliance on information technol-
ogy, novo nordisk’s ability to successfully market 
current and new products, exposure to product 
liability and legal proceedings and investigations, 
changes in governmental laws and related inter-
pretation thereof, including on reimbursement, 
intellectual property protection and regulatory 
controls on testing, approval, manufacturing and 
marketing, perceived or actual failure to adhere 
to ethical marketing practices, investments in and 
divestitures of domestic and foreign companies, 
unexpected growth in costs and expenses, failure 
to recruit and retain the right employees, failure to 
maintain a culture of compliance and epidemics, 
pandemics or other public health crises . 
for an overview of some, but not all, of the risks 
that could adversely affect novo nordisk’s results 
or the accuracy of forward-looking statements in 
this annual report 2020, reference is made to the 
overview of risk factors in ‘risk management’ of 
this annual report 2020 .
unless required by law, novo nordisk is under no 
duty and undertakes no obligation to update or 
revise any forward-looking statement after the 
distribution of this annual report 2020, whether 
as a result of new information, future events, or 
otherwise.

risk 
management
in order for us to become a sustainable 
business, we must anticipate and adapt 
to our surrounding environment to create 
new strategic opportunities. managing risks 
rigorously and systematically is key in order 
for us to create and protect value over the 
short, medium and long term. 
addressing risks in our strategic planning: 
scenario and risk-thinking exercises are part of our 
strategic planning process . they include analyses 
of market dynamics as well as socioeconomic 
and political developments that present risks or 
opportunities for our business .
access and affordability 
in the short and medium term, access to 
affordable care and innovative treatments is a 
key challenge for patients in many parts of the 
world. access to affordable care is a global issue 
as healthcare systems struggle to provide quality 
care at a sustainable cost, while the burden of 
chronic diseases keeps rising . ensuring access and 
affordability is a responsibility novo nordisk shares 
with all involved in healthcare. we recognise 
that we cannot defeat diabetes alone, but we 
can accelerate our actions to find solutions in 
collaboration with relevant stakeholders.
digital disruption
new digital technologies in healthcare are offering 
more personalised treatment and better manage-
ment of diseases . this is an opportunity for us to 
deliver more value to our stakeholders and help 
patients live a life free from the limitations of their 
disease. new digital health solutions, including our 
own, bring new risks particularly around data regu-
lation and data privacy, as well as potential quality 
and reliability risks . we strive to develop digital 
health solutions in collaboration with relevant part-
ners . we also believe in the value of open innova-
tion and sharing our knowledge and experience. 
environmental risks
we are preparing for the risks and opportunities 
which will arise from climate change. as 
recommended by the task force on climate-
related financial disclosures (tcfd), we are 
integrating climate change scenarios into our 
risk management processes to identify short-, 
medium- and long-term risks .
human rights and labour risks 
we take a proactive approach to integrating risk 
management of human and labour rights into our 
risk management process, while recognising that 
modern slavery, including human trafficking, forced 
labour, bonded labour, child slavery and hazardous 
child labour, can occur in every industry and sector . 
we respect human rights as per the un guiding 
principles on business and human rights . 
risk management process
a rigorous approach to enterprise risk management 
helps the company protect and enhance the value 
of our assets . we are continually exposed to risks 
throughout our value chain – from early discovery 
of new, promising molecules to the production and 
delivery of medicines to patients . some risks are 
inherent in the pharmaceutical industry, such as 
delays or failures of potential new medicines in the 
r&d pipeline . other risks, such as supply disrup-
tions and competitive threats, are well-known to 
any manufacturing company with global produc-
tion. we will never compromise on product quality, 
patient safety and business ethics: these are front 
and centre of our enterprise-wide risk management 
set-up. we apply a two-way lens and assess risks to 
potential financial loss and reputational damage.
executive management and the board of directors 
review a 'heat map' of our biggest risks every six 
months . this map is based on insights from man-
agement teams in the organisation and includes 
risks that could cause significant disruptions to the 
business over a three-year horizon. the following 
overview provides more details of our key risks.

shares and 
capital structure
through open and proactive 
communication, novo nordisk aims to 
provide the basis for fair and efficient 
pricing of our shares.
share capital and ownership
novo nordisk’s share capital of dkk 470,000,000 
is divided into a and b share capital . the a and b 
shares are calculated in units of dkk 0 .20, amount-
ing to 2 .35 billion shares . the a share capital, 
consisting of 537 million shares, has a nominal 
value of dkk 107,487,200 and the b share capital, 
consisting of 1,813 million shares, has a nominal 
value of dkk 362,512,800 . each a share carries 
200 votes and each b share carries 20 votes . novo 
nordisk's b shares are listed on nasdaq copenha-
gen and on the new york stock exchange (nyse) 
as american depository receipts (adrs) .
the company’s a shares are not listed and are 
held by novo holdings a/s1, a danish public 
limited liability company wholly-owned by the 
novo nordisk foundation . the foundation has 
a dual objective: to provide a stable basis for the 
commercial and research activities conducted by 
the companies within the novo group (of which 
novo nordisk a/s is the largest), and to support 
scientific and humanitarian purposes. according to 
the articles of association of the foundation, the a 
shares cannot be divested . special rights attached 
to a shares include pre-emptive subscription rights 
in the event of an increase in the a share capital 
and pre-emptive purchase rights in the event of 
a sale of a shares, while b shares take priority for 
liquidation proceedings . a shares take priority for 
dividends below 0.5%, and b shares take priority 
for dividends between 0.5 and 5%. however, in 
practice, a and b shares receive the same amount 
of dividend per share .
as of 31 december 2020, novo holdings a/s also 
held a b share capital of nominally dkk 24,347,800 . 
together with the a shares, novo holdings a/s's 
total ownership amounted to nominally dkk 
131,835,000. novo holdings a/s's ownership is 
reflected in the 'ownership structure' chart.
there is no complete record of all shareholders;

the capital structure has been adjusted as a con-
sequence of novo nordisk’s debt-financed, usd 
1 .8 billion acquisition of emisphere technologies 
inc., which was finalised on 8 december 2020. 
dividend policy
the company’s dividend policy applies a 
pharmaceutical industry benchmark to ensure a 
competitive payout ratio for dividend payments, 
which are complemented by share repurchase 
programmes. the final dividend for 2019 paid in 
march 2020 was equal to dkk 5.35 per a and b 
share of dkk 0.20 as well as for adrs. the total 
dividend for 2019 was dkk 8.35 per a and b share 
of dkk 0 .20, corresponding to a payout ratio of 
50.5%, which was in line with the 2019 pharma 
peer group average of 53 .5% . 
in august 2020, an interim dividend was paid 
equalling dkk 3 .25 per a and b share of dkk 
0.20 as well as for adrs. for 2020, the board of 
directors will propose a final dividend of dkk 
5 .85 to be paid in march 2021, equivalent to a 
total dividend for 2020 of dkk 9 .10 and a payout 
ratio of 50 .0% . the company expects to distribute 
an interim dividend in august 2021 . further 
information regarding this interim dividend will be 
announced in connection with the financial report

share repurchase programme for 2020/2021 
during the twelve-month period beginning 1

worth dkk 17 billion. the share repurchase pro-
gramme has primarily been conducted in accord-
ance with the safe harbour rules in the eu market

novo nordisk has decided to implement a new 
share repurchase programme . the expected total 
repurchase value of b shares amounts to a cash 
value of up to dkk 17 billion . the total programme

velopment opportunities arise during 2021 . novo 
nordisk expects to conduct the majority of the new 
share repurchase programme according to the 
safe harbour rules in mar . at the annual general 
meeting in march 2021, the board of directors 
will propose a further reduction in the company’s 
b share capital, corresponding to approximate-
ly 1 .7% of the total share capital, by cancelling 
40,000,000 treasury shares .

corporate governance 
shareholders
key responsibilities
the shareholders of novo nordisk have ultimate authority over the company and exercise their 
right to make decisions at general meetings . at the annual general meeting, shareholders approve 
the annual report and any amendments to the company’s articles of association. shareholders also 
elect board members and the independent auditor . resolutions can generally be passed by a simple 
majority . 
however, resolutions to amend the articles of association require two thirds of the votes cast and 
capital represented, unless other adoption requirements are imposed by the danish companies act .
novo holdings a/s holds the majority of votes at general meetings. however, all strategic and 
operational matters are decided solely by the board of directors and executive management . 
board of directors
key responsibilities
board committees: 
-  chairmanship 
-  audit committee 
-   nomination 
committee 
-   remuneration 
committee 
-  r&d committee
novo nordisk has a two-tier management structure consisting of a board of directors and executive 
management. the two bodies are separate and no one serves as a member of both.
the board of directors:
–   develops the company as a focused, sustainable, global pharmaceutical company
–  supervises executive management
–  appoints members of executive management and determines their remuneration
–   determines the company’s overall strategy and oversees the implementation of the strategy and the 
performance of the company
–  ensures adequate management and organisation
–   may distribute extraordinary dividends and issue new shares in accordance with the articles of 
association
–   may repurchase shares in accordance with authorisations granted by the shareholders at the 
annual general meeting in 2020 and recorded in the meeting minutes available at novonordisk .com
composition and independence
as of 31 december 2020, the board of directors consisted of 13 members. nine were elected by 
shareholders and four by danish-based employees. board members must retire at the first annual 
general meeting after they reach the age of 70 .
shareholder-elected board members serve for a one-year term and may be re-elected, which was the 
case for all nine members at the annual general meeting in 2020. two shareholder-elected board 
members are not independent, as they are related to the main shareholder, novo holdings a/s, and 
may be regarded as representing novo holdings a/s’s 1 interests, while the remaining seven members 
are independent . for independence2, see table on page 44 .
danish-based employees may elect a number of board members equalling half of the shareholder-
elected members. employee-elected members serve for a statutory four-year term, with the next 
election in 2022, and have the same rights, duties and responsibilities as shareholder-elected members .
executive management
key responsibilities
executive management is responsible for overall day-to-day management, the organisation of the 
company, allocation of resources, determination and implementation of strategies and policies, 
direction setting, and ensuring timely reporting and provision of information to the board of directors 
and novo nordisk’s stakeholders. 
to ensure the organisational implementation of our strategy, executive management has established 
a management board consisting of the chief executive officer, executive vice presidents and senior 
vice presidents .
composition and meetings
as of 31 december 2020, executive management consisted of nine members including the chief 
executive officer. no changes were made in the composition of executive management in 2020. 
executive management meets at least once a month and due to covid-19 a significant number of their 
meetings and other activities were conducted virtually. the three executives who are based outside 
denmark and who have responsibility for biopharm, international operations and north america 
operations, respectively, are not registered as executives with the danish business authority.
1. related as a member of either the board of directors or executive management of novo holdings a/s.  2. independence as defined by the danish corporate governance recommendations.

and leadership development as well 
as succession preparedness, core 
capabilities and development of the 
company culture and impact of the 
covid-19 pandemic .
in 2020, the audit committee focused 
on work performed by internal

focus sessions on risks and internal 
controls . the audit committee also

in 2020, the nomination committee 
focused particularly on reviewing the 
composition of the board, identifying 
and interviewing candidates and 
considering long-term succession 
planning. it also reviewed the desired 
competences to be represented on 
the board .
in 2020, the remuneration 
committee focused particularly 
on executive remuneration in light 
of the covid-19 pandemic, on 
assessing the design and structure 
of the short-term as well as the long-
term incentive programme for the 
executive management in 2021 and 
on enhancing the transparency in 
remuneration reporting even further .
in 2020, the research & development 
committee focused particularly on 
reviewing the results of clinical trials 
and discussed potential additional 
research and development activities 
to further explore opportunities 
within subcutaneous and oral glp-1 
as well as competitor initiatives. in 
addition, the committee discussed the 
potential opportunities for addressing 
unmet needs in mild cognitive 
impairment and mild dementia . it also 
reviewed potential external research 
collaborations as well as acquisitions.

nomination
the nomination committee presents proposals 
for election or re-election of shareholder-elected 
board members to the board of directors . when 
recommending candidates to be nominated by 
the board, the nomination committee considers 
factors such as the balance between renewal 
and continuity, the desired competences and 
experience, the performance of the individual 
board members, the ambition for diversity as well 
as independence considerations .
the board of directors has determined a 
competence profile for the shareholder-elected 
board members . board members should possess 
integrity, accountability, fairness, financial 
literacy, commitment and desire for innovation . 
additionally, the following competences and 
experience should be represented: global 
business management, strategic operations and 
governance . healthcare industry and market 
access . research and development, technology 
and digitalisation . m&a and external innovation 
sourcing . people leadership and change 
management . finance and accounting .
please refer to the overview on page 44 for com-
petence profiles for shareholder-elected board 
members. the competence profile is available at 
novonordisk .com .
board diversity
in 2016, the board of directors adjusted its 
diversity ambition and set new targets for 
diversity among shareholder-elected board 
members. by 2020, it was the aim that at least 
two members were of nordic nationality and two 
of non-nordic nationality. the aim was also to 
have at least three shareholder-elected board 
members of each gender .
as of 31 december 2020, our shareholder-
elected board members consisted of two nordic 
members and seven non-nordic members . of 
these, three members were female and six were 
male. thus, the board of directors fulfilled its 
2016 gender and nationality ambition. the board 
of directors finds that being diverse in gender 
and nationality is of continued importance, and 
consequently in 2020 the board of directors 
prolonged its gender and nationality ambition 
to 2024. when including the employee-elected 
board members, six members were nordic and 
seven were non-nordic. of these, five were 
female and eight were male.
in accordance with sections 99b and 107d of the 
danish financial statements act, novo nordisk 
discloses current performance on diversity in 
the social responsibility section. novo nordisk’s 
diversity policy is available in that section .
evaluation
the board conducts an annual evaluation . the 
evaluation includes all board members and 
executives . the chair has overall responsibility 
for the evaluation in collaboration with the 
nomination committee . every third year, the 
evaluation is facilitated by external consultants, 
who interview all board members and executives. 
for the subsequent two years, the evaluation is 
facilitated by the secretary of the nomination 
committee based on written questionnaires. 
the evaluation includes topics such as board 
performance, effectiveness, composition and 
succession, performance of the chairmanship 
and the board committees as well as the 
collaboration in the board and between the 
board and executive management . each board 
member and executive also receives feedback 
from all other board members and executives on 
their individual performance .
in 2020, the board evaluation was facilitated 
externally by a consultant working exclusively 
with board effectiveness reviews. overall, the 
evaluation revealed good performance by the 
board and good collaboration between the board 
and executive management . the evaluation 
resulted in continued focus on board culture, 
evolving the induction for new board members, 
board documentation and presentations, board 
competency profile and informal time between 
the board members, which had been affected by 
covid-19.
governance practices
novo nordisk annual report 2020  /  40
introducing novo nordisk  /  strategic aspirations  /  corporate governance  /  consolidated statements  /  additional information
remuneration 
in 2020, a new remuneration policy was adopted 
by the annual general meeting describing board 
and executive remuneration . the policy replaces 
novo nordisk’s remuneration principles and 
was introduced to comply with changed eu leg-
islation. the new policy is applicable to board 
remuneration as of 2020, while it is applicable to 
executive remuneration as of 2021. consequently, 
the remuneration principles applied to board 
remuneration relating to the period up to and 
including 2019 and to executive remuneration 
for the period up to and including 2020. the 
remuneration policy and the remuneration 
principles are available at:   
https://www.novonordisk.com/about/ 
corporate-governance/remuneration .html
novo nordisk has prepared a separate 
remuneration report describing the remuner-
ation awarded or due during 2020 to the board 
members and executives as registered with the 
danish business authority . the remuneration 
report will be submitted to the annual general 
meeting for an advisory vote . the remuneration 
report is available at:   
https://www.novonordisk.com/about/ 
corporate-governance/remuneration .html
danish corporate  
governance recommendations 
not being fulfilled
3.3.2
disclosure of additional information 
about the board members: information 
on matters such as numbers of shares 
owned and changes during the year is 
disclosed in the remuneration report 
for 2020 and not in the management 
commentary . 
3.4.2  
independence of board committees: 
the majority of the members of the 
nomination committee and the 
remuneration committee are not 
independent . 
3.4.6  
tasks of the nomination committee: 
responsibility for succession manage-
ment and recommending candidates 
for the executive management resides 
with the chairmanship and not with the 
nomination committee . 
3.4.7  
tasks of the remuneration committee: 
responsibility for the remuneration pol-
icy applicable to employees in general 
resides with executive management and 
not with the remuneration committee. 
4.1.5  
termination payments: one executive 
employment contract entered into 
before 2008 allows for severance 
payments of more than 24 months’ 
fixed base salary plus pension 
contribution, and thus the total value of 
the remuneration relating to the notice 
period and of the severance payment 
exceeds two years of remuneration.
compliance with corporate governance codes 
novo nordisk’s b shares are listed on nasdaq 
copenhagen and on the new york stock 
exchange (nyse) as american dipository receipts 
(adrs) .
today, novo nordisk adheres to all danish 
corporate governance recommendations (2017) 
designated by nasdaq copenhagen except 
the five recommendations outlined under 
the heading 'danish corporate governance 
recommendations not being fulfilled'.
in addition, novo nordisk complies with the 
corporate governance standards of the nyse 
applicable to foreign private issuers . a summary 
of the significant ways in which novo nordisk’s 
corporate governance practices differ from the 
nyse corporate governance standards can be 
found in novo nordisk’s corporate governance 
report 2020.
novo nordisk's compliance with and explanations 
about the applicable corporate governance codes 
designated by nasdaq copenhagen and the new 
york stock exchange is available at  
www.novonordisk.com/about/ 
corporate-governance/recommendations-and 
-practices .html in accordance with section 107b of 
the danish financial statements act . 
disclosure regarding change of control 
the eu takeover bids directive, as partially imple-
mented by the danish financial statements act, 
requires listed companies to disclose information 
that may be of interest to the market and poten-
tial take-over bidders, in particular in relation 
to disclosure of change-of-control provisions in 
material contracts . 
novo nordisk discloses that the group has one 
significant agreement with a us payer which 
takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change 
of control of the group. if effected, a takeover 
could – at the discretion of the relevant counter-
party – lead to the termination of such agree-
ment. given the ownership structure of novo 
nordisk, the risk is considered to be remote .
in relation to executive management,
the current employment contracts allow
for severance payments of up to 36 months' fixed 
base salary plus pension contributions in the 
event of a merger, acquisition or takeover of novo 
nordisk .
for information about the ownership structure of 
novo nordisk, see 'shares and capital structure' .

must make certain estimates regarding valuation and make judgements on 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, expenses and related 
disclosures.
the key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant 
risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the measurement of 
assets and liabilities in the following reporting period. an example 
being the estimation of us sales deductions and provisions for sales 
rebates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and 
various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. if necessary, changes are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised. management considers the key accounting 
estimates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available 
information. the actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as 
more detailed information becomes available.
in addition, management makes judgements in the process of applying the 
entity’s accounting policies, for example the classification of a transaction 
as an asset acquisition or a business combination.
management regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates 
and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements. 
please refer to the specific notes for further information on the key 
accounting estimates and judgements as well as assumptions applied. 
applying materiality
the consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large 
numbers of transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes 
according to their nature or function. the transactions are presented in 
classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. if a line 
item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar 
nature in the consolidated financial statements or in the notes.
management provides specific disclosures required by ifrs unless the 
information is not applicable or is considered immaterial to the decision-
making of the primary users of these financial statements.
1.2 changes in accounting policies and disclosures
adoption of new or amended ifrss
management has assessed the impact of new or amended and revised 
accounting standards and interpretations (ifrss) issued by the iasb and 
ifrss endorsed by the european union effective on or after 1 january 2020. 
the group adopted the amendments to ifrs 3 for the first time in 2020. 
the amendments narrow and clarify the definition of a business and 
permit a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and 
assets is a group of assets rather than a business (concentration test). the 
amendments are applied prospectively to all business combinations and 
asset acquisitions with an acquisition date on or after 1 january 2020.
it is assessed that application of other new amendments effective from  
1 january 2020 has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements in 2020. furthermore, management does not anticipate any 
significant impact on future periods from the adoption of these new 
amendments. 
adoption of new or amended ifrss in prior periods 
as of 1 january 2019, novo nordisk applied ifrs 16 'leases' for the first 
time. the standard was implemented using the modified retrospective 
approach. on transition to ifrs 16 the group recognised an additional dkk 
3,778 million of right-of-use assets and dkk 3,988 million of lease liabilities. 
the implementation did not have any impact on equity. 
as of 1 january 2018, novo nordisk applied ifrs 9 'financial instruments' 
and ifrs 15 'revenue from contracts with customers' for the first time. 
the impact of the implementation of ifrs 9 and ifrs 15 was immaterial in 
relation to recognition and measurement.
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards 
board (iasb) and in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the eu and 
further requirements in the danish financial statements act. all entities in 
the novo nordisk group follow the same group accounting policies.
measurement basis
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments and 
trade receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value.
except for the changes described in note 1.2, the principal accounting 
policies set out below have been applied consistently in the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements for all the years presented. the 
general accounting policies are described in note 5.5.
principal accounting policies
novo nordisk’s accounting policies are described in each of the individual 
notes to the consolidated financial statements. accounting policies listed 
in the table below are regarded as the principal accounting policies applied 
by management.

sales discounts and sales rebates are predominantly issued in the us. as 
such, rebates amount to 74% of gross sales in the us (71% in 2019 and 68% 
in 2018). provisions for sales rebates includes us managed care, medicare, 
medicaid and other minor us rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of 
european countries and canada.
pricing mechanisms in the us market 
in the us, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare 
insurance programmes, namely medicare and medicaid, as well as rebates 
to pharmacy benefit managers (pbms) and managed healthcare plans. 
key customers in the us include private payers, pbms and government 
payers. pbms and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating 
price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and 
government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their 
formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').
us managed care and medicare
for managed care and medicare, rebates are offered to a number of 
pbms and managed healthcare plans. these rebate programmes allow the 
customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters 
relating to formulary status or pre-established market shares thresholds. 
rebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement, 
historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market 
share information. novo nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to 
reflect actual sales performance. managed care and medicare rebates are 
generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.
us wholesaler charge-backs
wholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between novo 
nordisk and indirect customers in the us whereby products are sold at 
contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. a 
wholesaler charge-back represents the difference between the invoice price 
to the wholesaler and the indirect customer’s contract price. accruals are 
calculated for estimated charge-backs using a combination of factors such 
as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms 
and the value of claims received but not yet processed. wholesaler charge-
backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim.
us medicaid rebates
medicaid is a government insurance programme. medicaid rebates have been 
estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population 
growth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. the calculation 
also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes 
in interpretative guidance from government authorities. novo nordisk adjusts 
the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. medicaid rebates 
are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.
other us and non-us discounts and sales returns
other discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, 
pharmacies, etc. they are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash 
discounts. discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded 
as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. sales 
returns relate to damaged or expired products.
other net sales disclosures
in 2020, novo nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in 
the us, representing 19%, 13% and 12% respectively of total net sales (19%, 
14% and 12% in 2019 and 20%, 13% and 13% in 2018). sales to these three 
wholesalers are within both diabetes and obesity care and biopharm.
net sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts 
containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater 
than 12 months, are expected to be dkk 431 million within 12 months (dkk 
544 million in 2019) and dkk 216 million thereafter (dkk 32 million in 2019).
novo nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. refer to note 
4.2 for development in key exchange rates.
accounting policies
revenue from sale of goods is recognised when novo nordisk has 
transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that 
novo nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for 
transferring the products. control of the products is transferred at a point 
in time, typically on delivery. the amount of sales to be recognised is based 
on the consideration novo nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its 
goods. when sales are recognised, novo nordisk also records estimates for 
a variety of sales deductions, including product returns as well as rebates 
and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance 
companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. sales 
deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net 
sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable 
consideration). where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, novo 
nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.
in some markets, novo nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis. 
where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of 
future returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in 
sales. where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis, 
without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue 
is recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well-
established products with similar market characteristics. if similar market 
characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of 
consumption or when the right of return has expired. 
unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount 
is uncertain (note 3.6).
where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other 
liabilities. wholesaler charge-backs are netted against trade receivable balances.

novo nordisk operates in two business segments based on therapies: 
diabetes and obesity care and biopharm, representing the entirety of the 
group's operations. 
the segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing 
of products within the following areas:
– diabetes and obesity care: insulin, glp-1 and related delivery systems, oral 
antidiabetic products (oad), obesity and other serious chronic diseases.
– biopharm: haemophilia, growth disorders and hormone replacement therapy.
segment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit, consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements. financial income and expenses, and 
income taxes are managed at group level and are not allocated to business 
segments. there are no sales or other transactions between the business 
segments. costs have been split between business segments according to a 
specific allocation. in addition, a small number of corporate overhead costs are 
allocated systematically between the segments. other operating income has 
been allocated to the two segments based on the same principle. 
accounting policies
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to executive management and the board of directors. we 
consider executive management to be the operating decision-making body, 
as all significant decisions regarding business development and direction are 
taken in this forum. 
the impact of foreign currency hedging is recognised in the income 
statement in financial items. please refer to notes 4.2, 4.3 and 4.9 for more 
details on hedging.
key accounting estimates of sales deductions and provisions for  
sales rebates
sales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related 
sales are recorded. these estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and 
product return obligations require use of significant judgement, as not all 
conditions are known at the time of sale, for example total sales volume to a 
given customer. 
the estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations 
and historical experience. provisions are calculated on the basis of a 
percentage of sales for each product as defined by the contracts with the 
various customer groups. provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual 
amounts as rebates, discounts and returns are processed. 
novo nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be 
reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. however, 
the actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts 
estimated by management as more detailed information becomes available.
geographical areas
sales to external customers attributed to the us are collectively the most 
material to the group. the us and mainland china are the only territories 
where sales contribute 10% or more of total net sales.
in 2020 novo nordisk operated in two main commercial units:
– international operations
– emea: europe, the middle east and africa.
– china: mainland china, hong kong and taiwan.
– rest of world: all other countries except for north america.
– north america operations (the us and canada)
international operations was reorganised with effect from 1 april 2020, 
and the geographical reporting has been amended to reflect the new 
organisation. amounts for 2018 and 2019 have been restated. refer to 
note 5.6 for an overview of companies in the novo nordisk group based on 
geographical areas.
the country of domicile is denmark, which is part of emea. denmark is 
immaterial to novo nordisk’s activities in terms of sales as 99.7% of total 
sales are realised outside denmark. sales are attributed to geographical 
areas according to the location of the customer.

novo nordisk’s research and development is mainly focused on: 
– insulins, glp-1s and other therapeutic new antidiabetic drugs for diabetes 
treatment.
– glp-1s, combinations and new modes of action for obesity care.
– blood-clotting factors and new modes of action for treatment of 
haemophilia and other rare blood disorders.
– human growth hormone and new modes of action for treatment of growth 
disorders and other rare endocrine disorders.
– new modes of action including glp-1 and stem cells for treatment of 
nash, cardiovascular disease, alzheimer's disease, chronic kidney disease 
and parkinson's disease, among others.
the research activities mainly utilise biotechnological methods based on 
advanced protein chemistry and protein engineering. these methods have 
played a key role in the development of the production technology used to 
manufacture insulin, glp-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human 
growth hormone. research activities further focus on new technology 
platforms including stem cells and developing rnai therapies for liver-
related cardio-metabolic diseases.
research and development activities are carried out by novo nordisk’s 
research and development centres, mainly in denmark, the us, the uk and 
china. clinical trials are carried out all over the world. novo nordisk also 
enters into partnerships and licence agreements.
accounting policies
novo nordisk expenses all research costs. in line with industry practice, 
internal and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as 
they are incurred, due to significant regulatory uncertainties and other 
uncertainties inherent in the development of new products. this means that 
they do not qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets until marketing 
approval by a regulatory authority is obtained or considered highly probable. 
costs for post-approval activities that are required by authorities as a 
condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as research and 
development costs. 
research and development costs primarily comprise employee costs, 
and internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including 
manufacturing costs and facility costs of the research centres. the costs 
also comprise amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related 
to software and property, plant and equipment used in the research and 
development activities. impairment losses recognised on intangible assets 
not yet available for use related to research and development projects are 
presented in research and development costs.
certain research and development activities are recognised outside research 
and development costs:
– royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are expensed 
as cost of goods sold.
– royalty income received from partners is recognised as part of other 
operating income, net.
– contractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future 
are disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.

2.5 other operating income, net
accounting policies
other operating income, net, comprises licence income and income of 
a secondary nature in relation to the main activities of novo nordisk. 
licence income from royalties on net sales is recognised as the underlying 
customers' sale occurs and from sales milestones once the contingent 
sale milestone is achieved in accordance with the terms of the relevant 
agreement. income from the transfer of the right to use intellectual property 
may contain development or regulatory milestones (variable consideration) 
on which the income is recognised when the significant uncertainties in 
achieving the milestones are resolved, due to the significant uncertainties 
inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. operating profit 
from the wholly owned subsidiary nne a/s, not related to novo nordisk’s 
main activities, is recognised as other operating income. other operating 
income also includes income from sale of intellectual property rights.

wages, salaries, social security contributions, annual leave and sick leave, 
bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised in the year in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of novo nordisk. where 
novo nordisk provides long-term employee benefits, the costs are accrued 
to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.

swiss tax reform
in 2019, a tax reform was passed in switzerland. the tax reform has a minor 
positive impact on the effective tax rate, driven by a non-recurring increase 
to deferred tax assets.
accounting policies
the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. it also 
includes adjustments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain 
tax positions. tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.
provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax 
assets, tax receivables and tax payables.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the 
accounting and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and 
from realisable tax loss carry-forwards. the tax value of tax loss carry-
forwards is included in deferred tax assets to the extent that these are 
expected to be utilised in future taxable income. the deferred income taxes 
are measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in 
the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised. 
in general, the danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies 
provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. a provision for 
withholding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends 
is planned. the unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to dkk 
337 million (dkk 315 million in 2019). 
the value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is 
recognised as deferred tax, until the shares are paid out to the employees. 
any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the 
income statement is charged to equity.

management judgement regarding recognition of deferred income tax 
assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions
novo nordisk is subject to income taxes around the world. significant 
judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide accrual 
for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and provisions 
for uncertain tax positions.
novo nordisk recognises deferred income tax assets if it is probable that 
sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the 
temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
management has considered future taxable income and applied its 
judgement in assessing whether deferred income tax assets should be 
recognised.
in the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing 
disputes with tax authorities may occur. management judgement is applied 
to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. the 'most probable 
outcome' method is applied when making provisions for uncertain tax 
positions, and novo nordisk considers the provisions made to be adequate. 
however, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of 
litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.

2020 additions
in 2020 novo nordisk acquired corvidia therapeutics inc., in a transaction 
accounted for as an asset acquisition. an addition of dkk 4,580 million was 
recognised in patents and licences for the acquisition of ziltivekimab, a fully 
human monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin-6 related to chronic 
kidney disease, which is under development.
novo nordisk acquired emisphere technologies inc. and obtained ownership of 
the eligen® snac oral delivery technology. novo nordisk and emisphere have 
collaborated since 2007 and emisphere’s proprietary drug delivery technology 
eligen® snac is used by novo nordisk under an existing licence agreement in 
the oral formulation of novo nordisk’s glp-1 receptor agonist semaglutide, 
which is marketed and sold under the brand name rybelsus®. under the 
terms of the agreement, novo nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of 
emisphere for usd 1,335 million. as part of the transaction, novo nordisk also 
acquired related eligen® snac royalty stream obligations owed to mhr fund 
management llc (mhr), the largest shareholder of emisphere, for usd 450 
million. the transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, with 
dkk 11,060 million recognised in patents and licences, of which dkk 2,467 
million are related to assets under development. at 31 december 2020, the 
carrying amount of acquired intangible assets related to rybelsus is dkk 7,716 
million, which has a remaining amortisation period of 14 years.
of the total addition of intangible assets in 2020 dkk 396 million is internally 
developed (dkk 221 million in 2019).
accounting policies
patents and licences, including patents and licences acquired for research 
and development projects, are carried at historical cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any impairment loss. upfront fees and acquisition costs are 
capitalised and subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement 
of a contingent event will be capitalised on the contingent event being 
probable of being achieved.
amortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful 
life. this means the legal duration or the economic useful life depending on 
which is shorter, and not exceeding 15 years. the amortisation of patents 
and licences begins after regulatory approval has been obtained. 
internal development of software for internal use are recognised as 
intangible assets if the recognition criteria are met, for example a significant 
business system where the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable 
asset. amortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful life of 3-15 years. the amortisation begins when the asset is in the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.
research and development projects
internal and subcontracted research costs are charged in full to the 
consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
consistent with industry practice, development costs are also expensed until 
regulatory approval is obtained or is probable; please refer to note 2.3.
payments to third parties under collaboration and licence agreements 
are assessed for the substance of their nature. payments which represent 
subcontracted research and development are expensed as the services are 
received. payments which represent rights to the transfer of intellectual 
property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.
for acquired research and development projects, patents and licences, the 
likelihood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the 
asset, and thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to 
be satisfied. as the cost of acquired research and development projects can 
often be measured reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as 
intangible assets on acquisition. subsequent milestone payments payable 
on achievement of a contingent event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 
trials) are accrued and capitalised into the cost of the intangible asset when 
the achievement of the event is probable. development costs incurred 
subsequent to acquisition are treated consistently with internal project 
development costs.
assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. 
factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include  
the following:
– development of a competing drug.
– changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences.
– advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments.
– lower-than-predicted sales.
– adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names.
– changes in the economic lives of similar assets.
– relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment.
– changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement 
policies.
if the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount 
based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, 
any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. 
impairments are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal. 
key accounting estimates and judgements on intangible assets 
in 2020, an impairment loss of dkk 350 million (dkk 982 million in 2019) was 
recognised, substantially all of which related to patents and licences. dkk 350 
million (dkk 282 million in 2019) of the impairment was related to the diabetes 
and obesity care segment and none related to biopharm (dkk 700 million 
in 2019). all the impairment loss in 2020 was recognised in research and 
development costs (dkk 529 million in cost of goods sold and dkk 450 million 
in research and development costs in 2019). the impairment was a result of 
management’s review of expectations related to patents and licences not yet in 
use. no impairment related to marketable products was identified in 2020.
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet 
available for use are not subject to amortisation. they are tested annually for 
impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be 
impaired. 
intangible assets not yet being amortised amounts to dkk 9,607 million (dkk 
3,380 million in 2019), primarily patents and licences in relation to research 
and development projects. impairment tests in 2020 and 2019 of patents and 
licences not yet in use are based on management’s projections and anticipated 
net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products. 
terminal values used are based on the expected life of products, forecasted 
life cycle and cash flow over that period, and the useful life of the underlying 
assets. in addition, management makes judgements related to intangible 
assets when assessing whether a transaction is a business combination or 
an asset acquisition. an asset acquisition will arise when substantially all 
the transaction value is concentrated in a single asset or when there are no 
substantive business processes in the acquired entity. judgements are also 
made in evaluating whether payments under collaboration arrangements are 
acquisition of assets or prepayment of r&d services.

capital expenditure in the reporting period was primarily related to 
investments in facility upgrades and new production facilities for active 
pharmaceutical ingredients for diabetes, mainly the facility in clayton, us. 
the facility in clayton is intended to strengthen the novo nordisk supply 
chain. capital expenditure also related to investments in facility upgrades 
of the purification plant in kalundborg and investments were also made to 
establish additional api capacity in kalundborg. finally, capital expenditure 
related to the establishment of an oral tablet facility near durham, us for 
launch and commercial manufacturing of tablets.
accounting policies
property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. the cost of self-
constructed assets includes costs directly and indirectly attributable to the 
construction of the assets. any subsequent cost is included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to novo 
nordisk and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. depreciation 
is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years and other 
equipment: 3-10 years. land is not depreciated).
the depreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is 
in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management. the assets’ residual values and useful lives 
are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
if an asset’s carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, 
it is written down to the recoverable amount. plant and equipment with no 
alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are 
expensed. however, plant and equipment with an alternative use or used for 
general research and development purposes are capitalised and depreciated 
over the estimated useful life as research and development costs.

in 2020 the total cash outflow for leases amounted to dkk 1,367 million 
(dkk 1,295 million in 2019). please refer to note 4.4 for a maturity analysis of 
lease payments. the lease costs for 2018 were dkk 1,299 million. 
accounting policies
novo nordisk mainly leases office buildings, warehouses, laboratories and 
vehicles. the right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment 
and the lease liability in borrowings. 
for contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the group recognises a right-of-
use asset and a lease liability. the right-of-use asset is initially measured at 
cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. the right-of-use asset is 
subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. 
the right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of 
the lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses. 
the lease term determined by the group is the non-cancellable period of a 
lease, together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain 
to be exercised. when determining the term, management considers multiple 
factors that create economic incentives to exercise an option to extend the 
lease or not to terminate the lease, including termination penalties, potential 
relocation costs and whether significant leasehold improvements have been 
capitalised on the lease, with a remaining useful life which exceeds the fixed 
minimum duration of the lease. for contracts with a rolling term (evergreen 
leases), the group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination 
period if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period. 
the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease 
payments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the 
incremental borrowing rate. the lease liability is measured using the effective 
interest method. variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. residual 
value guarantees that are expected to be paid are included in the initial 
measurement of the lease liability. 
the lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease 
payments, typically due to a change in index or rate (e.g. inflation) on property 
leases, or if there is a reassessment of whether an extension or termination 
option will be exercised. a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-
use asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been 
fully depreciated.
new lease contracts with a lease term of 12 months or less and lease of low 
value assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. these are expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis. 
lease of low value assets include personal computers, telephones and small 
items of office equipment.
as of 31 december 2020, the lease liability excludes dkk 2,363 million 
(undiscounted) of potential lease payments related to lease term extension 
rights on properties which were not considered reasonably certain to be 
exercised (dkk 2,760 million in 2019).

all write-downs in both 2020 and 2019 relate to fully impaired inventory.
in 2019 a reversal of write-down on prelaunch inventory with a net positive 
income statement effect of dkk 510 million on research and development 
costs was recognised. 
accounting policies
inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. 
cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. cost comprises direct 
production costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour as well 
as indirect production costs. production costs for work in progress and 
finished goods include indirect production costs such as employee costs, 
depreciation, maintenance, etc. if the expected sales price less completion 
costs to execute sales (net realisable value) is lower than the carrying 
amount, a write-down is recognised for the amount by which the carrying 
amount exceeds its net realisable value.
inventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) 
is capitalised but immediately provided for, until there is a high probability of 
regulatory approval for the product. a write-down is made against inventory, 
and the cost is recognised in the income statement as research and 
development costs. once there is a high probability of regulatory approval 
being obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original 
cost.
key accounting estimate of indirect production costs capitalised and 
inventory write-downs
indirect production costs account for approximately 50% of the net 
inventory value, reflecting a lengthy production process compared with 
low direct raw material costs. the production of both diabetes and obesity 
care and biopharm products is highly complex from fermentation to 
purification and formulation, including quality control of all production 
processes. furthermore, the process is very sensitive to manufacturing 
conditions. these factors all influence the parameters for capitalisation of 
indirect production costs at novo nordisk and the full cost of the products. 
indirect production costs are measured using a standard cost method. this 
is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant measures of capacity utilisation, 
production lead time, cost base and other relevant factors, hence inventory 
is valued at actual cost. when calculating total inventory, management must 
make judgements about cost of production, standard cost variances and idle 
capacity in estimating indirect production costs for capitalisation. changes 
in the parameters for calculation of indirect production costs could have an 
impact on the gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories.

introducing novo nordisk  /  strategic aspirations  /  corporate governance  /  consolidated statements – financial statement  /  additional information
novo nordisk annual report 2020  /  62
novo nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries 
impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political 
climate. these indicators as well as payment history are taken into account 
in the valuation of trade receivables. 
during 2020 country risk ratings have been downgraded in a number of 
countries. however, despite of the covid-19 pandemic, novo nordisk has 
not experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual 
customers nor have we experienced significant deterioration in the ageing 
of receivables. please refer to note 4.2 for the trade receivable programmes. 
 
accounting policies
trade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. the allocation of 
trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the 
location of the customer.
before being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair 
value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. the allowance 
for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade 
receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement 
under sales and distribution costs. subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.
novo nordisk’s customer base comprises government agencies, 
wholesalers, retail pharmacies and other customers. management makes 
allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach 
to provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime 
expected loss provision for all trade receivables. the allowance is an 
estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. 
generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of 
goods. loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical 
risk and specific customer knowledge. the allowance is based on a provision 
matrix on days past due and a forward looking-element relating mainly to 
incorporation of the dun & bradstreet country risk rating and an individual 
assessment. please refer to note 4.2 for a general description of credit risk.

defined contribution plans
novo nordisk operates a number of defined contribution plans throughout 
the world. these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally 
separate from the group. 
defined benefit plans
in a few countries, novo nordisk operates defined benefit plans, primarily 
located in the us, germany, switzerland and japan. in germany and 
switzerland, the defined benefit plans are partly reimbursed by international 
insurance companies. the risk related to the plan assets in these countries 
is therefore limited to counterparty risk against these insurance companies. 
the total cost recognised for the year amounts to dkk 138 million (dkk 151 
million in 2019).
the present value of partly funded retirement benefit obligations amounts 
to dkk 1,953 million (dkk 1,845 million in 2019). the present value of 
unfunded retirement benefit obligations amounts to dkk 671 million (dkk 
663 million in 2019).
net remeasurement is a loss of dkk 67 million (loss of dkk 187 million in 
2019), primarily related to changes in financial assumptions (discount rate), 
and is included in other comprehensive income.
please refer to note 5.2 for a maturity analysis of the net retirement benefit 
obligation. novo nordisk does not expect the contributions over the next 
five years to differ significantly from current contributions.
accounting policies
defined contribution plans
novo nordisk’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged 
to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
defined benefit plans
the costs for the year for defined benefit plans are determined using the 
projected unit credit method. this reflects services rendered by employees 
to the valuation dates and is based on actuarial assumptions primarily 
regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits 
and projected rates of remuneration growth. discount rates are based on 
the market yields of high-rated corporate bonds in the country concerned.
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. past service costs are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
pension plan assets are only recognised to the extent that novo nordisk is 
able to derive future economic benefits such as refunds from the plan or 
reductions of future contributions. 
costs recognised for retirement benefits are included in cost of goods 
sold, sales and distribution costs, research and development costs, and 
administrative costs. the net obligation recognised in the balance sheet is 
reported as non-current liabilities.
actuarial valuations are performed annually for all major defined benefit 
plans. assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice 
in accordance with published statistics and experience in each country. 
other assumptions such as medical cost trend rate and inflation are also 
considered in the calculation. significant actuarial assumptions for the 
determination of the retirement benefit obligation (not considering plan 
assets) are discount rate and expected future remuneration increases. the 
sensitivity analysis has been determined based on reasonably likely changes 
in the assumptions occurring at the end of the period.

contingent liabilities
novo nordisk is currently involved in pending litigations, claims and 
investigations arising out of the normal conduct of its business. while 
provisions that management deems to be reasonable and appropriate 
have been made for probable losses, there are uncertainties connected 
with these estimates. novo nordisk does not expect the pending litigations, 
claims and investigations, individually and in the aggregate, to have a 
material impact on novo nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash 
flow in addition to the amounts accrued as provision for legal disputes.
pending litigation against novo nordisk
novo nordisk, along with the majority of incretin-based product 
manufacturers in the united states, is a defendant in product liability 
lawsuits related to use of incretin-based medications. as of 1 february 
2021, 384 plaintiffs have named novo nordisk in product liability lawsuits, 
predominantly claiming damages for pancreatic cancer that allegedly 
developed as a result of using victoza® and other glp-1/dpp-iv incretin-
based products. 236 of the novo nordisk plaintiffs have also named other 
defendants in their lawsuits. most novo nordisk plaintiffs have filed suit in 
california federal and state courts. novo nordisk does not currently have 
any individual trials scheduled in 2021. novo nordisk does not expect the 
pending claims to have a material impact on its financial position, operating 
profit or cash flow.
 
since january 2017, several class action lawsuits have been filed against 
novo nordisk, former ceo lars rebien sørensen, former cfo jesper 
brandgaard and former president of novo nordisk inc. jakob riis in the 
united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of all 
purchasers of novo nordisk american depositary receipts between february 
2015 and february 2017. all lawsuits have been consolidated into one case. 
the lawsuit alleges that novo nordisk artificially inflated its financial results, 
failed to disclose pricing pressure and rising rebate payments to pbms, and 
made other materially misleading statements to potential investors. novo 
nordisk does not expect the litigation to have a material impact on novo 
nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
in august 2019, a securities lawsuit was filed against novo nordisk in 
denmark by a number of institutional shareholders. the claim is for a total 
amount of dkk 11.8 billion based on trading and holding of shares in novo 
nordisk during the period between february 2015 and february 2017. the 
lawsuit alleges that novo nordisk made misleading statements and did 
not make appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products 
in the us. it contains broadly similar allegations to those of the previously 
disclosed securities class action lawsuit filed in the us in 2017 on behalf of 
all purchasers of novo nordisk american depository receipts. novo nordisk 
does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on novo nordisk’s 
financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
novo nordisk is currently defending six lawsuits, including two plead as 
putative class actions, relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines. four 
of these cases are pending in new jersey federal court; the other two are 
pending in kentucky state court and texas federal court. all pending matters 
also name as defendants eli lilly and company and sanofi-aventis u.s. 
llc; while certain matters also name pharmacy benefit managers (pbms) 
and related entities. plaintiffs generally allege that the manufacturers and 
pbms colluded to artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes 
products, while offering reduced prices to pbms through rebates used to 
secure formulary access. novo nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have 
a material impact on novo nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or 
cash flow.
in 2016, novo nordisk us received a civil investigative demand from 
the u.s. department of justice (“doj cid”) relating to potential off-label 
marketing of novoseven® (including high dose and for prophylactic use) and 
interactions with physicians and patients. the doj investigation was likely 
prompted by a lawsuit filed by a former novo nordisk us employee (the 
“relator”) under seal in the western district of oklahoma in 2015. relator 
alleges novo nordisk us caused the submission of false claims to medicare, 
medicaid, federal employees health benefits program and private insurers 
in california as a result of the same conduct that was the subject of the doj 
cid. as a result of these allegations, relator (on behalf of the federal and 
state governments) seeks injunctive and monetary relief. a consolidated 
complaint was jointly filed by relator and the state of washington on 9 
march 2020. the consolidated complaint was unsealed (made public) by the 
court on 28 may 2020. novo nordisk has filed two motions seeking dismissal 
of the complaint, both of which are currently pending and awaiting ruling 
from the court. novo nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material 
impact on novo nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
pending claims against novo nordisk and investigations involving 
novo nordisk
several authorities in the us have served novo nordisk with civil 
investigative demands (cids) or subpoenas calling for the production of 
documents and information. below is a list of ongoing matters:

– state of california office of the insurance commissioner subpoena (july

in the us. 
– mississippi attorney general’s office subpoena (december 2020), related 
to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products, 
including levemir®, novolog®, and novolin®, from 1 january 2005 through 
the present date.
– vermont attorney general’s office subpoena (december 2020), related to, 
among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products sold by 
novo nordisk during the period 1 january 2011 through the present date.
in all matters novo nordisk is cooperating with the authority in question. 
novo nordisk does not expect the above investigations to have a material 
impact on novo nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
novo nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received 
requests for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products 
from several committees of the unites states house of representatives 
and/or united states senate. novo nordisk is working with the staff of the 
various committees to respond to their questions. novo nordisk does not 
expect the inquiries to have a material impact on novo nordisk’s financial 
position, operating profit or cash flow.
other contingent liabilities
in addition to the above, the novo nordisk group is engaged in certain 
litigation proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. in 
the opinion of management, neither settlement or continuation of such 
proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to 
have a material effect on novo nordisk’s financial position, operating profit 
or cash flow.
3.7 other liabilities
other liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables 
related to non-current assets, and sales rebates.
accounting policies
provisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government 
agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed care and other 
customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded 
or when the incentives are offered. provisions are calculated based on 
historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. 
unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or 
amount is uncertain. where absolute amounts are known, the rebates 
are recognised as other liabilities. please refer to note 2.1 for further 
information on sales rebates and provisions.
provisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive 
obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable 
that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. 
in this case, novo nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation 
of the most likely outcome. disputes for which no reliable estimate can be 
made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
provisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated 
expenditure for settlement. this is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the obligation. the increase in the provision for interest 
is recognised as a financial expense.
novo nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal 
business. where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate 
estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for 
estimated product returns is recorded. the provision is measured at gross 
sales value.
key accounting estimate regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation 
and investigations
provisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provision linked 
to ongoing legal disputes. management makes estimates regarding 
provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and 
potential future litigation outcomes. these are by nature dependent on 
inherently uncertain future events. when determining likely outcomes of 
litigation, etc., management considers the input of external counsels on 
each case, as well as known outcomes in case law.
although management believes that the total provisions for legal 
proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there 
can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, 
or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not 
be material.

the net cash distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends and share 
repurchases amounts to dkk 36,976 million, compared with a free cash 
flow of dkk 28,565 million. this is in line with the guiding principle of paying 
out excess capital to investors after funding organic growth and potential 
acquisitions.
the total dividend for 2020 amounts to dkk 21,066 million (dkk 9.10 per 
share). the 2020 final dividend of dkk 13,496 million (dkk 5.85 per share) is 
expected to be distributed pending approval at the annual general meeting. 
the interim dividend of dkk 7,570 million (dkk 3.25 per share) was paid in 
august 2020. the total dividend for 2019 was dkk 19,651 million (dkk 8.35

dividends are based on the financial statements of the parent company, 
novo nordisk a/s. dividends are paid from distributable reserves. share 
premium is a distributable reserve, and any former share premium reserve

treasury shares
treasury shares are primarily acquired to reduce the company’s share 
capital. in addition, a limited part is used to finance novo nordisk’s 
long-term share-based incentive programme (restricted stock units) and 
restricted stock units to employees. treasury shares are deducted from 
the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of dkk 0.20 per 
share. differences between this amount and the amount paid to acquire or 
received for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in equity.
novo nordisk’s guiding principle is that any excess capital after the funding 
of organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions should be 
returned to investors. novo nordisk's dividend payouts are complemented 
by share repurchase programmes.
the purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining 
part of the 2019 share repurchase programme, totalling dkk 0.9 billion and 
the dkk 17 billion novo nordisk b share repurchase programme for 2020, of 
which dkk 1 billion was outstanding at year-end. the programme ended on 
1 february 2021. transfer of treasury shares relates to the long-term share-
based incentive programme and restricted stock units to employees.

4.2 financial risks
management has assessed the following key financial risks:
type
financial risk
foreign exchange risk
high
credit risk
low
interest rate risk
low
liquidity risk
low
novo nordisk has centralised management of the group's financial risks. the 
overall objectives and policies for the company's financial risk management 
are outlined in an internal treasury policy, which is approved by the board 
of directors. the treasury policy consists of the foreign exchange policy, the 
investment policy, the financing policy and the policy regarding credit risk on 
financial counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial 
instruments and risk limits.
novo nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not 
enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. novo 
nordisk uses a fully integrated treasury management system to manage all 
financial positions, and all positions are marked-to-market. 
foreign exchange risk
foreign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for novo nordisk 
and can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of 
comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement.
the overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the 
short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and 
cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results.
the majority of novo nordisk's sales are in usd, eur, cny, jpy, cad and 
gbp. the foreign exchange risk is most significant in usd, cny and jpy, while 
the eur exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of denmark's fixed 
exchange rate policy towards eur.
novo nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as 
future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. hedge 
accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument in the consolidated income statement. management has chosen to 
classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items. 
during 2020, the hedging horizon varied between 5 and 13 months for 
usd, cny, jpy, cad and gbp. the currency hedging strategy balances risk 
reduction and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and 
foreign exchange options matching the due dates of the hedged items. 
expected cash flows are continually assessed using historical inflows, 
budgets and monthly sales forecasts. hedge effectiveness is assessed on 
a regular basis. there is no expected ineffectiveness at 31 december 2020, 
primarily because hedging instruments match currencies of hedged cash 
flows. 
the financial contracts existing at year-end cover the expected future cash 
flow for the following number of months:

a 5% depreciation of usd versus eur and dkk at 31 december 2020 would 
affect other comprehensive income by dkk 1,380 million (dkk 1,298 million in 
2019) and the income statement by dkk -2 million (dkk 135 million in 2019).
the foreign exchange sensitivity analysis comprises effects from the group's 
cash, trade receivables and trade payables, current loans, current and non-
current financial investments, lease liabilities, foreign exchange forwards and 
foreign exchange options at year-end. anticipated currency transactions, 
investments and non-current assets are not included.
credit risk
credit risk arises from the possibility that transactional counterparties may 
default on their obligations, causing financial losses for the group. novo 
nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties 
to be dkk 15,089 million (dkk 15,663 million in 2019). in addition, novo 
nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other 
receivables (less prepayments and vat receivables) and other financial 
assets to be dkk 29,522 million (dkk 26,622 million in 2019). please refer to 
note 4.8 for details of the group's total financial assets. 
to manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, novo nordisk only 
enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with 
financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating 
from at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies: standard and 
poor's, moody's and fitch. furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for 
each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk. the table below 
shows novo nordisk's credit exposure on cash and financial derivatives.

outside the us, novo nordisk has no significant concentration of credit 
risk related to trade receivables or other receivables and prepayments, as 
the exposure in general is spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers. in the us, the three major wholesalers account for a large 
proportion of total net sales, see note 2.1. however, us wholesaler credit 
ratings are monitored and part of the trade receivables are sold on full non-
recourse terms; see below for details. novo nordisk continues to monitor 
the credit exposure in countries with increasing sales and low credit ratings.
trade receivable programmes
please refer to note 3.4 for the description of covid-19’s impact on trade 
receivables including the loss allowance for the group and ageing analysis. 
novo nordisk's subsidiaries in the us and japan employ trade receivable 
programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms 
to optimise working capital.
at year-end, the group had derecognised receivables without recourse 
having due dates after 31 december 2020 amounting to:

programmes are occasionally applied by novo nordisk subsidiaries around 
the world, with limited impact on the group's trade receivables.
please refer to note 3.4 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by 
geographical segment.
interest rate risk
novo nordisk has no significant exposure to interest rate risk as novo 
nordisk does not hold any significant interest-bearing marketable securities 
or non-current loans. furthermore, net interest costs have low sensitivity 
towards interest rates due to the capital structure.
liquidity risk
the liquidity risk is considered to be low. novo nordisk ensures the 
availability of the required liquidity through a combination of cash 
management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both uncommitted and 
committed credit facilities. novo nordisk uses cash pools for optimisation 
and centralisation of cash management.

1. average hedge rate for usd cash flow hedges is 640 at the end of 2020 and 654 at the end of 2019.
2. the fair value of cash flow hedges at year-end 2020, dkk 1,802 million, is recognised in other comprehensive income. in addition dkk 418 million in cash flow hedge losses on 
intangible asset purchases has been incurred for a total 2020 other comprehensive impact of dkk 1,384 million. the dkk 418 million deferred loss was transferred directly from the 
cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the intangible assets.
the financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within 
the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges 
then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses.
accounting policies
novo nordisk uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign 
exchange on financial results.
use of derivative financial instruments
the derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to 
market risk. none of the derivatives are held for trading.
novo nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, 
currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities. the 
overall policy is to hedge the majority of total currency exposure.
net investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.
initial recognition and measurement
on initiation of the contract, novo nordisk designates each derivative 
financial contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:
– hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)
– hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).
all contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at the end of the reporting period.
fair value hedges
value adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income 
statement along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability 
that are attributable to the hedged risk.
cash flow hedges
value adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income. the cumulative value adjustment 
of these contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income 
statement. 
for cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable non-
financial asset purchases, the cumulative value adjustments are transferred 
directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the asset 
when recognised.
discontinuance of cash flow hedging
when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the 
income statement under financial income or financial expenses.
fair value determination
the fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis 
of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. 
if an active market exists, the fair value is based on the most recently 
observed market price at the end of the reporting period.
if a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, novo 
nordisk bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. 
adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for 
instance by including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed 
to be motivated by normal business considerations.
if an active market does not exist, the fair value of standard and simple 
financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest 
rate swaps, currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to 
generally accepted valuation techniques. market-based parameters are 
used to measure the fair value.

cash and cash equivalents at 31 december 2020 includes dkk 653 million 
that is restricted (dkk 509 million in 2019). the restricted cash balance 
relates to subsidiaries in which availability of currency for remittance of 
funds is temporarily scarce.
accounting policies
the cash flow statement is presented in accordance with the indirect 
method commencing with net profit for the year. cash flows in foreign 
currencies are translated to dkk at the average exchange rate for the 
respective year.
cash from operating activities converts income statement items from 
the accrual basis of accounting to cash basis. as such, starting with net 
profit, non-cash items are reversed and actual payments included. the 
change in working capital is also taken into account, as this shows the 
development in money tied up in the balance sheet. cash from investing 
activities shows payments related to the purchase and sale of novo nordisk’s 
long-term investments. this includes fixed assets such as construction of 
new production sites, intangible assets such as patents and licences, and 
financial assets.
cash and cash equivalents consists of cash offset by short-term bank 
overdrafts. where short-term bank overdrafts are consistently overdrawn, 
they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. the movement in such 
facilities is presented under financing activities in the cash flow statement. 
financial reserves comprise the sum of cash and cash equivalents at the end 
of the year and undrawn committed credit and loan facilities, with a maturity 
of more than 12 months, less loans and bank overdrafts classified as 
liabilities arising from financing activities contractually obliged for repayment 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

5. the fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net 
invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring 
entity. the factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of 
sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. inputs into 
the estimate of us wholesaler charge-backs are described in note 2.1.
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be categorised 
using the fair value measurement hierarchy above. there were no transfers 
between the ’active market data’ and ’directly or indirectly observable 
market data’ categories during 2020, 2019 or 2018. there are no significant 
intangible assets or items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair 
value.
for a description of the credit quality of financial assets such as trade 
receivables, cash at bank, current debt and derivative financial instruments, 
refer to notes 4.2 and 4.3.
accounting policies
depending on purpose, novo nordisk classifies investments into the 
following categories:
– financial assets at fair value through the income statement
– financial assets at amortised cost
– financial assets at fair value through oci
management determines the classification of its financial assets on initial 
recognition and re-evaluates this at the end of every reporting period to the 
extent that such a classification is permitted or required.
recognition and measurement
purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement 
date. these are initially recognised at fair value.
fair value disclosures are made separately for each class of financial 
instruments at the end of the reporting period.
financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the rights to 
receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred, and novo nordisk 
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
financial assets 'at fair value through the income statement'
financial assets at fair value through the income statement consist of 
equity investments and forward exchange contracts. equity investments are 
included in other financial assets unless management intends to dispose of 
the investment within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. in that 
case, the current part is included in other receivables and prepayments.
net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets 
are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. 
the fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at 
the end of the reporting period. financial assets for which no active market 
exists are carried at fair value based on a valuation methodology.

novo nordisk annual report 2020  /  72
financial assets 'at amortised cost'
financial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative 
financial assets solely with payments of principal and interest. novo nordisk 
normally 'holds-to-collect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash 
flows. if collection is expected within one year (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. if not, 
they are presented as non-current assets.
trade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and other 
receivables are recognised initially at fair value. subsequently they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
allowance for doubtful receivables. 
financial assets 'at fair value through other comprehensive income'
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade 
receivables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.
financial liabilities 'at fair value through the income statement'
financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement consist of 
forward exchange contracts.
financial liabilities 'at amortised cost'
financial liabilities at amortised cost consist of bank overdrafts, trade 
payables and other liabilities.

accounting policies
as described in note 4.2 management has chosen to classify the result 
of hedging activities as part of financial items in the income statement 
except for cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable 
non-financial asset purchases, where the cumulative value adjustments are 
transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the 
asset when recognised. 
financial items primarily relate to foreign exchange elements and are 
mainly impacted by the cumulative value adjustment of cash flow hedges 
transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement 
when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement. 
in addition, value adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in 
financial income and financial expenses along with any value adjustments of 
the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. finally, 
value adjustments of foreign currency assets and liabilities in non-hedged 
currencies will impact financial income and financial expenses.

1. in 2017 novo nordisk introduced, for the first time, a share-based compensation 
programme with terms which amortises the grant date valuation over four years. the 
2020 expense includes amortisation of the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 programmes. 
restricted stock units to employees
in appreciation of the efforts of employees during recent years, as of 1 
august 2019, all employees in the company were offered 75 restricted 
stock units. a restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one 
novo nordisk b share free of charge in february 2023 subject to continued 
employment. the cost of the dkk 660 million programme is amortised over 
the vesting period.
long-term share-based incentive programme
management board
on 2 february 2021, the board of directors approved the allocation of a 
total of 370,038 novo nordisk b shares to the members of the management 
board for the 2020 financial year. the value at launch of the programme 
(adjusted for expected dividends) was dkk 152 million. on average, this 
corresponds to 14.9 months’ fixed base salary plus pension contribution 
for the ceo, 11.2 months’ fixed base salary plus pension contribution 
per executive vice president as of 1 march 2020 and 8.3 months’ fixed 
base salary plus pension for senior vice presidents. the cost of the 2020 
programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2020-2023 at an annual 
amount of dkk 38 million. the amount of shares allocated may be reduced 
or increased by up to 30%, depending on whether the average sales growth 
per year in the three-year vesting period deviates from a target set by the 
board of directors. 
the grant date of the programme was february 2020, and the share 
price used for the determining the grant date fair value of the award was 
the average share price (dkk 435) for novo nordisk b shares on nasdaq 
copenhagen in the period 5-19 february 2020, adjusted for the expected 
dividend. based on the split of participants when the share allocation was 
decided, 47% of the allocated shares will be allocated to members of executive 
management and 53% to other members of the management board.
the shares allocated to the pool for 2017 were released to the individual 
participants subsequent to approval of the 2020 annual report by the 
board of directors and after the announcement of the 2020 full-year 
financial results on 3 february 2021. the shares allocated correspond 
to a value at launch of the programme of dkk 76 million, expensed over 
the vesting period of 2017-2020. the number of shares to be transferred 
(331,587 shares) is lower than the original number of shares allocated, as 
some participants had left the company before the programme's release 
conditions were met.
all restricted stock units and shares allocated to management are hedged by 
treasury shares.
management group below management board
the management group below the management board has a share-based 
incentive programme with similar performance criteria. for 2020, a total 
of 1,011,692 shares were allocated to this group, corresponding to a value 
at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) of dkk 416 
million. the cost of the 2020 programme is amortised over the vesting 
period of 2020-2023 at an annual amount of dkk 104 million. the amount of 
shares allocated may be reduced or increased by up to 30%, depending on 
whether the average sales growth per year in the three-year vesting period 
deviates from a target set by the board of directors.
the shares allocated for 2017 were released to the individual participants 
subsequent to approval of the 2020 annual report by the board of directors 
and after the announcement of the 2020 full-year financial results on 3 
february 2021. the shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of 
the programme of dkk 162 million amortised over the period 2017-2020. 
the number of shares to be transferred (635,516 shares) is lower than 
the original number of shares allocated, as some participants had left the 
company before the programme’s release conditions were met.
accounting policies
share-based compensation
novo nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.
the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of 
any non-market vesting conditions. the fair value is fixed at the grant date, 
and adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares 
that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, novo nordisk 
revises its estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. novo nordisk 
recognises the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in 
proceeds) over the remaining vesting period. adjustments relating to prior 
years are included in the income statement in the year of adjustment.

1. predominantly relates to estimated variable property taxes, leases committed not yet commenced and low value assets. 
2. potential milestone payments are associated with uncertainty as they are linked to successful achievements in research activities.
contractual obligations
the lease commitments are related to ifrs 16 leases primarily for premises 
and company cars and include the present value of future lease payments 
during the lease term. approximately 75% of the commitments are related 
to leases outside denmark. 
research and development obligations include contingent payments related 
to achieving development milestones. such amounts entail uncertainties in 
relation to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of 
the obligations are dependent on milestone achievements. exercise fees 
and subsequent milestone payments under in-licensing option agreements 
are excluded, as novo nordisk is not contractually obligated to make such 
payments. commercial product launch milestones include contingent 
payments solely related to achievement of a commercial product launch 
following regulatory approval. commercial milestones, royalties and 
other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of 
goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual 
commitments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future 
sales. the due periods disclosed are based on management’s best estimate.
the purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase agreements regarding 
medical equipment and consumer goods. novo nordisk expects to fund 
these commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.
other guarantees
other guarantees amounts to dkk 1,117 million (dkk 906 million in 2019). 
other guarantees primarily relate to performance guarantees issued by 
novo nordisk. 
world diabetes foundation (wdf)
at the annual general meeting in 2020, a donation to wdf was approved, 
thereby replacing the remaining five years of the former donation approved 
by the annual general meeting in 2014, which covered the period 2018-
2024. for the years 2020-2024, the donation is calculated as 0.085% of novo 
nordisk's total diabetes care net sales. the annual donation cannot exceed 
dkk 91 million in 2020, dkk 92 million in 2021, dkk 93 million in 2022, dkk 
94 million in 2023, ending at dkk 95 million in 2024, or 15% of the taxable 
income of novo nordisk a/s in the financial year in question, whichever is 
the lowest. in addition, in 2020 novo nordisk a/s granted a special one-off 
contribution of dkk 50 million.
for 2020, the total amount to wdf was dkk 138 million (dkk 86 million in 
2019 and dkk 85 million in 2018).

5.5 general accounting policies
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the parent company novo nordisk a/s and entities controlled by novo 
nordisk a/s. control exists when novo nordisk has effective power over the 
entity and has the right to variable returns from the entity.
where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the financial statements 
of subsidiaries in line with the novo nordisk group's accounting policies. all 
intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in 
full when consolidated.
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal.
translation of foreign currencies
functional and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of novo nordisk's entities are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (functional currency). the consolidated financial 
statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is also the 
functional and presentation currency of the parent company.
translation of transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
foreign currency differences arising from the translation of effective 
qualifying cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
translation of group companies
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into dkk at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period for balance 
sheet items, and at average exchange rates for income statement items. 
all effects of exchange rate adjustments are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, i.e.:
– the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ net assets at the beginning of the 
year to the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
– the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ statements of comprehensive 
income at average to year-end exchange rates.

non-ifrs financial 
measures 
(part of management's review – not audited)
in the annual report, novo nordisk discloses certain financial measures of 
the group’s financial performance, financial position and cash flows that 
reflect adjustments to the most directly comparable measures calculated 
and presented in accordance with ifrs. these non-ifrs financial measures 
may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner, 
and may thus not be comparable.
the non-ifrs financial measures presented in the annual report are:
– sales and operating profit in constant exchange rates
– operating profit after tax to net operating assets (opat/noa)
– financial reserves
– free cash flow
– cash to earnings
 refers to an ifrs financial measure.
sales and operating profit growth in constant exchange rates
'growth in constant exchange rates’ means that the effect of changes in 
exchange rates is excluded. it is defined as sales/operating profit for the 
period measured at the average exchange rates for the same period of the 
prior year compared with net sales/operating profit for the same period of 
the prior year. price adjustments within hyperinflation countries as defined 
in ias 29 ‘financial reporting in hyperinflation economies’ are excluded from 
the calculation to avoid growth in constant exchange rates being artificially 
inflated.
growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information 
for investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales 
and operating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.

operating profit after tax to net operating assets (opat/noa)
operating profit after tax to net operating assets is defined as ‘operating 
profit after tax‘ (using the effective tax rate) as a percentage of average 
inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets 
and deferred tax assets, less non-interest-bearing liabilities including 
provisions and deferred tax liabilities (where average is the sum of the 
above assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year and at year-end 
divided by two). 
management believes operating profit after tax to net operating assets is 
a useful measure in providing investors and management with information 
regarding the group's performance. the calculation of this financial target 
is a widely accepted measure of earnings efficiency in relation to total 
capital employed.

cash to earnings
cash to earnings is defined as 'free cash flow as a percentage of net profit'.
management believes that cash to earnings is an important performance 
metric because it measures the group’s ability to turn earnings into cash. 
since management wants this measure to capture the ability of the group’s 
operations to generate cash, free cash flow is used as the numerator instead 
of net cash flow.

financial reserves
'financial reserves at the end of the year' is defined as the sum of cash and 
cash equivalents at the end of the year and undrawn committed credit and 
loan facilities, with a maturity of more than 12 months, less loans and bank 
overdrafts classified as liabilities arising from financing activities with obliged 
repayment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
management believes that financial reserves at the end of the year are an 
important measure of the group's financial strength from an investor's 
perspective, capturing the robustness of the group's financial position and 
its financial preparedness for unforeseen developments.

2. financial reserves include amounts undrawn under credit facilities and overdrafts 
where the repayment of such facilities or overdrafts is not contractually required 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date. financial reserves include the dkk 5,577 
million (eur 750 million) undrawn portion of a bridge facility as the terms of the facility 
provide that the maturity can be extended, at the option of novo nordisk, through 
june 2022. in accordance with ifrs, the dkk 5,577 million (eur 750 million) drawn 
portion of the bridge facility has nevertheless been classified as current debt as it is 
management’s expectation that the facility will be repaid in 2021. 
free cash flow
novo nordisk used to define free cash flow as ‘net cash generated from 
operating activities’ less ‘net cash used in investing activities’.
from 1 january 2019, novo nordisk has defined free cash flow as ’net cash 
generated from operating activities’, less ‘net cash used in investing activities’, 
less repayment on lease liabilities. the updated definition reflects the imple-
mentation of ifrs 16, which accordingly has a neutral effect on free cash flow.
free cash flow is a measure of the amount of cash generated in the period 
which is available for the board to allocate between novo nordisk's capital 
providers, through measures such as dividends, share repurchases and 
repayment of debt (excluding lease liability repayments) or for retaining in 
the business to fund future growth.

notes to the consolidated esg statement
section 6
basis of preparation
general reporting standards and principles
novo nordisk's annual reporting complies with the danish financial 
statements act. sections 99a, 99b and 107d specify the requirements of 
the eu directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information 
to report on the management of risks related to the environment, climate, 
human rights, labour and social conditions, anti-corruption and gender 
distribution. these requirements are addressed in the management review. 
novo nordisk also adheres to the international integrated reporting 
framework and the aa1000ap(2018), which states that reporting must 
provide a complete, accurate, relevant and balanced picture of the 
organisation’s approach to and impact on stakeholders and society.
novo nordisk is an active member of the world's leading circular economy 
network, the ellen macarthur foundation.
as recommended by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures 
(tcfd), novo nordisk is working to integrate two climate change scenarios 
into the risk management process to identify short, medium and long-term 
risks within our production and supply chain: 
– 2⁰c scenario, consistent with meeting the paris agreement goal 
(representative concentration pathway rcp 2.6)
– 4⁰c scenario as an alternative high-emission scenario (rcp 8.5)
novo nordisk discloses in accordance with the recommendations put 
forward by the carbon disclosure project (cdp). for a full breakdown of 
climate and water impacts, please refer to the publicly available report of 
novo nordisk cdp disclosures. 
novo nordisk applies aa1000ap(2018) as a component in creating 
a generally applicable approach to assessing and strengthening the 
credibility of the group's public reporting of esg information. novo nordisk 
has designed processes to ensure that the qualitative and quantitative 
information that documents the esg dimensions of performance is 
assured, as well as the systems that underpin the data and performance. 
the principles outlined in aa1000ap(2018) have been applied as described 
below.
inclusivity
as a pharmaceutical business with global reach, novo nordisk is committed 
to being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the 
organisation. from the perspective of social responsibility, the key 
stakeholder groups are patients who rely on novo nordisk products, 
employees at novo nordisk and throughout the group's value chain, 
business partners and local communities. novo nordisk maps its 
stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion of stakeholder 
concerns and expectations. in addition, novo nordisk continuously develops 
its stakeholder engagement and capacity to be a sustainable business at 
corporate, regional and affiliate levels. see how novo nordisk defines what is 
meant by sustainable business in 'purpose & sustainability'.
materiality
key issues are identified through ongoing stakeholder engagement 
and trendspotting, informed by data-driven analysis and addressed by 
programmes or action plans with clear and measurable targets. the issues 
presented in the annual report are deemed to have a significant impact on 
the group's future business performance and may support stakeholders in 
their decision-making.
responsiveness
the annual report reflects how the company is managing operations in 
ways that consider and respond to stakeholder concerns and interests. the 
report reaches out to a wide range of stakeholders, each with specific needs 
and interests. the annual report is prepared with investors in mind. to 
these stakeholders, however, as well as to the many other groups who may 
seek information in the annual report, this is just one element of interaction 
and communication with the company.
impact
understanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative 
impacts on society and the environment of novo nordisk's activities are 
important. novo nordisk is currently working on developing methodologies 
to be better able to do just that, covering the entire value chain.
applying materiality
the consolidated esg statement is a result of assessing legal requirements 
and disclosure commitments applicable to novo nordisk. whether 
information is tied directly or indirectly to novo nordisk's ability to create 
value over the short, medium and long term is also assessed. when 
assessing whether a disclosure is material to include in the consolidated esg 
statement, management considers whether the matter is of such relevance 
and importance that it could substantively influence the assessment by 
providers of financial capital of novo nordisk's ability to create value over the 
short, medium and long term. see more at novonordisk.com. 
principles of consolidation
the environmental disclosures covers the production sites, laboratories and 
offices with significant activities. co2 emissions related to transportation 
cover cars leased or owned by novo nordisk, business flights and suppliers 
distributing novo nordisk products.
the social and governance-related disclosures cover the novo nordisk group, 
comprising novo nordisk a/s and entities controlled by novo nordisk a/s.
accounting policies
the accounting policies set out below in the notes have been applied 
consistently in the preparation of the consolidated esg statement for all the 
years presented.
changes to accounting policies and disclosures
children reached through the changing diabetes in children programme 
(cdic) has been added to expand disclosure to align with the defeat 
diabetes strategy.
gender in the board of directors (bod) (ratio men:women) has been added 
to expand on the diversity reporting.

novo nordisk has a long-term target of zero co2 emissions from operations 
and transportation by 2030. 
in 2020, co2 emissions from operations and transportation decreased by 
44%. the decrease was due to the implementation of renewable energy 
initiatives in production, as well as impacts from covid-19 on transportation.
co2 emissions from production decreased by 57% due to the 
implementation of renewable heat and steam in kalundborg, denmark, wind 
power in france, algeria and russia, and solar power in the us.

energy consumption for production increased by 11% primarily due to a 
new api production facility in clayton, north carolina. energy consumption 
in office buildings and laboratories decreased by 12% due to both energy- 
saving projects and covid-19 shutdowns. 
energy-saving projects implemented in 2020 within production sites are 
expected to result in annual savings of 94,000 gj.
in 2020, 100% of power sourced at production sites was from renewable 
energy, an increase from 76% in 2019. this is due to five production sites, 
including north america, russia and france, now also sourcing renewable 
power starting in 2020.
accounting policies
energy consumption for operations is measured as consumption of power, 
steam, heat and fuel. the fuel is mainly from natural gas, biogas and wood. 
energy consumption is based on meter readings and invoices and covers 
all energy types at production sites and laboratories and consumption of 
power at office buildings outside of production sites. 
the share of renewable power used at production sites is reported 
according to the greenhouse gas (ghg) protocol scope 2 guideline. it 
is calculated as the sum of power in each country that comes from 100% 
renewable sources, either sourced or self-produced.
7.2 water consumption for production sites 
in 2020, production sites consumed 3,368,000 cubic metres of water, 
an increase of 7% compared with 2019 due to the start-up of a new api 
production facility in clayton, north carolina. 
four production sites, including china and brazil, are in areas subject to 
water stress or high seasonal variations. they consume 11% of the total 
water for global production. overall, water consumption at these facilities 
decreased by 15% in 2020, despite adding new sites. this was due to 
significant water-saving projects implemented in china and brazil.
accounting policies
water consumption is measured based on meter readings and invoices. it 
includes drinking water, industrial water and steam used at production sites.
section 7
environmental 
performance
co2 emissions from global offices and laboratories decreased by 38% in 
2020. as part of the circular for zero strategy, all offices and laboratories 
will source renewable power by 2030. in 2020, co2 emissions from office 
buildings and laboratories decreased, primarily due to energy-saving 
projects and impacts from covid-19.
in 2020, emissions from product distribution decreased by 24%, primarily 
driven by optimisation projects to move products shipped from air to sea 
freight despite supply and market challenges.
co2 emissions from business flights decreased by 71%, and emissions from 
company cars decreased by 27%. this was due to impacts from covid-19.
a full breakdown of scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from novo nordisk can be 
found at cdp.net.
accounting policies
co2 emissions from operations (production, office buildings and 
laboratories)
co2 emissions from operations cover consumption of power, fuel, heat 
and steam at office buildings in denmark, global production sites and 
laboratories, and consumption of power in office buildings outside denmark. 
emissions are measured in metric tonnes, calculated according to the ghg 
protocol and based on emission factors from the previous year.
co2 emissions from product distribution
co2 emissions from product distribution are calculated by external 
transportation suppliers as the estimated emissions from product 
distribution in metric tonnes. co2 emissions are calculated based on the 
worldwide distribution of semi-finished and finished products, raw materials 
and components by air, sea and road between production sites and from 
production sites to subsidiaries, direct customers and importing distributors. 
co2 emissions from product distribution from subsidiaries to pharmacies, 
hospitals and wholesalers are not included.
co2 emissions from business flights
co2 emissions from business flights are estimated based on mileage 
and emission factors for short, medium and long-haul flights along with 
passenger class obtained from travel agencies.
co2 emissions from company cars
co2 emissions from company cars cover cars leased or owned by novo 
nordisk. emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factors by the 
volumes of diesel and petrol used.

8.1 patients reached with novo nordisk's diabetes 
care products
the estimated number of full-year patients reached with novo nordisk's 
diabetes care products increased from 30.0 million in 2019 to 32.8. million in 
2020. this 9% increase was primarily driven by sales of long-acting, premix 
and fast-acting insulins, human insulin and glp-1 products.
in 2020, the estimated number of patients reached with novo nordisk's 
diabetes care products via the access to insulin commitment was 3.2 
million, compared with 2.9 million in 2019. novo nordisk sold insulin 
according to this commitment in 34 countries of the 76 countries in scope. 
beyond this scheme, novo nordisk also sold human insulin below the 
ceiling price in other countries, reaching an estimated additional 3.1 million 
patients in 2020. approximately 130,000 patients were reached through 
human insulin vial donations to humanitarian organisations.
through the changing diabetes in children programme, 28,296 children 
had been reached by the end of 2020, compared with 25,695 in 2019. 
accounting policies
the number of full-year patients reached with novo nordisk's diabetes 
care products, excluding devices and prandimet®, is estimated by dividing 
novo nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient 
for each product class as defined by the world health organization (who). 
prandimet® is not included as no who-defined dosage exists. who has not 
yet assigned a daily dose for rybelsus®. for this calculation, it is assumed 
that one tablet equals one patient treatment day.
the number of full-year patients reached with novo nordisk's diabetes care 
products (human insulin in vials) via the access to insulin commitment (atic) 
is estimated by dividing novo nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual 
usage dose per patient reached via the atic as defined by who. 
the who-defined daily dosage has not changed since 1982, except for 
victoza® which was changed in 2019, and may not accurately reflect 
the recommended or prescribed daily dose. actual doses are based on 
individual characteristics (e.g. age and weight) and pharmacokinetic 
considerations. despite this uncertainty, novo nordisk assesses this to be 
the most consistent way of reporting.
the number of children reached with free diabetes care treatment through 
the changing diabetes in children programme is measured as the total 
accumulated number of children reached at the end of the year since 2009, 
when the programme was initiated.

the nnhf supports programmes in low- and middle-income countries. 
initiatives focus on capacity-building, diagnosis and registry, awareness and 
advocacy. since 2005, the nnhf has provided funding for 296 programmes 
in 78 countries. see nnhf.org.
furthermore, dkk 165 million was granted to the antimicrobial resistance
research (amr) action fund, the largest collective fund ever established 
to support vital research into antimicrobial resistance research and 
development. it is categorised as an equity investment and therefore not 
expensed in the income statement.
accounting policies
donations and other contributions by novo nordisk to the wdf and the 
nnhf are recognised as an expense when the donation or contribution is 
paid out or when an unconditional commitment to donate has been made.

1. organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active 
pharmaceutical ingredients, where the energy is recovered in biogas plants and the 
digested slurry is used on local farmland as fertiliser.
2. ethanol is used in purification of diabetes care and biopharm products. the ethanol 
is recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used many times. the ethanol 
waste reported here is from production with no regeneration or residues from the 
regeneration process.
3. energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant.
4. water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as 
hazardous waste for incineration and various other types of waste.
in 2020, waste from production sites increased by 14% compared with 2019. 
the amount of waste recycled increased by 20% in 2020 primarily due to an 
increase in production in kalundborg, denmark. 
the amount of waste sent for energy recovery decreased by 17% primarily 
due to a distillation method within api production to reuse ethanol  
internally instead of sending it for incineration with energy recovery.
in 2020, 93% of the total waste from production sites was recycled, used for 
biogas production or incinerated at plants where the energy is used for heat 
and power production. less than 1% of total waste was sent to landfill.
14% of the waste is categorised as hazardous waste, a decrease from 18% 
in 2019. this reduction was due to a reduction in ethanol waste from the 
production of api for diabetes and obesity care.
accounting policies
waste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed of at production 
sites based on weight receipts.

the number of animals purchased for research in 2020 increased by 1% 
compared with 2019 due to the purchase of fish. the overall development  
reflects the changes in stages of the different research projects. however, 
for 2020 the animals purchased for research are also impacted by the overall 
covid-19 situation. the reduction in the number of rodents purchased also 
reflects novo nordisk's continuous focus on reducing the number of animals 
per research project. 78% of the animals purchased were rodents.
8.4 frequency of occupational accidents
the average frequency rate of occupational accidents with absence was 1.3 
accidents per million working hours in 2020, compared with 2.2 in 2019, 
due to a 39% decrease in the number of accidents. in 2020, as in 2019, 
novo nordisk had one work-related fatality. the significant decrease in the 
number of occupational accidents is attributed to the global covid-19-
related lockdown. our production sites, which have remained in operation 
during the lockdown, also show a decline in the number of occupational 
accidents with absence. novo nordisk works with a zero-injury mindset and 
has a long-term commitment to continuously improving safety performance.
accounting policies
the frequency of occupational accidents with absence is measured as the 
internally reported number of accidents using full-time employees, excluding 
externals, employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master 
thesis employees and substitutes, per million nominal working hours. an 
occupational accident with absence is any work-related accident causing at 
least one day of absence in addition to the day of the accident.

the growth in employees was mainly driven by international operations, 
with the highest growth rate in china. novo nordisk also continues to 
increase the number of employees in global business services in india, 
which grew by 14% compared with last year.
the employee turnover rate decreased significantly from 11.4% in 2019 to 
7.9% in 2020, and it is assumed to be related to the covid-19 pandemic.   
accounting policies
the number of employees is recorded as all employees except externals, 
employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees 
and substitutes at year-end. 
employees are attributed to geographical regions according to their 
primary workplace across the commercial units, research and development, 
production and support functions. employees in corporate functions are 
included in emea, and employees in global business service in bangalore, 
india are included in rest of world.
the rate of turnover is measured as the number of employees, excluding 
temporary employees, who left the group during the financial year divided 
by the average number of employees, excluding temporary employees. 
employees working for group companies that have been disposed of are 
not counted as having left the group. 
employee engagement is measured on a scale of 1–5 and based on 
questions relating to employee engagement in the annual employee survey, 
ourvoice. the score is calculated as the proportion of employees who 
responded favourably (4 or 5) to relevant questions.
accounting policies
the record of animals purchased for research comprises the number of 
animals purchased for all research undertaken by novo nordisk either 
in-house or by external contractors. the number of animals purchased is 
based on internal registration of purchased animals and yearly reports from 
external contractors.

the number of audits concluded in 2020 decreased by 25% compared with 
2019. the decrease was due to covid-19-related restrictions imposed 
on travel and general ability to access suppliers' facilities and subsequent 
postponement of planned audits. no critical findings were issued related to 
responsible sourcing audits, while one critical finding was issued related to 
quality audits regarding handling of controlled waste. a follow-up audit has 
since been conducted, where the finding was found to have been closed 
satisfactorily.
accounting policies
the number of supplier audits concluded by novo nordisk's corporate 
quality function consists of the number of responsible sourcing audits and 
quality audits conducted at suppliers.
employees and management are interviewed. identified gaps and 
improvement opportunities related to the novo nordisk way are presented 
to and discussed with management. the facilitators and management agree 
on an action plan to address those gaps and improvement opportunities.
9.2 facilitations of the novo nordisk way
in 2020, a total of 26 units were facilitated and more than 1,200 employees, 
were individually interviewed. in addition, feedback on those units was 
collected from approximately 340 stakeholders. 
overall, the 2020 process continues to show a good level of adherence 
to the novo nordisk way. three units were found to be in breach of one 
or more of the novo nordisk essentials. the essential with the strongest 
performance continues to be the 'patient-centred business approach'. 
in 2020, partly driven by the focus on strengthening the culture journey, 
significantly more findings were issued related to the essential 'we set 
ambitious goals and strive for excellence'. 
accounting policies
facilitations of the novo nordisk way is measured as the number of 
facilitations and culture coaching sessions completed. both are internal 
processes for assessing adherence with the novo nordisk way. the 
assessments are based on review of documentation and feedback from 
stakeholders followed by an on-site visit during which randomly selected 
9.4 product recalls
novo nordisk had no product recalls from the market in 2020, compared 
with four in 2019. to verify that the product recall process remains robust 
and efficient, a mock recall was effectuated in 18 affiliates worldwide. based 
on that, the product recall process has been evaluated and concluded to be 
effective. 
accounting policies
the number of product recalls is recorded as the number of times novo 
nordisk has instituted a recall and includes recalls in connection with clinical 
trials. a recall can affect various countries.
9.1 business ethics
accounting policies
the mandatory business ethics training is based on the business ethics 
code of conduct in the form of globally applicable e-learning, and related 
tests released annually by the novo nordisk business ethics compliance 
office. the percentage of employees completing the training is calculated as 
the percentage of completion of training in both the code of conduct and 
related tests, based on internal registrations.
the number of business ethics reviews is recorded as the number of 
business ethics reviews performed by group internal audit in subsidiaries, 
production sites and headquarter areas.

auditor’s reports
to the shareholders of novo nordisk a/s
report on the audit of the financial statements
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the group’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the group’s 
operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by the 
international accounting standards board and in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by 
the eu and further requirements in the danish financial statements act.
moreover, in our opinion, the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the parent company’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and of the results 
of the parent company’s operations for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 
in accordance with the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report to the audit committee 
and the board of directors.
what we have audited 
the consolidated financial statements of novo nordisk a/s for the financial year 1 
january to 31 december 2020, section ‘consolidated financial statements’, comprise 
income statement and statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement, 
balance sheet, equity statement and notes, including summary of significant accounting 
policies.
the parent company financial statements of novo nordisk a/s for the financial year 1 
january to 31 december 2020, section ‘financial statements of the parent company’, 
comprise income statement, balance sheet, equity statement and notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies.
collectively referred to as the “financial statements”.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) 
and the additional requirements applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards 
board for accountants’ code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 
5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided.
appointment 
we were first appointed auditors of novo nordisk a/s in april 1982 for the financial year 
1982. we have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period 
of uninterrupted engagement of 39 years including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
revenue recognition relating to rebates and discounts in the us business
the group sells to various customers in the us, which can fall under certain commercial 
and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrangements, of which the 
most significant are managed care, medicare, medicaid and charge-backs to wholesalers.
these arrangements result in deductions to gross sales in arriving at net sales and 
give rise to obligations for the group to provide customers with rebates, discounts and 
allowances, which for unsettled amounts are recognised as an accrual.
we focused on this area because rebates, discounts and allowances are complex and 
because establishing an appropriate accrual requires significant judgement and estimation 
by management. this judgement is particularly complex in a us healthcare environment in 
which competitive pricing pressure and product discounting are growing trends. 
refer to note 2.1 and note 3.6.
we obtained management’s calculations for accruals under applicable schemes and 
assessed the significance of assumptions applied by comparing them to the stated 
commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts, third party data and historical 
levels of paid rebates and discounts in the us business. 
 
we compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, 
allowances and to current payment trends. we also considered the historical accuracy of 
the group’s estimates.  
 
we formed an independent assessment of the most significant elements of the accrual 
at 31 december 2020 using third party data and compared this expectation to the actual 
accrual recognised.

statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review, section ‘managements review’.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s review, and we 
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
management’s review and, in doing so, consider whether management’s review is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s review includes the disclosures 
required by the danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s review is in 
accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the danish financial statements act. we did not identify any material misstatement in 
management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards board and in accordance with 
ifrs as endorsed by the eu and further requirements in the danish financial statements 
act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with the danish financial statements act, and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. 
we also: 
– identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
– obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
– evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
– conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s 
and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions 
may cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
– evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
– obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of 
the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial statements we performed procedures to express 
an opinion on whether the annual report of novo nordisk a/s for the financial year 1 
january to 31 december 2020 with the file name novo-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in 
all material respects, in compliance with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic format (esef regulation) which includes 
requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation. this responsibility includes:
– the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format;
– the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, including extensions to the 
esef taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial 
information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;
– ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the consolidated financial 
statements presented in human-readable format; and
– for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the 
preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is 
prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the esef regulation based on the 
evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. the nature, 
timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the 
esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error. the procedures include:
– testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format;
– obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging process and of internal 
control over the tagging process;
– evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements;
– evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl elements selected from 
the esef taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element 
in the esef taxonomy has been identified;     
– evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the esef 
taxonomy; and
– reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of novo nordisk a/s for the financial year 1 january to 
31 december 2020 with the file name novo-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef regulation.

independent assurance report on the esg statement
to the stakeholders of novo nordisk a/s
novo nordisk a/s engaged us to provide limited assurance on the consolidated esg 
statement stated in the annual report of novo nordisk for the year ended 31 december 
2020.
our conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained:
a. nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated esg 
statement of novo nordisk’s annual report for the year ended 31 december 2020 has 
not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
and
b. nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the description of 
novo nordisk’s alignment with the aa1000 accountability principles (aa1000ap) (2018) 
of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact is not fairly stated.
this conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report. 
what we are assuring 
the scope of our work was limited to assurance over:
a. the consolidated esg statement and associated notes on pages 81 - 87 in the annual 
report of novo nordisk;
b. novo nordisk’s description of alignment with the aa1000ap principles of inclusivity, 
materiality, responsiveness and impact for the year ended 31 december 2020 which is 
set out on page 82 (the stakeholder engagement description) of the annual report.
professional standards applied and level of assurance
we performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with international 
standard on assurance engagements 3000 (revised) ‘assurance engagements other than 
audits and reviews of historical financial information’ and, in respect of the greenhouse 
gas emissions stated on pages 81 and 83 in accordance with international standard on 
assurance engagements 3410 ‘assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements’ 
and aa1000 assurance standard (aa1000as, 2008) with 2018 addendum (type 2, 
moderate, which is the equivalent to isae 3000 limited assurance). a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 
control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, 
the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control
we have complied with the code of ethics for professional accountants issued by the 
international ethics standards board for accountants, which includes independence and 
other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. we 
also qualify as independent as defined by the aa1000as. the firm applies international 
standard on quality control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with 
experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
the consolidated esg statement needs to be read and understood together with the 
reporting criteria (pages 82 - 87), which novo nordisk a/s is solely responsible for selecting 
and applying. the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw 
to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, 
measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time. 
work performed
a. we are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material 
misstatement of the consolidated esg statement. in doing so, we:
– conducted interviews to understand the key processes and control activities for 
reporting data;
– obtained an understanding of the key processes and controls for managing, recording 
and reporting;
– performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis to check that data had been 
appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;
– performed analysis of data selected on the basis of risk and materiality to the group;
– made inquiries to significant development in reported data;
– considered the presentation and disclosure of the consolidated esg statement; and 
– assessed that the process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions data comply with 
the principles of relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy 
outlined in the greenhouse gas protocol (2003).
b. in respect of novo nordisk’s description of alignment with the aa1000ap of inclusivity, 
materiality, responsiveness and impact we performed the following activities:
– interviewed members of novo nordisk’s board of directors and executive management 
team, representatives responsible for corporate and commercial strategy at global 
level and within international operations, key employees in global public affairs 
and sustainability to determine their understanding of novo nordisk’s stakeholders, 
the mechanisms used to engage them and key issues that are of interest to each 
stakeholder group;
– interviewed external stakeholders to determine their perception of novo nordisk’s 
stakeholder engagement capabilities, particularly, in relation to understanding and 
responding to material concerns, needs and desires linked to access and affordability 
regarding medicin and circular for zero;
– reviewed evidence on a selective basis to support the assertions made in these 
interviews and in the stakeholder engagement description;
– confirmed the systems and procedures to support novo nordisk’s governance for 
responsible business conduct and stakeholder relationships. our work focused on 
how novo nordisk intends to deliver on the atrategic aspiration of purpose and 
sustainability and to what extend it is aligned with stakeholder needs and concerns and 
novo nordisk’s aim of being a truly sustainable company; and
– assessed the disclosure and presentation of the stakeholder engagement description.
novo nordisk’s responsibilities
management are responsible for:
– designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over information relevant 
to the preparation of the consolidated esg statement that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
– establishing objective reporting criteria for preparing the consolidated esg statement;
– preparing the greenhouse gas protocol statement in accordance with the defined 
reporting criteria. greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty 
because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and 
the values needed to combine emissions of different gases;
– measuring and reporting the consolidated esg statement based on the reporting 
criteria; and
– the content of the annual report 2020.
our responsibility
we are responsible for:
– planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether 
the consolidated esg statement is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error;
– forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we performed and the 
evidence we obtained; and
– reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of novo nordisk a/s.
observations and recommendations
according to aa1000as, we are required to include observations and recommendations 
for improvements in relation to adherence to the aa1000ap. we have no significant 
recommendations regarding inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact. we 
have communicated a number of minor recommendations for improvement to the 
management.

1 accounting policies
the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in 
accordance with the danish financial statements act (class d) and other 
accounting regulations for companies listed on nasdaq copenhagen. 
the accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company 
are unchanged from the previous financial year except for a change of 
presentation of equity. the accounting policies are the same as for the 
consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. 
for a description of the accounting policies of the group, please refer to the 
consolidated financial statements.
no separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent 
company; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the group.
change of presentation of equity
the danish financial statements act has been amended effective from 1
january 2020 to require an equity reserve corresponding to income and
expenses on cash flow hedges recognised in equity ('reserve for cash flow
hedges'). these transactions have previously been recognised in retained 
earnings. the reserve for cash flow hedges is distributable.
the amendment has been implemented retrospectively. the impact at the
beginning of 2019 is recognition of a reserve for cash flow hedges 
amounting to dkk (1,506) million and a corresponding increase in retained 
earnings. the implementation had no impact on total equity. the movement 
in the reserve for 2019 amounted to dkk 1,183 million, resulting in a reserve 
of dkk (323) million at the end of 2019.
supplementary accounting policies for the parent company
financial assets
in the financial statements of the parent company, investments in 
subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity 
method, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries 
and associated companies. the equity method is used as a measurement 
basis rather than a consolidation method. the net profit of subsidiaries and 
associated companies less unrealised intra-group profits is recorded in the 
income statement of the parent company.
