2020 annual report / management’s review / about genmab
our pipeline
millions of people are diagnosed with cancer each year. cancer 
is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with about 
one in six deaths attributed to cancer. we believe antibody 
therapies are one of the keys to improving the lives of patients 
living with cancer. our antibodies target two main categories of 
cancer: solid tumors and hematological cancers.
solid tumors
a solid tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue 
that usually does not contain any liquid 
or cysts. solid tumors may be malignant 
(cancerous) or benign (non- cancerous). 
solid tumors can occur in several places 
in the body, including the bones, muscles 
and organs. sarcomas and carcinomas are 
examples of solid tumors.
hematological cancers
hematological cancers, also called blood 
cancers, begin in the tissues that form blood, 
such as the bone marrow, or in the cells of 
the immune system. the three main types 
of blood cancers are leukemia, lymphoma 
and myeloma.
genmab is building a strong pipeline of proprietary antibody 
products that have the potential to make a real impact on the lives 
of cancer patients. when we consider which programs to develop, 
we look for differentiated antibodies that are first-in-class, offer 
better efficacy than current treatments, or are better tolerated, and 
have the potential to improve outcomes for cancer patients. in this 
way we are building a knock-your-socks-off pipeline that offers 
multiple possibilities for success and the potential to meet our 2025 
vision, while balancing the risks inherent in drug development. we 
are also working on an extensive portfolio of pre- clinical programs 
to fuel our pipeline of the future and bring us closer to achieving our 
2025 vision.

key events in genmab’s 
22-year journey
a history of accomplishments rooted in science: from our start in copenhagen in 1999, our 
continued commitment to oncology has given us purpose and a drive to improve the lives 
of patients with cancer. we strive to achieve this goal by working together as one team and 
building on our world-class research in antibodies to expand our capabilities beyond the lab.
while we are proud of our past accomplishments for getting us to this point, we keep our 
eyes and minds focused on what is next. our history has been powered by a dedication to 
 developing  antibody-based therapeutics. it is this same spirit that will guide us into the future.

2020 annual report / management’s review / progress toward our 2025 vision
a point of inflection: 
with two potential product launches 
in the coming years, we have never 
been in a better position to achieve 
our vision of transforming the lives of 
cancer patients.
making our 2025 vision a reality:  
genmab is a world-class antibody 
innovation powerhouse. we built 
a strong foundation that includes a 
robust pipeline built on our propri-
etary technology, partnerships with 
innovators and industry leaders and 
a solid financial base with growing 
recurring revenues. genmab’s 
proprietary pipeline consists of 
modified antibody candidates, 
including bispecific t-cell engagers 
and next-generation immune 
checkpoint modulators, effector 
function enhanced antibodies and 
 antibody-drug conjugates.
from clinical to commercial —  
evolution into a fully integrated 
biotech:  
we are building and expanding 
internal capabilities such as medical 
affairs, safety, regulatory and data 
sciences and are strengthening 
our r&d teams with key talent. 
we are also building commercial-
ization excellence as we plan for 
the first genmab labeled medicine. 
taken together, we are growing our 
internal competencies to become an 
end-to-end biotech.
broad oncology collaboration 
with abbvie:  
a landmark event in genmab’s 
history, this collaboration sets us 
on a path to accelerate, broaden 
and maximize the development 
and commercialization of some of 
our promising bispecific antibody 
products with the ultimate goal to 
bring new potential therapies much 
faster to cancer patients.
2020 has further strengthened 
genmab’s position as a world-
class innovation powerhouse 
in oncology:  
we further built up and evolved all 
areas of our business with now more 
than 750 employees.

dear shareholder,
in march of this year i was honored to be elected 
to the position of chair of genmab’s board of 
directors. when i first joined the board, genmab 
was a completely different company than it is 
today. in just three years we have grown our 
pipeline, our capabilities and our ambitions 
as a dual-listed company with more than 750 
employees across four global sites.
a successful strategy
this phenomenal growth begins with our core 
purpose —  to improve the lives of patients by 
creating and developing innovative antibody 
products. this purpose is linked to a laser-sharp 
three-pronged strategy: we focus on our core 
competence —  combining our deep insight into 
antibody biology and disease targets to develop 
next- generation technologies and identify the 
best disease targets, leading to the development 
of differentiated best-in-class and first-in-class 
antibodies. some of these innovations have led to 
medicines that, in turn, have allowed us to build 
a profitable and successful biotech. our vision 
is that by 2025 this strategy will have provided 
us with a pipeline of “knock-your-socks-off” 
antibodies, and our own product will have 
transformed cancer treatment. we are ahead of 
schedule in achieving this 2025 vision and we 
are confident that our strategy will position us for 
continued success in the future.
commitment to corporate 
governance and csr
the board of directors and genmab’s senior 
leadership are also committed to an integrated 
corporate social responsibility (csr) strategy, 
focusing on employee well-being, ethics and 
compliance in relation to our research, the envi-
ronment and business ethics and transparency. 
in 2020 we embarked upon a more focused, 
business-driven csr strategy to steer our efforts 
and build a foundational csr program. a key 
part of this effort included our commitment to 
three united nations sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) that were most closely aligned with 
our business and that our teams can positively

impact. we also benchmarked and examined our environmental, 
social and governance (esg) activities, policies and disclosures to 
build a sustainable organization that meets esg criteria of relevance 
to our business operations. we have adopted the sustainability 
accounting standards board (sasb) framework and will follow its 
guidelines to disclose key metrics on esg activities of relevance to 
our business operations.
as a company we also work diligently to continually improve our 
guidelines and policies for corporate governance, always taking 
into account trends in international and domestic requirements 
and recommendations. this commitment to corporate governance, 
like our dedication to csr, is based on ethics and integrity. our 
commitment to corporate governance also forms the basis of 
our effort to strengthen the confidence that existing and future 
shareholders, partners, employees and other stakeholders have 
in genmab. the role of shareholders and their interaction with 
genmab is important and open and transparent communication is 
paramount to maintain the confidence of genmab’s shareholders. 
as such, we conduct regular outreach and engage with our 
shareholders throughout the year.
experienced leadership
in february of 2020 our long-tenured chief financial officer 
(cfo), david eatwell, retired from the company, and we welcomed 
anthony pagano into this position. mr. pagano joined genmab 
in 2007 and even prior to becoming cfo, he played a key role in 
genmab’s success and corporate development.
we further strengthened our executive management team in 
march with the appointment of anthony mancini as chief operating 
officer (coo). mr. mancini brought to genmab, and to this newly 
created role, strategic and operational leadership as well as a 
consistent track record of growth across north america, europe 
and australia.
we also welcomed a new member to our board, jonathan peacock. 
previously cfo at both novartis and amgen, he brings with him 
extensive experience in corporate finance, strategy and interna-
tional expansion in the pharmaceutical industry.
in 2020 we continued to successfully execute our strategy to 
achieve our vision; we are progressing toward launching our own 
products so that patients with cancer may benefit from our inno-
vations; and we are on a trajectory to become a fully integrated 
biotech and global oncology leader.
on behalf of the board, i would like to thank genmab’s dedicated 
employees for their commitment to the company during this chal-
lenging year, jan van de winkel and the rest of the senior leadership 
team for their inspiration and extraordinary leadership and all of our 
shareholders for their continued support.
sincerely,

dear shareholder,
the past year was like no other in the history of 
genmab. the challenges posed by the global 
covid-19 pandemic were extraordinary, but 
so, too, are genmab’s passionate and talented 
employees. i am proud to say that as an orga-
nization, we not only rose to meet the global 
challenges presented by 2020; we made tremen-
dous strides in our evolution into a leading, fully 
integrated innovation powerhouse, and are closer 
than ever to achieving our 2025 vision of trans-
forming cancer treatment.
a transformational year
genmab has a strong foundation of innovative 
science and an unparalleled history of repeated 
success in research and development. over the 
course of the past few years, we strategically built 
on this foundation with the goal of evolving into 
a fully-integrated end-to-end biotech. in 2020 
we reached an inflection point in this evolution, 
created by a series of key events, including our 
broad oncology collaboration with abbvie, the 
opening of our  cutting-edge laboratories in the 
u.s. and the strategic development of our internal 
capabilities across our global sites —  including 
our latest location in tokyo, japan.
by itself, the collaboration with abbvie is 
a landmark achievement for genmab. both 
companies share a deep commitment to making 
a difference for patients, as well as a solid track 
record of innovation. the agreement put us on 
a path to accelerate, broaden and maximize 
the development of some of our promising 
bispecific antibody products, with the ultimate 
goal of bringing new potential medicines much 
faster to cancer patients. genmab and abbvie 
are equal partners, and we are working together 
to jointly make all strategy, development and 
letter from the ceo
i believe that years from now, when 
we look back on 2020, we will see 
that it was a turning point for genmab, 
with events that turbocharged our 
evolution into a fully integrated biotech 
innovation powerhouse.

commercialization decisions for three genmab bispecific 
antibody products — epcoritamab,  duohexabody-cd37 
and  duobody- cd3x5t4 — as well as potential novel differ-
entiated cancer therapies created under our discovery 
research collaboration.
maturing and expanding pipeline
a key component of our collaboration with abbvie is 
the development of epcoritamab. the first patient was 
treated with epcoritamab in 2018, and by the end of 2020 
we announced the first phase 3 study. at the beginning 
of 2021 the first patient was treated in the phase 3 
epcoritamab study and we announced the first phase 3 
study for tisotumab vedotin, our product candidate in 
 development with seagen. based on the very favorable 
phase 2 innovatv 204 study results in metastatic cervical 
cancer, we anticipate, along with seagen, filing our first 
biologics license application (bla) for tisotumab vedotin 
in the first quarter of 2021.
in addition to these later-stage studies, our pipe-
line expanded in 2020 as we filed two inds for 
hexabody- cd38 and duobody-cd3x5t4. subsequently, 
duobody- cd3x5t4 as well as duohexabody-cd37 
progressed into clinical development. we were also 
extremely pleased to present the first clinical data for 
duobody-pd-l1x4-1bb, one of our programs in develop-
ment with biontech, at the society for immunotherapy of 
cancer’s (sitc) 35th anniversary annual meeting.
significant evolution for genmab created 
antibodies
in addition to the development of our own pipeline, 
there were great leaps forward with antibodies created 
by genmab that are now being developed and marketed 
by other companies. chief among these is darzalex® 
( daratumumab), developed and commercialized by 
janssen. darzalex® has already revolutionized the 
treatment of multiple myeloma, and in 2020 it became 
the first and only subcutaneously administered cd38 
antibody approved in the world. this route of adminis-
tration significantly reduces treatment burden, as the 
fixed-dose injection is administered in approximately 
three to five minutes, offering patients a more  convenient 
treatment experience.
an additional highly-anticipated approval in 2020 was 
that of subcutaneous (subq) ofatumumab, as kesimpta®, 
in the u.s. for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (rms). 
kesimpta®, which is being developed and marketed by 
novartis, is the first b-cell therapy that can be self-ad-
ministered by patients at home using the sensoready® 
autoinjector pen, once monthly after starting therapy.
a third  genmab- created antibody was approved in 2020, 
with the u.s. food and drug administration (u.s. fda) 
approval of tepezza® (teprotumumab), developed and 
commercialized by horizon therapeutics, for thyroid eye 
disease (ted). tepezza® is the first and only u.s. fda 
approved medicine for the treatment of ted, and it has 
had an incredibly successful launch, despite the impact 
of covid-19.
it is also worth noting that janssen submitted applica-
tions for approval for amivantamab in both the u.s. and 
in europe in december. these are the first regulatory 
submissions for a product candidate that was created 
using genmab’s proprietary duobody® technology 
platform. amivantamab is also the first duobody® to 
receive breakthrough therapy designation (btd) from the 
u.s. fda. these events, in addition to the advancement 
our broad oncology collaboration 
with abbvie
on june 10, 2020, genmab entered into a broad oncology collaboration 
agreement with abbvie to jointly develop and commercialize epcoritamab, 
 duohexabody-cd37 and  duobody- cd3x5t4 and a discovery research 
collaboration for future differentiated antibody therapeutics for cancer. for 
epcoritamab, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the 
u.s. and japan, with abbvie responsible for further global commercializa-
tion. genmab will be the principal for net sales in the u.s. and japan and 
receive tiered royalties on remaining global sales. for  duohexabody-cd37, 
 duobody- cd3x5t4 and any product candidates developed as a result of the 
companies’ discovery research collaboration, genmab and abbvie will share 
responsibilities for global development and commercialization in the u.s. 
and japan. genmab retains the right to co- commercialize these products, 
along with abbvie, outside of the u.s. and japan. for the discovery research 
collaboration, which combines proprietary antibodies from both companies 
along with genmab’s duobody® technology and abbvie’s payload and adc 
technology, the companies will select and develop up to four additional 
differentiated next- generation  antibody-based product candidates, poten-
tially across both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. genmab will 
conduct phase 1 studies for these programs and abbvie retains the right to 
opt-in to program development.
under the terms of the agreement, genmab received a usd 750 million 
upfront payment from abbvie with the potential for genmab to receive up to 
usd 3.15 billion in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone 
payments for all programs, as well as tiered royalties between 22% and 26% 
on net sales for epcoritamab outside the u.s. and japan. except for these 
 royalty- bearing sales, the parties share in pre-tax profits from the sale of 
products on a 50:50 basis. included in these potential milestones are up to 
usd 1.15 billion in payments related to clinical development and commercial 
success across the three existing bispecific antibody programs. in addition, 
and also included in these potential milestones, if all four next- generation 
antibody product candidates developed as a result of the discovery 
research collaboration are successful, genmab is eligible to receive up to

of epcoritamab into phase 3, underscore the potential of our 
duobody® technology platform to create innovative and differenti-
ated antibody therapeutics.
genmab’s response to the covid-19 pandemic
the covid-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of science-
driven innovation to help solve the world’s most pressing issues 
and revealed just how interconnected we are as a society. this 
interdependence reinforces how critically important it is for 
genmab to operate with a laser-sharp focus in our response to 
this unprecedented pandemic.
genmab continues to closely monitor developments related 
to the pandemic and follows recommendations from various 
authorities, including governments and global and local health 
agencies. genmab established a covid-19 response team, which 
i lead, that closely monitors the evolving situation, develops and 
implements precautionary measures to help limit the impact of 
covid-19 at our workplace and on our communities and ensures 
business continuity.
genmab is actively monitoring the potential impact on our key 
priorities and assessing the situation on an ongoing basis in close 
contact with clinical trial sites, physicians and contract research 
organizations (cros) to evaluate the impact and challenges posed 
by the covid-19 situation and manage them accordingly.
delivering on genmab’s commitment
i believe that 2020 was a turning point for genmab, with events 
that turbocharged our evolution into a fully integrated biotech 
innovation powerhouse. this evolution will allow us to deliver on 
our commitment to patients and shareholders not only through 
successful partnered products, but with our own products that may 
revolutionize cancer treatment. none of our achievements —  espe-
cially during this incredibly turbulent year —  would be possible 
without our dedicated world-class team, the support of our board 
of directors, the patients who participate in our clinical trials, the 
investigators who help us trail blaze innovations and our share-
holders who believe in our 2025 vision. thank you all for your 
continued support as we move into another exciting year.
sincerely yours,

market overview
oncology: a critical and growing market
each year, millions of people are diagnosed with cancer, the second leading cause 
of death worldwide.1 one in six deaths is cancer-related. the time to transform how 
cancer is treated is now.
what is driving change?
global innovation in oncology is rapidly accel-
erating within an ever-evolving and progressing 
biopharmaceutical industry. an increase in the 
development and availability of monoclonal 
antibodies (mabs) has fueled another wave of 
innovation, which includes multi-specific drugs 
that have the potential to reframe how we think 
about targeted therapies. this focus on specific 
molecular therapies, coupled with technological 
and diagnostic advancements, has provided 
important tools to offer greater promise of 
personalized therapies. in addition, continued 
commitment to data science, predictive analytics 
and translational medicine will help biotech 
companies like ours develop smarter, more effi-
cacious cancer treatments. through partnerships 
and collaborations with academia, pharma and 
other biotechs, we are seeking ways to accel-
erate development of cancer therapies via robust 
clinical development programs and more efficient 
clinical trials that may rapidly provide activity 
signals and lead to breakthrough therapies that 
may reach patients.
what is the outlook?
by 2040, the global burden of cancer is expected 
to grow to more than 27 million new cases and 
more than 16 million deaths due to the growth and 
aging of the population.2
improved understanding and treatment of cancer, 
coupled with innovation and collaboration, will 
continue to have a meaningful and transforma-
tive potential for patient outcomes. as science 
continues to unravel the interplay between cancer 
and anticancer immunity, increased investment 
in immuno-oncology research has yielded 
promising therapies poised to revolutionize 
cancer treatment. in addition, as competition for 
key oncology targets has intensified, develop-
ment timelines have accelerated significantly, 
potentially opening up quicker paths to regulatory 
submissions and approvals, and eventually to 
patients who need new options.
at genmab, we believe in the power of antibody 
therapeutics to disrupt traditional approaches 
to treating cancer. in fact, mabs have experi-
enced explosive growth to become some of the 
most successful and widely used treatments in

market overview
oncology, with bispecific antibodies specifically 
emerging as promising candidates for differen-
tiated therapies.3 our pipeline’s focus on these 
unique multi-specific antibody products places 
us in an excellent position to transform cancer 
treatment. continued growth of antibody thera-
peutics in the coming years is expected to be a 
significant growth driver in the oncology market.
genmab’s position in oncology
genmab is a biotechnology innovation powerhouse, 
pioneering the discovery, development and future 
commercialization of a new frontier of transfor-
mative antibody cancer medicines. through our 
22-year history, we have been unyielding in our 
efforts to better understand cancer and its impact 
on patients’ lives. to do so, we have had a laser- 
sharp focus on harnessing the power of human anti-
bodies to develop differentiated cancer therapeutics.
we turn our deep understanding of antibody 
biology into inventive technology platforms, 
including duobody® hexabody®, duohexabody®, 
and hexelect® that fuel a transformative pipeline. 
through our data-driven translational approach, 
we are continuing to uncover more about novel 
cancer pathways, biomarkers and targets that 
drive our research forward to transform the future 
of cancer treatment.
our strong pipeline includes a number of potentially 
best-in-class or first-in-class product candidates, 
including two products in phase 3 clinical devel-
opment for patients with high unmet medical 
needs. we are excited by the prospect of potentially 
launching two of our own product candidates in the 
coming years with a focus on the u.s. and japan.
we also have a depth and breadth of experience 
forging effective partnerships to bring therapies to 
patients faster. our successful track record of over 
20 key partnerships include three genmab-created 
and approved antibody therapeutics commer-
cialized by our partners. our innovation- and 
collaboration-based culture has always been part of 
our dna and is a major factor of our overall success.
we do not take our responsibility to help more 
patients through science lightly. as we look 
to the future of cancer care, we are working to 
identify the best disease targets, discover unique 
best- or first-in-class antibodies and develop 
next- generation antibody product candidates. as 
we work toward our vision of becoming a fully inte-
grated biotechnology company, we will continue to 
strive to improve the lives of patients with cancer.
what markets do we operate in?
our global footprint includes our headquarters in 
copenhagen and world-class research and devel-
opment facilities in utrecht, princeton and tokyo. 
we are also building commercialization excellence 
as we plan for the first genmab-labeled medicine, 
focusing our efforts, initially, on two priority 
markets, the u.s. and japan. through science, 
innovation and drug discovery and development, 
we are determined to positively impact the lives 
of people with cancer throughout the world.

revenue
we expect our 2021 revenue to be in the range of dkk 6,800–7,500 
million, compared to dkk 10,111 million in 2020. our revenue in 
2020 was significantly impacted by the abbvie collaboration and 
included dkk 4,398 million related to the portion of the upfront 
payment that was allocated to the license grants and recognized as 
revenue in 2020.
our projected revenue for 2021 primarily consists of darzalex® 
royalties of dkk 4,900–5,300 million. such royalties are based 
on estimated darzalex® 2021 net sales of usd 5.2–5.6 billion 
compared to actual net sales in 2020 of approximately usd 4.2 
billion. janssen has started reducing its royalty payments to 
genmab by what it claims to be genmab’s share of janssen’s royalty 
payments to halozyme in connection with subcutaneous sales 
beginning in the second quarter of 2020. given the ongoing arbitra-
tion, genmab has reflected this as a reduction to estimated 2021 
revenue. the remainder of our revenue consists of royalties from 
tepezza® and kesimpta®, reimbursement revenue, milestones for 
epcoritamab under our abbvie collaboration, and other milestones.
operating expenses
we anticipate our 2021 operating expenses to be in the range of 
dkk 5,500–5,800 million, compared to dkk 3,798 million in 2020. 
the increase is driven by the advancement of our clinical programs, 
continued investment in research and development, as well as 
building our commercial organization and infrastructure.
operating result
we expect our operating result to be in the range of dkk 1,000–
2,000 million in 2021, compared to dkk 6,313 million in 2020.
outlook: risks and assumptions
in addition to factors already mentioned, the estimates above are 
subject to change due to numerous reasons, including but not 
limited to, the achievement of certain milestones associated with 
our collaboration agreements; our ongoing binding arbitration of 
two matters under our license agreement with janssen relating to 
daratumumab; the timing and variation of development activities 
(including activities carried out by our collaboration partners) and 
related income and costs; darzalex®, kesimpta® and tepezza® 
net sales and royalties paid to genmab; and currency exchange 
rates (the 2021 guidance assumes a usd/dkk exchange rate of 6.0). 
the financial guidance assumes that no significant agreements are 
entered into during 2021 that could materially affect the results. 
additionally, the covid-19 pandemic could potentially materially 
adversely impact our business and financial performance, including 
our clinical trials, projected regulatory approval timelines, supply 
chain and revenues, and cause our actual results to differ materially 
from our 2021 guidance and key 2021 priorities in this annual report.

be on our business. the extent, length and consequences of 
the pandemic are uncertain and impossible to predict. genmab 
has established a covid-19 response team, led by the ceo, that 
closely monitors the evolving situation, develops and implements 
precautionary measures to help limit the impact of covid-19 at

on our key 2021 priorities and assessing the situation on an 
ongoing basis in close contact with clinical trial sites, physicians 
and contract research organizations to evaluate the impact and 
challenges posed by the covid-19 situation and manage them

pandemic and related containment measures on our business 
and financial performance is uncertain as the situation continues 
to develop. the factors discussed above, as well as other factors 
which are currently unforeseeable, may result in further and other 
unforeseen material adverse impacts on our business and financial 
performance, including on the net sales of darzalex®, kesimpta® 
and tepezza®, by our partners and on our royalty and milestone 
revenue therefrom.

at genmab, we are inspired by nature and understand how 
 antibodies work. we are deeply knowledgeable about antibody 
biology and our scientists exploit this expertise to create and 
develop differentiated antibody product candidates.
we utilize a sophisticated and highly automated 
process to efficiently generate, select, produce 
and evaluate human antibody product 
candidates.
we utilize a sophisticated and highly automated process to 
 efficiently generate, select, produce and evaluate human antibody 
product candidates. our research and development teams have 
established a fully integrated r&d enterprise and streamlined 
process to coordinate the activities of product discovery, pre- clinical 
testing, manufacturing, clinical trial design and execution and regu-
latory submissions across genmab’s international operations.

product pipeline
at the end of 2020, genmab’s proprietary pipeline of product candidates, 
where genmab owns at least 50% of the program, consisted of seven 
clinical-stage antibodies*. combined with product candidates being 
developed by other companies that were either created by genmab or 
that incorporate genmab’s innovation, our pipeline consists of over 20 
antibodies in clinical development, including three approved products. 
in addition to the antibodies in clinical development, genmab’s pipeline 
includes around 20 in-house and partnered pre-clinical programs.
an overview of the development status of each of our  clinical-stage product candidates is provided in the 
following sections. detailed descriptions of dosing, efficacy and safety data from certain clinical trials have 
been disclosed in company announcements and media releases published via the nasdaq copenhagen 
stock exchange. additional information is available on genmab’s website, www.genmab.com.
 *on november 24, 2020, genmab announced that it would not advance the development of the  clinical- stage 
antibody drug conjugate, enapotamab vedotin. while enapotamab vedotin showed some evidence of clinical 
activity, this was not optimized by different dose schedules and/or predictive biomarkers. accordingly, the 
data from the expansion cohorts did not meet genmab’s stringent criteria for proof-of- concept.

darzalex
®
(daratumumab)
darzalex® (daratumumab) is a human 
 monoclonal antibody that binds with high 
affinity to the cd38 molecule, which is highly 
expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma 
cells and is also expressed by light-chain (al) 
amyloidosis plasma cells. daratumumab triggers 
a person’s own immune system to attack the 
cancer cells, resulting in rapid tumor cell death 
through multiple  immune- mediated mecha-
nisms of action and through immunomodulatory 
effects, in addition to direct tumor cell death, 
via apoptosis (programmed cell death). genmab 
used technology licensed from medarex to 
generate the cd38 antibody forming part of 
 daratumumab. daratumumab is being developed 
by janssen under an exclusive worldwide license 
from genmab to develop, manufacture and 
commercialize daratumumab (see daratumumab 
collaboration with janssen biotech, inc. 
section for more information). darzalex® 
(daratumumab) intravenous infusion and 
darzalex® subq administration (daratumumab 
and  hyaluronidase-fihj) are approved in certain 
 territories for the treatment of adult patients 
with certain multiple myeloma indications as 
indicated on the following page.
redefining the treatment of multiple myeloma
• first-in-class human cd38 monoclonal antibody
• intravenous (iv) formulation approved in combination with

darzalex® sc in the eu, in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
and dexamethasone (vcd) for the treatment of adult patients 
newly diagnosed with al amyloidosis. the u.s. fda is reviewing 
the sbla for this indication under their real-time oncology review 
(rtor) pilot program and project orbis. the submissions were 
based on positive topline data from the phase 3 andromeda 
(nct03201965) study, which were announced in may 2020.
• november: janssen submitted regulatory applications to the 
u.s. fda and ema seeking approval of the daratumumab subq 
formulation, known as darzalex faspro® (daratumumab and 
 hyaluronidase-fihj) in the u.s. and as darzalex® sc in the eu, 
with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pd) for the treatment 
of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior line of therapy. the submissions 
were based on positive results from the phase 3 apollo study 
(nct03180736), which were announced in july 2020.
• october: genmab announced that at a pre- planned interim 
analysis, the second part of the phase 3 cassiopeia study 
(nct02541383) of daratumumab as maintenance treatment for 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant (asct), met the primary endpoint 
of  progression-free survival (pfs) (hazard ratio (hr) = 0.53 (95% 
ci 0.42–0.68), p < 0.0001), resulting in a 47% reduction in the risk 
of progression or death in patients treated with daratumumab. 
the safety profile observed in this study was consistent with the 
known safety profile of daratumumab, and no new safety signals 
were observed.
updates from first quarter to third quarter
• september: genmab commenced binding arbitration of two 
matters arising under the license agreement with janssen relating 
to daratumumab.
• august: the u.s. fda approved the use of darzalex® 
(daratumumab) in combination with carfilzomib and 
dexamethasone (kd) for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to 
three previous lines of therapy. the approval was based on the 
phase 3 candor study (nct03158688), which was sponsored

daratumumab collaboration with janssen 
biotech, inc.
in 2012, genmab and janssen biotech, inc., one of the 
janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson, 
entered a global license and development agreement for 
daratumumab. genmab received an upfront license fee 
of usd 55 million, and johnson & johnson development 
corporation (jjdc) invested usd 80 million to subscribe 
for 5.4 million new genmab shares. genmab could also be 
entitled to up to usd 1,015 million in development, regu-
latory and sales milestones, in addition to tiered double 
digit royalties between 12% and 20%. to date genmab 
has recorded usd 850 million in milestone payments 
from janssen and could be entitled to receive up to usd 
165 million in further payments if certain additional 
milestones are met. the following royalty tiers apply for 
net sales in a calendar year: 12% on net sales up to and 
including usd 750 million; 13% on net sales above usd 
750 million and up to and including usd 1.5 billion; 16% 
on net sales above usd 1.5 billion and up to and including 
usd 2.0 billion; 18% on net sales above usd 2.0 billion 
and up to and including usd 3.0 billion; and 20% on net 
sales exceeding usd 3.0 billion. janssen is fully respon-
sible for developing and commercializing daratumumab 
and all costs associated therewith. in september 2020, 
genmab commenced binding arbitration of two matters 
arising under the license agreement with janssen relating 
to  daratumumab. the arbitration is to settle whether 
genmab is required to share in janssen’s royalty payments 
to halozyme therapeutics, inc., for the halozyme enzyme 
technology used in the subcutaneous formulation of 
 daratumumab and whether janssen’s obligation to pay 
royalties on sales of licensed product extends, in each 
applicable country, until the expiration or invalidation 
of the last-to- expire relevant  genmab-owned patent 
or the last-to- expire relevant  janssen-owned patent 
covering daratumumab. please refer to “legal matter —

kesimpta
®
(ofatumumab)
ofatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody that 
targets an epitope on the cd20 molecule encom-
passing parts of the small and large extracellular 
loops. genmab used technology licensed from 
medarex to generate the cd20 antibody forming part 
of ofatumumab. a subq formulation of ofatumumab 
was investigated in two phase 3 asclepios clinical 
studies in rms. the studies compared the efficacy 
and safety of subq ofatumumab versus teriflun-
omide in patients with rms and were comprised 
of approximately 900 patients each. based on 
these studies, and data from the phase 2 aplios 
study, which evaluated the bioequivalence of subq 
administration of ofatumumab via pre- filled syringe 
in august 2020, kesimpta® (ofatumumab) was 
approved by the u.s. fda for the treatment of rms 
in adults. kesimpta® is the first b-cell therapy that 
can be self- administered by patients at home using 
the sensoready® autoinjector pen, once monthly 
after starting therapy. additional studies with rms 
patients are ongoing. ofatumumab in rms is being 
developed and marketed worldwide by novartis 
under a license agreement between genmab 
and novartis pharma ag. (see ofatumumab 
collaboration with novartis pharma ag section 
for more information.)

with rms, was presented at the americas committee for 
treatment and research in multiple sclerosis (actrims) forum 
in florida.
ofatumumab collaboration with novartis pharma ag (novartis)
genmab and glaxosmithkline (gsk) entered a co- development and collaboration agreement for ofatumumab in 2006. 
the full rights to ofatumumab were transferred from gsk to novartis in 2015. novartis is now fully responsible for the 
development and commercialization of ofatumumab in all potential indications, including autoimmune diseases. genmab 
is entitled to a 10% royalty payment of net sales for non- cancer treatments. in 2020 subcutaneous ofatumumab was 
approved by the u.s. fda, as kesimpta®, for the treatment of rms in adults. ofatumumab was also previously approved 
as arzerra® for certain chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) indications. in 2019, the marketing authorization for arzerra® 
was withdrawn in the eu and several other territories. in august 2020, genmab announced that novartis planned to 
transition arzerra® to an oncology access program for cll patients in the u.s. genmab recognized usd 30 million lump 
sum from novartis as payment for lost potential royalties. ofatumumab is no longer in development for cll.

has been shown to induce potent in vitro and 
in vivo anti-tumor activity. this suggests that 
 duohexabody-cd37 is a promising candidate 
hexabody-dr5/dr5 (gen1029) is a product 
comprising a mixture of two non- competing 
hexabody® antibody molecules that target two 
distinct epitopes on death receptor 5 (dr5), a cell 
surface receptor that mediates a process called 
programmed cell death. increased expression of 
dr5 has been reported in several types of tumors. 
the product was created with our hexabody® 
technology and dr5 antibodies acquired from 
idd biotech.  hexabody-dr5/dr5 is fully owned 
by genmab and a phase 1/2 clinical study in solid

antibodies are y- shaped proteins that play a central role in immunity 
against bacteria and viruses (also known as pathogens). as we develop 
immunity, our bodies generate antibodies that bind to pathogen 
structures (known as antigens), which are specific to the pathogen. 
once bound, the antibodies attract other parts of the immune system 
to eliminate the pathogen. in modern medicine, we have learned how 
to create and develop specific antibodies against antigens associated 
with diseased human cells for use in the treatment of diseases 
such as cancer and autoimmune disease. genmab uses several 
types of technologies to create antibodies to treat disease and has 
developed proprietary antibody technologies including the duobody®, 
hexabody®, duohexabody® and hexelect® platforms. information 
about these technologies can be found in the following sections and 
at www.genmab.com/research-innovation/antibody-technology-
platforms/.
we also use or license several other technologies to generate diverse 
libraries of high quality, functional antibodies such as the omniab® 
transgenic mouse and rat platforms from ligand pharmaceuticals, inc. 
we also use or license technologies to increase the potency of some 
of our antibody therapeutics on a  product-by- product basis such as 
the adc technology from seagen. adcs are antibodies with potent 
cytotoxic agents coupled to them. by using antibodies that recognize 
specific targets on tumor cells, these cytotoxic agents are preferentially 
delivered to the tumor cells.

duobody
® platform
the duobody® platform is genmab’s innovative platform for the 
discovery and development of bispecific antibodies. bispecific 
antibodies bind to two different epitopes (or “docking” sites) 
either on the same, or on different targets (also known as dual- 
targeting). dual- targeting may improve binding specificity and 
enhance therapeutic efficacy or bring two different cells together 
(for example, engaging a t cell to kill a tumor cell). bispecific 
antibodies generated with the duobody® platform can be used 
for the development of therapeutics for diseases such as cancer, 
autoimmune, infectious, cardiovascular, central nervous system 
diseases and hemophilia. duobody® molecules combine the 
benefits of bispecificity with the strengths of conventional 
antibodies, which allows duobody® molecules to be adminis-
tered and dosed the same way as other antibody therapeutics. 
genmab’s duobody® platform generates bispecific antibodies 
via a versatile and broadly applicable process which is easily 
performed at high throughput, standard bench, as well as 
commercial manufacturing scale. genmab uses the duobody® 
platform to create its own bispecific antibody programs and the 
technology is also available for licensing. genmab has numerous 
alliances for the duobody® platform including commercial 
collaborations with abbvie, janssen, novo nordisk, biontech, 
blink biomedical and immatics.
innovative technology for bispecific 
antibody therapeutics
• bispecific antibody technology platform
• potential in cancer, autoimmune, infectious, 
cardiovascular, central nervous system 
diseases and hemophilia
• commercial collaborations with abbvie, 
janssen and biontech among others, plus 
multiple research collaborations
• first regulatory submissions for a product 
candidate that was created using the 
duobody® technology platform —  
amivantamab (janssen)
• first  genmab- sponsored phase 3 study 
for a product candidate that was created 
using the duobody® —  epcoritamab (50:50 
with abbvie)
antibody technologies
the innovative duobody® technology platform generates  bispecific 
antibodies via a fast, versatile and broadly applicable process called 
controlled fab-arm exchange. with only minimal protein engineering, the 
technology allows the binding arms of two distinct monoclonal antibodies 
to exchange, combining into one stable bispecific antibody, thereby 
retaining regular immunoglobulin structure and function. the duobody® 
platform is also highly suitable for high throughput generation, screening 
and discovery of bispecific antibodies in the final format.

oncology collaboration agreement with abbvie to 
jointly develop and commercialize epcoritamab 
( duobody- cd3xcd20),  duohexabody-cd37 
and  duobody- cd3x5t4. for epcoritamab, the 
companies will share commercial responsibilities 
in the u.s. and japan, with abbvie responsible for 
further global commercialization. genmab will be 
the principal for net sales in the u.s. and japan, 
and receive tiered royalties on remaining global 
sales. for  duohexabody-cd37,  duobody- cd3x5t4 
and any product candidates developed as a result 
of the companies’ discovery research collabora-
tion, genmab and abbvie will share responsibilities 
for global development and commercialization 
in the u.s. and japan. genmab retains the right 
to  co- commercialize these products, along with 
abbvie, outside of the u.s. and japan.
under the terms of the agreement, genmab 
received a usd 750 million upfront payment from 
abbvie with the potential for genmab to receive 
up to usd 3.15 billion in additional development, 
regulatory and sales milestone payments for all 
programs, as well as tiered royalties between 22% 
and 26% on net sales for epcoritamab outside the 
u.s. and japan. except for these  royalty- bearing 
sales, the parties share in pre-tax profits from 
the sale of products on a 50:50 basis. included 
in these potential milestones are up to usd 
1.15 billion in payments related to clinical devel-
opment and commercial success across the three 
existing bispecific antibody programs. genmab 
and abbvie split 50:50 the development costs 
related to epcoritamab,  duohexabody-cd37 and 
 duobody- cd3x5t4.
biontech
in may 2015, genmab entered an agreement 
with biontech to jointly research, develop and 
commercialize bispecific antibody products 
using genmab’s duobody® technology platform. 
under the terms of the agreement, biontech 
will provide proprietary antibodies against key 
immunomodulatory targets, while genmab 
provides proprietary antibodies and access to its 
duobody® technology platform. genmab paid an 
upfront fee of usd 10 million to biontech. if the 
companies jointly select any product candidates 
for clinical development, development costs 
and product ownership will be shared equally 
going forward. if one of the companies does not 
wish to move a product candidate forward, the 
other company is entitled to continue developing 
the product on predetermined licensing terms. 
the agreement also includes provisions which 
will allow the parties to opt out of joint develop-
ment at key points. genmab and biontech have 
selected two product candidates for clinical devel-
opment,  duobody- cd40x4-1bb (gen1042) and 
 duobody-pd-l1x4-1bb (gen1046), both of which 
are now in clinical trials.
janssen
in july 2012, genmab entered into a collaboration 
with janssen to create and develop bispecific

payment of usd 2 million from janssen. under 
the terms of the original agreement, for each of 
the additional programs that janssen successfully 
initiates, develops and commercializes, genmab 
will potentially be entitled to receive average 
milestone and license payments of approximately 
usd 191 million. in addition, genmab will be 
entitled to royalties on sales of any commer-
cialized products. all research work is funded 
by janssen.
janssen has exercised 14 licenses under this 
collaboration, not all of which are active, and no 
further options remain for use by janssen. as of 
december 31, 2020, seven duobody® product 
candidates created under this collaboration 
were in the clinic. one of these, amivantamab, 
is the first product candidate created using the 
duobody® technology platform to be submitted 
for regulatory approval.
novo nordisk a/s
in august 2015, genmab entered an agreement 
to grant novo nordisk commercial licenses to use 
the duobody® technology platform to create and 
develop bispecific antibody candidates for two 
therapeutic programs. the bispecific antibodies 
will target a disease area outside of cancer ther-
apeutics. after an initial period of exclusivity 
for both target combinations, novo nordisk has 
extended exclusivity of the commercial license 
for one target combination in 2018, now in clinical 
development as mim8. under the exclusive 
license agreement, genmab is entitled to potential 
development, regulatory and sales milestones of 
up to approximately usd 250 million. in addition, 
genmab will be entitled to  single-digit royalties 
on sales of any commercialized products. in 
december 2017, the collaboration was expanded 
with a new agreement for up to an additional five 
potential target pair combinations, which may be 
reserved on either an exclusive or non-exclusive 
basis, and three commercial license options. this 
agreement contained similar termination provi-
sions as the initial agreement.
blink biomedical sas
in july 2019, genmab entered into an agreement 
with blink biomedical for an exclusive commer-
cial license to certain antibodies targeting cd47, 
for potential development and commercializa-
tion into novel bispecific therapeutics created 
via genmab’s proprietary duobody® platform 
technology. under the terms of the agreement, 
blink biomedical is also eligible to receive up to 
approximately usd 200 million in development, 
regulatory and commercial milestone payments 
for each product, as well as tiered royalties on 
net sales.
immatics
in july 2018, genmab entered into a research 
collaboration and exclusive license agreement 
with immatics to discover and develop next-gen-
eration bispecific immunotherapies to target 
multiple cancer indications. genmab received 
an exclusive license to three proprietary targets 
from immatics, with an option to license up to two 
additional targets at predetermined economics. 
under the terms of the agreement, genmab paid 
immatics an upfront fee of usd 54 million and 
immatics is eligible to receive up to usd 550 
million in development, regulatory and commer-
cial milestone payments for each product, as well 
as tiered royalties on net sales.

hexabody
® platform
the hexabody® technology platform is a proprietary genmab 
 technology that is designed to increase the potency of antibodies. the 
hexabody® platform builds on natural biology and strengthens the 
natural killing ability of antibodies while retaining regular structure and 
specificity. the technology allows for the creation of potent therapeutics 
by inducing antibody hexamer formation (clusters of six antibodies) 
after binding to their target antigen on the cell surface. we have 
used the hexabody® platform to generate antibodies with enhanced 
 complement- mediated killing, allowing antibodies with limited or absent 
killing capacity to be transformed into potent, cytotoxic antibodies. in 
addition to  complement- mediated killing, the clustering of membrane 
receptors by the hexabody® platform can lead to subsequent  outside-in 
signaling (e.g., in the case of our  hexabody-dr5/dr5 product candidate) 
leading to cell death. the hexabody® technology creates opportuni-
ties to explore new product candidates, to repurpose drug candidates 
unsuccessful in previous clinical trials due to insufficient potency and 
may provide a useful strategy in product life cycle management. the 
hexabody® technology is broadly applicable and can be combined 
with genmab’s duobody® platform (duohexabody® platform) as well 
as other antibody technologies. the technology has the potential to 
enhance antibody therapeutics for a broad range of applications in 
diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases. genmab intends to use 
the hexabody® technology for its own antibody programs and the tech-
nology is also available for licensing. in addition to multiple hexabody® 
research collaborations with other companies, genmab has entered into 
an exclusive worldwide license and option agreement with janssen to 
develop and commercialize  hexabody-cd38, a next- generation cd38 
monoclonal antibody product incorporating the hexabody® technology. 
an ind for  hexabody-cd38 was submitted in october 2020.

the hexabody® platform is an innovative approach for the creation of 
potent therapeutics. it builds on recent insights in the natural biology 
of antibodies. the technology enhances the ordered clustering of 
antibodies into hexamers after they bind to their target cells. this biolog-
ical mechanism can be exploited to robustly enhance cell killing via 
 complement- dependent cytotoxicity (cdc) or agonist  outside-in signaling 
induced by clustering. the hexabody® platform can be combined with 
genmab’s duobody® platform as well as with other antibody technologies.

genmab has core facilities in four countries and performs 
research and development activities with clinical trials 
conducted around the globe. through our activities, we are 
exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are beyond our 
control. these risks may have a significant impact on our 
business if not properly assessed and controlled. maintaining 
a strong control environment, with adequate procedures 
for identification and assessment of risks and adhering to 
operational policies designed to reduce such risks to an 
acceptable level, is essential for the continued development of 
genmab. it is our policy to identify and reduce the risks derived 
from our operations and to establish insurance coverage to 
mitigate any residual risk, wherever considered practicable. 
the board of directors performs a yearly review of genmab’s 
insurance coverage to ensure that it is appropriate.
the following is a summary of some of genmab’s key risk 
areas and how we attempt to address and mitigate such risks. 
environmental and ethical risks are also covered in genmab’s 
statutory report on corporate social responsibility.

identification and development of successful products, expensive, 
time- consuming clinical trials with uncertain outcome and risk of 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions
genmab has a disciplined approach to investment, focusing on areas with the potential to maximize success, 
including new technologies and formats, scaling up to expand from early- to late-stage development and 
commercialization. genmab has established various committees to ensure optimal selection of disease targets 
and formats of our antibody candidates, and to monitor progress of pre-clinical and clinical development. we 
strive to have a well-balanced product pipeline and continue to identify and search for new product candidates 
and closely follow the market.
dependent on identification and development of new proprietary 
technologies and access to new third-party technologies including 
exposure to safety issues, as well as other failures and setbacks 
related to use of such new or existing technologies
genmab strives to continue its identification and development of new technologies, such as the duobody®, 
hexabody®, duohexabody® and hexelect® platforms, and gain access to competitive new third-party 
technologies such as adc technology and mrna technology. we closely monitor our pre- clinical programs and 
clinical trials to mitigate any unforeseen safety issues or other failures or setbacks associated with the use of our 
proprietary platform technologies, adc technology or mrna technology.
genmab faces uncertainty about the successful commercialization 
of product candidates. this is a result of factors including immense 
competition on the basis of cost and efficacy as well as rapid 
technological change, which may result in others discovering, 
developing or commercializing competing products before or more 
successfully than us
from early in the research phase and throughout development, commercial potential and risks are assessed to 
ensure that final products have the potential to be commercially viable. genmab attempts to control commercial 
risks by monitoring and evaluating current market conditions, competing products and new technologies, and to 
potentially gain access to new technologies and products that may supplement our pipeline. genmab strives to 
ensure market exclusivity for its own technologies and products by seeking patent protection.
near- and mid-term prospects are substantially dependent on 
continued clinical and commercial success of darzalex®
darzalex® is subject to intense competition in the multiple myeloma 
therapy market
genmab focuses on its three- pronged strategy to develop a broad pipeline of unique best-in-class or first-in-class 
antibody products with significant commercial potential. in addition, genmab maintains a strong cash position, 
disciplined financial management, and a flexible and capital efficient business model to mitigate potential 
setbacks for darzalex®.
in 2020 genmab commenced binding arbitration of two matters arising under the license agreement with janssen 
relating to daratumumab. while genmab intends to vigorously protect its rights under the agreement, the outcome 
of any arbitration proceeding, as well as its duration, is inherently uncertain.
in 2019 genmab entered into an exclusive license agreement with janssen regarding a next- generation cd38 
antibody product, hexabody-cd38. in 2020 two additional genmab created antibody products, kesimpta® and 
tepezza®, were approved by the u.s. fda, providing additional recurring royalty revenue.
exposure to product liability claims related to the use or misuse of our 
products and technologies
a product liability claim could materially affect our business and financial position, and genmab therefore 
maintains product liability insurance for our clinical trials and other coverage required under applicable laws.
our core research and manufacturing activities are carried out at a 
limited number of locations. any event resulting in genmab’s or our 
vendors’ inability to operate these facilities could materially disrupt 
our business.
genmab employs oversight and quality risk management principles. in addition genmab follows good laboratory 
practices (glp), good manufacturing practices (gmp) and requires that our vendors operate with the same 
standards. genmab has established a quality assurance (qa) department to monitor adherence to these practices.

(continued)
if we are unable to manage genmab’s fast-paced growth or build our 
commercialization capabilities, our business, financial condition and 
net results may be adversely affected
genmab continues to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our 
operations, including the continued expansion of our product pipeline and development of our commercialization 
capabilities. genmab must continue to improve existing operational and financial systems, procedures and 
controls. genmab must expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and we expect that we may need to 
increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations.
government restrictions on pricing/public reimbursement as well as 
other healthcare payor cost- containment initiatives

research organizations to conduct key aspects of our clinical trials, and 
on partners to conduct some of our clinical trials
genmab oversees outsourcing and partnership relationships to ensure consistency with strategic objectives 
and service provider compliance with regulatory requirements, resources and performance. this includes 
assessment of contingency plans, availability of alternative service providers and costs and resources required to 
switch service providers. we evaluate financial solvency and require our suppliers to abide by a code of conduct 
consistent with genmab’s code of conduct. 
regulation and 
legislation
subject to extensive regulatory and other legal requirements both 
during clinical development and post- marketing approval, including 
healthcare laws and regulations, as well as data protection regulations
subject to strict disclosure obligations under applicable laws 
and regulations, including the eu market abuse regulation. as a 
consequence of the listing on the nasdaq global select market, we 
are subject to additional u.s. regulatory requirements, including u.s. 
securities laws and the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and may 
become more exposed to u.s. class actions
to ensure compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements including current good laboratory practices 
(cglp), current good clinical practices (cgcp) and current good manufacturing practices (cgmp), genmab has 
established a quality assurance department and makes every effort to stay abreast of regulatory and legislation 
changes to ensure compliance. to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, genmab 
has established relevant policies and guidelines, including pharma compliance guidelines and guidelines for the 
processing and protection of personal data and a new global compliance function led by an executive who reports 
to the ceo. the data protection area is overseen by the company’s dpo (data protection officer). genmab has 
a code of conduct setting high ethical standards for its employees, management and the board of directors. all 
employees receive regular training and communications on the code and policies and sops relevant to their work.
genmab has established relevant procedures and guidelines to ensure transparency with respect to timely, 
adequate and correct information to the market and otherwise comply with u.s. securities laws and other 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
legislation, regulations and practices may change from time to time
to prevent unwarranted consequences of new and amended legislation, regulations, etc., genmab strives to 
stay current with respect to all applicable legislation, regulations and practices by means of internal, as well 
as external, legal counsel. also, internal procedures for review of contracts have been implemented to ensure

guidance due to the timing of project costs. operating result 
was above guidance due to higher revenue and lower operating 
expenses. the latest guidance was published on august 20, 2020.
revenue
revenue was dkk 10,111 million in 2020 compared to dkk 5,366 
million in 2019. the increase of dkk 4,745 million, or 88%, was 
mainly driven by the upfront payment of usd 672 million (dkk 
4,398 million) related to the abbvie collaboration that was allocated 
to license grants and recognized as revenue in june 2020. the 
remaining portion of the upfront payment from abbvie of usd 
78 million (dkk 513 million) was recorded as deferred revenue and 
will be recognized as activities are performed, which is estimated to 
be over a seven-year period. in addition, genmab recorded higher 
darzalex® royalties as net sales of darzalex® as reported by 
johnson & johnson (parent company of janssen) were usd 4,190 
million in 2020.
of the revenue for 2020, dkk 4,741 million, or 47%, was attribut-
able to royalties, dkk 4,588 million, or 45% to license revenue, dkk 
431 million, or 4% to reimbursement revenue and dkk 351 million, 
or 4%, to milestone revenue. this is compared to dkk 3,155 million, 
or 59%, attributable to royalties, dkk 1,869 million, or 35%, to 
milestone revenue and dkk 342 million, or 6%, to reimbursement 
revenue in 2019.
royalties
royalty revenue amounted to dkk 4,741 million in 2020 compared 
to dkk 3,155 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 1,586 million, or 
50%, was mainly driven by higher darzalex® royalties achieved 
under our daratumumab collaboration with janssen.
net sales of darzalex® by janssen were usd 4,190 million in 
2020 compared to usd 2,998 million in 2019. the increase of usd 
1,192 million, or 40%, was driven by the continued strong uptake of 
darzalex®. royalty revenue on net sales of darzalex® was dkk 
4,419 million in 2020 compared to dkk 3,132 million in 2019, an 
increase of dkk 1,287 million, or 41%. janssen has started reducing 
its royalty payments to genmab by what it claims to be genmab’s 
share of janssen’s royalty payments to halozyme in connection 
with subcutaneous sales beginning in the second quarter of 2020. 
given the ongoing arbitration, genmab has reflected this as a 
reduction to its recognized revenue.
tepezza® (teprotumumab) was launched by horizon in 2020. 
royalties, which are based on net sales, amounted to dkk 298 
million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
novartis was granted u.s. fda approval for kesimpta® (ofatu-
mumab) in relapsing multiple sclerosis and genmab started 
recognizing royalties on net sales of kesimpta® during the third 
quarter of 2020. royalties were negligible in 2020.
royalty revenue fluctuations from period to period are due primarily 
to the level of product net sales as well as foreign currency 
exchange rates.

milestone revenue
milestone revenue was dkk 351 million in 2020 compared to dkk 
1,869 million in 2019. the decrease of dkk 1,518 million, or 81% 
was mainly driven by significant one-time sales milestones for 
darzalex® in 2019. in 2020, genmab recorded dkk 274 million 
(dkk 186 million in regulatory milestones and dkk 88 million in 
development milestones) resulting from achievements under our 
darzalex® and duobody® collaborations with janssen, dkk 70 
million from achievements under our novo nordisk collaboration 
and dkk 7 million from other collaborations. by comparison, in 
2019, genmab recorded dkk 1,778 million (usd 264 million) in 
darzalex® milestone payments from janssen, including (i) a usd 
150 million milestone payment related to the achievement of usd 
3.0 billion in net sales (as calculated on the basis of the license 
agreement terms) of darzalex® in calendar year 2019, (ii) a usd

under the abbvie collaboration and the payment of usd 30 million 
(dkk 188 million) from novartis as a result of novartis’s decision to 
transition arzerra (ofatumumab) to an oncology access program for 
cll patients in the u.s. there was no license revenue during 2019.
operating expenses
total operating expenses increased by dkk 1,070 million, or 39%, 
from dkk 2,728 million in 2019 to dkk 3,798 million in 2020.
research and development expenses
research and development costs amounted to dkk 3,137 million in 
2020 compared to dkk 2,386 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 
751 million, or 31%, was driven by the advancement of epcoritamab 
( duobody- cd3xcd20) and  duobody-pd-l1x4-1bb, the additional 
investment in our product pipeline, and the increase in research and 
development employees. during 2020, we recorded dkk 401 million

third-party costs for tisotumab vedotin decreased by dkk 
37 million, or 8%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to 
manufacturing work related to validations finalized in 2019.
third-party costs for epcoritamab increased by dkk 264 million, or 
208%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the advance-
ment of the program under genmab’s collaboration with abbvie.
third-party costs for duobody-pd-l1x4-1bb increased by dkk 202 
million, or 139%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the 
continued advancement of the program under genmab’s collabora-
tion with biontech.
third-party costs for enapotamab vedotin decreased by dkk 
54 million, or 20%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due 
to data from expansion cohorts that did not meet genmab’s 
stringent criteria for proof-of-concept, which resulted in genmab’s 
decision not to advance the development of enapotamab vedotin 
during 2020.
third-party costs for genmab’s other clinical-stage programs 
increased by dkk 80 million, or 75%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, 
primarily related to duohexabody-cd37 and duobody-cd3x5t4 
entering the clinical-stage in 2020.
research and development expenses related to our pre- clinical 
projects increased by dkk 49 million, or 12%, in 2020 as 
compared to 2019 driven by the continued investment in our 
pre-clinical programs.
unallocated costs and overhead increased by dkk 247 million, or 
28%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase 
in staffing levels and the expansion of our facilities to accommo-
date our growth. our research and development ftes (full-time 
 equivalents) increased from 468 at the end of 2019 to 647 at the 
end of 2020.
general and administrative expenses
general and administrative expenses were dkk 661 million in 
2020 compared to dkk 342 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 
319 million, or 93%, was driven by one-time costs related to the 
abbvie collaboration agreement, increased ongoing costs related 
to genmab’s u.s. listing, including higher insurance costs, and 
growth across all support areas including enhanced technology and 
systems, investment in commercial capabilities, and other costs 
related to the expansion of our product pipeline.
dkk 250 million, or 38% of general and administrative expenses 
in 2020, was related to remuneration of employees and senior 
management involved in general and administrative activities, as 
compared to dkk 175 million, or 51% of general and administrative 
expenses in 2019.
general and administrative expenses accounted for 17% of the total 
operating expenses in 2020 compared to 13% in 2019.
operating result
operating result was dkk 6,313 million in 2020 compared to dkk 
2,638 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 3,675 million, or 139%, 
was driven by higher revenue, which was partly offset by increased 
operating expenses.
net financial items
the net financial items reflect a combination of interest income 
and expense, realized and unrealized fair value adjustments on our 
portfolio of marketable securities, realized and unrealized fair value 
adjustments on other investments, as well as realized and unreal-
ized foreign exchange adjustments.
financial income for 2020 was dkk 1,149 million, reflecting interest 
and other financial income of dkk 184 million, and net realized 
and unrealized gains on other investments of dkk 965 million, as 
compared to dkk 228 million for 2019, reflecting interest and other 
financial income of dkk 120 million, net realized and unrealized 
gains on marketable securities of dkk 9 million, and net realized 
and unrealized exchange rate gains of dkk 99 million.
financial expenses for 2020 were dkk 1,558 million related to 
interest and other financial expenses of dkk 10 million, net realized 
and unrealized losses on marketable securities of dkk 92 million, 
and net realized and unrealized exchange rate losses of dkk 
1,456 million, as compared to dkk 7 million for 2019 related to 
interest and other financial expenses.
as a result of the above, net financial items for 2020 were a net loss 
of dkk 409 million, as compared to a net gain of dkk 221 million

for 2019. the decrease in net financial items was driven primarily 
by an increase in net realized and unrealized exchange rate losses 
driven by foreign exchange movements which negatively impacted 
our u.s. denominated portfolio and cash holdings, partly offset by 
an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on other invest-
ments related to the change in fair value of genmab’s investment in 
common shares of curevac. please refer to note 4.2 for additional 
information regarding foreign currency risk and note 4.5 for addi-
tional information regarding the net financial items.
corporate tax
corporate tax expense was dkk 1,146 million in 2020 compared to 
dkk 693 million in 2019, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 
19% for 2020 and 24% in 2019. the effective tax rate decreased in 
2020 as a result of the utilization of prior year tax benefits. in 2019, 
a discrete tax benefit of dkk 29 million was realized through the 
use of prior year tax benefits. please refer to note 2.4 for additional 
information regarding the corporate tax and deferred tax assets 
including management’s significant judgements and estimates.
net result
net result for 2020 was dkk 4,758 million compared to dkk 
2,166 million in 2019. the increase of dkk 2,592 million, or 120%, 
was driven by the items described above.

as of december 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and marketable 
securities (cash position) amounted to dkk 16,079 million, an 
increase of dkk 5,108 million from the beginning of 2020. the 
increase was primarily driven by the upfront payment of usd 
750 million (dkk 4,911 million) related to the abbvie collaboration, 
and darzalex®  milestones achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019, 
which were received in 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, genmab’s usd denominated cash, 
cash equivalents and marketable securities represented 83% of 
genmab’s cash position compared to 74% as of december 31, 2019 
driven by the increased investment in united states government 
bonds and treasury bills.
as of december 31, 2020, dkk 7,260 million, as compared to 
dkk 3,552 million as of december 31, 2019, was held as cash and 
cash equivalents, and dkk 8,819 million, as compared to dkk 
7,419 million as of december 31, 2019, was held as liquid invest-
ments in short-term government and other debt instruments.
cash and cash equivalents included short-term marketable securi-
ties of dkk 2,206 million at the end of december 2020, compared 
to dkk 668 million at the end of december 2019. in accordance with 
genmab’s accounting policy, securities purchased with a maturity 
of less than three months at the date of acquisition are classified as 
cash and cash equivalents.
genmab requires cash to meet our operating expenses and capital 
expenditures. we have funded our cash requirements since 
inception, including through december 31, 2020, primarily with 
equity financing, upfront payments and royalty and milestone 
payments from our partners.
genmab expects to continue to fund a significant portion of our 
development costs for proprietary product candidates as well as 
planned commercialization activities with funds received from 
royalties and milestone payments from partners.
genmab’s expenditures on current and future pre- clinical and 
clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncer-
tainties in timing and cost to completion. in order to advance our 
product candidates toward commercialization, the product candi-
dates are tested in numerous pre- clinical safety, toxicology and 
efficacy studies. genmab then conducts clinical trials for those 
product candidates that take several years or more to complete. the 
length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, 
novelty and intended use of a product candidate. the cost of clinical 
trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a 
variety of factors, including: the number of patients required in the 
clinical trials; the length of time required to enroll trial participants; 
the number and location of sites included in the trials; the costs of 
producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical 
trials and regulatory submissions; the safety and efficacy profile of 
the product candidate; the use of cros to assist with the manage-
ment of the trials; and the costs and timing of, and the ability to 
secure, regulatory approvals.
genmab’s expenses also fluctuate from period to period based 
on the degree of collaborative activities, timing of manufacturing 
campaigns, numbers of patients enrolled in clinical trials and the 
outcome of each clinical trial event. as a result, the company is 
unable to determine with any degree of certainty the anticipated 
completion dates, duration and completion costs of research and 
development projects, or when and to what extent genmab will 
receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any 
product candidates. the company also cannot predict the actual 
amount or timing of future royalties and milestone payments, and 
these may differ from estimates.
genmab expects to make additional capital outlays and to increase 
operating expenditures over the next several years as the company 
hires additional employees, supports pre- clinical development, 
manufacturing, clinical trial activities and product collaborations. 
as spending increases on research and development and pre- 
commercialization activities related to product collaborations,

genmab may be required to make certain capital outlays against 
which genmab expects to receive reimbursement revenue to the 
extent the outlay exceeds genmab’s share under the applicable 
collaboration agreement. the company expects that the time-lag 
between the expenditure by us, on the one hand, and the reim-
bursement by a partner of its relevant share, on the other hand, 
will increase genmab’s working capital needs. to the extent the 
company’s capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital 
requirements, genmab will need to finance operating requirements 
and cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt 
financings, or additional corporate collaboration and licensing 
arrangements.

cash inflow from operating activities for 2020 was dkk 6,433 
million, as compared to dkk 1,326 million in 2019. the increase 
of dkk 5,107 million was primarily related to the upfront payment 
from abbvie included in our operating result as it was collected in 
july 2020, and higher positive working capital adjustments in 2020 
related to darzalex® milestones achieved in the fourth quarter 
of 2019 that were received in 2020. working capital fluctuations, 
reversal of net financial items, and adjustments related to non-cash 
transactions, all of which may be highly variable period to period, 
also contributed to the variation.
cash outflow from investing activities for 2020 was dkk 2,351 
million, as compared to dkk 1,983 million in 2019. the increase 
of dkk 368 million, or 19%, primarily reflects differences between 
the proceeds received from the sale and maturity of our invest-
ments and amounts invested, and the investment in intangible 
and tangible assets. purchases of marketable securities exceeded 
sales and maturities in both 2020 and 2019, which has resulted in 
significant growth in the marketable securities portion of the cash 
position.
cash inflow from financing activities for 2020 was dkk 71 million, 
as compared to dkk 3,660 million in 2019. the decrease of dkk 
3,589 million, or 98%, was primarily related to net proceeds from 
the issuance of new shares in connection with the public offering 
and listing of american depository shares (adss) on the nasdaq 
global select market of dkk 3,635 million in july of 2019. exercise 
of warrants, lease payments and payment of withholding taxes on 
behalf of employees on net settled rsus, also contributed to the 
variation.
marketable securities are invested in highly secure, liquid and 
conservative investments with short effective maturity. as of 
december 31, 2020, 99% of our marketable securities had an aa 
rating or higher from moody’s, s&p, or fitch compared to 100% as 
of december 31, 2019. the weighted average effective duration 
was approximately 0.8 years as of december 31, 2020 (2019: 1.1 
years). please refer to notes 4.2 and 4.4 for additional information 
regarding our financial risks and marketable securities.
balance sheet
as of december 31, 2020, total assets were dkk 21,143 million, 
compared to dkk 15,144 million as of december 31, 2019. as of 
december 31, 2020, assets were mainly comprised of the cash 
position of dkk 16,079 million and current receivables of dkk 
2,463 million. the receivables consist primarily of amounts related 
to royalties and milestones from our collaboration agreements 
and non- interest bearing receivables, which are due less than one 
year from the balance sheet date. the credit risk on receivables 
is considered to be limited. please refer to note 3.5 for additional 
information regarding receivables.
as of december 31, 2020, total liabilities were dkk 2,022 million 
compared to dkk 1,096 million on december 31, 2019. the increase 
in total liabilities of dkk 926 million was primarily driven by an 
increase in deferred revenue of dkk 513 million related to the 
abbvie collaboration and an increase in other payables related to 
our research and development programs.
shareholders’ equity as of december 31, 2020 equaled dkk 
19,121 million compared to dkk 14,048 million at december 31, 
2019. the increase was driven primarily by net income and the 
issuance of shares related to share-based compensation plans. on 
december 31, 2020, genmab’s equity ratio was 90% compared to 
93% as of december 31, 2019.

commitment to building a sustainable 
and socially responsible biotech
genmab’s activities are anchored in the company’s core purpose 
“to improve the lives of patients by creating and developing 
innovative antibody products,” thus creating value over the 
long term not only for its employees and shareholders, but also for 
patients who may benefit from genmab’s innovation. through our 
reports on governance, csr and compensation, genmab has estab-
lished a framework to set goals and track our performance against 
these goals. as the reporting of sustainability metrics continues to 
evolve over the years, genmab has and will continue to adapt and 
improve its metrics and disclosures.
in 2020, genmab embarked upon a more focused,  business- driven 
csr strategy to steer our efforts. highlights include committing 
to and aligning our current activities with the most relevant un 
sustainable development goals (unsdgs). we have determined 
to commit to goals 3, 5 and 8, which most closely align with our 
business. additionally, we defined the key esg-related activities 
and disclosures relevant to our business and launched our first 
sustainability working group.
the year 2020 also posed unprecedented global challenges with 
the covid-19 pandemic, which highlighted the importance of 
 science- driven  innovation to help solve the world’s most pressing 
issues and which revealed just how  interconnected we are as a 
society. this interdependence reinforces how  critically important it 
is for businesses to operate in a socially responsible and sustain-
able manner. genmab’s core values have guided our teams to 
remain focused on delivering on our inspirational 2025 vision.
as a leading international biotechnology company, genmab has 
high standards for reporting requirements. genmab’s core values 
and vision are the foundation for its commitment to building a 
sustainable and socially  responsible biotech company.

set of training courses (including 
unconscious bias and cross-
cultural diversity), we committed 
to hiring a leader of diversity and

drive even greater awareness and 
impact going into 2021.
during 2020, the covid-19 
response team, led by genmab’s

that offered clear guidance to 
employees based on global and 
local government and health 
agencies. all major safety protocols 
were reviewed and enhanced to 
ensure a hygienic and safe work 
environment.

corporate social responsibility and 
sustainability commitments
the board of directors and senior leadership 
at genmab are committed to genmab’s 
 business- driven csr strategy, which focuses 
on four main areas:
employee well-being, 
including health, safety 
and development 
business ethics and 
transparency 
environment including  
waste management 
and recycling
ethics in relation to pre- 
clinical and clinical studies
our vision —  “by 2025 our own product has transformed 
cancer treatment and we have a pipeline of knock-your-
socks-off antibodies” —  inspires and motivates us to find 
new ways to improve healthcare and quality of life for patients 
and their families. we are pioneers committed to creating 
differentiated antibody products that have the potential to 
provide new treatment options to patients with life threatening 
and debilitating diseases.
we have dedicated more than 20 years to better understanding 
cancer and its impact on patients’ lives and we embrace our 
responsibility to ensure our actions not only benefit our main 
stakeholders —  patients, shareholders and employees —   but 
also society as a whole. with our core values and vision in mind, 
being socially responsible is fundamental to the way we do 
business at genmab.
in carrying out our business we strive to comply with all relevant 
laws, standards and guidelines. we also consider the well-being 
of our employees a top priority, and we minimize our impact 
on the environment to the extent possible. we have high ethical 
standards and aim to conduct business with companies and 
within countries that share our ethics and respect the protec-
tion of internationally proclaimed human rights. as we conduct 
business in a highly regulated industry, we have chosen not 
to implement a specific human rights policy. it is important to 
us, however, to support and respect the protection of inter-
nationally proclaimed human rights through other policies 
that address responsible supply chain management, ethical 
procedures, health and safety procedures and issues regarding 
access to medicine. genmab strives to only conduct clinical 
trials in markets where a drug is planned to become available. 
furthermore, genmab does not employ child labor.
genmab embraces its responsibility to society and 
is pleased to join the effort to progress the united 
nations sustainable development goals.
in 2020, we reviewed our csr focus areas and related activities 
to determine which sdgs were most closely aligned with our 
business and determined to commit to goals 3, 5 and 8. we will 
continue to assess our business operations in relation to all of 
the sdgs.
  goal 3 good health and 
well-being
ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
for all at all ages
genmab is dedicated to using science-driven innovation to 
improve the lives of patients with cancer and their families. 
in addition to the resources we dedicate to research 
and development, we are committed to our employees’ 
well-being and have benefits and programs in place to 
support them. additionally, we seek to support and be 
part of health-related initiatives in the communities where 
we operate.

  goal 5 gender equality 
achieve gender equality and empower  
all women and girls
genmab continues to be a leader in gender diversity among 
our peers. we have a female representation in “director-level 
and above” of 49 percent and are proud that four of our nine 
members of the board of directors are female, including 
the chair and deputy chair. our strong standing in gender 
balance and relatively high share of women at all levels led to 
genmab’s inclusion in the newly published goldman sachs 
“womenomics” share index of the 50 european companies that 
rank the highest in gender equality.
  goal 8 decent work and 
economic growth
promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive employment 
and decent work for all
genmab’s work is driven by innovation and conducted by 
employees who are highly skilled at and dedicated to their 
individual roles. we pay all of our employees a living wage 
and provide a safe, stimulating, and secure working environ-
ment. additionally, genmab contributes to the life sciences 
ecosystem by collaborating with academia, biotech and 
pharma companies, and other innovators to advance therapies 
against cancer and other diseases.
we also benchmarked and examined our esg activities, policies 
and disclosures to build a sustainable organization that meets esg 
criteria of relevance to our business operations. we have adopted 
the sasb framework and will follow its guidelines to disclose critical 
measurements on esg activities of relevance to our business opera-
tions. as we further execute on our csr strategy and build programs 
that have an impact on our stakeholders, we will be guided by the 
following tenets:
• we use our world-class knowledge in innovative antibody 
technologies to develop cancer treatments that have a positive 
impact on patients and society.
• we care for our employees’ health, well-being, safety and 
development and promote a collaborative culture that fosters 
passion for innovation, integrity and respect. we believe that 
diversity and inclusion are fundamental to achieving our vision 
and are committed to championing a corporate culture that 
accepts and promotes uniqueness and empowers each team 
member to bring their authentic self to work in a safe, open and 
respectful environment.
• we operate our business with the utmost integrity by always 
doing what is right, and incorporating compliance, ethics and 
transparency into our business practices, policies and procedures. 
we maintain a highly ethical organization by promoting our code 
of conduct to employees and by engaging with partners and 
suppliers committed to the same level of ethics in their operations.
• we aim to reduce our impact on the environment by refining our 
processes and incorporating best practices into our operations to 
reduce our environmental footprint, minimize waste and decrease 
use of hazardous material.
• we monitor and evaluate targets for esg activities, measure our 
impact and communicate our progress.
our csr committee, chaired by genmab’s ceo, 
is comprised of representatives from our human 
resources, investor relations and communications, legal, 
compliance and research and development functions.
the committee ensures that genmab carries out its csr activities 
effectively and communicates them clearly and openly. in 2021, we 
will continue to move our csr efforts forward, look for opportunities 
to further integrate esg into our strategic planning and risk manage-
ment processes, monitor esg matters of relevance to our business 
operations and establish clear goals to measure our performance.
genmab’s statutory report on csr for the financial year 2020 cf.

policies, progress made during 2020 and expected  activities

employees are genmab’s most important resource 
and we strive to attract and retain the most qualified 
people to fulfill our core purpose. genmab’s goal is to 
develop and retain value in our own products which 
could one day transform cancer treatment. at genmab, 
our core purpose, together with our core values, 
guides and inspires employees in their everyday work.
teamwork and respect are central pillars of genmab’s culture, and 
we therefore ensure an inclusive, open and supportive profes-
sional work environment across our international locations. we 
believe that fostering workplace diversity across social, educa-
tional, cultural, national, age and gender lines is a prerequisite 
for the continued success of the company. we are committed 
to diversity at all levels of the company and strive to recruit 
employees with the right skills and competences, regardless of 
gender, age, ethnicity and other differences.
skill, knowledge, experience and employee motivation are 
essential to genmab as a biotech company. the ability to organize 
our highly skilled and very experienced employees at all levels 
of the organization into interactive teams is a key factor in 
achieving our goals and ensuring genmab’s success. genmab’s 
teams are very experienced in the pharmaceutical and biotech-

stakeholder engagement
our research collaborators
genmab collaborates with a wide range of parties from large pharmaceutical 
companies to academic institutions. these are not collaborations with just any 
partner, but with particularly complementary partners in terms of technologies, 
capabilities and knowledge.
why are they important to us?
collaborations across the ecosystem of pharma, biotech and academia help us to create innova-
tive next-generation antibody products and potentially make them available to patients faster.
key areas of our strategy
• focus on core competence
• turn science into medicine
• build a profitable and successful biotech
how do we engage with them?
our methods of engagement vary from co- development of programs, licensing of our tech-
nology, involvement in clinical trials and indirectly, through our work with industry groups.
our list of research collaborations is extensive. in addition to large pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies, we work with innovative companies like tempus, which has built 
the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data. we collaborated on the tisotumab 
vedotin innovatv 204 study with the european network of gynecological oncological trial 
groups and gynecologic oncology group, and we belong to industry groups such as holland 
bio, bionj and the confederation of danish industry. 
as an international dual- listed company, genmab 
has many stakeholders with an interest into how we 
conduct our business. we can only be successful if we 
continually engage and maintain relationships with 
these stakeholders. this is accomplished in a variety 
of ways, including direct interactions, participation in 
industry groups and employee engagement surveys. 
some of genmab’s key stakeholder groups and the ways 
we interact with them are highlighted here.

how do we engage with them?
we create an atmosphere that fosters individual empowerment and development via an envi-
ronment that allows employees to achieve their maximum potential and transform their skills 
into real value for patients.
in 2020 we conducted a global employee engagement survey assessing 14 proven engage-
ment drivers across the rapidly transforming enterprise. our overall scoring significantly 
outpaced industry benchmarks and highlighted key opportunities to drive even higher engage-
ment in the future. a structured workplan was created to improve engagement even further 
across our rapidly evolving enterprise. 
our shareholders and investors
genmab has a diverse shareholder base, with investors in the company 
coming from across the spectrum of both size and location.

we communicate in an open and transparent way about our business, financial results, devel-
opment programs and scientific results through company announcements, investor meetings 
and company presentations.
during 2019 and 2020 we undertook an extensive outreach program, reaching out to proxy 
advisors and to shareholders representing over 40% of the genmab’s outstanding common 
stock. the discussions were robust and the perspectives we heard were diverse. in response to 
the shareholder feedback we received during this outreach, we committed to making construc-
tive changes. included in the 2020 compensation report is a summary of shareholders’ key 
concerns and our plans to address them.

corporate governance
genmab works diligently to improve its guidelines 
and policies for corporate governance, taking into 
account the recent trends in international and 
domestic requirements and recommendations. 
genmab’s commitment to corporate governance 
is based on ethics and integrity and forms the 
basis of its effort to strengthen the confidence 
that existing and future shareholders, partners, 
employees and other stakeholders have in genmab. 
the role of shareholders and their interaction with 
genmab is important. genmab believes that open 
and transparent communication is necessary to 
maintain the confidence of genmab’s shareholders 
and achieves this through company announcements, 
investor meetings and company presentations. 
genmab is committed to providing reliable and 
transparent information about its business, financial 
results, development programs and scientific results 
in a clear and timely manner.
all danish companies listed on the nasdaq copenhagen exchange 
are required to disclose in their annual reports how they address 
the recommendations for corporate governance issued by the 
committee on corporate governance in november 2017 (the 
“recommendations”), applying the “ comply-or- explain” principle.
genmab follows the vast majority of the recommendations, 
although specific sub-areas have been identified where 
genmab’s corporate governance principles differ from the 
recommendations:
• the recommendations provide that according to a company’s 
takeover contingency procedures, the board of directors shall 
not attempt to counter a takeover bid without the acceptance of 
the general meeting. genmab does not have such a restriction 
in its takeover contingency procedures and retains the right in 
certain circumstances to reject takeover bids without consulting 
the shareholders. genmab believes this provides the board of 
directors with the needed flexibility to best respond to takeover 
bids and to negotiate with bidders; retaining this flexibility helps 
the board of directors meet its objectives in protecting and 
creating value in the interest of the shareholders. actions will be 
determined on a case-by-case basis with due consideration to 
the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders.
• the recommendations provide that the total value of the 
remuneration relating to the notice period, including severance 
pay, does not exceed two years of remuneration, including 
all components of the remuneration. in the event genmab 
terminates the service agreements with each member of 
the executive management team without cause, genmab 
is obliged to pay the executive management member his/
her existing salary (including benefits) for one or two years 
after the end of the one-year notice period. also, in the 
event of termination by genmab (unless for cause) or by a 
member of the executive management as a result of a change 
of control of genmab, genmab is obliged to pay a member 
of the executive management compensation equal to his/her 
existing total salary (including benefits and a bonus) for up 
to two years in addition to the notice period. depending on 
the circumstances, termination payments to members of the 
executive management could therefore exceed two years of 
remuneration. the board of directors is, however, considering 
amending the remuneration policy to specify that the total 
value of the remuneration relating to the notice period for new 
members of executive management cannot exceed two years 
of remuneration, including all components of the remuneration, 
as defined by the recommendations.
genmab publishes its statutory report on corporate governance 
for the financial year 2020 cf. article 107 b of the danish financial 
statements act (“lovpligtig redegørelse for virksomhedsledelse 
jf. årsregnskabslovens § 107 b”) on the company’s website, 
including a detailed description of the board of directors’ consid-
eration in respect of all the recommendations. the statutory 
report on corporate governance can be found on genmab’s 
website https://ir.genmab.com/corporate-governance.
the board of directors
the board of directors plays an active role within genmab in 
setting the strategies and goals for genmab and monitoring the 
operations and results of the company. board duties include 
establishing policies for strategy, accounting, organization and 
finance and the appointment of executive management members. 
the board of directors also assesses genmab’s capital and share 
structure and is responsible for approving share issues and the 
grant of warrants and rsus.

board committees
to support the board of directors in its duties, the board of 
directors has established and appointed a compensation 
committee, an audit and finance committee, a nominating and 
corporate governance committee and a scientific committee. 
these committees are charged with reviewing issues pertaining 
to their respective fields that are due to be considered at board 
meetings. written charters specifying the tasks and responsibili-
ties for each of the committees are available on genmab’s website 
www.genmab.com.
for more details on the work and composition of the board of 
directors and its committees, reference is made to the statutory 
report on corporate governance.
remuneration policy
a remuneration policy applying to the compensation of members of 
the board of directors and the executive management of genmab 
a/s has been prepared in accordance with sections 139 and 139a of 
the danish companies act and considered and adopted by the 2020 
annual general meeting pursuant to the danish companies act (in 
danish “selskabsloven”).
the remuneration policy contains an exhaustive description 
of the remuneration components for members of the board of 
directors and the executive management and includes the reasons 
for choosing the individual components of the remuneration and 
a description of the criteria on which the balance between the 
individual components of the remuneration is based. the latest 
version, which was adopted by the general meeting in 2020, can 
be downloaded from genmab’s website https://ir.genmab.com/
governance/compensation#content.
compensation report
in accordance with the recommendations, genmab has prepared 
a compensation report for the financial year 2020 that includes 
information on the total remuneration received by each member 
of the board of directors and the executive management from 
genmab a/s and other group companies for the last three years, 
including information on the most important content of retention 
and resignation arrangements and the correlation between the 
remuneration and company strategy and relevant related goals 
(the “compensation report”). the compensation report can be 
found on genmab’s website https://ir.genmab.com/governance/
compensation#content.
disclosure regarding change of control
the danish financial statements act (section 107 a) contains rules 
relating to listed companies with respect to certain disclosures 
that may be of interest to the stock market and potential takeover 
bidders, in particular in relation to disclosure of change of control 
provisions.
for information on change of control clauses in our collaboration, 
development and license agreements as well as certain service 
agreements with the executive management and employees, please 
refer to note 5.5. change of control clauses related to our warrant 
and rsu programs are outlined in note 4.6.
more information on share capital is included in note 4.7. unless 
otherwise provided in the danish companies act, the adoption 
of any resolution to amend genmab a/s’ articles of association 
shall be subject to the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds 
of the votes cast, as well as of the voting share capital represented 
at the general meeting. genmab a/s’ entire articles of association

materiality
genmab’s annual report is based on the concept of materiality and 
the company focuses on information that is considered material 
and relevant to the users of the consolidated financial statements. 
the consolidated financial statements consist of a large number 
of transactions. these transactions are aggregated into classes 
according to their nature or function and presented in classes of 
similar items in the consolidated financial statements as required 
by ifrs and the danish financial statements act. if items are indi-
vidually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of similar 
nature in the financial statements or in the notes.
the disclosure requirements are substantial in ifrs and for danish 
listed companies. genmab provides these specific required 
disclosures unless the information is considered immaterial to the 
economic  decision- making of the readers of the financial state-
ments or not applicable.
section 1
basis of 
presentation
these consolidated financial statements include 
genmab a/s (the parent company) and subsidiaries 
over which the parent company has control. the 
genmab consolidated group is referenced herein as 
“genmab” or the “company”.
this section describes genmab’s financial accounting 
policies including management’s judgements and 
estimates under international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs). new or revised eu endorsed 
accounting standards and interpretations are 
described, in addition to how these changes are 
expected to impact the financial performance and 
reporting of genmab.
genmab describes the accounting policies in 
conjunction with each note with the aim to provide 
a more understandable description of each 
accounting area.

2020 annual report / financial statements / group
primary statements consolidated statements of changes in equity / 1.1 nature of the business and accounting policies
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements include genmab a/s (the 
parent company) and subsidiaries over which the parent company 
has control. the parent controls a subsidiary when the parent is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power to direct the activities of the subsidiary. a 
company overview is included in note 5.3.
genmab’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
on the basis of the financial statements of the parent company and 
subsidiaries —  prepared under genmab’s accounting policies —  by 
combining similar accounting items on a line-by-line basis. on 
consolidation, intercompany income and expenses, intercompany 
receivables and payables, and unrealized gains and losses on trans-
actions between the consolidated companies are eliminated.
the recorded value of the equity interests in the consolidated 
subsidiaries is eliminated with the proportionate share of the 
subsidiaries’ equity. subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
when control is transferred to the group.
the income statements for subsidiaries with a different functional 
currency than genmab’s presentation currency are translated into 
genmab’s presentation currency at average exchange rates, and the 
balance sheets are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the 
balance sheet date.
exchange rate differences arising from the translation of foreign 
subsidiaries shareholders’ equity at the beginning of the year and 
exchange rate differences arising as a result of foreign subsidiaries’ 
income statements being translated at average exchange rates are 
recorded in translation reserves in shareholders’ equity.
functional and presentation currency
the financial statements have been prepared in danish kroner 
(dkk), which is the functional and presentation currency of the 
parent company.
foreign currency
transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rates in effect at the date of the transaction.
exchange rate gains and losses arising between the transac-
tion date and the settlement date are recognized in the income 
statement as financial income or expense.
unsettled monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. 
exchange rate gains and losses arising between the transaction 
date and the balance sheet date are recognized in the income 
statement as financial income or expense.
classification of operating expenses 
in the income statement
research and development expense
research and development expenses primarily include salaries, 
benefits and other employee related costs of genmab’s research 
and development staff, license costs, manufacturing costs, pre- 
clinical costs, clinical trials, contractors and outside service fees, 
amortization and impairment of licenses and rights related to intan-
gible assets, and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, to 
the extent that such costs are related to the group’s research and 
development activities. please see note 3.1 for a more detailed 
description on the treatment of genmab’s research and develop-
ment expenses.
general and administrative expense
general and administrative expenses relate to the management and 
administration of genmab, including pre-commercialization activ-
ities. this includes salaries, benefits and other headcount costs 
related to management and support functions including human 
resources, information technology and the finance departments. 
in addition, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and 
equipment, to the extent such expenses are related to adminis-
trative functions are also included. general and administrative 
expenses are recognized in the income statement in the period to 
which they relate.
statements of cash flows
the cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method 
with basis in the net result before tax.
cash flows from operating activities are stated as the net result 
before tax adjusted for net financial items, non-cash operating 
items such as depreciation, amortization, impairment losses, share-
based compensation expenses, provisions, and for changes in 
operating assets and liabilities, interest paid and received, interest 
elements of lease payments and corporate taxes paid or received. 
operating assets and liabilities are mainly comprised of changes in 
receivables and other payables excluding the items included in cash 
and cash equivalents. changes in non- current assets and liabilities 
are included in operating assets and liabilities, if related to the main 
 revenue- producing activities of genmab.
cash flows from investing activities are comprised of cash flows 
from the purchase of intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment and financial assets, as well as the purchase and sale of 
marketable securities.
cash flows from financing activities are comprised of cash flows 
from the issuance of shares, payments of withholding taxes on 
behalf of employees on net settled rsus and payments of long-term 
loans including installments on lease liabilities. finance lease trans-
actions are considered non-cash transactions.
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash, bank deposits, 
and marketable securities with a maturity of three months or less on 
the date of acquisition.
the statements of cash flows cannot be derived solely from the 
financial statements.

2020 annual report / financial statements / group
primary statements consolidated statements of changes in equity / 1.1 nature of the business and accounting policies
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date 
the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
 re- measured at their fair value. the method of recognizing the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is desig-
nated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item 
being hedged. genmab designates certain derivatives as either:
1.  fair value hedge (hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or 
liabilities or a firm commitment); or
2.  cash flow hedge (hedges of a particular risk associated with 
a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction).
at the inception of a transaction, genmab documents the rela-
tionship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for under-
taking various hedging transactions. genmab also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of 
hedged items.
movements on the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income 
are shown as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity. the 
full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non- current 
asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item 
is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the 
remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized 
in other comprehensive income. the gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion and changes in time value of the derivative 
instrument is recognized immediately in the income statement 
within financial income or expenses.
when forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, 
genmab generally designates the full change in fair value of the 
forward contract (including forward points) as the hedging instru-
ment. in such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective 
portion of the change in fair value of the entire forward contract are 
recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or 
liability that is attributable to the hedged risk.
genmab had no material hedge transactions in 2020, 2019, or 2018.
treasury shares
the total amount paid to acquire treasury shares including directly 
attributable costs and the proceeds from the sale of treasury shares 
are recognized in retained earnings.
research collaborations, license agreements 
and collaborative agreements
research collaborations and license agreements
genmab continues to pursue the establishment of research collab-
orations and licensing agreements. these arrangements often 
include upfront payments, expense reimbursements or payments to 
the collaboration partner, and milestone and royalty arrangements, 
contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to 
the success of the asset in development.
in regard to genmab’s license agreements with janssen, novartis 
and roche, each of these parties retain final  decision- making 
authority over the relevant activities and as such no joint control 
exists. refer to note 2.1 for additional information related to 
revenue from these parties.
genmab’s other significant research collaborations and license 
arrangements are with janssen (duobody®), curevac and immatics. 
refer to note 3.4 for additional information regarding genmab’s 
equity investment in curevac.
joint collaborative agreements
genmab has entered into a number of joint collaborative agree-
ments. these agreements often include upfront payments, expense 
reimbursements or payments to the collaboration partner, and 
milestone and royalty arrangements, contingent upon the occur-
rence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in 
development.
these agreements also provide genmab with varying rights 
to develop, produce and market products together with its 
collaborative partners. both parties in these arrangements are 
active participants and exposed to significant risks and rewards 
dependent on the commercial success of the activities of the 
collaboration. genmab’s more significant collaboration agree-
ments are with abbvie (epcoritamab), seagen (tisotumab vedotin) 
and biontech.
refer to note 2.1 for additional information related to revenue 
from the abbvie collaboration.

some existing standards, the majority of which are effective for 
accounting periods beginning on january 1, 2021 or later. therefore, 
they are not incorporated in these consolidated financial state-
ments. there are no standards presently known that are not yet 
effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on 
genmab in current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable 
future transactions.
1.3
management’s judgements 
and estimates under ifrs
in preparing financial statements under ifrs, certain provisions in 
the standards require management’s judgements, including various 
accounting estimates and assumptions. these judgements and 
estimates affect the application of accounting policies, as well as 
reported amounts within the consolidated financial statements and 
disclosures.
determining the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities 
requires judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning future 
events that are based on historical experience and other factors, 
which by their very nature are associated with uncertainty and 
unpredictability.
accounting estimates are based on historical experience and 
various other factors relative to the circumstances in which they 
are applied. estimates are generally made based on information 
available at the time. an example would include management’s esti-
mation of useful lives of intangible assets.
accounting judgements are made in the process of applying 
accounting policies. these judgements are typically made based on 
the guidance and information available at the time of application. 
examples would include management’s judgements utilized in 
determining revenue recognition.
these estimates and judgements may prove incomplete or 
incorrect, and unexpected events or circumstances may arise. 
genmab is also subject to risks and uncertainties which may lead 
actual results to differ from these estimates, both positively and 
negatively. specific risks for genmab are discussed in the relevant 
section of this annual report and in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements.
the areas involving a high degree of judgement and estimation that 
are significant to the consolidated financial statements are summa-
rized below. refer to the identified notes for further information on 
the key accounting estimates and judgements utilized in the prepa-
ration of the consolidated financial statements.

revenue may vary from period to period as revenue comprises 
royalties, milestone payments, license fees and reimbursement of 
certain research and development costs under genmab’s collabora-
tion agreements.
 accounting policies
genmab recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control 
of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the 
consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for 
those goods or services. to determine revenue recognition for 
arrangements that genmab determines are within the scope of 
ifrs 15, genmab performs the following five steps: (i) identify the 
contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations 
in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the 
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 
and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a perfor-
mance obligation. genmab only applies the five-step model to 
contracts when it is probable that the company will collect the 
consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services 
it transfers to the customer. at contract inception, once the contract 
is determined to be within the scope of ifrs 15, genmab assesses 
the goods or services promised within each contract and identifies, 
as a performance obligation, and assesses whether each promised 
good or service is distinct. revenue is recognized in the amount of 
the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance 
obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
royalties: certain of genmab’s license and collaboration agree-
ments include sales-based royalties including commercial milestone 
payments based on the level of sales. the license has been

deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate 
under genmab’s license and collaboration agreements. as a result, 
genmab recognizes revenue when the related sales occur.
reimbursement revenue for r&d services: genmab’s research 
collaboration agreements include the provisions for reimburse-
ment or cost sharing for research and development services and 
payment for full time equivalent employees (ftes) at contractual 
rates. r&d services are performed and satisfied over time given that 
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits 
provided by genmab and revenue for research services is recog-
nized over time rather than a point in time.
milestone revenue: at the inception of each arrangement that 
includes milestone payments, genmab evaluates whether the 
achievement of milestones are considered highly probable and 
estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using 
the most likely amount method. if it is highly probable that a signif-
icant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone 
value is included in the transaction price. milestone payments that 
are not within the control of genmab or the license and collabo-
ration partner, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered 
probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. the 
transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation 
on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which genmab 
recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under 
the contract are satisfied. at the end of each subsequent reporting 
period, genmab re- evaluates the probability of achievement of 
such development milestones and any related constraint, and if 
necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. any 
such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, 
which would affect revenue and earnings in the period of adjust-
ment. under all of genmab’s existing license and collaboration 
agreements, milestone payments have been allocated to the license 
transfer performance obligation.
license revenue for intellectual property: if the license to 
genmab’s functional intellectual property is determined to be 
distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the 
arrangement, genmab recognizes revenues from non- refundable 
upfront fees allocated to the license at the point in time the license 
is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and 
benefit from the license. for licenses that are bundled with other 
promises, genmab utilizes judgement to assess the nature of 
the combined performance obligation to determine whether the 
combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a 
point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring 
progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non- refundable, 
upfront fees. under all of genmab’s existing license and collabora-
tion agreements the license to functional intellectual property has 
been determined to be distinct from other performance obligations 
identified in the agreement.
abbvie collaboration agreement
on june 10, 2020, genmab entered into a broad collaboration 
agreement to jointly develop and commercialize epcoritamab 
( duobody- cd3xcd20),  duohexabody-cd37 and  duobody- cd3x5t4 
and a discovery research collaboration for future differentiated 
antibody therapeutics for cancer. under the terms of the agreement, 
genmab received a usd 750 million upfront payment in july 2020.
within this abbvie agreement, genmab identified four perfor-
mance obligations: (1) delivery of license for epcoritamab (2) 
delivery of license for  duohexabody-cd37 (3) delivery of license for 
 duobody- cd3x5t4 (4) co- development costs related to the product 
concepts that will be under a separate research collaboration 
agreement. the total transaction price under the agreement was 
determined to be the usd 750 million (dkk 4,911 million) upfront 
payment as the future potential milestone amounts were not 
deemed to be highly probable as they are contingent upon success 
in future clinical trials and regulatory approvals which are not 
within genmab’s control and were uncertain at the inception of the 
agreement. milestones will be recognized when their achievement 
is deemed to be highly probable and a significant revenue reversal 
would not occur. upon commercialization of products, if any, under 
this agreement, royalties and net sales-based milestones will be 
recognized when the related sales occur.
the total transaction price of usd 750 million (dkk 4,911 million) 
was allocated to the four performance obligations based on the 
best estimate of relative stand-alone selling prices. for the license 
grants, genmab based the stand-alone selling price on a discounted 
cash flow approach and considered several factors including, but 
not limited to discount rate, development timeline, regulatory risks, 
estimated market demand and future revenue potential. for co- de-
velopment activities related to the product concepts, a cost-plus 
margin approach was utilized. the allocation of the transaction 
price to the performance obligations is summarized below:
• delivery of licenses for the three programs: usd 672 million 
(dkk 4,398 million)
• co- development activities for the product concepts: usd 
78 million (dkk 513 million)
the performance obligations related to the delivery of licenses were 
completed at a point in time (june 2020) and genmab recognized 
usd 672 million (dkk 4,398 million) as license fee revenue in june 
2020. after delivery of the licenses, genmab shares further devel-
opment and commercial costs equally with abbvie. abbvie is not 
assessed as a customer but as a collaboration partner, and as such 
this part of the collaboration is not in scope of ifrs 15. any cost 
reimbursement/cost sharing with abbvie will not be recognized as 
revenue but accounted for as a decrease of the related research and 
development expenses.
the remaining transaction price of usd 78 million (dkk 513 million) 
related to the co- development activities for the product concepts 
was recorded as deferred revenue and is expected to be recognized 
as revenue as activities are performed, which is estimated to be 
over a seven year-period. this seven-year period approximates 
an average development life cycle for these types of projects. 
revenue will be recognized for the co- development activities 
based on a measure of genmab’s efforts toward satisfying the 
performance obligation relative to the total expected efforts or 
inputs to satisfy the performance obligation. no revenue has 
been recognized in 2020. in future reporting periods, genmab will 
reevaluate the estimates related to its efforts toward satisfying

• genmab engaged third-party valuation specialists to assist 
with the allocation of the transaction price. in formulating the 
allocation of the transaction price various valuation techniques 
were utilized, including a discounted cash flow approach and a 
cost-plus margin approach.
• the utilization of the discounted cash flow approach considered 
several factors including, but not limited to discount rate, 
development timeline, regulatory risks, estimated market demand 
and future revenue potential. the utilization of the cost-plus 
margin approach considered several factors, including but not 
limited to discount rate, estimated development costs, and 
profit margin.

 management’s judgements and estimates
revenue recognition
evaluating the criteria for revenue recognition under license and 
collaboration agreements requires management’s judgement to 
assess and determine the following:
• the nature of performance obligations and whether they 
are distinct or should be combined with other performance 
obligations to determine whether the performance obligations are 
satisfied over time or at a point in time.
• an assessment of whether the achievement of milestone 
payments is highly probable.
• the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation 
identified in the contract using key assumptions which 
may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, 
reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and 
probabilities of technical and regulatory success.
2.2
information about geographical areas
genmab is managed and operated as one business unit, which is reflected in the organizational structure and internal reporting. no 
separate lines of business or separate business entities have been identified with respect to any of the product candidates or geographical 
markets and no segment information is currently prepared for internal reporting.
accordingly, it has been concluded that it is not relevant to include segment disclosures in the financial statements as the genmab’s 
business activities are not organized on the basis of differences in related product and geographical areas.

government grants, which are a reduction of payroll taxes in the 
netherlands, amounted to dkk 119 million in 2020, dkk 96 million 
in 2019 and dkk 86 million in 2018. these amounts are an offset 
to wages and salaries and research and development costs in the 
tables above. the increases in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were primarily 
due to increased research activities in the netherlands.
 accounting policies
share-based compensation expenses
genmab has granted restricted stock units (rsus) and warrants 
to the board of directors, executive management and employees 
under various share-based compensation programs. the group 
applies ifrs 2, according to which the fair value of the warrants 
and rsus at grant date is recognized as an expense in the income 
statement over the vesting period. such compensation expenses 
represent calculated values of warrants and rsus granted and do 
not represent actual cash expenditures. a corresponding amount 
is recognized in shareholders’ equity as both the warrant and rsu 
programs are designated as  equity- settled share-based payment 
transactions.
government grants
the dutch research and development act “wbso” provides 
compensation for a part of research and development wages 
and other costs through a reduction in payroll taxes. wbso grant 
amounts are offset against wages and salaries and research and 
development costs.

share-based compensation expenses
in accordance with ifrs 2, the fair value of the warrants and 
rsus at grant date is recognized as an expense in the income 
statement over the vesting period, the period of delivery of work. 
subsequently, the fair value is not remeasured.
the fair value of each warrant granted during the year is calculated 
using the black- scholes pricing model. this pricing model requires 
the input of subjective assumptions such as:
• the expected stock price volatility, which is based upon the 
historical volatility of genmab’s stock price;
• the risk-free interest rate, which is determined as the interest 
rate on danish government bonds (bullet issues) with a maturity 
of five years;
• the expected life of warrants, which is based on vesting 
terms, expected rate of exercise and life terms in the current 
warrant program.
these assumptions can vary over time and can change the fair 
value of future warrants granted.
valuation assumptions for warrants granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018

the fair value of each rsu granted during the year is equal to the closing market price on the date of grant of one genmab a/s share. based 
on a weighted average fair value per rsu of dkk 1,927.83 in 2020, dkk 1,511.70 in 2019 and dkk 1,033.95 in 2018, the total fair value of rsus

genmab records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax 
assets to reflect the net amount that is more likely than not to be 
realized. realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of future taxable income, the amount and timing of 
which are uncertain. the establishment of a valuation allowance 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence 
when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred 
tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a 
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. based upon the weight of available 
evidence at december 31, 2020, genmab determined that it was 
more likely than not that all deferred tax assets in the united states 
(u.s.) are not realizable at this time. the decision to provide a full 
valuation allowance against u.s. deferred tax assets was made 
after management considered all available evidence, both positive 
and negative, including but not limited to genmab’s historical 
operating results, taxable income or loss in recent periods by 
jurisdiction, cumulative income in recent years, forecasted earnings, 
future taxable income, and significant risk and uncertainty related 
to forecasts.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, genmab had gross tax loss 
carry-forwards of dkk 1.6 billion to reduce future taxable income 
in the u.s. and netherlands. the carry-forwards generally expire in 
various periods through 2040.
in addition to the deferred taxes listed above, genmab has unrec-
ognized unused tax benefits of approximately dkk 950 million to 
offset future taxable income in the us. these unused tax benefits 
expire in various periods through 2033.
 accounting policies
corporate tax
corporate tax, which consists of current tax and deferred taxes for 
the year, is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent 
that the tax is attributable to items which directly relate to share-
holders’ equity or other comprehensive income.
current tax assets and liabilities for current and prior periods are 
measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the tax authorities.
deferred tax
deferred tax is accounted for under the liability method which 
requires recognition of deferred tax on all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the tax 
base of such assets and liabilities. this includes the tax value of 
certain tax losses carried forward.
deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the tax regulations 
in the individual countries and the tax rates expected to be in 
force at the time the deferred tax is utilized. changes in deferred 
tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognized in the 
income statement.
deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences, including 
the tax value of losses to be carried forward, are recognized only 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the differences can be utilized.
 management’s judgements and estimates
deferred tax
genmab recognizes deferred tax assets, including the tax base 
of tax loss carryforwards, if management assesses that these tax 
assets can be offset against positive taxable income within a fore-
seeable future. this judgement is made on an ongoing basis and is 
based on numerous factors, including actual results, budgets, and 
business plans for the coming years.
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon a number of 
factors, including future taxable earnings, the timing and amount 
of which is highly uncertain. a significant portion of genmab’s 
future taxable income will be driven by future events that are highly 
susceptible to factors outside the control of the group including 
commercial growth of darzalex®, specific clinical outcomes, 
regulatory approvals, advancement of genmab’s product pipeline, 
and other matters. genmab intends to continue maintaining a 
valuation allowance against a significant portion of its deferred tax 
assets related to its subsidiaries until there is sufficient evidence to 
support the reversal of all or some additional portion of these allow-
ances. the company may release an additional part of its valuation 
allowance against its deferred tax assets related to its subsidiaries. 
this release would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax 
assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period such 
release is recorded.

basic net result per share
basic net result per share is calculated as the net result for the year 
divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary 
shares, excluding treasury shares.
diluted net result per share
diluted net result per share is calculated as the net result for the 
year divided by the weighted average number of outstanding 
ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares adjusted for the dilutive 
effect of share equivalents.

section 3 operating assets and liabilities / 3.1 intangible assets
 accounting policies
research and development
genmab currently has no internally generated intangible assets 
from development, as the criteria for recognition of an asset are not 
met as described below.
licenses and rights
licenses, rights, and patents are initially measured at cost and 
include the net present value of any future payments. the net 
present value of any future payments is recognized as a liability. 
milestone payments are accounted for as an increase in the cost to 
acquire licenses, rights, and patents. genmab acquires licenses and 
rights primarily to gain access to targets and technologies identified 
by third parties.
amortization
licenses, rights, and patents are amortized using the  straight-line 
method over the estimated useful life of five to seven years. 
amortization, impairment losses, and gains or losses on the 
disposal of intangible assets are recognized in the income 
statement as research and development costs.
impairment
if circumstances or changes in genmab’s operations indicate that 
the carrying amount of non- current assets in a cash- generating 
unit may not be recoverable, management reviews the asset 
for impairment.
 management’s judgements and estimates
research and development
internally generated intangible assets
according to the ias 38, intangible assets arising from development 
projects should be recognized in the balance sheet. the criteria that 
must be met for capitalization are that:
• the development project is clearly defined and identifiable 
and the attributable costs can be measured reliably during the 
development period;
• the technological feasibility, adequate resources to complete and 
a market for the product or an internal use of the product can be 
documented; and
• management has the intent to produce and market the product or 
to use it internally.
such an intangible asset should be recognized if sufficient certainty 
can be documented that the future income from the development 
project will exceed the aggregate cost of production, development, 
and sale and administration of the product.
a development project involves a single product candidate under-
going a high number of tests to illustrate its safety profile and its 
effect on humans prior to obtaining the necessary final approval of 
the product from the appropriate authorities. the future economic 
benefits associated with the individual development projects are 
dependent on obtaining such approval. considering the significant 
risk and duration of the development period related to the develop-
ment of biological products, management has concluded that the 
future economic benefits associated with the individual projects 
cannot be estimated with sufficient certainty until the project 
has been finalized and the necessary final regulatory approval 
of the product has been obtained. accordingly, genmab has not 
recognized such assets at this time and therefore all research 
and development costs are recognized in the income statement 
when incurred.
antibody clinical trial material purchased 
for use in clinical trials
according to our accounting policies, antibody clinical trial material 
(antibodies) for use in clinical trials that are purchased from third 
parties will only be recognized in the balance sheet at cost and 
expensed in the income statement when consumed, if all criteria for 
recognition as an asset are fulfilled.
during both 2020 and 2019, no antibodies purchased from third 
parties for use in clinical trials have been capitalized, as these anti-
bodies do not qualify for being capitalized as inventory under either 
the “framework” to ias/ifrs or ias 2, “inventories.”
management has concluded that the purchase of antibodies from 
third parties cannot be capitalized as the technical feasibility is not 
proven and no alternative use exists. expenses in connection with 
purchase of antibodies are expensed as incurred.
estimation of useful life
genmab has licenses, rights, and patents that are amortized over 
an estimated useful life of the intangible asset. as of december 31, 
2020, the carrying amount of the intangible assets was dkk 
338 million (2019 —  dkk 470 million). genmab estimates the useful 
life of the intangible assets to be at least seven years based on 
the expected obsolescence of such assets. however, the actual 
useful life may be shorter or longer than seven years, depending 
on the development risk, the probability of success related to 
the development of a clinical drug as well as potential launch of 
competing products.

section 3 operating assets and liabilities / 3.3 leases
 accounting policies
property, plant and equipment is mainly comprised of leasehold 
improvements, assets under construction, and equipment, furniture 
and fixtures, which are measured at cost less accumulated depreci-
ation, and any impairment losses.
the cost is comprised of the acquisition price and direct costs 
related to the acquisition until the asset is ready for use. costs 
include direct costs and costs to subcontractors.
depreciation
depreciation, which is stated at cost net of any residual value, is 
calculated on a  straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of 
the assets, which are as follows:
equipment, furniture and fixtures
3–5 years
computer equipment
3 years
leasehold improvements
15 years or the lease term, if shorter
the useful lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted if 
appropriate on a yearly basis. assets under construction are not 
depreciated.
impairment
if circumstances or changes in genmab’s operations indicate that the 
carrying amount of non- current assets in a cash- generating unit may 
not be recoverable, management reviews the asset for impairment.
the basis for the review is the recoverable amount of the assets, 
determined as the greater of the fair value less cost to sell or its 
value in use. value in use is calculated as the net present value of 
future cash inflow generated from the asset.
if the carrying amount of an asset is greater than the recoverable 
amount, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount. an 
impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when the 
impairment is identified.
3.3
leases
genmab has entered into lease agreements with respect to office 
space and office equipment.
the leases are non- cancellable for various periods up to 2038.

2020 annual report / financial statements / group
section 3 operating assets and liabilities / 3.4 other investments
 accounting policies
all leases are recognized in the balance sheet as a right-of-use 
(“rou”) asset with a corresponding lease liability, except for short 
term assets in which the lease term is 12 months or less, or low 
value assets.
rou assets represent genmab’s right to use an underlying asset 
for the lease term and lease liabilities represent genmab’s obli-
gation to make lease payments arising from the lease. the rou 
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and 
the lease term on a  straight-line basis over the lease term. in the 
income statement, lease costs are replaced by depreciation of the 
rou asset recognized over the lease term in operating expenses, 
and interest expenses related to the lease liability are classified in 
financial items.
genmab determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. 
genmab leases various properties and it equipment. rental 
contracts are typically made for fixed periods. lease terms are 
negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of 
different terms and conditions.
assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on 
a present value basis. lease liabilities include the net present value 
of fixed payments, less any lease incentives. as genmab’s leases 
do not provide an implicit interest rate, genmab uses an incre-
mental borrowing rate based on the information available at the 
commencement date of the lease in determining the present value 
of lease payments. lease terms utilized by genmab may include 
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably 
certain that genmab will exercise that option. in determining the 
lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that 
create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not 
exercise a termination option. extension options (or periods after 
termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease 
is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).
rou assets are measured at cost and include the amount of the 
initial measurement of lease liability, any lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs.
payments associated with short-term leases and leases of 
low-value assets are recognized on a  straight-line basis as an 
expense in the income statement. short-term leases are leases with 
a lease term of 12 months or less and low-value assets comprise it 
equipment and small items of office furniture.
3.4
other investments
genmab’s other investments consist primarily of an investment 
in common shares of curevac n.v. (“curevac”). curevac is also a 
strategic partner that is focused on the research and development 
of differentiated mrna-based antibody products by combining 
curevac’s mrna technology and know-how with genmab’s propri-
etary antibody technologies and expertise. the investment in 
curevac ag was made in december 2019. in august 2020, curevac 
ag had an ipo and its shares are now listed under curevac n.v. the 
investment in curevac is recorded at fair value through profit and 
loss. this investment represents 1.2% ownership of curevac and 
is recorded at a fair value of dkk 1,067 million as of december 31, 
2020 compared to dkk 149 million as of december 31, 2019.

during 2020 and 2019, there were no losses related to receivables 
and the credit risk on receivables is considered to be limited. the 
provision for expected credit losses was not significant given that 
there have been no credit losses over the last three years and the 
high- quality nature (top tier life science companies) of genmab’s 
customers are not likely to result in future default risk.
the receivables are mainly comprised of royalties, milestones and 
reductions of research and development costs from our collabora-
tion agreements and are non- interest bearing receivables which are 
due less than one year from the balance sheet date.
please refer to note 4.2 for additional information about interest 
receivables and related credit risk.
 accounting policies
receivables are designated as financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and are initially measured at fair value or transaction 
price and subsequently measured in the balance sheet at amortized 
cost, which generally corresponds to nominal value less expected 
credit loss provision.

genmab utilizes a simplified approach to measuring expected credit 
losses and uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all receiv-
ables. to measure the expected credit losses, receivables have 
been grouped based on credit risk characteristics and the days

provisions include contractual restoration obligations related 
to our lease of offices. in determining the fair value of the resto-
ration obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation 
to discounting, the expected cost to restore the offices and the 
expected timing of those costs.
the majority of non- current provisions are expected to be settled 
in 2022.
 accounting policy
provisions are recognized when the group has an existing legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of events occurring prior to or 
on the balance sheet date, and it is probable that the utilization 
of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. 
provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the 
expenses required to settle the obligation.
a provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected 
benefits to be derived by genmab from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. 
the provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost 
of continuing with the contract.
when genmab has a legal obligation to restore our office lease in 
connection with the termination, a provision is recognized corre-
sponding to the present value of expected future costs.
the present value of a provision is calculated using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the obligation. the increase in the provision 
due to passage of time is recognized as an interest expense.

which dkk 4,398 million has been recognized as license revenue 
during 2020.
the revenue deferred at the initiation of the abbvie agreement in 
june 2020 related to two product concepts to be identified and 
controlled under a research agreement to be negotiated between 
genmab and abbvie. the product concepts relate to (1) genmab 
antibodies conjugated with different linker payloads and (2) cd3 
duobody® molecules. genmab and abbvie will conclude a research 
agreement that will govern the research and development activ-
ities in regard to the product concepts. as there have been no 
development activities for the product concepts at december 31, 
2020, no recognition of deferred revenue has been made in 
2020. this deferred revenue is estimated to be recognized over a 
seven-year period which reflects the period expected to develop a 
drug candidate.

the current other payables are comprised of liabilities that are due 
less than one year from the balance sheet date and are in general 
not interest bearing and settled on an ongoing basis during the next 
financial year.
non- current payables are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. 
the increase in the liability due to passage of time is recognized as 
interest expense.
staff cost liabilities
wages and salaries, social security contributions, paid leave 
and bonuses, and other employee benefits are recognized in the 
financial year in which the employee performs the associated work.
termination benefits are recognized as an expense, when 
the genmab group is committed demonstrably, without 
realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to 
terminate employment.
genmab’s pension plans are classified as defined contribution 
plans, and, accordingly, no pension obligations are recognized 
in the balance sheet. costs relating to defined contribution plans 
are included in the income statement in the period in which 
they are accrued and outstanding contributions are included in 
other payables.
accounts payable
accounts payable are measured in the balance sheet at

4.1
capital management
genmab’s goal is to maintain a strong capital base so as to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence, and a contin-
uous advancement of genmab’s product pipeline and business 
in general.
genmab is primarily financed through partnership collaboration 
income and had, as of december 31, 2020, a cash position of dkk 
16,079 million compared to dkk 10,971 million as of december 31, 
2019. the cash position supports the advancement of our product 
pipeline and operations.
the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, 
including continued growth of darzalex sales, progress in 
our research and development programs, the magnitude of 
those programs, our commitments to existing and new clinical 
collaborators, our ability to establish commercial and licensing 
arrangements, our capital expenditures, market developments, 
and any future acquisitions. accordingly, we may require additional 
funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or 
debt financings, collaborative agreements with partners, or from 
other sources.
the board of directors monitors the share and capital structure to 
ensure that genmab’s capital resources support the strategic goals. 
there was no change in the group’s approach to capital manage-
ment procedures in 2020.
neither genmab a/s nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to exter-
nally imposed capital requirements.
4.2
financial risk
the financial risks of the genmab group are managed centrally.
the overall risk management guidelines have been approved by 
the board of directors and includes the group’s investment policy 
related to our marketable securities. the group’s risk manage-
ment guidelines are established to identify and analyze the risks 
faced by the genmab group, to set the appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits. it is 
genmab’s policy not to actively speculate in financial risks. the 
group’s financial risk management is directed solely against moni-
toring and reducing financial risks which are directly related to 
genmab’s operations.
the primary objective of genmab’s investment activities is to 
preserve capital and ensure liquidity with a secondary objective of 
maximizing the return derived from security investments without 
significantly increasing risk. therefore, our investment policy 
includes among other items, guidelines and ranges for which invest-
ments (all of which are  shorter-term in nature) are considered to be 
eligible investments for genmab and which investment parameters 
are to be applied, including maturity limitations and credit ratings. 
in addition, the policy includes specific diversification criteria and 
investment limits to minimize the risk of loss resulting from over 
concentration of assets in a specific class, issuer, currency, country, 
or economic sector.
currently, our marketable securities are administrated by two 
external investment managers. the guidelines and investment 
managers are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market 
conditions, genmab’s activities and financial position. in 2016, the 
investment policy was amended to increase the investment limits 
for individual securities and reduce the percent of the total portfolio 
required to have a maturity of less than one year. the changes were 
made as a result of the higher value of our marketable securities 
portfolio and reduced need for short duration securities.

section 4 capital structure, financial risk and related items / 4.2 financial risk
in addition to the capital management and financing risk mentioned 
in note 4.1, genmab has identified the following key financial 
risk areas, which are mainly related to our marketable securi-
ties portfolio:
• credit risk;
• foreign currency risk; and
• interest rate risk
all of genmab’s marketable securities are traded in established 
markets. given the current market conditions, all future cash 
inflows including re- investments of proceeds from the disposal of 
marketable securities are invested in highly liquid and conservative 
investments. please refer to note 4.4 for additional information 
regarding marketable securities.
credit risk
genmab is exposed to credit risk and losses on marketable secu-
rities and bank deposits. the maximum credit exposure related to 
genmab’s cash position was dkk 16,079 million as of december 31, 
2020 compared to dkk 10,971 million as of december 31, 2019. the 
maximum credit exposure to genmab’s receivables was dkk 2,483 
million as of december 31, 2020 compared to dkk 3,001 million as 
of december 31, 2019.
marketable securities
to manage and reduce credit risks on our securities, genmab’s 
policy is to ensure only securities from investment grade issuers 
are eligible for our portfolios. no issuer of marketable securities can 
be accepted if it is not assumed that the credit quality of the issuer 
would be at least equal to the rating shown below:
category
s&p
moody’s
fitch
short-term
a-1
p-1
f-1
long-term
a-
a3
a-
genmab’s current portfolio is spread over a number of different 
securities and is conservative with a focus on liquidity and security. 
as of december 31, 2020, 99% of our marketable securities had an 
aa rating or higher from moody’s, s&p, or fitch compared to 100% 
as of december 31, 2019. the total value of marketable securities 
including interest receivables amounted to dkk 8,874 million at the 
end of 2020 compared to dkk 7,453 million at the end of 2019.
bank deposits
to reduce the credit risk on our bank deposits, genmab policy is 
only to invest its cash deposits with highly rated financial institu-
tions. currently, these financial institutions have a short-term fitch 
and s&p rating of at least f-1 and a-1, respectively. in addition, 
genmab maintains bank deposits at a level necessary to support 
the short-term funding requirements of the genmab group. the 
total value of bank deposits including short-term marketable 
securities amounted to dkk 7,260 million as of december 31, 2020 
compared to dkk 3,552 million at the end of 2019. the increase was 
primarily driven by the upfront payment of usd 750 million (dkk 
4,911 million) related to the abbvie collaboration.
receivables
the credit risk related to our receivables is not significant based 
on the high quality nature of genmab’s collaboration partners. as 
disclosed in note 2.1, janssen is genmab’s primary partner in which 
receivables are established for royalties and milestones achieved.
foreign currency risk
genmab’s presentation currency is the dkk; however, genmab’s 
revenues and expenses are in a number of different currencies. 
consequently, there is a substantial risk of exchange rate fluctua-
tions having an impact on genmab’s cash flows, profit (loss) and/or 
financial position in dkk.
the majority of genmab’s revenue is generated in usd. exchange 
rate changes to the usd will result in changes to the translated 
value of future net result before tax and cash flows. genmab’s 
revenue in usd was 95% of total revenue in 2020 as compared to 
97% in 2019 and 96% in 2018.
the foreign subsidiaries are not significantly affected by currency 
risks as both revenues and expenses are primarily settled in the 
foreign subsidiaries’ functional currencies.
assets and liabilities in foreign currency
the most significant cash flows of genmab are dkk, eur, usd and 
gbp, and genmab limits its currency exposure by maintaining cash 
positions in these currencies. genmab’s total marketable securities 
were invested in eur (10%), dkk (19%), usd (70%) and gbp (1%) 
denominated securities as of december 31, 2020, compared to 12%, 
23%, 64%, and 1%, as of december 31, 2019.

 *  the analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, 
remain constant.
 **  the movements in the income statement and equity arise from monetary 
items (cash, marketable securities, receivables and liabilities) where the 
functional currency of the entity differs from the currency that the monetary 
items are denominated in.
accordingly, significant changes in exchange rates could cause 
genmab’s net result to fluctuate significantly as gains and losses 
are recognized in the income statement. genmab’s eur exposure 
is mainly related to our marketable securities, contracts and other 
costs denominated in eur. since the introduction of eur in 1999, 
denmark has committed to maintaining a central rate of 7.46 dkk 
to the eur. this rate may fluctuate within a +/- 2.25% band. should 
denmark’s policy toward the eur change, the dkk values of our 
eur denominated assets and costs could be materially different 
compared to what is calculated and reported under the existing 
danish policy toward the dkk/eur.
the usd currency exposure was mainly related to cash, market-
able securities, and receivables related to our collaborations with 
janssen, abbvie, novartis and horizon. significant changes in the 
exchange rate of usd to dkk could cause the net result to change 
materially as shown in the table above.
the gbp currency exposure is mainly related to contracts and 
marketable securities denominated in gbp.
interest rate risk
genmab’s exposure to interest rate risk is primarily related to the 
marketable securities, as genmab currently does not have signifi-
cant interest bearing debts.
marketable securities
the securities in which the group has invested bear interest rate 
risk, as a change in market derived interest rates may cause fluctu-
ations in the fair value of the investments. in accordance with the 
objective of the investment activities, the portfolio of securities is 
monitored on a total return basis.
to control and minimize the interest rate risk, genmab maintains an 
investment portfolio in a variety of securities with a relatively short 
effective duration with both fixed and variable interest rates.
as of december 31, 2020, the portfolio has an average effective 
duration of approximately 0.8 years (2019: 1.1 years) and no 
securities have an effective duration of more than 6 years (2019: 
9 years), which means that a change in the interest rates of one 
percentage point will cause the fair value of the securities to change 
by approximately 0.8% (2019: 1.1%). due to the short-term nature of 
the current investments and to the extent that we are able to hold 
the investments to maturity, we consider our current exposure to 
changes in fair value due to interest rate changes to be insignificant 
compared to the fair value of the portfolio.

 accounting policies
classification of categories of financial 
assets and liabilities
genmab classifies its financial assets held into the following 
measurement categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through 
other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and
• those to be measured at amortized cost.
the classification depends on the business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
for assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be 
recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
genmab reclassifies debt investments only when its business 
model for managing those assets changes.
further details about the accounting policy for each of the catego-
ries are outlined in the respective notes.
fair value measurement
genmab measures financial instruments, such as marketable 
securities, at fair value at each balance sheet date. management 
assessed that financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized 
costs such as bank deposits, receivables and other payables 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term 
maturities of these instruments.
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. the fair value measurement 
is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous 
market for the asset or liability.
the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible 
by genmab.
the fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
genmab uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at 
fair value, ifrs 13 for financial instruments requires disclosure of fair 
value measurements by level of the following fair value measure-
ment hierarchy for:
• level 1 —  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities
• level 2 —  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, 
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
• level 3 —  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
for assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial state-
ments on a recurring basis, genmab determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re- assessing 
categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting 
period. any transfers between the different levels are carried out at 
the end of the reporting period.

 accounting policies
marketable securities consist of investments in securities with 
a maturity greater than three months at the time of acquisition. 
measurement of marketable securities depends on the business 
model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics 
of the asset. there are two measurement categories into which 
genmab classifies its debt instruments:
• amortized cost: assets that are held for collection of contractual 
cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of 
principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost. interest 
income from these financial assets is included in finance income 
using the effective interest rate method. any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and 
presented in other gains/(losses), together with foreign exchange 
gains and losses. impairment losses are presented as a separate 
line item in the statement of profit or loss.
• fair value through profit and loss (fvpl): assets that do not 
meet the criteria for amortized cost or fvoci are measured at 
fvpl. a gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently 
measured at fvpl is recognized in profit or loss and presented 
net within financial income or expenses in the period in which 
it arises.
genmab’s portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis 
in accordance with its stated investment guidelines and the infor-
mation provided internally to management. this business model 
does not meet the criteria for amortized cost or fvoci and as a 
result marketable securities are measured at fair value through 
profit and loss. this classification is consistent with the prior year’s 
classification.
genmab invests its cash in deposits with major financial institu-
tions, in danish mortgage bonds, and notes issued by the danish, 
european and united states governments. the securities can be 
purchased and sold using established markets.
transactions are recognized at trade date.

interest income
interest and other financial income of dkk 184 million in 2020 
compared to dkk 120 million in 2019 increased primarily due to 
a higher cash position in 2020 compared to 2019, partly offset 
by lower interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019. interest and 
other financial income of dkk 120 million in 2019 compared to 
dkk 63 million in 2018 increased primarily due to both higher cash 
position and interest rates in 2019 compared to 2018.
foreign exchange rate gains and losses
realized and unrealized exchange rate losses, net of dkk 1,456 
million in 2020 were driven by foreign exchange movements, which 
negatively impacted our usd denominated portfolio and cash 
holdings. the usd weakened against the dkk during 2020, resulting 
in realized and unrealized exchange rate losses. more specifically, 
the usd/dkk foreign exchange rate decreased from 6.6759 at 
december 31, 2019 to 6.0524 at december 31, 2020.
realized and unrealized exchange rate gains, net of dkk 99 million 
in 2019 were driven by foreign exchange movements, which posi-
tively impacted our usd denominated portfolio and cash holdings. 
the usd strengthened against the dkk during 2019, resulting in 
realized and unrealized exchange rate gains. more specifically, 
the usd/dkk foreign exchange rate increased from 6.5213 at 
december 31, 2018 to 6.6759 at december 31, 2019. please refer to 
note 4.2 for additional information on foreign currency risk.
other investments
realized and unrealized gains on other investments, net of dkk 
965 million in 2020 was related to the unrealized change in fair 
value of genmab’s investment in common shares of curevac. 
there was no gain or loss attributable to other investments in 2019 
or 2018.
 accounting policies
financial income and expenses include interest as well as realized 
and unrealized exchange rate adjustments and realized and unreal-
ized gains and losses on marketable securities (designated as fair 
value through the income statement) and realized gains and losses 
and write-downs of other securities and equity interests (desig-
nated as  available-for-sale financial assets).
interest and dividend income are shown separately from gains 
and losses on marketable securities and other securities and 
equity interests.
gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion of a cash flow 
hedge and changes in time value are recognized immediately in the 
income statement as part of the financial income or expenses.

share-based instruments
restricted stock unit program
genmab a/s has established an rsu program ( equity- settled 
share-based payment transactions) as an incentive for genmab’s 
employees, members of the executive management, and members 
of the board of directors.
rsus are granted by the board of directors. rsu grants to 
members of the board of directors and members of the executive 
management are subject to the remuneration policy adopted at the 
annual general meeting.

2020 annual report / financial statements / group
section 4 capital structure, financial risk and related items / 4.6 share-based instruments
under the terms of the rsu program, rsus are subject to a cliff 
vesting period and become fully vested on the first banking day of 
the month following a period of three years from the date of grant. 
if an employee, member of executive management, or member of 
the board of directors ceases their employment or board member-
ship prior to the vesting date, all rsus that are granted, but not yet 
vested, shall lapse automatically.
however, if an employee, a member of the executive management 
or a member of the board of directors ceases employment or 
board membership due to retirement, death, serious sickness or 
serious injury then all rsus that are granted, but not yet vested, 
shall remain outstanding and will be settled in accordance with 
their terms. beginning with the december 2020 rsu grant to 
members of the board of directors, all rsu grants to members of 
the board of directors will be subject to pro-rata vesting upon termi-
nation of board services. for further details, please see the 2020 
compensation report.
in addition, for an employee or a member of the executive 
management, rsus that are granted, but not yet vested, shall 
remain outstanding and will be settled in accordance with their 
terms in instances where the employment relationship is terminated 
by genmab without cause.
within 30 days of the vesting date, the holder of an rsu receives 
one share in genmab a/s for each rsu. in jurisdictions in which 
genmab as an employer is required to withhold tax and settle with 
the tax authority on behalf of the employee, genmab withholds 
the number of rsus that are equal to the monetary value of the 
employee’s tax obligation from the total number of rsus that 
otherwise would have been issued to the employee upon vesting 
(“net settlement”). genmab a/s may at its sole discretion in extraor-
dinary circumstances choose to make cash settlement instead of 
delivering shares.
the rsu program contains anti- dilution provisions if changes occur 
in genmab’s share capital prior to the vesting date and provisions 
to accelerate vesting of rsus in the event of change of control as 
defined in the rsu program.

warrant program
genmab a/s has established a warrant program ( equity- settled 
share-based payment transactions) as an incentive for all the 
genmab group’s employees, and members of the executive 
management.
warrants are granted by the board of directors in accordance with 
authorizations given to it by genmab a/s’ shareholders.
warrant grants to executive management are subject to genmab’s 
remuneration policy adopted at the annual general meeting.
under the terms of the warrant program, warrants are granted at an 
exercise price equal to the share price on the grant date. according 
to the warrant program, the exercise price cannot be fixed at a lower 
price than the market price at the grant date. in connection with 
exercise, the warrants shall be settled with the delivery of shares in 
genmab a/s.
the warrant program contains anti- dilution provisions if 
changes occur in genmab’s share capital prior to the warrants 
being exercised.
warrants granted from august 2004 until april 2012
under the august 2004 warrant program, warrants can be exercised 
starting from one year after the grant date. as a general rule, the 
warrant holder may only exercise 25% of the warrants granted 
per full year of employment or affiliation with genmab after the 
grant date.
however, the warrant holder will be entitled to continue to be able 
to exercise all warrants on a regular schedule in instances where the 
employment relationship is terminated by genmab without cause.
in case of a change of control event as defined in the warrant 
program, the warrant holder will immediately be granted the right 
to exercise all of his/her warrants regardless of the fact that such 
warrants would otherwise only become fully vested at a later point 
in time. warrant holders who are no longer employed by or affili-
ated with genmab will, however, only be entitled to exercise such 
percentages as would otherwise have vested under the terms of the 
warrant program.
warrants granted from april 2012 until march 2017
following the annual general meeting in april 2012, a new warrant 
program was adopted by the board of directors. whereas warrants 
granted under the august 2004 warrant program will lapse on the 
tenth anniversary of the grant date, warrants granted under the new 
april 2012 warrant program will lapse at the seventh anniversary of 
the grant date. all other terms in the warrant program are identical.
warrants granted from march 2017
in march 2017, a new warrant program was adopted by the board of 
directors. whereas warrants granted under the april 2012 warrant 
program vested annually over a four-year period, warrants granted 
under the new march 2017 warrant program are subject to a cliff 
vesting period and become fully vested three years from the date of 
grant. all other terms in the warrant program are identical.

section 4 capital structure, financial risk and related items / 4.7 share capital
4.7
share capital
share capital
the share capital comprises the nominal amount of genmab a/s 
ordinary shares, each at a nominal value of dkk 1. all shares are 
fully paid.
on december 31, 2020, the share capital of genmab a/s comprised 
65,545,748 shares of dkk 1 each with one vote. there are no restric-
tions related to the transferability of the shares. all shares are 
regarded as negotiable instruments and do not confer any special 
rights upon the holder, and no shareholder shall be under an obliga-
tion to allow his/her shares to be redeemed.
until april 10, 2023, the board of directors is authorized to increase 
the nominal registered share capital on one or more occasions by 
up to nominally dkk 7,500,000 by subscription of new shares that 
shall have the same rights as the existing shares of genmab. the 
capital increase can be made by cash or by non-cash payment and 
with or without pre- emption rights for the existing shareholders. 
within the authorizations to increase the share capital by nominally 
dkk 7,500,000 shares, the board of directors may on one or more 
occasions and without pre- emption rights for the existing share-
holders of genmab issue up to nominally dkk 2,000,000 shares 
to employees of genmab, and genmab’s subsidiaries, by cash 
payment at market price or at a discount price as well as by the 
issue of bonus shares. no transferability restrictions or redemption 
obligations shall apply to the new shares, which shall be negotiable 
instruments in the name of the holder and registered in the name of 
the holder in genmab a/s’ register of shareholders. the new shares 
shall give the right to dividends and other rights as determined by 
the board in its resolution to increase capital.
on july 17, 2019, in connection with genmab a/s’ initial public 
offering of american depositary shares (adss) in the united states 
and the listing of the adss on the nasdaq global select market, 
the board of directors partly exercised the authority in accordance 
with the authorization described above, to increase the share 
capital without pre- emption rights for the existing shareholders by 
nominally dkk 2,850,000. additionally, on july 17, 2019, the board 
of directors partly exercised the authority to increase the share 
capital without pre- emption rights for the existing shareholders by 
nominally dkk 427,500. the remaining amount of the authorization 
is thus dkk 4,222,500.
until march 17, 2021, the board of directors is authorized by one or 
more issues to raise loans against bonds or other financial instru-
ments up to a maximum amount of dkk 3 billion with a right for 
the lender to convert his/her claim to a maximum of nominally dkk 
4,000,000 equivalent to 4,000,000 new shares (convertible loans). 
convertible loans may be raised in dkk or the equivalent in foreign 
currency (including us dollar (usd) or euro (eur)). the board of 
directors is also authorized to effect the consequential increase 
of the capital. convertible loans may be raised against payment in 
cash or in other ways. the subscription of shares shall be with or 
without pre- emption rights for the shareholders and the convertible 
loans shall be offered at a subscription price and conversion price 
that in the aggregate at least corresponds to the market price of the 
shares at the time of the decision of the board of directors. the time 
limit for conversion may be fixed for a longer period than five (5) 
years after the raising of the convertible loan.
by decision of the general meeting on march 28, 2017, the board 
of directors was authorized to issue on one or more occasions 
warrants to subscribe genmab a/s’ shares up to a nominal value 
of dkk 500,000. this authorization shall remain in force for a 
period ending on march 28, 2022. moreover, by decision of the 
annual general meeting on march 29, 2019 the board of directors is 
authorized to issue on one or more occasions additional warrants 
to subscribe genmab a/s’ shares up to a nominal value of dkk 
500,000 to genmab a/s’ employees as well as employees of 
genmab a/s’ directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries, excluding 
executive management, and to make the related capital increases in 
cash up to a nominal value of dkk 500,000. this authorization shall 
remain in force for a period ending on march 28, 2024.
subject to the rules in force at any time, the board of directors may 
reuse or reissue lapsed non- exercised warrants, if any, provided 
that the reuse or reissue occurs under the same terms and within 
the time limitations set out in the authorization to issue warrants.
as of december 31, 2020, a total of 346,337 warrants have been 
issued and a total of 17,759 warrants have been reissued under 
the march 28, 2017 authorization, and a total of 384,081 warrants 
have been issued and a total of 9,734 warrants have been reissued 
under the march 29, 2019 authorization. a total of 269,582 warrants 
remain available for issue and a total of 51,938 warrants remain 
available for reissue as of december 31, 2020.
share premium
the share premium reserve is comprised of the amount received, 
attributable to shareholders’ equity, in excess of the nominal 
amount of the shares issued at the parent company’s offerings,

genmab has two authorizations to repurchase shares as of 
december 31, 2020. the first authorization, granted on march 17, 
2016, authorizes the board of directors to repurchase up to a total 
of 500,000 shares (with a nominal value of dkk 500,000) and shall 
lapse on march 17, 2021. the second authorization, granted on 
march 29, 2019, authorizes the board of directors to repurchase 
up to an additional 500,000 shares (with a nominal value of dkk 
500,000) and shall lapse on march 28, 2024. the authorizations 
are intended to cover inter alia obligations in relation to the rsu 
program and reduce the dilution effect of share capital increases 
resulting from future exercises of warrants.
during 2018, genmab acquired 125,000 of its own shares, approxi-
mately 0.2% of share capital, to cover its obligations under the rsu 
program. the total amount paid to acquire the shares, including 
directly attributable costs, was dkk 146 million and has been 
recognized as a deduction to shareholders’ equity. these shares are 
classified as treasury shares. treasury shares are presented within 
retained earnings as of december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. the 
shares were acquired in accordance with the authorization granted 
by the annual general meeting in march 2016. there were no acqui-
sitions of treasury shares in 2020 or 2019.
as of december 31, 2020, a total of 225,000 shares, with a nominal 
value of dkk 225,000, have been repurchased under the march 17, 
2016 authorization. a total of 775,000 shares, with a nominal 
value of dkk 775,000, remain available to repurchase as of 
december 31, 2020.

severance payments:
in the event genmab terminates the service agreements with each 
member of the executive management team without cause, genmab 
is obliged to pay the executive officer his/her existing salary 
for one or two years after the end of the one year notice period. 
however, in the event of termination by genmab (unless for cause) 
or by a member of executive management as a result of a change 
of control of genmab, genmab is obliged to pay a member of the 
executive management a compensation equal to his/her existing 
total salary (including benefits) for up to two years in addition to 
the notice period. in case of the termination of the service agree-
ments of the executive management without cause, the total impact 
on our financial position is estimated to be approximately dkk 
52 million as of december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 46 million, 2018: 
dkk 42 million).

commitments
guarantees and collaterals
there were no bank guarantees as of december 31, 2020 or 2019.
other purchase obligations
genmab has entered into a number of agreements primarily related 
to research and development activities. these short term contrac-
tual obligations amounted to dkk 1,074 million as of december 31, 
2020, all of which is due in less than two years (2019: dkk 
564 million).
genmab also has certain contingent commitments under license 
and collaboration agreements that may become due for future 
payments. as of december 31, 2020, these contingent commit-
ments amounted to approximately dkk 14,638 million (usd 2,418 
million) in potential future development, regulatory and commercial 
milestone payments to third parties under license and collaboration 
agreements for our pre- clinical and  clinical-stage development 
programs as compared to dkk 9,520 million (usd 1,426 million) as 
of december 31, 2019. these milestone payments generally become 
due and payable only upon the achievement of certain develop-
ment, clinical, regulatory or commercial milestones. the events 
triggering such payments or obligations have not yet occurred.
in addition to the above obligations, we enter into a variety of agree-
ments and financial commitments in the normal course of business. 
the terms generally allow genmab the option to cancel, reschedule 
and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to 
the delivery of goods or performance of services. it is not possible 
to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under 
these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations 
and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each partic-
ular agreement.
5.5
contingent assets and 
contingent liabilities
contingent assets and liabilities
license and collaboration agreements
we are entitled to potential milestone payments and royalties on 
successful commercialization of products developed under license 
and collaboration agreements with our partners. since the size 
and timing of such payments are uncertain until the milestones 
are reached or sales are generated, the agreements may qualify as 
contingent assets. however, it is impossible to measure the value 
of such contingent assets, and, accordingly, no such assets have 
been recognized.
as part of the license and collaboration agreements that genmab 
has entered into, once a product is developed and commercialized, 
genmab may be required to make milestone and royalty payments. 
it is impossible to measure the value of such future payments, but 
genmab expects to generate future income from such products 
which will exceed any milestone and royalty payments due, and 
accordingly no such liabilities have been recognized.
derivative financial instruments
genmab has entered into an international swaps and derivatives 
association master agreement. the master agreement with 
genmab’s financial institution counterparty also includes a credit 
support annex which contains provisions that require genmab to 
post collateral should the value of the derivative liabilities exceed 
dkk 50 million (2019: dkk 50 million). as of december 31, 2020 and 
2019, genmab has not been required to post any collateral. there 
were no outstanding receivables related to derivative financial 
instruments as of december 31, 2020 or 2019.
in addition, the agreement requires genmab to maintain a cash 
position of dkk 258.5 million at all times or the counterparty has 
the right to terminate the agreement. upon termination, the dkk

legal matter —  janssen binding arbitration
in september 2020, genmab commenced binding arbitration of 
two matters arising under its license agreement with janssen 
biotech, inc. (janssen) relating to daratumumab. under the license 
agreement, genmab is, among other things, entitled to royalties 
from janssen on sales of daratumumab (marketed as darzalex® 
for intravenous administration and for subcutaneous administration 
as darzalex faspro® in the u.s. and darzalex® sc in europe). 
the arbitration first is to settle whether genmab is required to share 
in janssen’s royalty payments to halozyme therapeutics, inc. for 
the halozyme enzyme technology used in the subcutaneous formu-
lation of daratumumab. the royalties janssen pays to halozyme 
represent a mid- single digit percentage rate of subcutaneous dara-
tumumab sales. janssen has started reducing its royalty payments 
to genmab by what it claims to be genmab’s share of janssen’s 
royalty payments to halozyme beginning in the second quarter 
of 2020 and has continued to do so through december 31, 2020. 
the arbitration is also to settle whether janssen’s obligation to pay 
royalties on sales of licensed product extends, in each applicable 
country, until the expiration or invalidation of the last-to- expire 
relevant  genmab-owned patent or the last-to- expire relevant 
 janssen-owned patent covering the product, as further defined and 
described in the license agreement.
change of control
in the event of a change of control, change of control clauses are 
included in some of our collaboration, development and license 
agreements as well as in service agreements for certain employees.
collaboration, development and license agreements
genmab has entered into collaboration, development and license 
agreements with external parties, which may be subject to rene-
gotiation in case of a change of control event as specified in the 
individual agreements. however, any changes in the agreements are 
not expected to have significant influence on our financial position.
service agreements with executive 
management and employees
the service agreements with each member of the executive 
management may be terminated by genmab with no less than 12 
months’ notice and by the member of the executive management 
with no less than six months’ notice. in the event of a change of 
control of genmab, the termination notice due to the member 
of the executive management is extended to 24 months. in the 
event of termination by genmab (unless for cause) or by a member 
of executive management as a result of a change of control 
of genmab, genmab is obliged to pay a member of executive 
management a compensation equal to his/her existing total salary 
(including benefits) for up to two years in addition to the notice 
period. in case of a change of control event and the termination of 
service agreements of the executive management, the total impact 
on our financial position is estimated to approximately dkk 105 
million as of december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 106 million).
in addition, genmab has entered into service agreements with 
18 (2019: 22) current employees according to which genmab may 
become obliged to compensate the employees in connection with 
a change of control of genmab. if genmab as a result of a change of 
control terminates the service agreement without cause, or changes 
the working conditions to the detriment of the employee, the 
employee shall be entitled to terminate the employment relation-
ship without further cause with one month’s notice in which case 
genmab shall pay the employee a compensation equal to one-half, 
one or two times the employee’s existing annual salary (including 
benefits). in case of the change of control event and the termination 
of all 18 service agreements the total impact on genmab’s consol-
idated financial position is estimated to approximately dkk 57 
million as of december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 75 million).
please refer to note 4.6 for additional information regarding 
change of control clauses related to share-based instruments 
granted to the executive management and employees.
 accounting policies
contingent assets and liabilities
contingent assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities that arose 
from past events but whose existence will only be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non- occurrence of future events that are beyond 
genmab’s control.
contingent assets and liabilities are not to be recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements, but are disclosed in the notes.

collaborations
genmab enters into collaborations with biotechnology and 
pharmaceutical companies to advance the development and 
commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement 
our internal pipeline. genmab seeks collaborations that will allow 
genmab to retain significant future participation in product sales 
through either  profit- sharing or royalties paid on net sales. below 
is an overview of certain of genmab’s collaborations that have had 
a significant impact or are expected in the near term have a signifi-
cant impact on financial results.
janssen (daratumumab/darzalex®)
in 2012, genmab entered into a global license, development, and 
commercialization agreement with janssen for daratumumab 
(marketed as darzalex® for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
indications). under this agreement, janssen is fully responsible 
for developing and commercializing daratumumab and all costs 
associated therewith. genmab receives tiered royalty payments 
between 12% and 20% based on janssen’s annual net product 
sales. the royalties payable by janssen are limited in time and 
subject to reduction on a  country-by- country basis for customary 
reduction events, including upon patent expiration or invalidation 
in the relevant country and upon the first commercial sale of a 
biosimilar product in the relevant country (for as long as the biosim-
ilar product remains for sale in that country). pursuant to the terms 
of the agreement, janssen’s obligation to pay royalties under this 
agreement will expire on a  country-by- country basis on the later 
of the date that is 13 years after the first sale of daratumumab in 
such country or upon the expiration of the last-to- expire relevant 
product patent (as defined in the agreement) covering daratu-
mumab in such country. genmab is also eligible to receive certain 
additional payments in connection with development, regulatory 
and sales milestones.

in september 2020, genmab commenced binding arbitration of 
two matters arising under its license agreement with janssen 
relating to daratumumab. under the license agreement, genmab 
is, among other things, entitled to royalties from janssen on 
sales of daratumumab (marketed as darzalex® for intravenous 
administration and for subcutaneous administration as darzalex 
faspro® in the u.s. and darzalex® sc in europe). the arbitration 
first is to settle whether genmab is required to share in janssen’s 
royalty payments to halozyme therapeutics, inc. for the halozyme 
enzyme technology used in the subcutaneous formulation of 
daratumumab. the royalties janssen pays to halozyme represent 
a mid- single digit percentage rate of subcutaneous daratumumab 
sales. janssen has started reducing its royalty payments to 
genmab by what it claims to be genmab’s share of janssen’s royalty 
payments to halozyme beginning in the second quarter of 2020 
and has continued to do so. the arbitration is also to settle whether 
janssen’s obligation to pay royalties on sales of licensed product 
extends, in each applicable country, until the expiration or invali-
dation of the last-to- expire relevant  genmab-owned patent or the 
last-to- expire relevant  janssen-owned patent covering the product, 
as further defined and described in the license agreement.
novartis (ofatumumab)
genmab and glaxosmithkline (gsk) entered a co-development and 
collaboration agreement for ofatumumab in 2006. the full rights 
to ofatumumab were transferred from gsk to novartis in 2015. 
novartis is now fully responsible for the development and commer-
cialization of ofatumumab in all potential indications, including 
autoimmune diseases. genmab is entitled to a 10% royalty payment 
of net sales for non-cancer treatments. in 2020 subcutaneous 
ofatumumab was approved by the u.s. fda, as kesimpta®, for 
the treatment of rms in adults. ofatumumab was also previously 
approved as arzerra® for certain cll indications. in 2019, the 
marketing authorization for arzerra® was withdrawn in the eu and 
several other territories. in august 2020, genmab announced that 
novartis planned to transition arzerra® to an oncology access 
program for cll patients in the u.s. genmab recognized usd 
30 million lump sum from novartis as payment for lost potential 
royalties. ofatumumab is no longer in development for cll.
roche (teprotumumab)
in may 2001, genmab entered a collaboration with roche to develop 
human antibodies to disease targets identified by roche. in 2002, 
this alliance was expanded, and roche made an equity investment 
in genmab. under the agreement, genmab will receive milestones 
as well as royalty payments on successful products and, in certain 
circumstances, genmab could obtain rights to develop products 
based on disease targets identified by roche. teprotumumab was 
created by genmab under the collaboration with roche and devel-
opment and commercialization of the product, approved in 2020 by 
the u.s. fda, as tepezza, for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, 
is now being conducted by horizon therapeutics under a license 
from roche. under the terms of genmab’s agreement with roche, 
genmab will receive mid-single digit royalties on sales of tepezza®.
seagen (tisotumab vedotin)
in september 2010, genmab and seagen entered into an adc 
collaboration, and a commercial license and collaboration 
agreement was executed in october 2011. under the agreement, 
genmab was granted rights to utilize seagen’s adc technology 
with its human monoclonal tf antibody. seagen was granted 
rights to exercise a co-development and co-commercialization 
option at the end of phase i clinical development for tisotumab 
vedotin. in august 2017, seagen exercised its option to co-develop 
and co-commercialize tisotumab vedotin with genmab. under 
the agreement, seagen and genmab will each be responsible for 
leading tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in certain 
territories. in october 2020, genmab and seagen entered into 
a joint commercialization agreement. genmab will co-promote 
tisotumab vedotin in the u.s., and we will lead commercial oper-
ational activities and book sales in japan, while seagen will lead 
operational commercial activities in the u.s., europe and china 
with a 50:50 cost and profit split in those markets. in any other 
markets, seagen will be responsible for commercializing tisotumab 
vedotin and genmab will receive royalties based on a percentage of 
aggregate net sales ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. 
the companies will continue the practice of joint decision-making 
on the worldwide development and commercialization strategy for 
tisotumab vedotin.
abbvie
on june 10, 2020, genmab entered into a broad oncology collabo-
ration agreement with abbvie to jointly develop and commercialize 
epcoritamab, duohexabody-cd37, and duobody-cd3x5t4 and a 
discovery research collaboration for future differentiated antibody 
therapeutics for cancer. for epcoritamab, the companies will share 
commercial responsibilities in the u.s. and japan, with abbvie 
responsible for further global commercialization. genmab will be 
the principal for net sales in the u.s. and japan and receive tiered 
royalties on remaining global sales. for duohexabody-cd37, 
duobody-cd3x5t4 and any product candidates developed as a 
result of the companies’ discovery research collaboration, genmab 
and abbvie will share responsibilities for global development and 
commercialization in the u.s. and japan. genmab retains the right 
to co-commercialize these products, along with abbvie, outside 
of the u.s. and japan. for the discovery research collaboration, 
which combines proprietary antibodies from both companies along 
with genmab’s duobody® technology and abbvie’s payload and 
adc technology, the companies will select and develop up to four 
additional differentiated next-generation antibody-based product 
candidates, potentially across both solid tumors and hemato-
logical malignancies. genmab will conduct phase 1 studies for 
these programs and abbvie retains the right to opt-in to program 
development.
under the terms of the agreement, genmab received a usd 750 
million upfront payment from abbvie with the potential for genmab 
to receive up to usd 3.15 billion in additional development, regu-
latory and sales milestone payments for all programs, as well as 
tiered royalties between 22% and 26% on net sales for epcoritamab 
outside the u.s. and japan. except for these royalty-bearing sales, 
the parties share in pre-tax profits from the sale of products on a 
50:50 basis. included in these potential milestones are up to usd 
1.15 billion in payments related to clinical development and commer-
cial success across the three existing bispecific antibody programs. 
in addition, and also included in these potential milestones, if all 
four next-generation antibody product candidates developed as 
a result of the discovery research collaboration are successful, 
genmab is eligible to receive up to usd 2.0 billion in option exercise

and success-based milestones. genmab and abbvie split 50:50 the 
development costs related to epcoritamab, duohexabody-cd37 
and duobody-cd3x5t4 while genmab will be responsible for 100% 
of the costs for the discovery research programs up to opt-in.
biontech
in may 2015, genmab entered an agreement with biontech to jointly 
research, develop and commercialize bispecific antibody products 
using genmab’s duobody® technology platform. under the terms of 
the agreement, biontech will provide proprietary antibodies against 
key immunomodulatory targets, while genmab provides propri-
etary antibodies and access to its duobody® technology platform. 
genmab paid an upfront fee of usd 10 million to biontech. if the 
companies jointly select any product candidates for clinical devel-
opment, development costs and product ownership will be shared 
equally going forward. if one of the companies does not wish to 
move a product candidate forward, the other company is entitled to 
continue developing the product on predetermined licensing terms. 
the agreement also includes provisions which will allow the parties 
to opt out of joint development at key points. genmab and biontech 
have selected two product candidates for clinical development, 
duobody-cd40x4 1bb (gen1042) and duobody-pd-l1x4 1bb 
(gen1046), both of which are now in clinical trials.
janssen (duobody®)
in july 2012, genmab entered into a collaboration with janssen 
to create and develop bispecific antibodies using our duobody® 
platform. under this original agreement, janssen had the right 
to use the duobody® technology to create panels of bispecific 
antibodies (up to 10 duobody® programs) to multiple disease 
target combinations. genmab received an upfront payment of usd 
3.5 million from janssen and will potentially be entitled to milestone 
and license payments of up to approximately usd 175 million, as 
well as royalties for each commercialized duobody® product.
under the terms of a december 2013 amendment, janssen was 
entitled to work on up to 10 additional programs. genmab received 
an initial payment of usd 2 million from janssen. under the terms 
of the original agreement, for each of the additional programs 
that janssen successfully initiates, develops and commercializes, 
genmab will potentially be entitled to receive average milestone 
and license payments of approximately usd 191 million. in addition, 
genmab will be entitled to royalties on sales of any commercialized 
products. all research work is funded by janssen.
janssen had exercised 14 licenses under this collaboration, not 
all of which are active, and no further options remain for use by 
janssen. as of december 31, 2020, seven duobody® product candi-
dates created under this collaboration were in the clinic. one of 
these, amivantamab, is the first product candidate created using 
the duobody® technology platform to be submitted for regula-
tory approval.
immatics
in july 2018, genmab entered into a research collaboration and 
exclusive license agreement with immatics to discover and develop 
next- generation bispecific immunotherapies to target multiple 
cancer indications. genmab received an exclusive license to three 
proprietary targets from immatics, with an option to license up 
to two additional targets at predetermined economics. under the 
terms of the agreement, genmab paid immatics an upfront fee 
of usd 54 million and immatics is eligible to receive up to usd 
550 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone 
payments for each product, as well as tiered royalties on net sales.
curevac
during december 2019, genmab entered into a research collab-
oration and license agreement with curevac ag. the strategic 
partnership will focus on the research and development of differ-
entiated mrna-based antibody products by combining curevac’s 
mrna technology and know-how with genmab’s proprietary 
antibody technologies and expertise.
under the terms of the agreement genmab will provide curevac 
with a usd 10 million upfront payment. the companies will collabo-
rate on research to identify an initial product candidate and curevac 
will contribute a portion of the overall costs for the development 
of this product candidate, up to the time of an investigational new 
drug application. genmab would thereafter be fully responsible for 
the development and commercialization of the potential product, 
in exchange for usd 280 million in development, regulatory and 
commercial milestones and tiered royalties in the range from 
mid-single digits up to low-double digits to curevac. the agreement 
also includes three additional options for genmab to obtain 
commercial licenses to curevac’s mrna technology at pre-defined 
terms, exercisable within a five-year period. if genmab exercises 
any of these options, it would fund all research and would develop 
and commercialize any resulting product candidates with curevac 
eligible to receive between usd 275 million and usd 368 million 
in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments 
for each product, dependent on the specific product concept. in 
addition, curevac is eligible to receive tiered royalties in the range 
from mid-single digits up to low double digits per product. curevac 
would retain an option to participate in development and/or 
commercialization of one of the potential additional programs under 
predefined terms and conditions. further, genmab made a eur 20 
million equity investment in curevac.

the parent company has entered into a number of agreements 
primarily related to research and development activities carried 
out by genmab. in the parent company, the contractual obligations 
amounted to dkk 970 million (2019: dkk 438 million).
we also have certain contingent commitments under our license 
and collaboration agreements that may become due for future 
payments. as of december 31, 2020, these contingent commit-
ments amounted to approximately dkk 11,591 million (usd 1,915 
million) in potential future development, regulatory and commercial 
milestone payments to third parties under license and collaboration 
agreements for our pre- clinical and  clinical-stage development 
programs as compared to dkk 6,322 million (usd 947 million) as of 
december 31, 2019. these milestone payments generally become 
due and payable only upon the achievement of certain develop-
ment, clinical, regulatory or commercial milestones. the events 
triggering such payments or obligations have not yet occurred.
in addition to the above obligations, we enter into a variety of agree-
ments and financial commitments in the normal course of business. 
the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and 
adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the 
delivery of goods or performance of services. it is not possible to 
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under 
these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations 
and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each partic-
ular agreement.

2020 annual report /  directors’ and management’s statement 
on the annual report
the board of directors and executive management have today considered and adopted the annual report of genmab a/s for the 
financial year january 1 to december 31, 2020.
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international 
accounting standards board (iasb) and in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the eu and further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial position at december 31, 2020 of the group and the parent company and of the results of the group and parent company 
operations and cash flows for 2020.
in our opinion, management’s review includes a true and fair account of the development in the operations and financial circumstances 
of the group and the parent company, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the group and the parent company as 
well as a description of the most significant risks and elements of uncertainty facing the group and the parent company.
we recommend that the annual report be adopted at the annual general meeting.

2020 annual report / independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of genmab a/s
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the group’s and the parent company’s financial position at 
december 31, 2020 and of the results of the group’s and the 
parent company’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 
january 1 to december 31, 2020 in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as issued by the international 
accounting standards board, international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and further requirements in the 
danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report to the 
audit and finance committee and the board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and parent company 
financial statements of genmab a/s for the financial year january 1 
to december 31, 2020 comprise the statements of comprehen-
sive income, the balance sheets, the statements of cash flows, 
the statements of changes in equity and the notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies for the group as 
well as for the parent company. collectively referred to as the 
“financial statements”.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards 
on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and require-
ments are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the 
international ethics standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 
were not provided.

copenhagen, we were first appointed auditors of genmab a/s on

key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
for 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
key audit matter
revenue recognition on abbvie collaboration agreement
• on june 10, 2020, genmab entered into a collaboration agreement with abbvie inc. to jointly develop and commercialize 
epcoritamab (duobody-cd3xcd20), duohexabody-cd37 and duobody-cd3x5t4 and a discovery research collaboration for future 
differentiated antibody therapeutics for cancer. the agreement includes four performance obligations: delivery of three licenses 
and co-development activities for the product concepts. during 2020, genmab received an upfront payment of dkk 4,911 million 
and allocated dkk 4,398 million to the delivery of the licenses and dkk 513 million to the co-development activities for the product 
concepts. genmab recognized revenue of dkk 4,398 million from the delivery of the licenses when the performance obligation was 
satisfied at a point in time for these.
• in relation to the abbvie collaboration agreement it requires that management ascertains that the delivery of the individual licenses 
and the co-development activities related to the product concepts are each a distinct performance obligation and to calculate a 
stand alone selling price for these performance obligations. for the individual licenses management used a discounted cash flow 
model, which requires management to make an estimate including selecting the discount rate, development timeline, regulatory risks, 
estimated market demand and future revenue potential. for the co-development activities related to the product concepts a cost-plus 
margin approach was used, which requires management to make an estimate including selecting the costs and margin to apply.
• we focused on the abbvie collaboration agreement because identifying performance obligations and allocating the transaction 
price between these performance obligations based on a best accounting estimate of relative stand-alone selling price and 
determining whether the performance obligations have been satisfied requires significant judgement by management.
• reference is made to note 2.1.
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
• we tested certain internal controls over the process to record revenue, including controls related to the identification of the 
performance obligations, allocation of transaction price and if the performance obligations were satisfied.
• we examined the collaboration agreement and evaluated and tested management’s identification of the performance obligations 
in the agreement, the allocation of transaction price between these performance obligations and whether the performance 
obligation was satisfied upon transfer of the licenses. we also assessed the methodology, data and assumptions used in the 
discounted cash flow model and cost-plus margin approach by using valuation specialists to assess the fair value determined by 
management for these performance obligations.
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
management’s review, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read management’s review and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, we considered whether management’s review includes 
the disclosures required by the danish financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s 
review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. we did not identify any material misstate-
ment in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for 
the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements and parent company financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as issued by the international accounting 
standards board, international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.

independent auditor’s report
in preparing the financial statements, management is respon-
sible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. we also:
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
however, future events or conditions may cause the group or the 
parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our inde-
pendence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with gover-
nance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclo-
sure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reason-
ably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
