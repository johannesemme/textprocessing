summary 
 
“a challenging first quarter of 2020 was followed by three quarters resulting in a pre-tax profit of dkk 3.1 bn and a 
net profit of dkk 2.4 bn, corresponding to earnings per share of dkk 31.2. the client activity is at a solid level, and the 
underlying business has developed in a stable fashion supported by significant cost reductions and a continuing good 
credit quality. also, the organisation has been most adaptive and flexible during a turbulent year characterised by 
restrictions. jyske bank has a satisfactory balance of impairment charges as well as a most solid capital and liquidity 
position, which has, so far, enabled the bank to launch a share repurchase programme in the amount of dkk 750m,” 
states anders dam, ceo and managing director.    
 
in 2020, the economic development was affected 
by the covid-19 pandemic. after the extensive 
lockdown of the danish economy in the spring, 
most economic activities were resumed, but 
towards the end of the year, the number of covid-
19 cases increased again and the visibility as to the 
effect on the economy in 2021 is somewhat 
limited. 
 
so far, the danish economy has performed 
relatively well through the pandemic; the number of 
bankruptcies is low, consumer spending and 
unemployment are developing in a stable manner, 
and activity levels in the housing market are high. at 
the same time, our clients’ capital and liquidity 
situation is generally good and supported by 
various support packages. 
 
the further development of the danish economy 
will be affected by the development in covid-19 
cases and the rolling out of vaccines in and outside 
denmark as well as the phasing out of support 
packages. to this must be added any derived 
economic effects from great britain’s exit from the 
eu. 
 
in addition to the economic consequences, the 
covid-19 pandemic has also resulted in 
adjustments of e.g. work habits and client 
behaviour. this has resulted in a stronger trend 
towards digital client interaction and an increased 
use of electronic payments. 
 
from high growth to business optimisation 
following several years with high lending growth, 
focus on the continued enforcement of the credit 
policy has increased. meanwhile, jyske bank 
intensified in 2020 business optimisation through 
various income-enhancing and cost-saving 
measures. 
 
these measures included, among other things, 
changes to the terms and conditions of client’ 
deposit rates, which now to a higher degree reflect 
the negative interest rate environment.  
 
also, jyske bank's focus on costs has intensified. 
core expenses fell by 4% in 2020, and further 
reductions are expected in 2021. 
 
over the period from mid-2020 to mid-2021, jyske 
bank will reduce the number of branches by about 
20% in consequence of changed client behaviour 
and increasing digitization. the adjustment 
strengthens the professionalism and coherence in 
the remaining branches to the benefit of both 
clients, employees and shareholders. 
 
in combination with major organisational changes 
in business areas such as personal clients and 
business concepts, the measures launched have 
contributed positively to the optimisation of jyske 
bank’s business in 2020. 
 
net profit of dkk 1,609m in 2020 
the net profit for the year of dkk 1,609m 
corresponds to a return on equity by 4.4% against 
dkk 2,440m and 7.1%, respectively, for 2019. 
earnings per share fell to dkk 19.8 from dkk 29.0. 
the lower profit can be attributed to an increased 
management's estimate for impairment charges in 
the amount of dkk 1.1 bn relating to the covid-19 
pandemic. earnings per share came to dkk 31.2 in 
the last nine months of 2020. 
 
for the fourth quarter of 2020, net profit came to 
dkk 831m, corresponding to a return on equity of 
9.6% p.a. against dkk 966m and 11.5% for the 
fourth quarter of 2019. earnings per share fell to 
dkk 10.9 from dkk 12.2. an intensified cost focus 
offset in part the effects from lower remortgaging 
activity and lower interest income from investment 
of excess liquidity. reduced deposit rates 
compensated for the decline in bank loans. 
 
jyske bank’s loans and advances (excl. repo loans) 
were at the same level at the end of 2020 as the 
previous year. hence, increasing mortgage loans to 
corporate clients were offset by lower bank loans 
due to limited demand for credit following the 
outbreak of covid-19 as well as the launch of 
support packages from the danish government. 
bank deposits were also unchanged compared to 
the end of 2019.  
 
jyske bank / annual report 2020 / summary / page 5 
 
 
core income fell by 1% relative to 2019. 
remortgaging activity fell from a record-high level, 
and the covid-19 pandemic adversely affected 
income from money transfers and card payments 
as well as bank loans. these elements more than 
offset the positive effects from higher value 
adjustments and reduced deposit rates. 
 
adjusted for one-off items in 2019 and 2020, core 
expenses fell by 6%. the decrease can be 
attributed to an 7% reduction in the number of full-
time employees, an intensified cost focus as well as 
the effect from the outbreak of covid-19 on 
travel expenses, etc. 
 
credit quality is assessed to be at a historically 
good level, and at the end of 2020 the proportion of 
non-performing loans was at the lowest level ever. 
to this must be added the balance of 
management's estimates of dkk 1.6 bn after dkk 
1.1 bn were reserved for potential impairment 
charges in consequence of the outbreak of 
covid-19. 
 
at the end of 2020, jyske bank's capital ratio and 
common equity tier 1 capital ratio were calculated 
at historically high levels of 22.9% and 17.9%, 
respectively, with excess capital of dkk 13.1 bn as 
well as a liquidity buffer (lcr) of dkk 111 bn. it is 
assessed that the capital and liquidity buffers can 
withstand even very severe stress scenarios. 
 
on 28 january 2021, jyske bank initiated a new 
share repurchase programme of up to dkk 750m, 
running until 30 september 2021 at the latest. 
 
outlook 
it is expected that in 2021 the bank’s business 
volumes will be affected by rising bank loans and 
falling deposits. to some extent, this is expected 
due to the corporate clients’ payment of deferred 
vat and taxes as well as pent-up consumer and 
investment demand. similarly, for mortgage loans 
an increase is expected in line with the market 
growth in 2021. 
 
it is expected that core income will decline in 2021.  
 
for 2021, endeavours will be made to reduce core 
expenses compared to 2020. 
 
it is expected that loan impairment charges will be 
at a very low level. the estimate is associated with 
uncertainty relating to the effects of the covid-19 
pandemic. 
 
for 2021, jyske bank estimates a pre-tax profit in 
the range of dkk 2.5 bn - 3.0 bn, corresponding to 
a net profit of dkk 1.9 bn - 2.3 bn. inclusive of the 
current share repurchase programme, earnings per 
share are expected to be dkk 25-31 against dkk 
19.8 for 2020.

strategy 
jyske bank’s strategy rests on the intention that 
we want to meet our clients and make a difference 
for them, wherever they are. 
 
we are a relationship and advisory bank. we see a 
future where our clients to an increasing degree 
wish to conduct their everyday banking 
themselves. we also see that, in connection with 
major financial choices, clients still wish to have 
personal advice, and therefore we preserve a 
significant physical and digital presence. 
 
the structure of the branch network is undergoing 
change due to digitization. the last cashier’s desks 
were closed in 2019, all outside atms have been 
removed, jyske bank does not pay out dkk 1,000 
notes, and branches with pure advisory services 
came into existence in 2020, which year also saw 
the launch of the new mobile bank. as part of jyske 
bank’s structural adjustment, the number of 
physical locations was reduced from 98 to 94. by 
march 2021, half of the adjustments are expected 
to be finished and contribute to a professional, 
specialised and value-creating work environment 
characterised by high cohesion to the benefit of 
both clients and employees. 
 
we offer 24/7 support and we strive to facilitate 
and simplify banking for our clients. in 2020, we 
introduced ‘jyske billån’ (jyske car loan), based on 
a combination of jyske bank's client relations and 
jyske finans’ efficient set-up. being ‘boligejernes 
bank’ (homeowners’ bank), jyske bank launched 
‘jyske frihed’, a fixed-rate loan with an instalment-
free option for up to 30 years, and loans for energy 
retrofitting of owner-occupied home, supported by 
a new co2 calculator in the ‘bedste hjem’ (best 
home) app. jyske bank's ambitions in the area of 
digitization were emphasised by the launch of a 
new mobile bank based on a new platform that and 
offers improved development opportunities. 
 
continued growth within wealth management 
jyske bank is working determinedly on the 
development of the business area of investment, 
trading and wealth management by expanding our 
focus on client relationships and strengthening our 
overall value proposition. 
 
the effect from these efforts were accentuated by 
the fact that in 2020, for the fifth year running, 
jyske bank was by cem voxmeter named the bank 
with the most satisfied private-banking clients in 
denmark.  
the development of a new capital market platform 
continues, and in 2020 additional instruments were 
brought into use. the capital market platform is a 
modern platform offering improved functionality 
within the areas of front-, middle- and back office 
with a view to ensuring an optimised consistent 
flow in work processes and data flows. 
 
contribution to a sustainable society  
it is jyske bank's vision to “make a difference”, and 
that also goes for the sustainable development. 
with focus on climate for the time being, jyske 
bank wishes to operate a company that conducts 
itself in a responsible manner and promotes 
sustainability, as expressed in the un sustainable 
development goals. jyske bank will offer business 
solutions that make it simple to invest sustainably, 
support a sustainable development, and supply 
knowledge of sustainability. 
 
we are also working actively with sustainability 
through our own activities. in 2020, jyske bank 
acquired a wind turbine with a view to 
compensating, through its own production of 
renewable energy, for the co2 emission from its 
electricity consumption, inclusive of the bank’s 
share of jn data’s and bankdata's electricity 
consumption. the next step that jyske bank 
intends to take is to ensure that its energy 
production also compensates for the co2 emission 
from its district heating and company cars. 
 
as a first step in the process of quantifying the 
most material impact areas of jyske bank's 
business activities in relation to the sustainable 
development goals, jyske bank has prepared an 
impact analysis focusing on co2e emissions. the 
analysis was performed as part of jyske bank's 
implementation of the un’s principles for 
responsible banking (prb). at the same time, it 
contributes to the fulfilment of the 
recommendations of the forum for sustainable 
finance that the financial sector needs to reduce 
the co2e emission in society. 
 
jyske bank offers products such as energy loans, 
credit cards from recycled plastic and equity funds 
focusing on sustainable development. the 
products support our clients’ wishes for sustainable 
solutions and enable them to make sustainable 
choices.

profit for the year 
in 2020, net profit amounted to dkk 1,609m against 
dkk 2,440m in 2019. earnings per share fell to dkk 
19.8 from dkk 29.0. the lower profit can primarily be 
attributed to a higher management's estimate for 
impairment charges following the outbreak of 
covid-19 and is in line with expectations of a net 
profit of about dkk 1.6 bn for 2020. 
 
core income 
core income fell by 1% relative to 2019. the effect 
from lower remortgaging activity and lower bank 
loans and advances was only partially compensated 
for by higher value adjustments and reduced deposit 
rates for both personal and corporate clients. 
 
net interest income amounted to dkk 4,966m, i.e. 
down by 4% relative to the 2019. net interest income 
from loans and deposits rose by 1%, as the effect 
from reduced deposit rates more than compensated 
for a lower level of bank loans and the sale of jyske 
bank (gibraltar). hence the decline can be attributed 
to higher funding costs and lower interest on bonds, 
where the latter should be seen in the context of the 
development of value adjustments. 
 
net fee and commission income fell by 10% to dkk 
2,091m in 2020. the decline was caused by lower 
remortgaging activity, lower performance fees as well 
as the outbreak of covid-19, which resulted in lower 
income from e.g. money transfers and card 
payments. 
 
value adjustments increased to dkk 685m from dkk 
342m in 2019. the turbulent financial markets after 
the outbreak of covid-19 in the first quarter of 2020 
were subsequently more than compensated for by 
narrowing credit spreads and rising equity prices as 
well as high activity levels in the trading area. 
 
other income fell to dkk 130m from dkk 154m, 
primarily due to gains from the sale of properties in 
2019.  
 
income from operating lease (net) rose to dkk 110m 
from dkk 101m due to the improving sales conditions 
in the used car market. 
 
core expenses 
in 2020, core expenses fell by 4% to dkk 4,848m 
relative to 2019. this development took place despite 
one-off expenses of dkk 75m relating to the sale of 
jyske bank (gibraltar), an increased payroll tax as well 
as a higher contribution to the danish resolution 
authority. the decline can be attributed to a 7% 
reduction of the number of full-time employees to 
3,318 as well as the intensified cost focus, resulting in 
broad-based savings in addition to lower travel 
expenses, etc. after the outbreak of covid-19.

impairment charges 
loan impairment charges amounted to an expense of 
dkk 968m against an income of dkk 101m in 2019. 
the higher level of loan impairment charges can be 
attributed to a higher management's estimate for 
impairment charges following the outbreak of 
covid-19. at the end of 2020, impairment charges 
based on the management's estimates amounted to 
dkk 1,607m against dkk 589m at the same time a 
year ago.  
 
investment portfolio earnings 
in 2020, investment portfolio earnings amounted to 
dkk -56m against dkk -53m for 2019. the negative 
earnings can, in particular, be attributed to the market 
turmoil after the outbreak of covid-19, resulting in a 
flatter yield curve as well as negative value 
adjustments of certain currency positions. the 
hedging of at-1 capital instruments in sek had a 
positive effect of dkk 50m in 2020 and was offset by 
a negative adjustment of shareholders' equity.

the own securities portfolio still consists of tactical 
market risk positions (primarily interest-rate and 
currency risk exposures) and a smaller amount of 
bond investments. 
 
covid-19 
the pandemic has resulted in a management's 
estimate for impairment charges in the amount of 
dkk 1,090m, cf. 67, due to (1) the increasing 
probability that clients will default on credits, (2) a 
sensitivity analysis relating to the expected 
macroeconomic development, and (3) a risk that 
unhealthy exposures will not be identified due to the 
government’s support packages. the covid-19 
pandemic also reduced bank loans, travel expenses 
and income from money transfers and card 
payments, and it also triggered increased volatility in 
the financial markets. 
 
in addition to the economic consequences, the 
covid-19 pandemic may also have had lasting 
consequences for the increasing digital behaviour on 
the part of clients and have affected social conditions 
and work habits for jyske bank's employees. 
 
due to the high degree of homeworking, jyske bank 
will in the course of the first half of 2021 make sure 
that its employees have access to a portable 
computer. moreover, the working group “communal 
spirit through shared experiences” has been set up 
with a view to launching activities that will add to the 
coherence at jyske bank. 
 
 
 
 
 
q4 2020 compared to q3 2020 
net profit rose to dkk 831m in q4 2020 from dkk 
696m in q3 2020.  
 
core income rose by 6%, primarily caused by 
higher net fee and commission income as well as 
higher value adjustments. 
 
net interest income fell to dkk 1,195m from dkk 
1,256m. the decrease can partially be attributed 
to dkk -19m from a one-off item and a changed 
contractual basis for certain fees paid. moreover, 
bank loans to personal and corporate clients fell, 
which was only to a small degree compensated for 
by lower deposit rates for corporate clients and 
higher loans to public authorities. to this must be 
added the effects from lower interest on bonds 
and expenses for new non-preferred senior debt. 
 
net fee and commission income rose to dkk 
581m from dkk 453m. the increase can be 
attributed to dkk 46m caused by the changed 
contractual basis for certain fees paid, higher 
brokerage and annual investment-related product 
and custody fees. these effects more than offset 
the seasonally lower remortgaging activity. 
 
value adjustments rose to dkk 278m from dkk 
189m. the increase was caused by continued 
narrowing of credit spreads and rising equity 
prices, supplemented by positive value 
adjustments of currency positions. 
 
income from operating lease (net) amounted to 
dkk 34m against dkk 69m in q3 where reversal 
of impairment charges contributed dkk 42m. 
 
core expenses came to dkk 1,179m against dkk 
1,159m in the preceding quarter. the 
development can be attributed to small increases 
in e.g. it expenses. higher employee-related 
provisions were more than offset by reversed 
provisions relating to court cases. 
 
loan impairment charges was a dkk 5m expense 
against an income of dkk 48m. credit quality 
continued to show a positive development. 
  
investment portfolio earnings increased to dkk 
157m from dkk 14m. the development can 
primarily be attributed to narrowing of credit 
spreads on bonds as well as positive value 
adjustments of certain currency positions.

jyske bank's total loans and advances (exclusive of 
repo loans) came to dkk 439.4 bn at the of 2020 
against dkk 439.6 bn at the end of 2019, as rising 
mortgage loans were offset by lower bank loans. 
 
mortgage loans at fair value rose to dkk 343.9 bn 
from dkk 337.5 bn at the end of 2019 and 
amounted, in combination with the new home 
loans, to 79% of total loans (excl. repo loans) at the 
end of 2020. nominal mortgage loans rose by 2% 
due to higher loans to corporate clients. 
 
traditional bank loans fell by 6% to dkk 92.9 bn 
compared with the level at the end of 2019. loans 
for both personal and corporate clients fell, which 
can partially be attributed to limited demand for 
credit following the outbreak of covid-19 as well 
as the launch of support packages from the danish 
government. 
 
at the end of 2020, bank deposits amounted to 
dkk 127.5 bn against 126.9 bn at the end of 2019. 
lower deposits from personal clients were 
compensated for by higher deposits from 
corporate clients. at the end of 2020, bank 
deposits were dkk 32.0 bn higher than bank loans, 
i.e. an increase by dkk 7.2 bn as compared to the 
level at the end of 2019. 
 
at the end of 2020, assets under management 
amounted to dkk 175 bn compared with dkk 171 
bn at the end of 2019. on the whole, net sales to 
retail clients in the danish business was positive for 
2020, which period also saw continuing inflow of 
new funds from professional clients. 
q4 2020 compared to q3 2020 
jyske bank's total loans and advances (excl. 
repo loans) rose by 1% to dkk 439.4 bn due to 
increases in bank loans as well as mortgage 
loans. 
 
nominal mortgage loans rose to dkk 333.1 bn 
from dkk 332.3 bn. due to higher loans to 
corporate clients. 
 
traditional bank loans increased by 2% due to 
higher loans, particularly to public authorities. 
the effect from limited credit demand in 
consequence of the covid-19 pandemic as 
well as deferred tax and vat payments showed 
early signs of stabilisation in the fourth quarter. 
 
bank deposits rose by 1% in the fourth quarter, 
to some extent caused by the danish 
government’s payout of frozen holiday funds to 
personal clients. 
 
at the end of 2020, assets under management 
amounted to dkk 175 bn compared to dkk 168 
bn at the end of the third quarter of 2020. the 
increase can in particular be attributed to the 
development in the financial markets.

at the end of 2020, non-performing loans 
amounted to 1.0% of loans, advances and 
guarantees against 1.4% at the end of 2019. the 
share of loans subject to forbearance fell to 1.6% 
from 2.0%. the development can be attributed to 
focus on the enforcement of the credit policy, 
deferred tax and vat payments, progress in the 
housing market, fairly limited increases in 
unemployment and a continued low level of 
bankruptcies despite the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
at the end of 2020, jyske bank’s balance of loan 
impairment charges amounted to dkk 5.5 bn,

recognition and measurement uncertainty 
measurement of certain assets and liabilities is 
based on accounting estimates made by the group 
management. 
 
the areas that involve assumptions and estimates 
that are material for the financial statements 
include loan impairment charges, fair value of 
unlisted financial instruments and provisions and 
are described in detail under accounting policies 
(note 67), to which reference is made. 
 
the effect from the covid-19 pandemic on the 
credit quality of the group is difficult to predict, and 
therefore the uncertainty about the group’s future 
indication of impairment is elevated. 
 
events after the end of the accounting period 
no events have taken place during the period prior 
to the publication of the annual report 2020 that 
have any material effect on the financial position of 
jyske bank.

capital management 
jyske bank’s objective is to achieve a capital ratio of 
20%-22% and a common equity tier 1 capital ratio 
of 15%-17% in the coming years. at these levels, 
jyske bank can comfortably absorb the effects 
from future legislative changes while at the same 
time having the required strategic scope. 
 
at the end of 2020, jyske bank's capital ratio was at 
22.9% and its common equity tier 1 capital ratio at 
17.9% after deducting the current share 
repurchase programme in the amount of dkk 
750m against 21.5% and 17.4%, respectively, at 
the end of 2019.

in connection with the presentation of its 2019 
annual report, jyske bank announced that it raised 
and extended the current share repurchase 
programme by dkk 500m to dkk 1,500m. in 
consequence of “the joint statement of the danish 
government and finance denmark in the light of 
the coronavirus outbreak” of 23 march 2020 and in 
the light of the increased macroeconomic 
uncertainty, jyske bank's supervisory board 
decided at the end of march 2020 to cancel the 
remaining part of the share repurchase programme 
at the time. buybacks in the amount of dkk 412m 
were outstanding under the share repurchase 
programme, under which a total of 4,992,980 
shares had been bought back before the 
cancellation.  
 
the extraordinary general meeting on 28 july 2020 
adopted a similar reduction of the share capital, and 
this was completed on 15 september 2020. the 
share capital then amounted to 72,560,778 shares, 
each of a nominal value of dkk 10. 
 
on 28 january 2021, jyske bank initiated a new 
share repurchase programme of up to dkk 750m, 
running until 30 september 2021 at the latest. 
 
jyske bank sold dlr kredit shares in the equivalent 
value of dkk 155m as part of the ordinary 
reallocation of shares in dlr kredit a/s in 2020. 
the equity interest in dlr kredit was dkk 977m 
and 6.9% at the end of 2020 compared to dkk 
1,832m and 15.7% at the end of 2017. jyske bank 
does not anticipate to dispose of further dlr kredit 
shares in connection with the ordinary reallocation 
of shares in 2021.  
 
capital requirement 
at the end of 2020, jyske bank's individual solvency 
requirement was 11.6% of the weighted risk 
exposure against 11.2% at the end of 2019. to this 
must be added a sifi requirement of 1.5% and a 
capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. both the sifi 
requirements and the capital conservation buffer 
have been fully phased in. in the spring of 2020, the 
countercyclical buffer was released, which lowered 
the capital requirement by 1% of the risk-weighted 
exposures. the level of the countercyclical capital 
buffer is expected to be phased in, at the earliest, in 
mid-2022. this forms the basis of the total capital 
requirement of 15.6% against 16.2% at the end of 
2019.

internal stress testing forms an important element 
of jyske bank's assessment of its capital base and 
objectives. to this must be added external stress 
 
    jyske bank / annual report 2020 / capital and liquidity management / page 13 
 
tests initiated by both the danish financial 
supervisory authority and the eba. the completed 
stress tests show that jyske bank is sufficiently 
capitalised and meet the requirements of both 
internal and external stress tests. 
 
liquidity management 
jyske bank's biggest source of funding was 
covered bonds and mortgage bonds, which 
amounted to dkk 349 bn, corresponding to 52% of 
the balance sheet at the end of 2020. the second-
largest source of funding in the amount of dkk 128 
bn was client deposits, of which a high proportion 
originates from personal clients as well as small and 
medium-sized enterprises. 
 
at the end of 2020, jyske bank's liquidity coverage 
ratio (lcr) was 339%, against 253% at the end of 
2019. the group's internal guideline points to a 
lcr of at least 150%. the lcr buffer after haircuts 
at the end of 2020 is shown below.

in addition, the group is on an ongoing basis active 
in the french cp market. at the end of 2020, the 
outstanding volume under the cp programme 
amounted to dkk 42.0 bn against dkk 15.6 bn at 
the end of 2019. the increase can be attributed to 
the attractive financing conditions, and the 
proceeds were used to underpin the liquidity buffer. 
 
the release of the counter-cyclical buffer in march 
2020 and jyske bank's tier-2 issue in january 2020 
as well as the issue of non-preferred senior debt in 
october 2020 reduced the need to issue non-
preferred senior debt in order to meet the 
minimum requirement for own funds and eligible 
liabilities (mrel). the implementation of the 
amendments to the eu crisis management 
directive (brrd ii) also entails that a part of the 
mrel can be met with preferred senior debt, which 
also reduces the need to issue non-preferred 
senior debt. 
 
depending on the development of the balance 
sheet, it is anticipated that in 2021 the issue of 
preferred senior debt will be supplemented by non-
preferred senior debt. once the transitional

arrangements for mrel have been phased out at 
the beginning of 2022, jyske bank anticipates a 
requirement (inclusive of an internal buffer for 
statutory requirements) for mrel-eligible debt 
instruments in an amount of about dkk 18 bn - 20 
bn, of which dkk 4 bn - 5 bn in preferred senior 
debt and dkk 14 bn - 15 bn in the form of non-
preferred senior debt. 
 
mrel 
for jyske bank, the fsa has stipulated the 
minimum requirement for own funds and eligible 
liabilities at twice the level of the current capital 
requirement for the banking activities of the group 
and with special treatment of the mortgage 
activities of the group. the mrel requirement was 
defined at 10.1% of jyske bank's total liabilities and 
consolidated capital base, corresponding to 26.3% 
of the adjusted risk exposure amount. to this must 
be added the combined capital buffer of 4%.  
 
the mrel requirement must primarily be met 
through non-preferred senior debt (nps), however, 
preferred senior debt issued before 1 january 2018 
with time to maturity above 12 months may be 
included in the period up to and including 1 january 
2022. as a consequence of the brrd2 
implementation, 4% senior debt can be included. at 
the end of 2020, jyske bank met the requirements. 
 
mortgage credit institutions are exempt from 
mrel but must meet a debt buffer requirement, of 
2% of their total unweighted loans. at the end of 
2020, jyske realkredit met the debt buffer 
requirement.

upcoming legislation  
jyske bank is prepared to comply with all known 
future statutory requirements. 
 
below is a brief description of the most important 
legislative changes that are expected to impact 
jyske bank the most in the years to come.  
 
crr implements the basel iii standard in eu and 
includes a number of clarifications and tightening of 
the former capital adequacy rules. parts of the 
revised crr have already been implemented, but 
the main part will not be applied until the summer of 
2021. 
 
as the first part of the eba guidelines, a new default 
definition has been approved for implementation in 
early 2021. 
 
a leverage requirement of at least 3% of core 
capital relative to unweighted exposures will be 
introduced as of 28 june 2021. at the end of 2020, 
jyske bank met the requirement with a leverage 
ratio of 5.3%.  
 
in december 2017, the bank for international 
settlements (bis) published a number of 
recommendations for revised capital requirements 
as a supplement to the basel iii standards.  it is 
expected that the implementation of the so-called 
basel iv recommendations will have great influence 
on the future capital requirements of jyske bank. in 
2020, the phasing in of the new rules was 
postponed by one year until 2023.

sustainability - all progress counts
 
jyske bank intends to make a difference - also 
when it comes to sustainability. it is our ambition to 
run a business that acts responsibly and promotes 
sustainability - that is part of our vision. we believe 
that the best long-term results are achieved when 
the necessary balancing of the interests of clients, 
employees, shareholders and the surrounding 
community is in place. 
 
through responsible banking, jyske bank 
endeavours to promote sustainability as expressed 
through the 17 un sustainable development 
goals. to us, responsible banking means that we 
work with both our own activities and our business 
activities. currently, our focus is especially on 
climate, which is a material impact area for jyske 
bank. 
 
sustainable business 
the financial sector has assumed a new role, which 
to an increasing degree focuses on how financial 
services companies, and hence also jyske bank, 
can promote sustainability through business 
activities such as lending and investment. 
 
in 2020, jyske bank had special focus on the 
further development of the approach to 
sustainable business. the work has resulted in the 
overall approach “all progress counts”. in other 
words, we focus on supporting our clients’ progress 
and facilitate their sustainable choices and 
decisions. we offer financing arrangements that 
make it simple to invest sustainably, support 
sustainable development, and supply knowledge of 
sustainability. 
 
sustainability strategy 
with the approach “all progress counts”, we work 
today at jyske bank both on the responsible 
activities that have already been integrated in the 
banking operations and on a stronger focus on how 
to promote sustainability through business 
activities such as lending and investments. 
 
this approach is illustrated by the “sustainability 
circle”. the circle symbolises the integral whole of 
our work and includes the areas we work on. the 
lower part of the circle – responsible banking 
operations – shows the areas we work on internally 
and which are the foundation of our business 
model. the upper part of the circle describes our 
approach to clients and the surrounding world. 
 
 
in 2019, jyske bank signed the un principles for 
responsible banking (prb) and the 20 
recommendations of the forum for sustainable 
finance. both initiatives contribute to the 
framework and direction of the work on 
sustainability. the principles for responsible 
banking (prb) are used as a point of departure for 
the work to integrate sustainability, which has had a 
spill-over effect on a number of activities, including 
impact analysis and organisation. 
 
organisation 
as part of the integration of sustainability in jyske 
bank’s business model, the area was embedded 
permanently in jyske bank in 2020. hence the 
sustainability programme has been replaced by a 
sustainability committee. 
 
the supervisory board has the overall responsibility 
for strategy and policies of sustainability. on a day-
to-day basis, the group executive board is in 
charge of implementation and observance in all 
parts of jyske bank, including the overall 
prioritization of initiatives. follow-up on this 
responsibility is assigned the sustainability 
committee. 
 
sustainability is an integral part of operations and 
the business development of the jyske bank 
group, and all units in the organisation contribute 
to the implementation of the strategy and the 
fulfilment of jyske bank's sustainability objectives. 
the individual units are responsible for the 
implementation of development tasks, and these 
adhere to the usual governance norms for 
prioritization and execution of development tasks.

sustainable banking targets
•
compensation for the co2 emission from

impact analysis – focus on climate
climate is a material impact area for jyske bank, 
which - as the first danish bank - has estimated 
its indirect co2e emission at a total of 2.7 million 
tonnes. 
the analysis is the first step towards quantifica-
tion of the group’s most material impact areas in 
relation to the sustainable development goals, 
and it helps us target our efforts.
the analysis shows that
•
corporate loans account for 41% of the 
estimated co2e emission. especially the 
transport industry contributes to the emis-
sion.
•
loans to personal clients account for 18% 
of the emission and are almost equally 
distributed between home loans and car 
loans.
•
asset management on behalf of clients 
accounts for 34% of the emission, due, in 
particular, to investments in shares in co2e 
intensive sectors such as utilities, materials 
and energy.

banking activities cover advisory services relating 
to traditional financial solutions targeting personal 
clients, private banking clients as well as corporate 
clients and also trading and investment activities 
targeting large corporate clients and institutional 
clients, including trading in interest-rate products, 
currencies, equities, commodities and derivatives. 
 
the strategic balance sheet and risk management 
as well as the investment portfolio earnings of 
jyske bank are also allocated to banking activities. 
 
pre-tax profit 
in 2020, pre-tax profit amounted to dkk 599m 
against dkk 1,273m in 2019. the lower profit can 
primarily be attributed to a higher management's 
estimate for impairment charges following the 
outbreak of covid-19 as well as lower 
remortgaging activity and lower bank loans. 
 
core income 
core income fell by 6% relative to 2019. the 
decline can primarily be attributed to lower 
remortgaging activity and lower bank loans. 
 
net interest income fell by 6% to dkk 2,155m in 
2020. net interest income on bank loans and 
deposits rose, however, by 2%, as the effect from 
the lower deposit rates more than compensated 
for lower level of bank loans and the effect from the 
sale of jyske bank (gibraltar). hence the decline 
was caused by lower other net interest income, 
including a lower contribution from trading 
activities and higher funding costs. 
 
net fee and commission income fell by 9% to dkk 
2,693m in 2020. the decline can be attributed to 
lower distribution fees following reduced 
remortgaging activity as well as to the outbreak of 
covid-19, which put a damper on our clients’ 
travels and increased risk aversion, resulting in 
lower income from e.g. money transfers and card 
payments. 
 
value adjustments increased to dkk 418m from 
dkk 329m in 2019. the turbulent financial markets 
after the outbreak of covid-19 in the first quarter 
of 2020 were subsequently more than 
compensated for by narrowing credit spreads and 
rising equity prices as well as a high activity level in 
the trading area. 
 
jyske bank / annual report 2020 / business segments / page 23 
 
core expenses 
compared with the 2019, core expenses fell by 4% 
in 2020 despite one-off expenses of dkk 75m 
relating to the sale of jyske bank (gibraltar), the 
increased payroll tax as well as contributions to the 
danish resolution authority. the decline can be 
attributed to a reduction of the number of full-time 
employees as well as the intensified cost focus 
resulting in broad-based savings as well as lower 
travel expenses, etc. after the outbreak of covid-
19. 
 
impairment charges 
loan impairment charges amounted to an expense 
of dkk 373m against an income of dkk 138m in 
2019. of the impairment charges in 2020, dkk 
615m can be attributed to a higher management's 
estimate relating to the outbreak of covid-19. 
the estimate was partially offset by the continuing 
positive development, among other things in the 
situation of agricultural clients.  
 
investment portfolio earnings 
in 2020, investment portfolio earnings amounted 
to dkk -56m against dkk -53m for 2019. the 
negative earnings can, in particular, be attributed to 
the market turmoil after the outbreak of covid-
19, resulting in a flatter yield curve as well as 
negative value adjustments of certain currency 
positions. the hedging of at-1 capital instruments 
in sek had a positive effect of dkk 50m in 2020 and 
was offset by a negative adjustment of 
shareholders' equity. 
 
business volume 
traditional bank loans fell by 8% to dkk 73.0 bn 
compared with the level at the end of 2019. loans 
for both personal and corporate clients fell, which 
can partially be attributed to limited demand for 
credit following the outbreak of covid-19 as well 
as the launch of support packages from the danish 
government. 
 
at the end of 2020, bank deposits amounted to 
dkk 127.2 bn, corresponding to an increase by 
dkk 0.5 bn relative to the level at the end of 2019. 
lower deposits from personal clients were 
compensated for by higher deposits from 
corporate clients. 
 
 
 
q4 2020 compared to q3 2020 
pre-tax profit rose to dkk 439m in the fourth 
quarter of 2020 from dkk 369m in the third 
quarter of 2020.  
 
core income rose by 2% to dkk 1,394m due to 
higher net fee and commission income. 
 
net interest income fell to dkk 499m from dkk 
558m in the third quarter. the decline can be 
attributed to lower bank loans to personal and 
corporate clients, which was only to a small degree 
compensated for by lower deposit rates for 
corporate clients and higher loans to public 
authorities. to this must be added the effects 
from the lower interest on bonds and expenses 
for non-preferred senior debt issued in october. 
 
net fee and commission income rose to dkk 
725m from dkk 643m. the increase was caused 
by higher brokerage as well as annual investment-
related product and custody fees. these 
circumstances compensated for the reduction in 
distribution fees caused by seasonally lower 
remortgaging activity.  
 
value adjustments came to dkk 143m against 
dkk 146m. the positive results in q4 were caused 
by the continuing narrowing of credit spreads and 
rising equity prices, supplemented by positive 
value adjustments of currency positions. 
 
core expenses rose to dkk 1,050m from dkk 
1,032m. the development can be attributed to 
small increases in e.g. it expenses. higher 
employee-related provisions were more than 
offset by reversed provisions relating to court 
cases. 
 
loan impairment charges amounted to an 
expense of dkk 62m against an income of dkk 
19m in the preceding quarter. 
  
investment portfolio earnings increased to dkk 
157m from dkk 14m in the third quarter. the 
development can primarily be attributed to 
narrowing of credit spreads on bonds as well as 
positive value adjustments of certain currency 
positions.

mortgage activities comprise financial solutions for 
the financing of real property carried out by jyske 
realkredit. mortgage activities are aimed mainly at 
danish personal clients, corporate clients and 
subsidised rental housing.   
 
pre-tax profit 
in 2020, pre-tax profit amounted to dkk 1,167m 
against dkk 1,433m in 2019. the profit for 2020 
was affected by an increased management's 
estimate relating to impairment charges in the 
amount of dkk 415m in consequence of the 
outbreak of covid-19. 
 
core income 
in 2020, core income amounted to dkk 1,997m 
against dkk 1,778m in 2019. the increase can be 
attributed to higher value adjustments. 
 
at dkk 2,332m for 2020, administration margin 
income was roughly unchanged. hence, margin 
pressure counteracted a 2% increase over the 
same period in mortgage loans stated at nominal 
value. remortgaging activity was high as from the 
second quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, 
where especially personal clients remortgaged to 
products for which the administration margin rate 
and the risk are lower.  
 
other net interest income fell to dkk 36m from 
dkk 58m in 2019. the decline can be attributed to 
a lower interest yield on the portfolio of securities 
and must be seen in the connection with the 
development of value adjustments.  
 
in 2020, net fee and commission income amounted 
to dkk -603m against dkk -641m in 2019. the 
improvement can be attributed to lower 
distribution fee payments made due to lower 
remortgaging activity. 
 
in 2020, value adjustments amounted to dkk 
219m against dkk 5m in 2019.  this development 
can primarily be attributed to positive value 
adjustments on the bond portfolio after the first 
quarter. 
  
core expenses 
in 2020, core expenses amounted to dkk 345m 
against dkk 310m in 2019. the increase can be 
attributed to the higher allocation to jyske 
realkredit of the number of employees split 
between the companiesin the group. 
 
impairment charges 
loan impairment charges amounted to an expense 
of dkk 485m in 2020 against dkk 35m in 2019. of 
the impairment charges in 2020, dkk 415m can be 
attributed to a higher management's estimate 
relating to the outbreak of covid-19. the 
remaining part of the increase relates primarily to 
single name-driven individual impairment charges 
due to a reassessment of collateral provided. 
 
business volume 
mortgage loans at fair value rose to dkk 343.9 bn 
from dkk 337.5 bn at the end of 2019 due to higher 
loans for corporate clients.

q4 2020 compared to q3 2020 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, pre-tax profit 
amounted to dkk 491m against dkk 436m in 
the third quarter of 2020. 
 
administration margin income, etc. amounted 
to dkk 584m in the fourth quarter against dkk 
581m in the third quarter. the increase was 
caused by higher loans for corporate clients and 
a slightly reduced margin pressure. 
 
other net interest income amounted to dkk 
13m against dkk 2m in the preceding quarter. 
 
net fee and commission income amounted to 
dkk -180m against dkk -176m in the third 
quarter, partially caused by the seasonally lower 
level of refinancing. 
 
value adjustments amounted to dkk 94m 
against dkk 48m, as the fourth quarter was 
characterised by a continuing favourable 
development in the financial markets.  
 
core expenses amounted to dkk 87m in the 
fourth quarter against dkk 86m in the 
preceding quarter. 
 
in the fourth quarter, impairment charges 
amounted to an income of dkk 64m against an 
income of dkk 57m in the third quarter. the 
reversals in the fourth quarter can primarily be 
attributed to reversals of management's 
estimates.

leasing activities cover financial solutions in the 
form of leasing and financing within car financing as 
well as leasing and financing of operating 
equipment for the corporate sector. the activities 
primarily target danish personal and corporate 
clients as well as dealer cooperation schemes and 
partnerships. secondarily, the activities target car 
financing in sweden. 
 
pre-tax profit 
in 2020, pre-tax profit amounted to dkk 344m 
against dkk 373m in 2019. the decrease was 
primarily caused by higher impairment charges 
relating to the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
in 2020, net interest income fell due to a negative 
one-off effect and accrual of fees paid in the fourth 
quarter of 2020. 
 
in 2020, net fee and commission income amounted 
to dkk 1m against dkk -16m in 2019. the 
development can be attributed to a changed 
contractual basis and hence a changed time of 
recognition of fees paid. 
 
value adjustments rose to dkk 48m from dkk 8m 
in 2019 due to foreign currency hedging of the 
swedish leasing portfolio. 
 
income from operating lease (net) rose by 9% 
relative to 2019, primarily due to the improving 
sales conditions in the used car market. 
 
core expenses fell by 10% relative to 2019 due to 
lower staff costs. 
 
loan impairment charges rose to dkk 110m 
against dkk 2m in 2019. the increase can partially 
be attributed to a management's estimate of dkk 
60m relating to the covid-19 pandemic.  
 
business volume 
loans under leasing activities rose by 1% to dkk 
19.9 bn at the end of 2020 from dkk 19.7 bn at the 
end of 2019.
q4 2020 compared to q3 2020 
in q4 2020, pre-tax profit amounted to dkk 
169m against dkk 101m in q3 2020.  
 
net interest income fell to dkk 99m from dkk 
115m due to a negative one-off and a changed 
contractual basis for fees paid with effect from 1 
january 2020. these effects totalled dkk -19m. 
 
net fee and commission income rose to dkk 
36m from dkk -14m due to a positive effect of 
dkk 46m from a changed contractual basis and 
hence a changed time of recognition of fees 
paid. 
 
value adjustments rose to dkk 41m from dkk -
5m. the development can primarily be attributed 
to the foreign currency hedging of the swedish 
leasing portfolio. 
 
income from operating lease (net) amounted to 
dkk 34m against dkk 69m in q3 where reversal 
of impairment charges contributed dkk 42m. 
 
core expenses increased to dkk 42m in q4 from 
dkk 41m in q3. 
 
loan impairment charges amounted to an 
expense of dkk 7m against an expense of dkk 
28m in the preceding quarter.

alternative performance targets 
 
the alternative performance targets applied in the management's review constitute valuable information for readers of financial 
statements as they provide a more uniform basis for comparison of accounting periods. no adjusting entries are made, and therefore the 
net profit or loss for the year will be the same in the alternative performance targets of the management's review and in the ifrs financial 
statements. 
 
 
 
 
core profit is defined as the pre-tax profit exclusive of investment portfolio earnings. hence earnings from clients are expressed better 
than in the ifrs financial statements. 
 
 
 
 
investment portfolio earnings are defined as the return on the group's portfolio of shares, bonds, derivatives and equity investments, yet 
exclusive of the liquidity buffer and certain strategic equity investments. investment portfolio earnings are calculated after expenses for 
funding and attributable costs. 
 
 
 
 
the above table illustrates relationships between income statement items under 'the jyske bank group' (key financial data), page 2, and 
income statement items in the ifrs financial statements, page 28.

reclassification relates to the following: 
 
- 
expenses of dkk 1m (2019: expenses of dkk 58m) due to value adjustments relating to the balance principle at jyske realkredit 
were reclassified from value adjustments to interest income. 
 
- 
income of dkk 11m (2019: income of 19m) from external sales was reclassified from income to offsetting against expenses. 
 
- 
depreciation and amortisation of dkk 534m (2019: dkk 415m) were reclassified from expenses to income from operating lease 
(net). 
 
 
please see below for definitions of the additional financial ratios stated under the jyske bank group, page 2. 
 
 
 
”earnings per share", "earnings per share (diluted)”, ”pre-tax profit as a percentage of average equity" and "net profit as a percentage of 
average equity” are calculated as if additional tier 1 capital (at1) is recognised as a liability. in the numerator, the profit is less interest 
expenses of dkk 168m (2019: dkk 156m) for additional tier 1 capital (at1), and the denominator is calculated as equity exclusive of 
additional tier 1 capital (at1) at dkk 3,307m (2019: dkk 3,257m). 
 
 
 
"expenses as a percentage of income" is calculated as core expenses divided by core income. 
 
 
 
"book value per share" and "price/book value per share" are calculated as if additional tier 1 capital (at1) is accounted for as a liability. 
book value was calculated exclusive of additional tier 1 capital (at1) of dkk 3,307m (2019: dkk 3,257m).

jyske bank's fee and commission income was finally calculated at the end of the year, when the bank’s obligation to deliver had been 
fulfilled and also the client’s payment had been effected. hence there remains no material balances of contractual assets and liabilities. 
the fee income for the year amounting to dkk 2,468m less the fees and commissions paid for the year and commission expenses of 
dkk 377m constitute the net fee and commission income for the year in the amount of dkk 2,091m (2019: dkk 2,311m). these are 
recognised in the segmental financial statements for the bank’s three business areas, cf. note 2.  loan application fees received 
relating to financial instruments measured at amortised cost amounted to dkk 198m (2019: dkk 216m). 
fee and commission income from from asset management activities and other activities entrusted to the bank that entail 
management or investment of assets on behalf of individuals, funds, pension funds and other institutions amounted to dkk 716m. 
(2019: dkk 765m).

the members of the supervisory board and the executive board are not offered any incentive programmes. no member of the 
supervisory board or the executive board is specifically remunerated as a member of the board in any group enterprise. members of 
the executive board are not separately remunerated as members of supervisory boards or board of directors outside the group (for 
instance, sector companies). alternatively, such remuneration will be set off against the salary of the individual member of the 
executive board. 
 
 
 
members of the executive board as well as jyske bank can mutually terminate the employment subject to a term of notice of six 
months. where jyske bank terminates the employment, a severance pay equalling the past 24 months' pay, inclusive of any retirement 
remuneration from jyske bank's pensionstilskudsfond will also be given. 
 
 
 
the group does not pay any separate pension contribution for the members of the supervisory board and the executive board in 
addition to the remuneration stated in the financial statements.  
 
 
 
jyske bank's pensionstilskudsfond is a fund which offers supplementary pensions to current and former members of the executive 
board and their surviving relatives, if any. payment will commence upon the resignation of the individual member of the executive 
board. since 1 january 2011, members of the executive board do not qualify for any further rights to pension supplements from jyske 
bank's pensionstilskudfond apart from a one-off payment in the form of a seniority-dependent retirement remuneration not 
exceeding 83.33% of the annual salary at the time of resignation, cf. the above table showing the total remuneration of the executive 
board. the retirement remuneration will be maximised when a member reaches 25 years of seniority, however, as regards peter 
schleidt and per skovhus when they reach 10 years of seniority. in the event of lower seniority at the time of resignation, the 
retirement remuneration will be reduced proportionally according to the shorter seniority. the pension liabilities of jyske bank's 
pensionstilskudsfond are calculated actuarially and based on a number of assumptions. to the extent the value of jyske bank's 
pensionstilskudsfond's assets does not match the net present value of the liabilities, the remaining amount has been recognised as a 
liability in the financial statements. see notes 37 and 62 for further details.

in 2020, the balance of impairment charges rose, which can be attributed to the management's estimate for the addition to the effects 
from the covid-19 outbreak. when disregarding the addition, impairment charges at the jyske bank group are generally developing 
in a positive manner, which is also evident from the stage migration. the items of new loans and advances, etc. and discontinued loans 
and advances, etc. were affected by natural refinancing and re-mortgaging. the size of the item recalculation was affected by the 
changed credit risk at each stage. the period only saw minor model adjustments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the whole, gross loans rose slightly in 2020, while gross loans fell in stages 2 and 3. the development of gross loans in stages 2 and 
3 could be attributed primarily to instalments on the exposure and, to a lesser degree, to the fact that the gross loans were transferred 
to stages 1 or 2. 
 
the management's estimates are based on models and experts. the breakdown was made in order to target the impairment charges 
to the specific clients and sub-portfolios that gave rise to management's estimates. management's estimates are included with dkk 
577m in stage 1 (2019: dkk 301m), dkk 479m in stage 2 (2019: dkk 93m) and dkk 551m in stage 3 (2019: dkk 195m).

standard terms 
 
 
 
personal clients 
 
jyske bank can call in floating-rate loans and credit facilities with a reasonable or usual notice of termination according to the rules on 
good business practice. fixed-rate loans are non-callable. clients can terminate their commitment with jyske bank without notice or, 
in the case of fixed-rate credit facilities, at two business days' notice. in case of default, jyske bank can terminate an agreement 
without notice. 
 
as a main rule, the debtor undertakes to disclose financial information. jyske bank may dispense with such undertaking where other 
information on the commitment, the repayment record and the collateral provided is deemed adequate to assess the credit risk. 
 
 
 
small and medium-sized corporate clients 
 
jyske bank can call in floating-rate loans and credit facilities without notice. in respect of old agreements, a term of notice of four 
weeks may apply on the part of jyske bank. fixed-rate loans are non-callable. in case of default, a client relationship can be terminated 
without notice. 
 
unless collateral has been provided in full, the borrower is obliged to submit financial information to jyske bank. 
 
it is jyske bank’s policy that the majority shareholder personally guarantees commitments in part or in full. 
 
 
 
large corporate clients 
 
terms of notice are agreed upon on an individual basis and may correspond to the standard notice applicable to other corporate 
clients. for facilities that cannot be terminated at short notice, covenants regarding financial ratios and material changes in the 
position of the client are standard. 
 
generally, financial information is submitted quarterly. 
 
typically, close-out netting agreements, negative pledge or pari passu agreements are entered into.

the jyske bank group has not seen significant changes to the quality of the collateral or other credit protection due to deterioration or 
changes to the company's policy on provision of collateral during the accounting period. in 2020, collateral values were affected by two 
opposing effects, including falling loans and advances in the jyske bank group to personal clients and increasing loans to corporate 
clients, primarily relating to mortgage products. this primarily affected collateral values relating to mortgages on real property. on the 
whole, collateral values are practically unchanged relative to 2019. 
 
 
 
the types of collateral are ranked with the most liquid types at the top. the collateral values have been reduced in order of priority 
according to liquidity if the collateral values exceed loans, advances and guarantees at client level. consequently, surplus collateral 
values from exposures that have been fully guaranteed are not included in the above note. for clients with fully guaranteed exposures 
in all impairment scenarios, the calculated indication of impairment will generally be dkk 0. this may be the case with exposures with a 
high surplus of fixed-value collateral such as cash, securities and properties. therefore, exposure categories with a calculated 
indication of impairment of dkk 0 are typically mortgage loans, home loans, cooperative unit loans and investment credit facilities.

fair value of collateral for loans, advances and guarantees, etc., cont. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the financial year 2020, no changes were made to the valuation principles. collateral values are recognised according to the following 
principles: 
 
 
 
highly liquid securities 
 
basically, jyske bank applies the official listed price, adjusted where necessary for marketability, currency of denomination, maturity, 
etc. 
 
 
 
real property, residential 
 
the collateral value of a charge on real property is calculated on the basis of the expected fair value of the property less sales costs and 
any senior mortgages. the value of real property is regularly assessed on the basis of the price trend of comparable real property, 
among other things. loan values are assessed individually depending on the characteristics of the real property in question, inter alia, 
type of property, location and size less expenses for realisation. the collateral value is applied for various purposes and is therefore 
adjusted to specific requirements depending on its application. 
 
 
 
 
 
real property, commercial 
 
the collateral value of a charge on real property is calculated on the basis of the expected fair value of the property less sales costs and 
any senior mortgages. the value of real property is regularly assessed on the basis of the price trend of comparable real property, 
among other things. collateral values are assessed individually depending on the characteristics of the real property in question, inter 
alia, the type of property in question, or by an independent assessment or the public land assessment. the collateral value is applied for 
various purposes and is therefore adjusted to specific requirements depending on its application. 
 
 
 
movable property 
 
jyske bank's model is based on our historical loss experience of various asset types. collateral value is reduced in accordance with the 
diminishing-balance method, which involves write-off of typically 10%-50% on acquisition and annual depreciation, typically of 10%-
50% of the asset value, during the useful life of the asset. 
 
 
 
guarantees 
 
the value of guarantees is calculated by means of a ‘double-default’ model which takes into account that jyske bank only risks a loss if 
both the debtor and the guarantor default. the effect of this is recognised by calculating an equivalent collateral value.

collateral 
 
the jyske bank group receives and provides collateral in connection with money and securities clearing, outstanding accounts with 
central banks, repo and reverse repo transactions, triparty agreements as well as fair value of derivatives covered by csa agreements.  
 
 
 
provision of collateral is a regular part of business transactions and are carried out at market-consistent terms and conditions. 
collateral is increased and reduced on an on-going basis as liabilities change. 
 
 
 
depending on agreements entered, collateral is provided and received with an owner's rights so that the recipient of collateral can sell 
this or use it to provide security for loans and other outstanding accounts. 
 
 
 
the jyske bank group has deposited bonds with central banks and clearing houses, etc. in connection with clearing and settlement of 
securities and currency transactions as well as tri-party repo transactions totalling a market value of dkk 13,912m at the end of 2020 
(2019: dkk 23,743m).  
 
 
 
in addition, the jyske bank group has provided cash collateral in connection with csa agreement in the amount of dkk 6,390m (2019: 
dkk 6,544m) as well as bonds in the amount of dkk 4,277m (2019: 1,677m).  
 
 
 
due to repo transactions, i.e. sale of securities involving agreements to repurchase them at a later point in time, bonds in the amount 
of dkk 14,523m (2019: dkk 10,058m) were at the end of 2020 provided as collateral for the amount that was borrowed. see note 40 
for further details. 
 
 
 
mortgage loans in the amount of dkk 343,449m (2019: dkk 337,050m) and other assets of dkk 24,477m (2019: 38,495m) were at the 
end of 2020 registered as collateral for issued mortgage bonds, including covered bonds. according to the danish mortgage 
legislation, the issued mortgage bonds, including covered bonds, are secured against the underlying mortgage loans. 
 
 
 
due to reverse repos, i.e. purchase of securities involving agreements to resell them at a later point in time, the jyske bank group 
received the sold bonds as security for the amount that was lent. at the end of 2020, reverse repos amounted to dkk 55,254m (2019: 
dkk 50,765m).   
 
 
 
in addition, the jyske bank group has received cash collateral in connection with csa agreements in the amount of dkk 4,061m (2019: 
dkk 1,668m) as well as bonds in the amount of dkk 696m (2019: 826m).

on a daily basis, the jyske bank group issues and redeems a large number of mortgage bonds. consequently, to some extent the 
change in the fair value of the issued mortgage bonds attributable to the change in credit risk can only be stated subject to some 
estimation. the model applied performs the calculation on the basis of the change in the option-adjusted spread (oas) relative to the 
swap curve. the calculation allows for, among other things, the maturity of the issued bonds as well as the nominal holding at the 
beginning and at the end of the year, and also adjustments are made for the jyske bank group’s own holding of jyske realkredit bonds, 
which are offset. 
 
 
 
the change in the fair value of issued mortgage bonds that can be attributed to credit risk is then calculated so it implies a decline in the 
fair value by dkk 0.5 bn in 2020 (2019: a decline by dkk 0.3 bn). since the issue, the accumulated change in fair value of the issued 
mortgage bonds at the end of 2020 attributable to credit risk is estimated to be an increase of dkk 1.0 bn (2019: an increase of dkk 2.0 
bn).  
 
 
 
the change in fair value of the issued mortgage bonds that can be attributed to credit risk can also be stated relative to corresponding 
mortgage bonds with the same rating (aaa) from other danish issuers. in recent years these bonds have been traded at prices 
showing no measurable price differences between the various issuers’ bonds with similar characteristics. stated according to this 
method, no changes have taken place to the fair value that can be attributed to credit risk, neither in the course of the year, nor since 
issue.  
 
 
 
net profit for the year or equity was not affected by the change, since the value of mortgage loans changed correspondingly. 
 
 
 
the difference between the fair value of the issued bonds in the amount of dkk 349 bn (2019: dkk 357 bn) and the nominal value of 
the issued bonds of dkk 336 bn (2019: dkk 346 bn), which corresponds to the value that is to be paid back at drawing and/or maturity 
of the bonds, amounts to dkk 13 bn (2019: dkk 11 bn).

the most important actuarial assumptions in the calculation of pension liabilities relate to interest rate level and the rate of wage 
increases. if the discount rate fall by 0.25% to 0.0%, the pension provisions increase by dkk 10m. if the rate of wage increases rise by 
0.25% to 2.25%, the pension provisions increase by dkk 10m. 
 
 
 
for 2021, payments to defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans are expected to be dkk 296m.  
 
 
 
defined contribution pension plans  
 
a large part of the group’s pension plans are defined contribution plans under which payments are made into pension funds, primarily 
pfa pension. these payments are charged to the income statement as they occur. 
 
 
 
defined benefit plans 
 
retirement remuneration equalling a maximum of one year’s salary is paid to employees on retirement. in 2020, a total of dkk 493m 
(2019: dkk 528m) was recognised in the balance sheet, this being the present value of the overall liability relating to the employees' 
term of employment with the group. employees recruited not later than 31 august 2005 are offered participation in the retirement 
remuneration plan. please see note 12 for details on the terms and conditions for retirement remuneration for the executive board. 
 
 
 
jyske bank a/s's pensionstilskudsfond is a fund which offers supplementary pensions to current and former members of jyske 
bank's executive board and their surviving relatives. at the end of 2020, provisions amounting to dkk 66m (2019: dkk 57m) were 
recognised, this being the present value of liabilities, dkk 147m (2019: dkk 144m), less the fair value of the assets, dkk 81m (2019: 
dkk 87m). 
 
 
 
long-term employee benefits 
 
an anniversary bonus equalling one month’s salary is paid when an employee has worked for the group for 25 years and 40 years. at 
the end of 2020, provisions amounted to dkk 57m (2019: dkk 51m), this being the present value of the expected future anniversary 
bonus payments. 
 
 
 
other long-term employee benefits relate to other salary- and pension-related benefits paid to employees on retirement. total 
provisions amounted to dkk 0m (2019: dkk 2m).

the above-mentioned issues of hybrid core capital issued in 2004 and 2005 do not meet the conditions for additional tier 1 capital in 
the capital requirements regulation, crr. the issues are recognised under liability other than provision according to ias 32.  
 
 
 
 
 
the above issues of hybrid core capital have no contractual maturity date. subject to the approval of the danish financial supervisory 
authority, the notes may be redeemed by jyske bank, but not earlier than ten years after the date of issue. the holders have no right to 
call for the redemption of the notes. interest payments will cease in the event that the issuer does not meet the solvency 
requirements. under such circumstances, dividend payments and buy-back of issued shares are subject to certain restrictions. the 
rate of interest is floating, but capped at 9% per annum for the eur 72.8m loan and at 8% per annum for the eur 60.7m loan. the rate 
is calculated as eur cms10 + 0.15% per annum.

jyske bank has not lent bonds that are still recognised in the balance sheet. moreover, jyske bank has not borrowed bonds that are not 
recognised in the balance sheet.  
 
 
 
jyske bank enters into transactions transferring the ownership to financial assets to the counterparty, yet jyske bank maintains the 
material part of the risks on the assets in question. when the most material risks are maintained, the asset is still recognised in jyske 
bank’s balance sheet. such transactions include repo transactions. repo transactions are sales of bonds where at the time of a sale an 
agreement is made on the repurchase at some later point in time at a certain price.  
 
 
 
jyske bank has not entered into agreements on the transfer of financial assets, where the assets sold no longer are recognised in the 
balance sheet, but where after the sale material risk and continued involvement exist.

general 
 
jyske bank's credit review of guarantee applicant takes into consideration the risk on guarantees. for 74% of jyske bank group’s 
guarantees, the contractual term to maturity is below one year; for 19%, the contractual terms to maturity is between 1 and 5 years; 
for 7%, the contractual term to maturity is above 5 years, compared to 68%, 25% and 7%, respectively, in 2019.  
 
 
 
financial guarantees are primarily payment guarantees, and the risk equals that involved in credit facilities. 
 
 
 
guarantees for losses on mortgage loans are typically provided as security for the riskiest part of mortgage loans granted to personal 
clients and to a limited extent for loans secured on commercial real property. guarantees for residential real property are within 80% 
and for commercial real property within 60%-80%, of the property value as assessed by a professional expert. 
 
 
 
registration and refinancing guarantees are provided in connection with the registration of new and refinanced mortgages. such 
guarantees involve insignificant risk. 
 
 
 
other contingent liabilities include other forms of guarantees at varying degrees of risk, including performance guarantees. the risk 
involved is deemed to be less than the risk involved in, e.g., credit facilities subject to flexible drawdown. 
 
 
 
the group is also a party to a number of legal disputes arising from its business activities. the group estimates the risk involved in each 
individual case and makes any necessary provisions which are recognised under contingent liabilities. the group does not expect such 
liabilities to have material influence on the group’s financial position. 
 
 
 
because of its mandatory participation in the deposit guarantee scheme, the sector has paid an annual contribution of 2.5‰ of the 
covered net deposits until the assets of pengeinstitutafdelingen (the financial institution fund) exceed 0.8% of the total net deposits 
covered, which level has been reached. according to bank package 3 and bank package 4, pengeinstitutafdelingen bears the 
immediate losses attributable to covered net deposits and relating to the winding up of financial institutions in distress. any losses in 
connection with the final winding up are covered by the guarantee fund's afviklings- og restruktureringsafdeling (settlement and 
restructuring fund), where jyske bank currently guarantees 8.70% of any losses. 
 
 
 
the statutory participation in the resolution financing arrangements (resolution fund) as of june 2015 entailed that credit institutions 
pay an annual contribution over a 10-year period to a danish national fund with a target size totalling 1% of the covered deposits. 
credit institutions are to contribute according to their relative sizes and risk in denmark, and the first contributions to the resolution 
fund were paid at the end of 2015. the jyske bank group expects having to pay a total of about dkk 500m over the 10-year period 
2015 -2025. 
 
 
 
due to jyske bank's membership of the association bankdata, the bank is - in the event of its withdrawal - under the obligation to pay 
an exit charge to bankdata in the amount of about dkk 3.3 bn. 
 
 
 
jyske bank is a management company under danish joint taxation. therefore, according to the provisions of the danish company 
taxation, jyske bank is liable as of the accounting year 2013 for corporation tax, etc. for the jointly taxed companies and as of 1 july 
2012 for any liabilities to withhold tax on interest and dividends for the jointly taxed companies.

on the balance sheet, reverse repo transactions are classified as claims on credit institutions or loans at amortised cost. on the 
balance sheet, repo transactions are classified as debt to credit institutions or deposits. 
 
 
 
financial assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when the group and the counterparty has a legal right to offset and have 
also agreed to settle net or realise the asset and the liability at the same time. positive and negative fair values of derivative financial 
instruments with the same counterparty are offset if net settlement of the contractual payments has been agreed and daily cash 
payments or provision of collateral for changes in the fair value take place. the group's netting of positive and negative fair values of 
derivative financial instruments can be referred to clearing through a central clearing house (ccp clearing).  
 
 
 
master netting agreements and similar agreements entitles a party to further offsetting if a counterparty is in default, which lowers the 
exposure further when a counterparty is in default, but does not meet the conditions for accounting offsetting on the balance sheet.

notes on fair value 
 
 
 
methods for measuring fair value  
 
fair value is the price that, at the time of measurement, would be obtained by selling an asset or paid for by transferring a liability in 
an ordinary transaction between independent market participants. the fair value may equal the book value where book value is 
recognised on the basis of underlying assets and liabilities measured at fair value. 
 
 
 
for all assets listed on active markets, fair values are measured at official prices (the category "quoted prices"). where no price is 
quoted, a different official price is used which is taken to reflect most closely the fair value (category: "observable prices"). financial 
assets and liabilities of which quoted prices or other official prices are not available or are not taken to reflect the fair value are 
measured at fair value according to other evaluation techniques and other observable market information. in those cases where 
observable prices based on market information are not available or are not taken to be useful for measuring fair value, the fair value 
is measured by recognised techniques, including discounted future cash flows, and own expertise (category "non-observable 
prices"). the basis of the measurement may be recent transactions involving comparable assets or liabilities, interest rates, 
exchange rates, volatility, credit spreads, etc. generally, the group's unlisted shares are placed in this category. 
 
 
 
generally, quoted prices and observable input are obtained in the form of interest rates and equity and bond prices, exchange rates, 
volatilities, etc. from recognised stock exchanges and providers. 
 
 
 
specific details on methods for measuring fair value 
 
loans at fair value are predominantly mortgage loans and generally measured at prices of the underlying bonds quoted on a 
recognised stock exchange. if such a market price is not available for the preceding 7 days, a calculated price based on the official 
market rate will be applied for determining the value. if derivatives are part of the funding of the mortgage loans, the value of these 
will be integrated in the valuation of the loans. the fair value is reduced by the calculated impairment charge, which for loans at fair 
value is measured according to the same principles that apply to impairments of loans and advances at amortised cost. 
 
 
 
bonds at fair value, shares, assets linked to pooled deposits, and derivatives are measured at fair value in the accounts to the effect 
that the carrying amounts equal fair values. 
 
 
 
generally, bonds are measured at prices quoted on a recognised stock exchange. alternatively, prices are applied that are 
calculated on the basis of jyske bank's own measurement models based on a yield curve with a credit spread. essentially, the 
calculated prices are based on observable input. 
 
 
 
generally, equities, etc. are measured at prices quoted on a recognised stock exchange. alternatively, prices are applied that are 
calculated on the basis of jyske bank's own measurement models based on observable input, shareholders' agreements, executed 
transactions, etc. unlisted equities are measured on the basis of discounted cash flow models (dcf). 
 
 
derivatives are measured on the basis of the following measurement techniques. 
 
- 
forward exchange transactions are measured on the basis of yield curves as well as exchange rates obtained. 
 
- 
interest-rate and currency swaps are measured on the basis of exchange rates, interest points, interpolation between 
these, as well as correction of credit risk (cva and dva). client margins are amortised over the remaining time to 
maturity. present value calculations with discounting is applied. 
 
- 
futures are measured on the basis of prices obtained in the market for stock-exchange traded futures. 
 
- 
options are measured on the basis of volatilities, correlation matrices, prices of underlying assets and exercise prices. 
for this purpose, option models, such as black-scholes, are applied. 
 
 
assets related to pooled deposits are measured according to the above principles. 
  
information about differences between recognised value and measurement of fair value 
 
loans and advances exclusive of mortgage loans and certain other home loans are recognised at amortised cost. the difference 
to fair value is assumed to be fee and commission received, costs defrayed in connection with lending, plus interest-rate-
dependent value adjustment calculated by comparing current market rates with market rates at the time when the loans and 
advances were established. changes in credit quality are assumed to be included under impairment charges both for carrying 
amounts and fair values. 
 
 
 
subordinated debt and issued bonds exclusive of issues of mortgage bonds are recognised at amortised cost supplemented with 
the fair value of the hedged interest-rate risk. the difference to fair value was calculated on the basis of own-issue prices obtained 
externally. 
 
 
deposits are recognised at amortised cost. the difference to fair value is assumed to be the interest-rate dependent value 
adjustment calculated by comparing current market rates with market rates at the time when the deposits were made. 
 
 
 
balances with credit institutions are recognised at amortised cost. the difference to fair value is assumed to be the interest-rate 
dependent value adjustment calculated by comparing current market rates with market rates at the time when the transactions 
were established. changes in the credit quality of balances with credit institutions are assumed to be included under impairment 
charges for loans, advances, and receivables. changes in the fair values of balances due to credit institutions because of changes in 
jyske bank’s own credit rating are not taken into account. 
 
 
 
the calculated fair values of financial assets and liabilities recognised at amortised cost are materially non-observable prices (level 
3) in the fair value hierarchy.

information about changes in credit risk on derivatives with positive fair value 
 
in order to allow for the credit risk on derivatives for clients without credit impairment, the fair value is adjusted (cva). adjustments 
will also be made for clients with credit impairment, but on an individual basis.  
 
for any given counterparty's total portfolio of derivatives, cva is a function of the expected positive exposure (epe), loss given 
default (lgd) as well as the probability of default (pd).  
 
when determining the epe, a model is used to establish the expected positive exposure to the counterparty's portfolio over the 
time to maturity of the derivatives. for lgd, internal estimates are used for the individual counterparty, adjusted for any collateral 
received as well as csa agreements concluded. the pds that jyske bank has applied in the model so far were estimated on the 
basis of irb (internal rating based) pds. the bank no longer assesses that this method for estimation of pds reflects to a sufficient 
degree the probability of default that can be seen in the market. therefore, jyske bank is in the process of replacing the model and 
anticipates that the new model will be implemented in 2021. the change gives rise to a management's estimate of dkk 142m for 
2020 in addition to the current acva model. 
 
in addition to cva, also an adjustment is made of the fair value of derivatives that have an expected future negative fair value. this 
takes place to allow for changes in the counterparties' credit risk against the jyske bank group (debt valuation adjustment - dva). 
the dva calculation takes place according to the same principles that apply to the cva calculation, yet pd for jyske bank is 
determined on the basis of jyske bank's external rating by standard & poor's. at the end of 2020, cva and dva amounted net to 
dkk 67m, which accumulated amount was recognised as an expense under value adjustment against an accumulated amount of 
dkk 73m at the end of 2019. the above-referenced management's estimate for acva is added to this.

fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the table shows the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and the carrying amounts. the re-statement at fair value of financial 
assets and liabilities shows a total non-recognised unrealised loss of dkk 42m at the end of 2020 against a total non-recognised 
unrealised loss of dkk 136m at the end of 2019. unrealised gains and losses caused by changes in the fair values of shares in sector-
owned undertakings are recognised in the income statement. the recognised value of those shares in the balance sheet at the end of 
2020 amounted to dkk 1,115m (2019: dkk 1,182m), and the recognised value adjustment in the income statement amounted to dkk 
92m (2019: dkk 120m).

the above table shows the fair value hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value. 
 
it is the practice of the group that if prices of danish bonds are not updated for two days, transfers will take place between the 
categories quoted prices and observable prices. this did not result in material transfers in 2020 and 2019.

non-observable prices 
 
non-observable prices at the end of 2020 referred to unlisted shares recognised at dkk 1,456m against unlisted shares recognised 
at dkk 1,530m at the end of 2019. these are primarily sector shares. the measurements, which are associated with some 
uncertainty, are made on the basis of the shares' book value, market trades, shareholders' agreements as well as own assumptions 
and extrapolations, etc. in the cases where jyske bank calculates the fair value on the basis of the company's expected future 
earnings, a required rate of return of 15% p.a. before tax is applied. if it is assumed that the actual market price will deviate by +/-
10% relative to the calculated fair value, the effect on the income statement would amount to dkk 146m on 31 december 2020 
(0.44% of the shareholders' equity at the end of 2020). for 2019, the effect on the income statement is estimated at dkk 153m 
(0.48% of the shareholders' equity at the end of 2019). capital gain and loss for the year on unlisted shares recognised in the 
income statement is attributable to assets held at the end of 2020. jyske bank finds it of little probability that the application of 
alternative prices in the measurement of fair value would result in a material deviation from the recognised fair value.

non-financial assets recognised at fair value 
 
 
 
investment properties were recognised at a fair value of dkk 28m (end of 2019: dkk 28m). fair value belongs to the category of 
non-observable prices calculated on the basis of a required rate of return of 7% (end of 2019: 7%). 
 
 
 
 
 
at the end of 2020, assets held temporarily included properties repossessed temporarily and cars, etc. assets held temporarily are 
recognised at the lower of cost and fair value less costs of sale. assets held temporarily were recognised at dkk 165m (end of 2019: 
dkk 2,476m). fair value belongs to the category of non-observable prices, except for bonds in the amount of dkk 0m (end of 2019: 
dkk 570m).   
 
 
 
 
 
owner-occupied properties, exclusive of leased properties, were recognised at the restated value corresponding to the fair value 
on the date of the revaluation less subsequent amortization, depreciation and impairment. the valuation of selected land and 
buildings is carried out with the assistance of external experts. based on the returns method, the measurement takes place in 
accordance with generally accepted standards and with a weighted average required rate of return of 6.43% (2019: 6.44%). owner-
occupied properties, exclusive of leased properties, were recognised at dkk 1,759m (2019: dkk 1,776m). see note 30 for further 
details. the revalued amount belongs to the category of ’ non-observable prices’. 
 
48 
risk exposure 
 
jyske bank assumes financial risks within established limits and to the extent the risk-adjusted return in this way contributes to the 
group's financial goal.  
 
 
 
jyske bank's financial risks consist mainly of credit risks. the group assumes credit risks if, through individual credit processing, it can 
be substantiated that the debtor has the necessary ability to service debts and that it can be rendered probable that the debtor has the 
will and the ability to repay the credit granted. failing that, the subject matter of the charge must have sufficient value as well as stability 
of value, and it must be substantiated that the subject matter of the charge can be realised and pay off the remaining credit. finally, it is 
a requirement that the group's expected earnings must match the associated credit risk and capital charge.    
 
 
 
moreover, jyske bank assumes market risks when a return matching the involved risk can be rendered probable. the group's market 
risk consists chiefly of interest-rate risk. market risks are managed on the basis of a portfolio approach across instruments and types of 
risk and hence in consideration of the correlation or lack of correlation for which there is empirical evidence and that is expressed 
through the risk measurement value at risk (var). to a lesser degree, the group assumes financial option risks. during periods with 
high market volatility, positions involving market risk are generally reduced so the stated var will still be at an acceptable level. 
 
 
 
as a consequence of the group's activities, liquidity risks arise when there is a funding mismatch in the balance sheet because the loan 
portfolio has a longer duration than its average funding sources. active liquidity management will ensure that there is sufficient liquidity 
in the short and long term to meet the group's payment obligations. 
 
 
 
it is to the greatest possible extent attempted to minimise operational risks considering the related costs. 
 
 
 
at any time, the total risks are adjusted to the group's risk profile and capital structure according to the group's capital management 
objective. therefore, over the past year, the monitoring and reporting of total risks have in particular focused on the risk relating to the 
covid-19 pandemic.

risk management and risk organisation 
 
risk management is a key element in the group's daily operations and is anchored in the group supervisory board and the group 
executive board. 
 
 
 
the group supervisory board lays down the general principles for risk and capital management as well as for the group's risk profile, 
and implement these in the group by adopting a number of risk policies and instructions. together with the group executive board, 
the group supervisory board is responsible for ensuring that the group has an organisational structure that will secure a distinct 
allocation of responsibility and include an appropriate separation of functions between development units, operating units and control 
units in the daily monitoring and management of the group's risks. 
 
 
 
the group executive board is responsible for the day-to-day risk management and the management of the group and will ensure that 
policies and instructions are operationalized and complied with. the group executive board has appointed a group chief risk officer, 
who is also the director of the risk unit. the responsibilities of the unit include assets involving risks across areas of risk and 
organisational units, including: 
 
• 
presentation of risk policies and risk-management principles to the group executive board and the group supervisory 
board;  
 
• 
presentation of a comprehensive picture of risk for the decision-makers; 
 
• 
implementation of risk management principles and policies in order to improve risk management on an on-going basis; 
 
• 
quantification of the group’s risk exposure as well as monitoring and reporting to ascertain that the group's risk exposure 
does not exceed the limits defined by the group supervisory board. 
 
 
the impact from covid-19 on the group's risks has over the past year been in focus. consequently, in the spring, a cross-
organisational task force was established to form an overview of the impact from covid-19 on the picture of risk. continuous 
reporting on the picture of risk in the light of the covid-19 pandemic has taken place, both in risk reports and in ad hoc analyses.  
 
 
 
to achieve efficient risk management close to the mortgage-credit business, the group has also appointed a risk officer at jyske 
realkredit. the risk officer and his employees form an integral part of the unit risk to ensure that the group chief risk officer has a 
complete overview of the entire group's risks.  
 
 
 
day-to-day management of credit risk is undertaken by account managers as well as the credit division with due regard to credit 
policies and credit instructions.  
 
jyske bank has three business areas that manage market risk. strategic market risks are managed by group treasury, and 
investments are in general based on a long-term perspective on the financial markets. jyske markets and jyske realkredit manage 
short-term market risks as part of the servicing of clients' trades with financial instruments and in the mortgage credit business. 
similarly, the strategic liquidity risks are managed by group treasury, and the short-term operational liquidity is managed at jyske 
markets. the day-to-day management of operational risk is undertaken by the individual units of the group. 
 
50 
credit risk 
 
credit risk is managed, among other things, on the basis of the group's approved advanced credit risk models. the models are used for 
various purposes, from advisory services offered to the jyske bank group’s clients to determination of risk and for management 
reporting. 
 
 
 
credit policy and responsibility 
 
the group supervisory board determines the general framework for the granting of credit in the group. the authority structure 
relating to the granting of credit in the group is determined by the group supervisory board, which is the granting authority in 
connection with the largest exposures. granting authority in connection with other exposures has been delegated to the group 
executive board.  
 
 
 
credit risk is managed through the credit policy, which defines objectives and framework for the credit risk of the group with the 
objective of keeping the group’s risk at a satisfactory level in respect of the capital base and business volume of the group as well as 
the general trend in the danish economy. clients’ transactions with the group must for the long term generate a satisfactory risk-
adjusted return. 
 
 
 
specific credit policies have been formulated for all areas in which the group assumes credit risk, and credit risk levels and undesirable 
types of business have been identified. the policies are regularly adjusted to meet current requirements and adapted to the 
management tools available to account managers and the monitoring functions. 
 
 
 
limits and authorisation 
 
the group attaches great importance to its decentralised credit-authorisation process. the limit structure states which amounts can 
be granted and which instances and segments are covered. the main principle is that regularly occurring credit cases can be decided 
locally, and credit-related decisions for major or more complicated cases must be made centrally - in respect of leasing, bank loans as 
well as mortgage loans. 
 
 
 
limits are delegated to account managers individually on the basis of perceived competence and need. decisions about applications 
over and above the limits delegated to account managers are made by the credit unit. credit-related decisions relating to credit's 
limits are made by the group executive board for credit cases at jyske bank, whereas the supervisory boards of the individual 
subsidiaries are the granting authority in connection with cases involving clients of the subsidiaries, including and primarily jyske 
realkredit and jyske finans. the group executive board is represented on the supervisory boards of the individual subsidiaries. finally, 
credit-related decisions relating to the supervisory boards of the subsidiaries are made by the group supervisory board.

the credit process and monitoring 
 
together with policies and business procedures, the credit processes form the basis ensuring that the granting of credit is based on 
sound risk taking and the highest degree of loss minimisation.  
 
 
 
the basis of each authorisation of credit is the client's ability to repay the loan. a central element in the assessment of the 
creditworthiness of corporate clients is their ability to service debt out of cash flows from operations in combination with their financial 
strength. in respect of personal clients, their debt servicing ability, as reflected in budgets and disposable income (before and after the 
raising of the loan), is decisive.  
 
 
 
the extent of data and analyses depends on the client's financial situation and the complexity of the case and may therefore vary from 
case to case. 
 
 
 
the provision of collateral is a material element in credit granting in order to minimise the group's future losses. in respect of mortgage 
loans, real property is always mortgaged, and in respect of leasing, the financed asset has always been provided as security. 
 
 
 
monitoring of the group’s credit risk is performed by the department risk management, which is fully independent of business 
processes and has no business responsibility. risk management is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and analysis of the 
exposures of the group, by size, sector, type and geographical area with the main focus on reducing the risk and ensuring satisfactory 
diversification of the portfolio in accordance with the group's risk targets. monitoring takes place through quantitative models at 
portfolio level. 
 
 
 
furthermore, risk management is responsible for monitoring the credit quality of the portfolio, which is based on several approaches 
(client groups, sectors, product groups, etc.). moreover, risk monitoring includes qualitative as well as quantitative control, for instance, 
of data and risk categories. 
 
 
 
credit assessment and pd 
 
credit procedures are adjusted to match the level of risk on individual exposures. one of the key elements is the ranking of the client’s 
credit quality through credit rating at jyske bank and jyske finans as well as rating at jyske realkredit. the credit rating expresses the 
probability of the client defaulting over the coming year (probability of default - pd). a client in default is defined as a client who is not 
expected to meet his obligations in full to the group. by far, most clients are awarded a pd on the basis of statistical credit scoring 
models developed internally in the group. very large companies and companies within special sectors are awarded a pd on the basis of 
an assessment by an independent expert. examples are financing companies, financial institutions and central governments. in those 
cases, external ratings, if available, will primarily form the basis of the internal credit rating of the client. 
 
 
 
many factors are relevant for the calculation of a client's pd. specific factors relating to the client and a large number of factors relating 
to the situation of the client are taken into account when making the calculation. the calculation of pd therefore takes into account 
financial data, changes in transaction data, management and market circumstances, etc. also included in the calculation are specific 
danger signals in relation to the client’s credit quality, payment profile and loss history. 
 
 
 
in order to reach the best possible overview of client credit quality, pd is mapped into internal credit ratings ("sty") at jyske bank and 
jyske finans. jyske bank's credit ratings are on a scale from 1 to 14, 1 being the best credit quality (the lowest pd) and 14 the poorest 
credit quality (the highest pd). the scale is constant over time so that clients migrate up or down depending on their pd.  
 
 
 
the pd level is monitored quarterly relative to the actual development of the default rate. adjustments are made with half of the 
fluctuations relative to the long-term average. 
 
 
 
at jyske realkredit, the pd is translated into 9 rating classes, where rating class 9 designates clients in default. work is undergoing to 
harmonise the concepts and models relating to credit rating in the group.

credit risk, cont. 
 
 
 
below is shown the mapping between credit ratings, the jyske realkredit rating, pd as well as external ratings at the end of 2020 for 
clients that are not in default. 
 
 
 
the group's internal credit ratings and the mapped jyske realkredit ratings aim to assess the credit risk in a one-year perspective, 
while external ratings (aaa - c) aim to assess the credit risk in a longer perspective. the mapping between the internal credit ratings, 
the jyske realkredit rating and the external credit ratings is based on the currently observed default frequency for companies rated by 
jyske realkredit and moody's. the mapping between the internal rating, the jyske realkredit rating and external ratings is therefore 
dynamic. observations are made on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether changes are to be made in the mapping. 
 
  
 
if the credit rating calculated by the model is considered to be inadequate, independent credit experts may review the credit rating of 
corporate clients at the request of the relevant account manager.

credit exposure 
 
credit exposures are quantified by means of ead (exposure at default). ead reflects the exposure at default in the event of the client 
defaulting in the course of the next twelve months. a client's overall ead depends on client-specific factors and the specific products 
held by the client. for most product types, ead is calculated on the basis of statistical models, while a few product types are based on 
expert models. 
 
 
 
for loans with a fixed principal, the only element of uncertainty in the determination of ead is the time until possible default. 
uncertainty is higher, however, for credit facilities under which the client may draw up to a maximum. in those cases, the amount drawn 
by the client at the time of loss is decisive. this can be modelled by means of client-specific factors and the circumstances surrounding 
the exposure. 
 
 
 
guarantees and credit commitments are special products inasmuch as a certain event must take place before they are utilised. it is 
therefore material to assess the probability and the extent of utilisation of the product in the event of the customer defaulting within 
the next twelve months. in this regard, the ead parameters are based mainly on expert assessments: the group has recorded very few 
default events over time, so the available data are too meagre for statistical modelling as such. in respect of guarantees, there is a 
sufficient body of data for statistical modelling. 
 
 
 
in respect of financial instruments, ead is measured according to the market-value method for regulatory calculation, while for 
internal management purposes, the more advanced epe method is used.

credit risk, cont. 
 
 
 
collateral 
 
as a main rule, clients are required to provide full or partial collateral for their commitments with a view to limiting the credit risk and 
ensuring an adequate balance between risk and earnings. the group's mortgage loans are always secured by mortgages on 
immovable property, and also in a large number of cases, guarantees are provided by third parties in connection with cooperation with 
other financial institutions. in connection with loans for social housing, guarantees are provided by municipalities and the state. 
 
 
 
collateral received is a main element of the group’s assessment of loss given default (loss given default (lgd)). lgd is the part of 
the group's total exposure to a client which the group expects to lose in the event the client defaults within the next twelve months. a 
client's lgd depends on specific factors, including the client’s commitment and the collateral provided. overall, lgd also depends on 
jyske bank's ability to collect receivables and liquidate collateral. 
 
 
 
the models relating to real property and vehicles include on-going updating of the collateral value, taking into account, among other 
things, market-related changes in value, ranking as well as wear and tear. the on-going updating of the values of real property will also 
ensure compliance with the requirements relating to the monitoring of ltv limits of the sdo loans according to the rules on possible, 
further supplementary capital.  
 
 
 
the calculation of impairment charges and solvency requirement uses lgd estimates which reflect the group's expected loss rates. 
the loss levels for impairment purposes have been calibrated for the current expectations of loss given default, while lgd for solvency 
purposes have been calibrated for the period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. 
 
 
risk classification 
 
at the jyske bank group exposures with objective evidence of impairment are divided into three categories: exposures with low, high 
and full risk. the latter two risk categories consist of defaulted clients. exposures with low risk are exposures for which it is assessed 
more probable that the exposure will again become sound, while exposures with high and full risk (defaulted clients) are exposures for 
which it is assessed more probable that the exposure will result in losses and/or forced sale of assets provided as security to the jyske 
bank group or other creditors. 
 
 
 
the jyske bank group’s definition of default is defined as clients with a high or full risk (unlikely to pay) and clients past due more than 
90 days on payment of contractual interest and instalments. the definition of default is based on the requirements set forth in article 
178 of the eu regulation no. 575/2013. for instance, clients are considered associated with high or full risk (defaulted clients) in the 
event of bankruptcy, restructuring, debt rescheduling, indication of current or expected future challenges establishing balance 
between income and expenditure, etc. the principles and the definitions of the risk classification have been applied for many years and 
are assessed to be a well-defined and robust element in the group’s risk management practice. 
 
 
 
the classification of risk is reassessed on an ongoing basis by account managers and/or credit specialists and at least once a year for 
sound accounts and at least once a quarter for weak accounts. the same requirement as to being updated applies to changes of the 
risk classification in the event of deterioration and improvement. this ensures a high level of assurance that the group’s statement of 
indication of impairment is true and fair, and that the solvency requirement has not been determined on an imprudent basis.  
 
 
 
there is close correlation between the group’s risk classification principles and credit management in the business, reflected, among 
other things, in the credit policy and credit-related business procedures. depending on the client’s risk classification, for instance 
requirements of frequency of credit follow-up, requirements of degree of collateral and requirements of pricing are made. the 
principles are generally applicable to the entire group and apply to all categories of loans and client segments. 
 
 
 
there are only minor differences between the definition of default and the accounting treatment of credit-impaired loans and 
advances (stage 3), as account managers and/or credit specialists - following a specific assessment of the client's financial 
circumstances - may reclassify clients past due more than 90 days (default) to stage 2, if it is documented that the reason why the 
client is in arrears is not financial difficulties. hence, to a high degree, the accounting treatment of the loan reflects the current financial 
assessments of the client’s circumstances. 
 
 
 
in connection with the group’s implementation of the new default guidelines (eba/gl/2016/07) issued by the eba, the entry criteria 
for default, stage 3 and non-performing, are aligned. various periods of quarantine apply to the individual concepts, and therefore the 
exit criteria vary.

loan impairment charges  
 
the jyske bank group recognises loan impairment charges and provisions for guarantees already as of the initial recognition. all loans 
are segmented into three stages, depending on the credit-impairment of the individual loans relative to the initial recognition: 
 
 
1. 
loans with no significant increase in credit risk 
 
2. 
loans with significant increase in credit risk 
 
3. 
credit-impaired loans 
 
 
 
on an on-going basis, account managers secure that the credit assessment and credit rating are true and fair and assess on an on-
going basis - and at least every quarter - the risk classification, including whether objective evidence of impairment has been 
established for group’s clients. where easier conditions have been granted to clients with financial problems, this will be regarded as 
individual objective evidence of impairment. 
 
 
 
in the jyske bank group, all loans are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. objective evidence of impairment exists if one or 
more of the following events have occurred: 
 
• 
the borrower is facing considerable financial difficulties; 
• 
the borrower is in serious breach of contract, for instance by failing to observe its liability to pay instalments and interest. 
• 
the borrower is granted easier terms that would not be considered if the borrower was not facing financial difficulties; 
• 
the borrower is likely to go bankrupt or undergo some other financial restructuring.

market risk 
 
jyske bank assumes market risk as a result of position-taking in the financial markets and general banking and mortgage banking 
operations. the measurement of market risk includes all products which involve interest-rate, currency, equity or commodity risk. 
certain financial instruments include elements of credit risk. this type of credit risk is managed and monitored in parallel with market 
risk. every risk type has its own characteristics and is managed and monitored by means of individual risk measurements as well as 
through the group's value-at-risk (var) model. value-at-risk expresses the maximum risk of loss over a period based on historical 
price and correlation developments of individual business types.  
 
 
 
sensitivity analyses 
 
jyske bank extensively holds offsetting positions across markets. the worst-case scenario is one where the prices of all long (positive) 
positions decline, while the prices of short (negative) positions increase. a sensitivity analysis of the balance sheet at the end of the 
period is shown in the table below, from which the earnings impact from the stated negative development in prices and rates for the 
group appears. the sensitivity analyses are based on ’other things being equal’ observations and do not take into account changes in 
the balance sheet due to changes in the market development.  
 
 
 
negative interest rates still constitute a dominant element, and the introduction of negative interest rates on deposits without 
contractual expiry contributed to a reduction of risk in 2020 compared to 2019, where the group also increased its degree of hedging 
marginally.

equity risk a is put at 10% of net equity exposure, net exposure being calculated as positive exposure less negative exposure. equity 
risk a is therefore an indication of the loss/gain in the event of a 10% change in global equity prices. 
 
 
 
equity risk b is put at 10% of the numerical equity exposure. this risk measurement thus expresses the gross exposure, as it shows the 
loss at a 10% negative price change on total positive exposure and a simultaneous 10% positive price change on total negative 
exposure. 
 
 
 
besides equity risks a and b, the jyske bank group applies limits to individual exposures to shares with the objective of limiting 
concentration risk. there is also a limit to the proportion of jyske bank shares held.

interest-rate risk 
 
jyske bank applies the rules for hedge accounting of fair value for certain fixed-rate issued bonds at amortised cost, subordinated debt 
and debt to credit institutions. the purpose is to avoid asymmetric fluctuations in the financial statements as both the hedging 
instruments as well as the hedged items will then be adjusted to market value in the income statement in the event of changes to the 
interest-rate level. the hedging instruments used are interest-rate swaps, which are used for hedging against changes in the interest-
rate level. the interest rate is the only material element of risk that is hedged in the hedged items, and not credit margins or similar.  
 
 
 
for each secured bond issued, subordinated debt or debt to credit institutions, an interest-rate swap is entered into with the same 
reference rate, same time to maturity and same nominal amount, and therefore the hedging relationship is 1:1. 
 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged items are hedged directly on the fixed rate of the hedging instruments, which are swapped into a 
floating 3- to 6-month euribor rate, which is included in the bank’s normal risk management.  
 
the carrying amount of the hedging instruments is recognised in the balance sheet under the item “other assets” in the event of a 
positive fair value and under the item “other liabilities” in the event of a negative fair value. 
 
 
 
the hedge effectiveness is determined by comparing the interest element of the total fair value of the hedging instruments with the 
interest element of the total fair value of the hedged items. moreover, the hedge effectiveness is calculated each month and each 
quarter for hedging instruments against the hedged items for the period's gain/loss on the element of interest of the fair value. 
 
 
 
the current portfolio of hedged items will mature over the decade with the last transaction in 2026. the largest number of instruments 
will mature in 2021 (about dkk 7.7 bn) and in 2022-2024 (about dkk 8.5 bn), which is, by far, the largest part of the hedging.  
 
 
 
a minor degree of inefficiency between the hedged items and the hedging instruments can be caused by a difference in the discount 
curves applied. in addition, inefficiency may occur when the recognised carrying amounts are very low. the hedge effectiveness 
recognised in the profit amounted to dkk -19m (2019: dkk 11m) as the gain for the year on hedging instruments amounted to dkk 
46m (2019: dkk 16m) and the loss for the year on hedged items at amortised cost was dkk -65m (2019: dkk -5m).  
 
ibor reform 
ibor rates are quoted in the interbank market for unsecured loans, which since the financial crisis has become an illiquid market. 
therefore, to a great extent, ibor rates are based on estimates. this is one of the reasons for a global reform of the use of interest 
rate benchmarks, including the ibor transition or the ibor reform. today the ibor reform is based on an eu regulation (benchmark 
regulation - bmr). 
 
today ibor rates are used generally to determine cash flows in both derivatives agreements, floating-rate consumer and corporate 
loans as well as mortgage loans. therefore, the interest rates are of crucial importance to the market value of the financial products. in 
its entirety, the ibor reform has the aim that derivatives and loan agreements to a higher degree are to be based on new alternative 
risk-free reference rates (rfr) instead of the current ibor rates. 
 
the new rfr rates are based on transactions in the interbank market on overnight loans contrary to ibor rates that are based on 
estimates. for derivatives transactions, the isda has published new definitions of fallback rates to replace the current ibor rates when 
they are discontinued. the fallback rates are based on rfr rates plus a fixed credit spread. among other things, the rates will be 
retrospective rather than forward-looking. 
 
in the loan markets it is increasingly uncertain how the transition to rfr rates will be secured. it is expected that many of the current 
ibor rates as well as eur eonia will cease to exist as of 2 january 2022. for euribor and scandinavian ibors (cibor, stibor and 
nibor) an expiry date has not yet been set, but instead they have been reformed into a new and bmr-compliant version. liquidity has 
still not been shifted from ibor-based products to new rfr products, but it is clearly expected that this will change in the course of 
2021.

hedge accounting, cont. 
 
 
 
jyske bank has established a task force to lead the bank and its clients through the ibor transition. the task force is to disclose which 
trades are affected by the ibor transition, investigate the economic effect of the transition, inform clients, negotiate changes in the 
contractual basis and secure the handling of the transition in the bank’s it systems. 
 
in respect of derivatives, where the transition has moved the furthest, the bank has, among other things, adjusted the trading system 
to handle derivatives based on the new rfr in eur and usd (eur estr and usd sofr, respectively) and handle the shift on the part of 
the clearing houses to estr in july 2020 and sofr in october 2020. 
 
in respect of agreements, we are re-negotiating the return on collateral under csa agreements. in addition, jyske bank has endorsed 
the isda 2020 ibor fallbacks protocol and the isda 2018 benchmarks supplement protocol, which will ensure robust fallback 
mechanisms when the ibor rates are discontinued. 
 
it is expected that the above will not to any material extent affect market values and hence the results of jyske bank. 
 
the ibor reform and the ensuing changes to the interest rate benchmarks and cash flows are not considered to be of importance for 
the hedging relationship for the hedged items and the hedging instrument. the transactions are hedged in the hedging relationship 1:1, 
and also the transactions are anticipated in mid-2021 to discounted on the basis of the same identical yield curve setup; the 
effectiveness test in the hedging relationship of 80% to 125% will be met. 
 
the table shows the distribution of the hedging instruments according to current reference rates, where jyske bank is primarily in 
euribor. the majority of the hedging instruments nominal value is also euribor, where the timing of these are maturities of 1 - 5 
years.  
 
hedge accounting of currency risk on investments in subsidiaries 
 
until the sale of jyske bank (gibraltar) on 3 april 2020, jyske bank hedged the currency risk on the net investment in the subsidiary 
through forward exchange rate contracts. after the sale of the subsidiary, the forward exchange rate contracts have also been 
disposed of. at the end of 2020, the gross value of the forward exchange rate contracts therefore amounted to dkk 0m (2019: dkk 
706m).  
 
 
 
in 2020, foreign currency translation adjustment of the contracts amounted to dkk 20m (2019: dkk -38m), which was recognised 
under other comprehensive income together with the foreign currency translation adjustment of the hedged items. in 2020, the 
hedging was 100% effective and was determined by comparing the exchange rate adjustment for the year at dkk -20m (2019: dkk 
38m) of the hedged items with the value adjustment of the year at dkk 20m (2019: dkk -38m) of the hedging instruments.

both its clients and the group use derivatives to hedge against and manage market risk. market risk on derivatives is included in the 
group's measurement of market risk. credit risk in connection with derivatives is calculated for each counterparty and is included in 
jyske bank’s overall credit risk management. subject to specific bilateral agreement, netting of the credit risk associated with 
derivatives is undertaken for each counterparty.

liquidity risk 
 
liquidity risk occurs due to funding mismatch in the balance sheet. the group's liquidity risk can primarily be attributed to its bank 
lending activities as loans and advances have a longer contractual duration than its average funding sources. liquidity risks at jyske 
realkredit are limited due to compliance with the balance principle for sdo issues as set out in the mortgage legislation. note 17 
states the remaining time to maturity for a number of assets and liabilities. 
 
 
 
objective and overall setup 
 
the group supervisory board determines the liquidity profile expressed as the balance between the risk level and the group’s costs of 
managing liquidity risk. the risk levels are re-assessed on an on-going basis in consideration of the current market-related and 
economic conditions in denmark and the financial sector.  
 
 
 
the overall development in lending and deposits in the danish banking sector, the rating agencies' assessment of the group's liquidity 
and funding risks as well as changes in statutory requirements will of course cause jyske bank to re-assess which risk levels can be 
deemed satisfactory.  
 
 
 
jyske bank's liquidity management must ensure adequate short- and long-term liquidity so the group can in due time honour its 
payment obligations by having reasonable funding costs. this is ensured through the following objectives and policies:  
 
1. 
a strong and stable deposit basis which ensures stable long-term funding of the group's lending activities; 
 
2. 
continued high credit ratings by international rating agencies; 
 
3. 
permanent access to international capital markets, hence achieving access to a diversified and professional funding base; 
 
4. 
maintenance of a considerable buffer of highly liquid securities reflecting the run-off risk of more volatile price and credit 
sensitive funding sources. the liquidity buffer ensures that jyske bank can withstand the effect of several adverse liquidity 
scenarios. 
 
 
 
organisation, management and monitoring 
 
the group supervisory board has adopted a liquidity policy, which among other things defines specific critical time horizons for the 
group during various adverse stress scenarios. other key ratios include an internal target for lcr, the size and quality of the group’s 
liquidity buffer and the ratio between bank loans and bank deposits. on the basis of the general limits, the group executive board has 
delegated specific operational limits to the operationally responsible officers at jyske bank, who on a daily basis follow and manage the 
group’s liquidity in line with limits and liquidity policies.  
 
 
 
jyske realkredit is subject to liquidity-related restrictions in respect of investment profile in the securities portfolio, repo lending as 
well as money-market placements outside the group to ensure that transactions at jyske realkredit are in line with statutory 
requirements as well as internal guidelines at jyske realkredit and at group level.  
 
 
 
liquidity positions are monitored daily by market risk & models for observance of the delegated limits. liquidity positions that exceed 
the authorised limits are reported immediately according to the business procedure relating to market risks. 
 
 
 
short-term liquidity management 
 
short-term operational liquidity is managed by jyske bank, jyske markets, which is active in the international money markets as a 
trader in all major currencies and related derivatives and as a market-maker in the nordic inter-bank money markets. short-term 
funding in these markets form part of the overall group limits for short-term funding within strategic liquidity management.

strategic liquidity management 
 
strategic liquidity management is embedded in group treasury. this management is based on various balance sheet and financing-
related targets and statements of the group’s liquidity position under various stress scenarios.  
 
 
 
under the stress scenarios applied, payments from the asset side of the liquidity balance sheet are grouped in order of liquidity, 
whereas payments from the financial liabilities side are grouped according to expected run-off risk in various scenarios. the analyses 
are based on the contractual maturity of each individual payment, but they make allowance for the fact that the actual maturities of a 
large part of the balance sheet deviate from the contractual maturities. the analyses therefore apply scenario-specific expectations 
of client behaviour in those cases where contractual maturities are not considered to give a true and fair view of the actual maturities 
of deposits or loans. in relevant stress scenarios, the liquidity buffer is used to cover negative cash flows.  
 
 
 
under the various stress scenarios, both a survival horizon and a horizon regarding compliance with the mandatory lcr requirement 
are determined. the survival horizon is defined as the horizon with which the liquidity buffer will suffice to honour due dates relating to 
financing. group treasury is responsible for ensuring that the group can at all times meet the critical survival horizons in the three 
scenarios used in strategic management: 
 
 
 
• 
institution-specific liquidity scenario (scenario 1): the scenario is based on an isolated incident in the group, which will shake the 
surrounding world's confidence. also, the incident may result in the loss of clients. the scenario also entails that jyske bank’s 
rating is downgraded by one notch. it is, among other things, assumed that the group is entirely cut off from access to the capital 
markets defined as cp, interbank as well as to issues of senior debt and capital instrument. in addition, the group is fast losing a 
significant part of the credit-sensitive client deposits, and it is also facing the risk that the bank must provide additional collateral 
as a derivative counterparty. the target is a horizon of at least 24 months. 
 
  
 
• 
capital market scenario (scenario 2): this scenario is, in actual fact, also a recession scenario. following a long-lasting economic 
slowdown, banks are generally suffering from increasing credit losses and weak earnings. the property market is characterised 
by steep price declines. the surrounding world’s confidence in the banking sector is seriously shaken, with the result that the 
capital market is frozen. the group performs in line with the sector and avoids a downgrade on the part of the rating agencies. 
the group is cut off from the capital markets defined as cp, interbank as well as issues of senior debt and capital instrument. on 
the other hand, deposits with jyske bank are only affected to a modest degree. a decline in property prices totalling 20% over 
two years will entail that jyske realkredit must provide extensive collateral at the capital centres to meet the sdo requirement 
and that, due to turmoil in the capital markets, the need for cas collateral increases. moreover, rising risk aversion in the market 
will have the result that the value of the liquidity reserve is lowered due to widening credit spreads. the target is a horizon of at 
least 18 months. 
 
 
 
• 
combination scenario (scenario 3): this scenario is a combination of the two above ones; in the middle of a deep financial crisis, 
the group is affected by a specific incident that undermines the confidence in the bank, see scenario 1. as the group is affected 
by two incidents at the same time, the rating will be downgraded by two notches, which again adds to a negative liquidity flow. the 
outflow of the scenario is the union of scenario 1 and scenario 2. in addition, it must be assumed that a downgrade by two 
notches in a general market crisis will make it more difficult to find new derivative counterparties. it is therefore anticipated that it 
may be necessary for the group to provide significant (and of a more permanent nature) collateral to new derivative 
counterparties. the target is a horizon of at least 9 months. 
 
 
 
in addition to the targets for survival horizons, the ongoing group reporting also includes the calculated horizon for compliance with 
the statutory lcr requirement. 
 
 
 
liquidity contingency plan 
 
the liquidity contingency plan comes into force if the group can only meet the internally delegated limits at very high costs or is 
ultimately unable to do so within the critical horizons. the contingency plan establishes a wide range of possible actions to strengthen 
the group's liquidity situation. 
 
 
 
in 2020, jyske bank had a very high degree of excess coverage in respect of internally delegated limits and guidelines.

the group's liquidity buffer 
 
the jyske bank group's liquidity buffer is determined as assets that be can sold quickly or put up as collateral for loans, and such assets 
are therefore an efficient source of liquidity. the procurement of secured funding does not depend on jyske bank's creditworthiness, 
but solely on the quality of the assets that can be offered as collateral. only assets that are not applied for the group’s daily operations 
are included. the measurement of the group's liquidity buffer takes into account haircuts of the relevant assets. 
 
 
 
jyske bank’s securities portfolio is, in the internal liquidity management, divided into three groups according to liquidity ratio: 
 
1. 
ultra liquid assets: cash deposits placed with the danish central bank or the ecb with intra-day liquidity effect according to the 
rules of the central banks.  
2. 
very liquid assets: bonds eligible for borrowing transactions in the danish central bank or the ecb. the liquidity value of danish 
government and mortgage bonds as well as covered bonds is determined at market value less the danish central bank’s specific 
haircuts on bonds in connection with borrowing. to this must be added european mortgage bonds and government bonds. the 
liquidity value of these is determined at market value less the ecb’s specific haircuts in connection with borrowing. the internal 
statement of liquidity reserves includes own mortgage bonds and small bond series in line with other mortgage bonds (contrary 
to the lcr buffer). 
3. 
non-eligible assets: consist of other negotiable securities. the realisation period of such assets may vary considerably 
depending on the market - either in the form of sales or borrowing in the private repo market. haircuts are determined at 25%. 
securities in this group consist primarily of assets denominated in currencies other than dkk and eur as well as securitization 
positions in the form of clos.  
 
 
jyske bank has adopted a general policy for the size and quality of its total liquidity buffer, which is adjusted to suit the group's balance 
sheet composition and risk profile. in practice, the liquidity buffer policy implies that the liquidity buffer consists predominantly of 
assets from liquidity groups 1 and 2. 
 
 
 
additional information about liquidity risk is provided in the section ‘liquidity management’ in the management’s review. 
 
 
 
asset encumbrance 
 
asset encumbrance is a natural and inevitable part of the group's daily activities. a large asset encumbrance of the group's assets will, 
however, entail structural subordination of the group's unsecured creditors. to ensure that the group at all times has access to 
unsecured funding, a policy has been established in the area to ensure that asset encumbrance is not extended to any inexpedient 
extent. 
 
 
 
at jyske bank, the following types of asset encumbrance of material extent have been identified: 
 
• 
issuance of sdos 
 
• 
periodical short-term financing from danmarks nationalbank and the ecb 
 
• 
repo financing  
 
• 
derivatives and clearing activities. 
 
 
 
issuance of sdos is the most important asset encumbrance of jyske realkredit a/s. issuance of sdos is a long-term and strategically 
important instrument to ensure stable and attractive funding.  
 
 
 
the group does not wish to be structurally dependent on financing of its activities with central banks, and appropriate liquidity 
management takes place to avoid such financing. on the other hand, short-term loans cannot be ruled out in the event of major 
unexpected shifts in liquidity and are considered a natural last resort.  
 
 
 
participation in the repo market for institutional clients and other financial institutions forms an integral part of the business model of 
jyske markets. it is the policy that such repo transactions are covered by collateral agreements (csa) so the group does not assume 
credit risk through such transactions. repo transactions are solely carried out on liquid assets where the market price can be observed 
in the market. also, repo transactions are included as a natural element of the management of the group's liquidity buffer. even 
though repo transactions form an important element in jyske markets, these can fairly quickly be scaled up or down. 
 
 
 
derivatives and clearing activities involve asset encumbrance via agreements on provision of financial collateral. the group strives to 
ensure that collateral is primarily received and given through cash but includes also provision of collateral in the form of bonds.

operational risk 
 
the group is exposed to potential losses as a result of operational risks, including inexpedient processes, human errors, it errors as 
well as fraud. operational risk relates to all internal processes and can therefore not be eliminated.  
 
 
 
the group monitors and actively manages operational risk to reduce the risk of operational events resulting in material loss and 
damage to the group’s reputation. 
 
 
 
objective and overall setup 
 
jyske bank's group supervisory board sets out a policy for operational risk, which states the framework for identification, assessment, 
monitoring and management of the operational risk as well as the group supervisory board's risk profile for the area.  
 
 
 
the purpose of the policy is to keep operational risks at an acceptable level in respect of the group's overall objectives and the cost 
associated with reducing the risks. therefore, the group supervisory board has laid down a number of principles for the set-up and 
management of the group where, among other things, attention must be paid to sufficient resources, it support of material work 
processes, due separation of functions as well as stable development and operational processes.  
 
 
 
management and monitoring 
 
developments in operational risk are monitored to ensure the best possible basis for risk management. monitoring is based on 
continuous dialogue with management to ensure that all the material operational risks of the group are reflected in the risk scenarios. 
risk scenarios, risk exposure and control environment are evaluated annually in cooperation with the business units. 
 
  
 
in addition to the monitoring of potential risks in the form of the risk scenarios, registration takes place in the group of all operational 
errors or incidents that caused losses or gains in excess of dkk 5,000. each registration includes information about the incident, for 
instance about product, work process and cause of error. data are used for analysis and reporting with a view to optimising processes 
and reducing future losses. 
 
 
 
the group executive board and the relevant business unit directors are in charge of operational risk management. this management 
is an integral part of daily operations through business procedures and controls established with the object of securing the best 
possible processing environment. on the basis of scenario analyses and regular reporting of the group's operational risks, 
management considers the group's risk exposure on an ongoing basis and decides whether to introduce initiatives to reduce 
operational risks.  
 
 
 
every quarter, the group executive board and the group supervisory board receive a comprehensive report that describes the 
development of the group’s operational risks accompanied by error statistics from the error registry. non-compliance with 
established risk targets will also be reported.

transactions between related parties are characterised as ordinary financial transactions and services of an operational nature. jyske 
bank a/s and jyske realkredit a/s have entered into an agreement on joint funding and an agreement on outsourcing. transactions 
related to these agreements are eliminated in the group. 
 
 
 
transactions between jyske bank and group enterprises and associates as well as joint ventures are entered into on an arm’s length or 
at cost. the transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. transactions between jyske bank and other related parties were executed 
on an arm’s length basis. this also holds for the rates of interest and commission charges. 
 
 
 
jyske bank a/s's pensionstilskudsfond is a fund which offers supplementary pensions to current and former members of jyske bank's 
executive board and their surviving relatives. pension liabilities are actuarial items based on a number of assumptions, cf. also note 37 
on pension provisions. at an unchanged discount rate, jyske bank's executive board earned additional retirement remuneration of dkk 
2m in 2020 (2019: dkk 1m), cf. note 12.

new clients or, alternatively, sold within the next 12 months. 
 
 
 
 
 
description of risks and uncertainty relating to estimation of residual values 
 
the group has assumed risks relating to the residual value of its holding of operating lease agreements. 
 
 
 
the measurement of the group’s property, plant and equipment relating to operating lease agreements is subject to some uncertainty, 
which can be attributed to a number of external market effects as well as the group’s own estimates of future circumstances. this is in 
particular related to the expected cash flows from the lease agreements in connection with the assets, and in particular cash flows from 
the subsequent sale of the assets and the circumstances related to this. 
 
 
 
the accounting residual values are set at the market value at which the object is expected to have at the expiry of the agreement. the 
actual market value is, however, only finally known at the time of sale, and therefore, to a great extent, the establishment of residual 
values relies on professional estimates based on experience, market trends, etc. sales prices of the objects are strongly affected by the 
supply/demand situation in the danish and european car market, including industry trends as regards fuel preferences, bodywork, level 
of equipment, etc. 
 
 
 
in addition, the expected net sales price is affected by prepayment patterns for the group’s private lease agreements in denmark, as 
expectations of these contribute to deciding the expected time of sale. moreover, the net sales price is also affected by the rate of 
turnover measured from the time of the return of the object to the sale and possibly other future income as well as expenses relating to 
the realisation/contract expiry, etc. 
 
 
 
risk management strategy 
 
the group monitors continuously whether the established residual values of the contracts in progress match the estimated realisation 
price, and whether other circumstances also indicate indication of impairment. this takes place in close connection with the ongoing 
pricing of new campaigns, and whether the residual values established for running campaigns are still appropriate and correct. 
 
 
 
the above task has been assigned dedicated employee and management resources and also it applications that assists in the ongoing 
monitoring of the picture of risk. 
 
 
 
in addition to the above, the group also works continuously to build new sales channels and also to enhance the logistics, preparation 
and repair set-up with a view to obtaining the best possible net sales prices.

accounting policies 
basis of accounting 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as adopted by the eu. the financial statements of the parent 
company have been presented in accordance with the danish 
financial business act, including the danish executive order on 
financial reports for credit institutions, stockbrokers, etc. 
furthermore, the annual report has been prepared in accordance 
with the danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed 
financial institutions. 
 
additional danish reporting requirements for the consolidated 
financial statements are laid down in the executive order on ifrs 
relating to financial institutions in accordance with the danish 
financial business act and in the rules laid down by nasdaq 
copenhagen a/s, and for the parent’s financial statements in 
accordance with the danish financial business act and in the rules laid 
down by nasdaq copenhagen a/s. 
 
the rules applying to recognition and measurement at the parent are 
consistent with ifrs.  
 
figures in the annual report are in danish kroner, rounded to the 
nearest million in danish kroner.  
 
changes to accounting policies, new and changed standards as well 
as interpretation 
changes to ias 39, ifrs 9 and ifrs 7, ”reform of reference rates” was 
implemented as of 1 january 2020 with the purpose of reducing the 
potential risks associated with “hedge accounting” during the 
transition period until the new reference rates have been fully phased 
in. the change, which is described in detail in note 58 to the 
consolidated accounts, resulted in a stricter duty of disclosure but has 
no effect on the net profit for the year, comprehensive income, 
balance sheet or equity in 2020, and the future effect is expected to 
be insignificant.  
 
changes to ias 1 and ias 8 “definition of materiality” was 
implemented on 1 january 2020 and include a series of clarifications 
as to whether a matter is material in relation to the basis of decision of 
a user of financial statements. the change did not have any effect on 
the financial reporting. 
 
changes to ifrs 3 “business combinations” was implemented as of 1 
january 2020 and concern a clarification whether a transaction is a 
purchase of a company or a group of assets that do not constitute a 
company. the change does not affect the net profit for the year, 
comprehensive income, balance sheet or equity. 
 
change to ifrs16 “leasing” was implemented on 1 june 2020 and 
concerns the accounting treatment of workout agreements on lease 
payment from the lessee due to the covid-19 pandemic. the 
change did not affect the financial statements.  
 
apart from the above changes, accounting policies are unchanged 
compared to the annual report for 2019. 
 
accounting standards and interpretation that have not taken effect 
at the time of publication of this financial report, a number of new or 
amended standards and interpretations had been adopted yet not 
come into force or been approved for use in the eu. it is not expected 
that these will have any material impact on jyske bank's financial 
reporting. 
 
ifrs 17 “insurance contracts” (approved for use in the eu, active as 
from 1 january 2021). 
 
in addition, a number of minor changes, including ”reform of 
reference rates” in phase 2 (ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 7, ifrs 4, ifrs 16) as 
well as ifrs 3, ifrs 16 and ias 37 and annual improvements 2018-
2020, which have not yet taken effect or have been approved by the 
eu.  
it is not expected that the above will affect jyske bank's financial 
reporting to any material degree. 
 
recognition and measurement 
assets under the control of the jyske bank group as a result of past 
events are recognised in the balance sheet when it is deemed 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the group and the 
asset value can be measured reliably. liabilities as a result of past 
events are recognised in the balance sheet when it is deemed that 
redemption will result in the relinquishment of future economic 
benefits and the amount of the liability can be measured reliably. 
 
at the initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at fair 
value, and for assets and liabilities that are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, directly attributable transaction costs paid will be 
added, and directly attributable transaction costs received will be 
deducted. subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as 
described for each item below.  
 
recognition and measurement take into account gains, losses and 
risks that occurred prior to the presentation date of the annual 
report and that confirm or disprove conditions which existed on the 
balance sheet date. 
 
income is recognised in the income statement as earned. incurred 
expenses that relate directly to the generation of the year’s earnings 
are recognised in the income statement. value adjustment of financial 
assets, financial liabilities and derivatives is recognised in the income 
statement with the exception of value adjustment of instruments 
entered into with a view to hedging net investment in associates and 
group enterprises abroad. the latter value adjustment is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
 
financial instruments are recognised at the date of settlement, and 
the recognition ceases when the right to receive or deliver cash flows 
from the financial instrument has expired, or if the financial instrument 
has been transferred, and the group has essentially transferred all 
risks and returns associated with the ownership. 
 
accounting estimates 
measurement of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
requires the management’s estimate of the influence of future events 
on the value of such assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date. 
estimates of material importance to the presentation of the accounts 
are, among other things, based on 
 
• 
loans, including loan impairment charges; 
• 
fair value of financial instruments; 
• 
provisions, including provisions for defined benefit liabilities, 
losses on guarantees, lawsuits, etc.  
 
the estimates are based on assumptions which management finds 
reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. besides, the group is 
subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ 
from those estimates. key assumptions and any specific risks to 
which the group is exposed are stated in the management's review 
and the notes. 
 
loan impairment charges and provisions for guarantees are subject 
to significant estimates as regards the quantification of the risk that 
future payments may not all be received. where it is established that 
not all future payments will be received, the determination of the 
extent of anticipated payments, including specification of scenarios, 
risk classification, realisable values of security provided and 
anticipated dividend payments by estates, will also be subject to 
significant estimates. the division of loans and advances, etc. into 
stages 1, 2 or 3 is subject to significant estimates, which is decisive

when determining whether a loss expected in the 12-month term or 
an expected loss in the entire term of the loan is to be recognised. in a 
number of instances, it is necessary to supplement the model-
calculated impairment charges in stages 1, 2 and 3 with a 
management's estimate. this will typically be the case when social 
events are assessed to affect the level of impairment, yet these 
events have not yet been picked up by the group’s credit models. due 
to the covid-19 pandemic, the uncertainty relating to the estimates 
applied has increased. 
 
the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments is subject 
to significant estimates of the fair value in a non-active market. fair 
value is recognised on the basis of observable market data and 
recognised value assessment techniques, which include discounted 
cash flow models and models for the pricing of options. input variables 
include observable market data, including non-listed yield curves, 
exchange rates and volatility curves. unlisted shares are recognised at 
an estimated fair value on the basis of the available budget and 
accounting figures of the issuer in question or at management’s best 
estimate. 
 
provisions for defined benefit pension plans, etc. are subject to 
significant estimates with regard to the determination of future 
employee turnover, discount rate, the rate of wage and salary 
increase, and the return on associated assets. provisions for pension 
liabilities, etc. are based on actuary calculations and estimates. 
moreover, provisions for losses on guarantees are subject the 
uncertainty of assessing the extent to which guarantees may be 
called upon as a consequence of the financial collapse of the 
guarantee applicant. the calculation of other provisions are subject to 
significant estimates with regard to the determination of the 
probability and to which extent a possible obligating event may and will 
result in a future drain on jyske bank’s economic resources. 
 
hedge accounting 
the group hedges the interest-rate risk on a portfolio of liabilities as 
well as the foreign currency translation risk of its subsidiaries. 
 
subsequent value adjustments of derivatives that are classified as and 
meet the requirements for hedging the fair value of a recognised 
fixed-rate liability are recognised in the income statement together 
with the value adjustment of the hedged liability, dependent of 
interest rate levels. if the criteria for hedging are no longer met, the 
accumulated valuation of the hedged item is amortised over the 
remaining maturity period.  
 
subsequent value adjustment of derivatives applied towards the 
hedging of net investments in international subsidiaries, and which 
effectively offer protection against exchange rate fluctuations in 
respect of those companies, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income under a separate currency translation reserve. the inefficient 
part is recognised in the income statement at once. if the foreign 
enterprise is disposed of, the accumulated changes in value are 
transferred to the income statement. 
 
the consolidated financial statements  
the consolidated financial statements cover the financial statements 
for jyske bank a/s and the companies controlled by jyske bank a/s. 
control is achieved when jyske bank a/s 
 
• 
has control of another company, 
• 
has the possibility of or the has the right to a variable return on 
its investment, and 
• 
is able to use its control to obtain such return. 
 
the group reassesses whether it controls a company if the situation 
and circumstances indicate changes to one or more of the three 
above elements. 
 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared by adding 
up the financial statements of jyske bank a/s and those of its  
 
 
subsidiaries, which were prepared in accordance with the group’s 
accounting policies. intra-group credit and debit items, intra-group 
share holdings, commitments and guarantees have been eliminated. 
 
intra-group transactions 
intra-group transactions are entered into on an arm's length basis or 
at cost. 
 
business combinations 
assets, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on the date of 
acquisition. a positive difference between the cost and the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. a negative 
difference between the cost and the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets is recognised as negative goodwill under other operating 
income in the income statement.  
 
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are recognised in 
the consolidated income statement at the time when the controlling 
interest is transferred to the group, and cease to be consolidated 
from the time when the controlling interest ceases to exist.  
 
transaction costs are recognised in the income statement.  
 
translation of foreign currency amounts at consolidation  
balance-sheet items relating to the bank's foreign subsidiaries are 
translated at year-end exchange rates for balance sheet items and at 
average exchange rates for income statement items. changes in the 
value of opening equity due to exchange-rate movements during the 
year are recognised in other comprehensive income under currency 
translation reserve. differences between translation at year-end and 
at average exchange rates are included in other comprehensive 
income under currency translation reserve. 
 
foreign currency transactions 
transactions in currencies other than danish kroner are translated at 
the official exchange rates on the day of the transactions. unsettled 
monetary transactions in foreign currencies on the balance-sheet 
date are translated at the official exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. for listed currencies, the published bid and offer prices from 
external suppliers will be applied. 
 
non-monetary assets and liabilities acquired in a foreign currency, 
which are not restated at fair value, are not subject to translation 
adjustments. in connection with a non-monetary asset, the fair value 
of which exceeds that stated in the income statement, unrealised 
translation adjustments are recognised in the income statement. 
 
foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the profit of the 
year, with the exception of exchange-rate adjustments related to 
non-monetary assets and liabilities, where changes in the fair value 
are recognised in other comprehensive income, and exchange rate 
hedging of net investments in international subsidiaries where the 
exchange rate adjustment is recognised in other comprehensive 
income as well.  
 
offsetting 
assets and liabilities are offset when the jyske bank group has a legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts and also intends to net or 
realise the asset and settle the liability at the same time.

leasing contracts  
a leased asset and a lease liability is recognised in the balance sheet 
when , according to a lease agreement entered into, a leased asset is 
made available to the group for a lease period, and when the group 
has the right of practically all the economic benefits from the use of 
the identified asset and the right to decide on the use of this. 
 
lease liabilities are measured at the initial recognition at the net 
present value of the future leasing payments discounted at an 
alternative interest rate, which will amount to the cost relating 
externally financing of a corresponding asset. subsequently, the lease 
liability is measured at amortised cost in accordance with the effective 
interest method. the lease liability is recalculated when changes take 
place in the underlying contractual cash flows, if changes take place in 
the estimate of the residual value guarantee, or if the group changes 
its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain that an option to 
purchase, extend or cancel is expected to be utilised. 
 
at initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at cost, which 
corresponds to the value of the lease liability adjusted for prepaid 
leasing payments plus directly related costs. subsequently, the leased 
asset is measured at cost less accumulated impairment and 
depreciation. leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
leasing period or the useful life of the leased asset. the depreciation is 
recognised in the income statement by the straight line method. 
leased assets are adjusted for changes in the lease liability due to 
changes in the terms and conditions of the lease agreement or 
changes in the cash flows of the contract. 
 
leased assets are depreciated by the straight-line method over the 
expected lease period, which amounts to: 
 
properties  
5-10 years 
cars  
3-5 years  
 
the leased asset and the lease liability are stated in the notes. 
 
the group does not recognise short-term lease agreements in the 
balance sheet. instead lease payments relating to such lease 
agreements are recognised in the income statement by the straight-
line method. 
 
assets that are leased at financial lease terms and conditions are 
recognised, measured and presented as loans and advances.  
 
hence assets that are leased at operating lease terms and conditions 
are recognised and presented like the group’s other assets of a 
similar type. income from operating lease agreements is recognised 
by the straight-line method over the relevant leasing period under 
other operating income. 
 
tax 
jyske bank a/s is assessed for danish tax purposes jointly with its 
danish subsidiaries. tax on the year’s income is divided among the 
danish enterprises according to the full costing method. domestic 
corporation tax is paid in accordance with the danish tax prepayment 
scheme.  
 
tax comprises calculated tax and any change in deferred tax as well as 
the readjustment of tax for previous years. calculated tax is based on 
the year’s taxable income. deferred tax is recognised and measured in 
accordance with the balance-sheet liability method on the basis of the 
differences between the carrying amounts and tax values of assets 
and liabilities. overall, deferred tax liabilities are recognised on the 
basis of temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is deemed probable that taxable 
income exists against which deductible temporary differences may be 
offset. such assets and liabilities are not recognised where the 
temporary difference is due to goodwill.  
 
 
 
 
 
provisions are not made in the balance sheet for tax payable on the 
sale of an investment in subsidiaries or associates, if the investment is 
not expected to be disposed of within a short period of time, or if a 
sale is planned so that there is no tax liability. 
 
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates applicable during the 
financial year in which the liability is settled, or the asset is realised. 
deferred tax is recognised in the income statement, unless it is 
associated with items which are carried as expenses or income 
directly in other comprehensive income, in which case deferred tax is 
recognised in other comprehensive income as well. deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset where attributable to tax levied by the 
same tax authority, and where it is the intention of the group to net its 
current tax assets and liabilities. 
 
financial guarantees 
financial guarantees are contracts according to which the group 
must pay certain amounts to the holder of the guarantee as 
compensation for a loss incurred, because a certain debtor did not 
make a payment on time according to the terms and conditions of the 
debt instrument. 
 
financial guarantee obligations are the first time recognised at fair 
value, and the initial fair value is accrued over the lifetime of the 
guarantee. subsequently, the guarantee obligation will be recognised 
at the higher one of the value on an accrual basis or the present value 
of expected payments when a payments under the guarantee has 
become likely. 
 
for the method for provisions for losses on guarantees, please see 
loans at amortised cost. provisions for losses on loan commitments 
and unutilised loan commitments are made according to the same 
method.

balance sheet 
according to ifrs 9, classification and measurement of financial 
assets are based on the business model for the financial assets and 
related contractual cash flows. in consequence of this, financial assets 
must be classified as one of the following categories: 
 
• 
financial assets that are held to generate the contractual cash 
flows and where the contractual cash flows solely consist of 
interest and instalments on the outstanding amounts are 
measured after the time of the initial recognition at amortised 
cost. as a typical example, this measurement category 
comprises loans, advances and bonds included in an investment 
portfolio that is in general held to maturity. 
 
• 
financial assets held in a mixed business model where financial 
assets are held both with a view to generating the contractual 
cash flows and returns on sales and where the contractual cash 
flows on the financial assets in the mixed business model solely 
consist of interest and instalments on the outstanding amount 
are measured after the time of the initial recognition at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. in connection with a 
subsequent sale, recirculation of the change in fair value will take 
place to the income statement. as a typical example, this 
measurement category comprises bonds included in the day-
to-day liquidity management, unless they are used by a risk 
management system or an investment strategy based on fair 
values, cf. below.  
 
• 
financial assets that do not belong under one of the above-
mentioned business models or where the contractual cash flows 
do not solely consist of interest and instalments on the 
outstanding amounts are measured after the time of the initial 
recognition at fair value through the income statement. as a 
typical example, this measurement category comprises shares, 
derivatives and financial assets, which are otherwise included in 
the trading portfolio or in a risk management system or an 
investment strategy based on fair values and, on this basis, are 
included in the bank's internal management reporting. moreover, 
financial assets can be measured at fair value through the 
income statement, if the measurement according to the two 
above-mentioned business models results in a recognition or 
accounting mismatch. 
 
jyske bank has no financial assets that fall under the measurement 
category with recognition of financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income. instead, jyske bank's bond portfolio is 
measured at fair value through the income statement either because 
they are included in a trading portfolio, or because they are used by a 
risk management system or an investment strategy based on fair 
values and are, on this basis, included in the bank's internal 
management reporting, except for a holding of bonds that is held 
under a business model where the bonds will be measured at 
amortised cost. 
 
due from credit institutions and central banks 
initially, balances due from credit institutions and central banks are 
recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs less 
fees and commissions received which are directly associated with the 
amount due. subsequently, balances due from banks and central 
banks are measured at amortised cost in accordance with the 
effective interest method, less impairment charges, cf. below. 
 
loans and advances at fair value 
mortgage loans are recognised according to the trade date approach 
and classified as ‘loans at fair value’. mortgage loans are measured at 
fair value on initial and subsequent recognition through the income 
statement. this takes place to eliminate financial inconsistency 
resulting from the purchase and sale of own issued bonds. index-
linked loans are measured on the basis of the index value at the end of 
the year. the fair value is generally measured at prices of the 
underlying issued bonds quoted on a recognised stock exchange.  
 
 
 
 if such a market price is not available for the preceding 7 days, a 
calculated price based on the official market rate will be applied for 
determining the value. if derivatives are part of the funding of the 
mortgage loans, the value of these will be integrated in the valuation 
of the loans. 
 
the fair value is reduced by the calculated impairment charge, which 
for loans at fair value is measured according to the same principles 
that apply to impairments of loans and advances at amortised cost. in 
connection with all loans and advances at initial recognition and all 
loans and advances without any significant increase in credit risk, a 
calculation of expected losses over the coming 12 months is made, 
while in connection with all loans and advances with a significant 
increase in credit risk, impairment charges corresponding to the 
expected losses over the remaining term are recognised. please see 
the description of accounting policies for impairment charges under 
loans and advances at amortised cost. 
 
loans and advances at amortised cost  
initially, loans and advances are recognised at fair value plus directly 
attributable transaction costs, less fees and commission received 
which are directly associated with the granting of loans. subsequently, 
loans and advances are measured at amortised cost in accordance 
with the effective interest method.  
 
stages for development of credit risk 
in connection with all loans and advances, impairment charges are 
recognised according to ifrs 9. the impairment model is based on 
calculations of expected losses where the loans are divided into three 
stages depending on the individual loan’s credit impairment relative to 
the initial recognition: 
 
1. 
loans with no significant increase in credit risk 
2. 
loans with significant increase in credit risk 
3. 
credit-impaired loans. 
 
for loans in stage 1, impairment charges corresponding to the 
expected loss over the following 12 months are recognised, while for 
loans in stages 2 and 3, impairment charges corresponding to 
expected losses over the remaining life of the exposures are 
recognised. at the initial recognition, the individual loans are generally 
placed in stage 1, which means that impairment charges 
corresponding to the expected losses over the following 12 months 
are recognised.  
 
loans with a very low probability of default (pd below 0.2%) and 
without any other indications of significant increases in the credit risk 
are considered having a low credit risk and are placed in stage 1 
regardless of the probability of default since the initial recognition.

for loans and advances in stage 2, an expected loss over the 
remaining term of the loan is calculated. assessment of whether the 
credit risk has increased for individual loans and advances, the ranking 
of loans and advances into stages and the statement of expected 
take place on a quarterly basis. 
 
the ranking in the various stages will affect the calculation method 
applied, and it is determined, among other things, on the basis of the 
change in the probability of default (pd) over the expected remaining 
life of the loans. loans and advances in stage 3 are considered credit-
impaired and are classified with risk code 2 or 3, as, under the most 
likely scenario, a loss is expected. there are only minor differences 
between the definition of default and the accounting treatment of 
credit-impaired loans and advances (stage 3), as account managers 
and/or credit specialists - following a specific assessment of the 
client's financial circumstances - may reclassify clients past due more 
than 90 days (default) to stage 2, if it is documented that the reason 
why the client is in arrears is not financial difficulties. hence, to a high 
degree, the accounting treatment of the loan reflects the current 
financial assessments of the client’s circumstances. 
 
in connection with the group’s implementation of the new default 
guidelines (eba/gl/2016/07) issued by the eba, it is the aim of the 
group to align the entry criteria for default, stage 3 and non-
performing. various periods of quarantine apply to the individual 
concepts, and therefore the exit criteria vary. 
 
for detailed definitions of default, credit deterioration and risk 
classifications applied, please see note 50, the section on risk 
classifications on page 78. 
 
assessment of significant increase in credit risk 
in the event of a significant increase in credit risk, loans and advances 
will be transferred to stage 2. assessment of whether any significant 
increase in credit risk has taken place since the initial recognition is 
based on the following circumstances: 
 
1. 
an increase in the pd for the expected remaining life of the 
financial asset by 100% and an increase in the 12-month 
pd of 0.5 percentage point when, at the initial recognition, 
the 12-month pd was below 1.0%. 
 
2. 
an increase in the pd for the expected remaining life of the 
financial asset by 100% or an increase in the 12-month pd 
of 2.0 percentage points when, at the initial recognition, the 
12-month pd was 1.0% or above. 
 
3. 
loans in arrears by 30 days or more. 
 
4. 
the account manager's risk assessment (risk 
classification), which among other things is based on an 
assessment of the client's ability and will to honour his 
payment obligations, possible arrears and/or changes to 
the initial assumptions on which the client relationship rests 
for instance, the development of a client's financial 
circumstances will be followed and assessed (income, 
assets/financial position, liquidity, leverage, any arrears, 
etc.). 
 
clients for which the credit risk has increased significantly and with a 
probability of default (pd above 5%) will be placed in the weak part of 
stage 2 together with loans and advances that have been classified 
with risk code 1 and with objective evidence of impairment. for loans 
and advances subject to objective evidence of impairment in stage 2, 
impairment charges will be calculated according to the principles 
applicable to loans and advances in stage 3.  
 
if the group’s most likely scenario points to losses, the client is 
considered credit-impaired and will be ranked in stage 3. 
 
 
 
 
hence, the group’s most important credit management tools are 
used directly in the segmentation and the determination of the  
expected future credit loss. please see note 50 on risk classification, 
credit rating process and monitoring. 
 
statement of expected losses 
the expected future loss is calculated on the basis of the probability 
of default (pd), the exposure at default (ead) and the loss given 
default (lgd). these parameters rest on the group's advanced irb 
set-up, which is based on the bank's experience of loss history and 
early repayment, among other things. these parameters are adjusted 
to ifrs 9 in a number of specific areas. the purpose of the 
adjustments is to ensure that the parameters reflect a current as well 
as true and fair picture that comprises available information and 
expectations of the future, including the group’s expectations of the 
real economy trends in gdp, unemployment, house prices, etc. 
hence the parameters are adjusted to cover a longer time horizon. 
the projection allows for client-specific circumstances such as client 
segment, credit rating, industry, etc. advanced quantitative credit 
models are applied to all clients in stages 1 and 2 for which there is no 
evidence of credit impairment. 
 
the covid-19 outbreak and economic consequences derived from 
this affect the calculation of the expected future loss. to define the 
increased risk from this, the effects are quantified according to the 
following method: 
 
1. 
for clients with no oei classification, the effect of the 
increasing probability of default (pd) and the expected 
development of property prices are analysed. 
2. 
quantification of non-linear effects in scenario-specific 
impairment calculations (sensitivities relating to the base 
line scenario) 
3. 
increased risk of lack of identification of unhealthy 
exposures due to liquidity from government rescue 
packages. 
 
on the whole, this results in an additional indication of impairment of 
dkk 1,200m, of which dkk 1,090m relate to the effects derived from 
the covid-19 outbreak.  
 
(1) based on observed default levels in combination with macro-
economic forecasts, updated levels for the probability of default (pd) 
is estimated. in addition, expectations of the development of property 
prices are updated. the levels are continuously reassessed, among 
other things, in connection with updates of macro-economic 
forecasts from danmarks nationalbank, the central bank of denmark, 
and internal analyses. based on the updated input parameters, a 
complete recalculation of the expected loss is performed. currently 
this gives rise an additional indication of impairment of dkk 550m for 
the jyske bank group. the amount is recognised as a management's 
estimate of an increase in impairment charges.  
 
(2) the macro-economic forecasts are very much affected by the 
development of covid-19 cases and the level of restrictions. this 
development is very dynamic and associated with heightened 
uncertainty in the current situation. therefore, analyses are 
performed based on several scenarios. this is done with a view to 
assessment of the sensitivity relating to the most probable scenario 
(base line scenario) and with a view to quantification of non-linear 
effects from scenario-specific impairment calculations.  
 
four scenarios are used, based on the group’s expectations of the 
macro-economic development (good, base-line, weak and hard).  
the scenarios are based on forecasts prepared by a unit of the bank, 
which is independent of the impairment process. the ‘hard’ scenario 
is in line with the scenario used in the group’s internal stress tests. for 
each scenario, the probability of default (pd) and the value of 
securities are recalculated. hence it is ensured that the results of

the models are balanced. the impairment effect of the scenarios is 
calculated by weighting the results against the assessed event 
probability, which is defined by management.  
 
macro-economic scenarios and event probability are reviewed at 
least once a year. the spread of covid-19 has had a significant effect 
on these scenarios, and therefore the analysis has been updated on 
the background of this. on the whole, due to the scenario calculation, 
this results in additional impairment charges of dkk 140m (dkk 110m 
in 2019). this is an increase of dkk +30m compared to the 
calculations in 2019. hence this increase can be indirectly attributed 
to effects derived from covid-19. the amount is recognised as a 
management's estimate of an increase in impairment charges.  
 
the increase was primarily caused by a higher additional indication of 
impairment in the scenario, which is weaker than the most likely 
scenario as well as a minor discount in the scenario, which is better 
than the base line scenario. in addition, the additional indication of 
impairment falls in the scenario “hard” due to a significantly 
deteriorated base line scenario. the results related to the respective 
scenarios is calculated based on the stage segmentation in the base-
line scenario and is summarised in the following table:

the probability of the hardest scenario materialising is maintained at 
10%, while the other scenarios are allocated identical probability 
weights. this is assessed to be true and fair due to the uncertainty 
relating to the outcome space. the severity of the scenarios good, 
base-line, weak has been increased significantly compared to the 
calculations at the end of 2019. the results in the above table can be 
used for sensitivity analysis of the portfolio. for example, the 
additional impairment charges would increase to dkk 260m if the 
scenario weak is assigned a 100% probability. 
 
(3) the progress of the pandemic leads to uncertainty about the 
depth and the length of the economic setback. naturally, government 
rescue packages will support healthy and unhealthy exposures, which 
makes it more difficult to identify unhealthy exposures. in the current 
situation, it is more difficult to identify weak clients at an early stage 
due to the large support packages from the government. in 2020, the 
group conducted a number of portfolio and client surveys with a view 
to assessing the change in credit risk. only to a limited extent did the 
surveys give rise to a downgrade of risk classification. it is assessed, 
however, that an effect of the rescue packages is that of concealing 
the actual position of a number of clients. therefore, it is likely that 
currently the portfolio includes unhealthy exposures that have not yet 
been identified. in order to address this risk, a sensitivity analysis has 
been performed of the expected loss under a scenario where a part of 
the portfolio migrates to higher stages. in addition, allowance is made 
for risk that the collateral values for these may be overestimated. 
naturally, the analysis is associated with great uncertainty due to the 
extraordinary situation. consequently, an amount of dkk 510m was 
recognised as a management's estimate of an increase in impairment 
charges. 
 
for most loans, the expected time to maturity is limited to the 
contractual time to maturity. however, for mortgage loans, 
allowances are made for expected early repayment. for revolving 
credit facilities, the expected remaining term is based on analyses of 
the term for credit-impaired clients. if a loan is secured in full in all 
scenarios, the impairment charge will generally be zero. this will  
 
 
 
 
typically be the case with exposures with a high overcollateralisation 
and/or fixed-value collaterals such as cash fixed properties. 
 
the assessment of the indication of impairment for the weakest 
exposures in stages 2 and 3 is based on individual expert assessments 
of the probability-weighted expected loss. expert assessments are 
made in sub-portfolios divided on group units and relevant industry 
groups. in connection with the most important loans, an individual 
assessment of the scenarios are made, including definition of cash 
flows, security values and scenario probability. at the individual 
assessment, up to 13 scenarios are applied. 
 
no significant changes were made to the impairment set-up during 
the financial year. 
 
in addition to the calculations, a management's assessment is 
performed of the models and the ability of the expert-assessed 
impairment calculations to take expectations of the future 
development into consideration. to the extent that it is assessed that 
circumstances and risks are not included in the models, an addition to 
the impairment calculations is made which is based a management's 
estimate. this estimate is based on specific observations and is 
calculated on the basis of the expected risks of the specific sub-
portfolios.  
 
loans are written off as a loss when there are no reasonable 
prospects of collecting the debt. indications of this are, for instance 
bankruptcy and debt rescheduling. the group still seeks to collect 
debts even though they are written off as losses. 
 
bonds at fair value 
bonds are recognised at fair value, which is the amount at which the 
bonds can be bought or sold in a transaction between independent 
parties. in an active market, the fair value is expressed in the form of a 
listed price. in a less active or inactive market, the fair value is 
determined on the basis of a value calculated by a model based on 
observable market data and recognised models, alternatively on the 
basis of the management’s estimate corresponding to this. 
 
bonds at amortised cost 
bonds at amortised cost include investments whose price is listed in 
an active market and which were acquired with the object of earning a 
return until maturity. they are measured initially at fair value 
corresponding to the sum paid plus directly attributable transaction 
costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
 
impairment charges are made in the same way as for loans and 
advances at amortised cost. if impairment charges cannot be 
measured reliably, fair value in the form of an observed market price is 
chosen.  
 
repos and reverse repos 
securities sold under repurchase agreements (repos) remain in the 
balance sheet under securities, carry interest and are subject to value 
adjustment. amounts received are recognised as balances due to or 
from credit institutions. 
 
securities bought under reverse repurchase agreements (reverse 
repos) are recognised as loans and advances or balances due from 
credit institutions at amortised cost, and the return is recognised 
under interest income. 
 
financial instruments, trading portfolio 
financial instruments included in the trading portfolio are instruments 
which have been acquired with a view to generating a profit from 
short-term price or margin fluctuations, or instruments included in a 
portfolio characterised by short-term profit-taking.

assets in the trading portfolio comprise money-market instruments, 
other instruments of debt including acquired loans and equity 
instruments held by the group. liabilities in the trading portfolio 
comprise liabilities to deliver money market instruments, other debt 
instruments and equity instruments sold short by the group to a third 
party. upon initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at 
fair value with subsequent value adjustment in the income statement. 
 
for initial and subsequent recognition, shares in sector-owned

the basis of a value calculated by a model based on observable market 
data and recognised models, alternatively on the basis of the 
management’s estimate corresponding to this. 
 
the fair value of unlisted shares and other equity investments is 
calculated on the basis of available information about transactions, 
expected cash flows, etc. if a reliable fair value cannot be determined, 
shares will be recognised at cost less any impairment. 
 
investments in associates 
an associate is an enterprise in which the group holds a significant but 
not controlling interest, by participating in the company’s financial and 
operational decision-making process, and which does not qualify as a 
subsidiary. a controlling interest is typically achieved when the group 
holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.  
 
equity investments in associates are recognised and measured in the 
consolidated accounts and the accounts of the parent company 
according to the equity method. accordingly, the equity investments 
are measured at the pro rata share of the associates’ equity value 
calculated in accordance with the group’s accounting policies with 
deduction or addition of unrealised intra-group profits and losses, 
respectively, and with the addition of the carrying amount of goodwill. 
  
the pro rata share of the associates' results after tax and elimination 
of unrealised intra-group profit and loss less write-down for 
impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement. the 
pro rata share of all transactions and events recognised in the equity 
of the relevant associate is recognised in group’s and parent 
company’s other comprehensive income. 
 
equity investments in group enterprises 
a group enterprise is an enterprise in which the group holds a 
controlling interest, cf. the paragraph on the consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
investments in group enterprises are recognised in the parent 
company’s financial statements according to the equity method. a 
positive difference between cost and the fair value of net assets at the 
time of acquisition of a group enterprise is recognised as goodwill 
under intangible assets. 
 
investments in joint ventures  
a joint venture is a contractual relationship whereby the group and 
other interested parties undertake a commercial activity of which they 
have joint control.  
 
 
 
 
investments in associates are recognised and measured in the 
consolidated accounts and the financial statements of the parent 
company according to the equity method, cf. the section on 
investments in associates. 
 
intangible assets 
it development costs are recognised at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment. amortisation is provided on a straight-
line basis over an estimated useful life of maximum three years.  
 
 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions 
are recognised at fair value at the time of acquisition and 
subsequently amortised over the expected useful life, typically 3 to 10 
years. 
 
other internally generated intangible assets are charged in the year of 
acquisition, as the conditions for capitalisation are not deemed to be 
fulfilled. 
 
land and buildings 
investment properties 
investment properties held for rental income and/or capital gain are 
recognised at fair value on the balance sheet date. gains and losses 
attributable to changes in the fair value of investment properties are 
included in the result for the period during which they arise. fair value 
is measured on the basis of the return method, where the 
measurement of fair value is carried out with the assistance of 
external experts. 
 
owner-occupied properties 
land and buildings for own use are recognised in the balance sheet at 
the restated value corresponding to the fair value on the date of the 
revaluation less subsequent depreciation and impairment. 
revaluation is made at a frequency deemed adequate to ensure that 
the carrying amount is not materially different from the presumed fair 
value on the balance sheet date. a reduction in the carrying amount as 
a result of the revaluation of land and buildings is charged to the 
income statement to the extent that the amount exceeds revaluation 
reserves under equity attributable to past revaluation of the asset. 
any increase in value at revaluation of land and buildings is included in 
other comprehensive income, unless the increase offsets an 
impairment charge made earlier for the same asset which was 
previously recognised as an expense.  
 
the valuation of selected land and buildings is carried out with the 
assistance of external experts. at the regular valuation of land and 
buildings, the value of a building is recognised on the basis of the 
return method in accordance with generally accepted standards. the 
value of the building is recognised at cash value before interest and 
depreciation. the operating income from the property includes rental 
income less maintenance costs, administrative costs and other 
operating costs. the required rate of return on a property is 
determined to best reflect the transactions undertaken until the date 
of valuation, and allowances are made for the individual property’s 
location and level of maintenance as well as sales efforts within a 
reasonable time horizon. the required rate of return on property is 
discussed with local and national estate agents. 
 
initially, leased owner-occupied properties are recognised at the net 
present value of the lease liability inclusive of costs. subsequently, 
leased owner-occupied properties are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment. 
 
once a year, spot checks are made of a number of properties with the 
assistance of an external appraiser. 
 
the depreciation of revalued buildings is recognised in the income 
statement. upon the subsequent sale of a revalued building, any 
relevant revaluation reserves are transferred to retained earnings.

accounting policies, cont. 
 
owner-occupied properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets to the estimated residual 
value. land is not depreciated. the following depreciation periods 
apply: 
 
buildings 
 
max. 50 years 
residual value of buildings 
max. 75%  
 
methods of depreciation, useful lives, residual values and indication of 
impairment are reviewed annually. 
 
other property, plant and equipment 
operating equipment, cars, tools and equipment and leasehold 
improvements are recognised at cost less accumulated impairment 
and depreciation. depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis 
over an estimated useful life of typically three years. leasehold 
improvements are depreciated over the lease term, yet not more 
than five years. 
 
methods of depreciation, useful lives, residual values and indication of 
impairment are reviewed annually. in the event of indications of 
impairment, depreciation is provided at the recoverable amount, 
which is the higher of that asset's value in use and its selling price. 
 
assets held temporarily with a view to sale 
assets held temporarily with a view to sale comprise properties 
acquired through foreclosure, equity investment and cars, etc. 
intended for sale shortly, as a sale is considered very likely. the item 
also covers owner-occupied properties, subsidiaries and disposal 
groups of assets, intended for sale shortly, and where a sale is very 
likely. 
 
assets held temporarily with a view to sale are recognised at the lower 
amount of the carrying amount at the time of the classification as 
assets held temporarily or the fair value less sales costs. no 
depreciation is recognised on the assets from the time when they are 
classified as assets held temporarily. 
 
other assets 
other assets comprise assets not recognised under other asset 
items, including positive fair value of derivatives, assets in pooled 
deposits as well as interest and commission receivable, etc. 
assets in pooled deposits are recognised at fair value.  
 
due to credit institutions and central banks 
balances due to credit institutions and central banks are recognised at 
fair value equal to payments received less directly attributable 
transaction costs incurred. subsequently, the item is measured at 
amortised cost according to the effective interest method. 
 
deposits 
deposits comprise amounts received, including liabilities relating to 
genuine repos from counterparties who are not credit institutions or 
central banks. deposits are recognised at fair value equal to payments 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
subsequently, deposits are measured at amortised cost according to 
the effective interest method. 
 
issued bonds at fair value 
issued mortgage bonds are recognised according to the settlement 
approach and measured at fair value through the income statement 
on initial and subsequent recognition. this takes place to eliminate 
financial inconsistency resulting from the purchase and sale of own 
issued bonds. the fair value is generally measured at prices of the 
underlying issued bonds quoted on a recognised stock exchange. if 
such a market price is not available for the preceding 7 days, a 
calculated price based on the official market rate will be applied for 
determining the value.  
 
mortgage bonds drawn for redemption and repayable immediately 
after the financial year end are measured at par.  
 
 
the portfolio of own mortgage bonds is deducted. 
 
issued bonds and subordinated debt at  
amortised cost 
issued bonds and subordinated debt are recognised at fair value equal 
to payments received less directly attributable transaction costs 
incurred. subsequently, issued bonds and subordinated debt are 
measured at amortised cost according to the effective interest 
method. when the interest-rate risk on fixed-rate issued bonds and 
subordinated debt has been hedged efficiently through derivatives,  
the amortised cost is supplemented with the fair value of the hedged 
interest-rate risk.  
 
liabilities in disposal group with a view to sale 
liabilities in disposal groups are recognised at fair value and comprise 
the liabilities that are closely linked to disposal groups of assets 
awaiting sale within a short period of time and where a sale is very 
likely.  
 
other liabilities 
other liabilities comprise liabilities not recognised under other items 
under equity and liabilities, including liabilities from finance leases with 
lessees, acceptance of long-term letters of credit, negative fair value 
of derivatives as well as interest and commission payable, etc. 
 
provisions 
provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, where resources embodying 
financial benefits are required to settle an obligation, and where a 
reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.  
 
provisions are measured as the best estimates of the cost of meeting 
liabilities on the balance sheet date. provisions for debt expected to 
be payable later than 12 months after the balance sheet date are 
measured at present value, if of material importance, otherwise at 
cost. 
 
provisions for pension liabilities and the like are based on the actuarial 
present value of the expected benefit payments. the present value is 
calculated, among other things, on the basis of expected employee 
turnover, discount rate and rate of wage increase as well as the return 
on associated assets. the difference between the expected and the 
actual development in pension benefits will generate actuarial loss and 
gain which will be recognised under other comprehensive income. 
 
for provisions for guarantees, loan commitments and unutilised loan 
commitments, reference is made to the section on financial 
guarantees and the section on loans and advances at amortised cost. 
 
for provisions for deferred tax, reference is made to the section on 
tax.

accounting policies, cont. 
 
equity 
share capital is classified as equity where there is no obligation to 
transfer cash or other assets. 
 
a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability when the motion has 
been approved at the annual general meeting. dividend for the year is 
stated separately under equity. 
 
the currency translation reserve includes translation differences 
which are the result of translating results and net investments in 
foreign units into danish kroner. it also includes the foreign currency 
translation adjustment of financial liabilities for the hedging of net 
investments in international units. 
 
the revaluation reserve relates to the revaluation of property, plant 
and equipment less deferred tax on the revaluation. a reserve is 
dissolved once the assets are sold or lapse. 
 
reserves according to the equity method include value adjustment of 
investments in associates and group enterprises. 
 
the reserve is reduced by the distribution of dividend to the parent 
company and adjusted by other changes in equity in associates and 
group enterprises. 
 
retained earnings include non-distributed dividends from previous 
years. 
 
additional tier 1 capital with no maturity and with voluntary repayment 
of interest and principal is recognised under equity. likewise, interest 
expenses relating to the issue are considered dividend. interest is 
deducted from equity at the time of payment. 
 
own shares 
acquisition costs, consideration and dividend on own shares are 
recognised in retained earnings under equity. capital reduction by 
cancellation of own shares reduces the share capital by an amount 
equal to the nominal value of the cancelled shares at the time of the 
registration of the capital reduction. 
 
contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
contingent assets and contingent liabilities comprise possible assets 
and liabilities originating from past events and the existence of which 
depends on the occurrence of future uncertain events not entirely 
within the control of the jyske bank group. 
 
contingency assets are disclosed when the occurrence of an 
economic benefit is likely. 
 
contingency liabilities that can but most likely will not require a drain 
on the resources of the jyske bank group are disclosed. moreover, 
current liabilities that are not recognised as they are unlikely to cause 
a drain on the resources of the jyske bank group or the extent of the 
liability cannot be measured reliably are disclosed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
income statement 
 
interest income and interest expenses 
interest income and expenses on all interest-bearing instruments are 
recognised in the income statement according to the accruals 
concept at the effective interest rate based on the expected useful 
life of the relevant financial instrument. for floating-rate assets and 
liabilities the rate of interest applied is the rate that applies until the 
next interest-fixing date.  
 
interest includes amortised fees which are an integral part of the 
effective return on a financial instrument at amortised cost, including 
front-end fees.  
 
interest income includes administrative contributions from mortgage 
loans. 
 
interest on mortgage loans and issued mortgage bonds that are 
governed by the specific balance principle is recognised at the 
nominal rate of interest on the outstanding bond debt. 
 
interest on mortgage loans, issued mortgage bonds and relating 
derivatives that are governed by the general balance principle is 
recognised at the yield to maturity. interest relating to the related 
derivatives is presented together with the interest on the issued 
mortgage bonds so that the net interest expenses on these are 
recognised as a whole under interest expenses. 
 
negative interest income is recognised under interest expenses, while 
negative interest expenses are recognised under interest income. in 
the notes to interest income and interest expenses, negative interest 
is initially recognised under the original note item and is then 
transferred net between interest income and interest expenses at the 
bottom of the notes. 
 
fees received and paid 
income related to services rendered over a given period of time 
accrues over the service period. this includes guarantee commission 
and portfolio management fees. other fees are recognised in the 
income statement once the transaction has been completed. this 
includes securities transaction and safe-custody fees as well as 
money transfer fees.  
 
value adjustments 
all realised and unrealised value adjustments of assets, liabilities and 
derivatives measured at fair value as well are recognised under value 
adjustments. exempt from these are value adjustment of credit risk 
on loans and advances recognised under loan impairment charges 
and provisions for guarantees. furthermore, the earnings impact of 
exchange rate adjustments and hedge accounting of fair value is 
recognised.

accounting policies, cont. 
 
other operating income 
other income not attributable to other income statement items, 
inclusive of income relating to operational leases and the proceeds 
from the sale of leased assets, is recognised under other operating 
income. 
 
employee and administrative expenses 
salaries and remuneration, etc. to employees and management as 
well as administrative expenses, including rent for leased premises, 
are recognised under employee and administrative expenses. the 
expenses comprise among other things salaries, holiday payments 
and retirement remuneration, anniversary bonuses, pension plans and 
other long-term employee benefits. 
 
pension plans and other long-term employee benefits 
the group has entered into defined contribution pension plans with 
the majority of its employees. 
 
under defined contribution pension plans, the group makes fixed 
contributions to an independent pension fund, etc. the group is 
under no obligation to make further contributions. contributions are 
included in the income statement over the vesting period. 
 
under defined benefit pension plans, the group is obliged to pay a 
certain benefit when an employee retires. liabilities in connection with 
defined benefit plans are automatically calculated by actuarially 
discounting pension liabilities to present value. the present value is 
calculated on the basis of assumptions relating to the future trend in 
interest rates, inflation, mortality and disablement. 
 
anniversary bonuses are recognised as the present value of the part 
of the overall liability which relates to the term during which the 
employees have been employed with the group. due consideration is 
paid to staff turnover, etc. the liability is recognised under provisions 
for pensions and similar liabilities. 
 
other operating expenses 
other expenses not attributable to other income statement items, 
inclusive of jyske bank's proportionate share of statutory expenses 
for the guarantee fund for depositors and investors as well as the 
resolution fund, are recognised under other operating expenses. 
 
earnings per share 
earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year 
exclusive of interest for additional tier 1 capital (at1) by the weighted 
average number of shares in circulation during the financial year.  
 
diluted earnings per share are calculated in the same manner as 
earnings per share, but the decisive factors are adjusted to reflect the 
effect of all diluted share capital. 
 
comprehensive income 
comprehensive income comprises the profit for the period plus other 
comprehensive income relating to currency translation and hedge 
accounting of international units, property revaluations, actuarial loss 
and gain and tax adjustments. 
 
segment information 
information is stated for business sectors identified on the basis of 
internal management reports and accounting policies in accordance 
with ifrs 8. the segment information is based on the information 
used by the group's highest-ranking decision-making officer for 
assessing results and allocating resources. internal management 
reporting comprises the segments banking activities, mortgage 
activities, leasing activities. jyske bank operates in the following 
geographical areas: denmark and germany. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
core profit 
core profit is defined as the pre-tax profit exclusive of earnings from 
investment portfolios. 
 
investment portfolio earnings 
the investment portfolio earnings consist of the return on the 
group’s own securities portfolio of tactical market risk positions 
(primarily interest-rate and currency risk risk exposures) and a smaller 
amount of bond investments. investment portfolio earnings are 
calculated after expenses for funding and directly attributable costs. 
 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement shows group cash flows relating to 
operating, investing and financing activities for the year, changes in 
cash and cash equivalents for the financial year, and cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. the cash flow 
statement is presented in accordance with the indirect method based 
on the profit for the year.  
 
cash flows derived from operating activities are calculated as the 
profit for the year adjusted for non-cash operating items, changes in 
operating capital and paid corporate tax. cash flows relating to 
investing activities include dividend received, purchase and sale of 
enterprises and non-current assets. cash flows relating to financing 
activities include distribution and movements in equity and 
subordinated debt as well as repayment on lease commitment. 
 
cash and cash equivalents include cash and free balances due from 
credit institutions and central banks with an original time to maturity 
of less than three months. 
 
european single electronic format 
according to eu regulation – eu 2019/815 on european single 
electronic format (esef regulation) – companies that report results 
according to ifrs and that issue listed securities must publish the 
annual reports for 2020 approved by their supervisory boards in the 
esef format. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the 
authorities have in 2020 made it possible to postpone this reporting 
until 2022 (annual report for 2021). jyske bank has chosen to publish 
and report its 2020 annual reports in the esef format. the 
implementation of the new format does not result in material changes 
to the group’s annual report and does not affect the accounting 
policies applied by the group. this is solely a technical format, which 
allows financial statement users to read the financial statements in a 
browser (xhtml format) and to retrieve digitally certain details from 
the financial statements in the xbrl format. in the 2020 financial 
statements, the following items in the consolidated financial 
statements have been marked up (ixbrl tags) for the esef taxonomy 
for 2019 issued by the european securities and markets authority 
(esma): 
 
• 
items in the income statement and other comprehensive 
income 
• 
items on the balance sheet 
• 
statement of changes in equity 
• 
cash flow statement. 
 
tagging does not include the notes, etc. of the financial statements. 
this will be the case in 2022 (annual report for 2021) in accordance 
with the regulation. the mark-up has taken place in such a way that 
initially for each item, an assessment has been made of the 
relationship to the esma taxonomy, which is based on the iasb's ifrs 
taxonomy, and then a mark-up is made to the element in the 
taxonomy that is most relevant for the determination and 
assessment of the individual item. mark-up requirements solely relate 
to items at a consolidated level, and therefore all items in the parent 
company are not marked up. the financial statements have been 
published with the following file name: “jysk-2020-12-31.zip”.

in 2020, the balance of impairment charges rose slightly, which can be attributed to the management's estimate for the addition to the 
effects from the covid-19 outbreak. when disregarding the addition, impairment charges at jyske bank are generally developing in a 
positive manner. the items of new loans and advances, etc. and discontinued loans and advances, etc. were affected by natural 
refinancing and re-mortgaging. the size of the item recalculation was affected by the changed credit risk at each stage. the period 
only saw minor model adjustments. 
 
 
 
on the whole, gross loans declined in 2020, which could be attributed to developments in stages 2 and 3, as gross loans in stage 1 rose 
slightly. the development of gross loans in stages 2 and 3 could be attributed primarily to instalments on the exposures and, to a 
lesser degree, to the fact that the gross loans were transferred to stages 1 or 2.

contingent liabilities 
 
 
 
 
 
general 
 
jyske bank's credit review of guarantee applicant takes into consideration the risk on guarantees. for 77% of jyske bank’s guarantees, 
the contractual term to maturity is below one year; for 17%, the contractual terms to maturity is between 1 and 5 years; for 6%, the 
contractual term to maturity is above 5 years, compared to 75%, 19% and 6%, respectively, in 2019. 
 
 
 
financial guarantees are primarily payment guarantees, and the risk equals that involved in credit facilities. 
 
 
 
guarantees for losses on mortgage loans are typically provided as security for the riskiest part of mortgage loans granted to personal 
clients and to a limited extent for loans secured on commercial real property. guarantees for residential real property are within 80% 
and for commercial real property within 60%-80%, of the property value as assessed by a professional expert. 
 
 
 
registration and refinancing guarantees are provided in connection with the registration of new and refinanced mortgages. such 
guarantees involve insignificant risk. 
 
 
 
other contingent liabilities include other forms of guarantees at varying degrees of risk, including performance guarantees. the risk 
involved is deemed to be less than the risk involved in, e.g., credit facilities subject to flexible drawdown. 
 
 
 
jyske bank is also a party to a number of legal disputes arising from its business activities. jyske bank estimates the risk involved in 
each individual case and makes any necessary provisions which are recognised under contingent liabilities. jyske bank does not expect 
such liabilities to have material influence on jyske bank’s financial position. 
 
 
 
because of its mandatory participation in the deposit guarantee scheme, the sector has paid an annual contribution of 2.5‰ of the 
covered net deposits until the assets of pengeinstitutafdelingen (the financial institution fund) exceed 0.8% of the total net deposits 
covered, which level has been reached. according to bank package 3 and bank package 4, pengeinstitutafdelingen bears the 
immediate losses attributable to covered net deposits and relating to the winding up of financial institutions in distress. any losses in 
connection with the final winding up are covered by the guarantee fund's afviklings- og restruktureringsafdeling (settlement and 
restructuring fund), where jyske bank currently guarantees 8.70% of any losses. 
 
 
 
the statutory participation in the resolution financing arrangements (resolution fund) as of june 2015 entailed that credit institutions 
pay an annual contribution over a 10-year period to a danish national fund with a target size totalling 1% of the covered deposits. 
credit institutions are to contribute according to their relative sizes and risk in denmark, and the first contributions to the resolution 
fund were paid at the end of 2015. jyske bank expects having to pay a total of about dkk 300m over the 10-year period 2015 - 2025. 
 
 
 
due to jyske bank's membership of the foreningen bankdata, the bank is - in the event of its withdrawal - under the obligation to pay 
an exit charge to bankdata in the amount of about dkk 3.3 bn. 
 
 
 
jyske bank is a management company under danish joint taxation. therefore, according to the provisions of the danish company 
taxation, jyske bank is liable as of the accounting year 2013 for corporation tax, etc. for the jointly taxed companies and as of 1 july 
2012 for any liabilities to withhold tax on interest and dividends for the jointly taxed companies.

independent auditors’ report 
to the shareholder of jyske bank a/s 
audit opinion  
we have audited the consolidated financial 
statements and the financial statements for jyske 
bank a/s for the financial year 1 january-december 
2020 comprising the income statement, statement 
of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement 
of changes in equity, capital statement and notes, 
including accounting policies, for the group as well as 
the company, and the consolidated cash flow 
statement for the group. the consolidated financial 
statements were prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and also in accordance with 
additional danish disclosure requirements for listed 
financial companies, and the parent's financial 
statements were prepared in accordance with the 
danish financial business act.  
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the group’s financial 
position on 31 december 2020 and of its financial 
performance and cash flows for the financial year 
1 january-december 2020 – in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and additional disclosure 
requirements for listed financial companies.  
in addition, in our opinion, the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the company's financial 
position on 31 december 2020 and of the company's 
financial performance for the financial year 
1 january-december 2020 – in accordance with the 
danish financial business act.  
our audit opinion is in line with our long-form audit 
report to the audit committee and the supervisory 
board. 
basis of the audit opinion  
we conducted our audit in accordance with the 
international standards on auditing and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. our 
responsibility according to these standards and 
requirements are described in detail in the auditors' 
report under the heading "the auditor's 
responsibility for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent’s financial 
statements".  
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion. 
 
independence 
we are independent of the group in accordance with 
the code of ethics of the international ethics 
standard board for accountants (iesba) and also in 
accordance with the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark; also, we have met our other

and requirements. 
   
to the best of our knowledge, no prohibited non-
audit services as stated in art. 5(1) of regulation (eu) 
no. 537/2014 have been performed. 
appointment of auditors 
on 16 june 2020, we were for the first time elected 
auditors of jyske bank a/s for the financial year 
2020. 
key audit matters  
key audit matters are the matters that in our 
professional opinion were the most important ones 
in connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent’s financial 
statements for the financial year 2020. these 
matters were discussed in the course of our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent’s financial statements as a whole and the 
preparation of our audit opinion. we do not issue a 
separate audit opinion about these matters. for each 
of the below matters, the description of how the 
matter was treated during our audit is given in 
connection with this. 
we have lived up to our responsibility as described in 
the section “the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent’s financial statements”, 
also in relation to the below key audit matters. our 
audit covered the preparation and performance of 
audit procedures in reaction to our assessment of 
the risk of material misinformation in the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent’s 
financial statements. the result of our audit 
procedure, including the audit procedures we have 
performed to treat the below matters, forms the 
basis of our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent’s financial 
statements as a whole. 
measurement of loans, advances and guarantees 
risk: a material part of the group's assets consists of 
loans and advances, which are associated with risks 
of loss in the event of the client's inability to pay. in 
addition, guarantees and other financial products are 
offered that are also associated with risks of loss. 
the jyske bank group's total loans and advances 
amounted to dkk 491,379m on 31 december 2020 
(dkk 485,900m on 31 december 2019), and the total 
impairment charges and provisions for expected 
credit losses amounted to dkk 5,227m on 31

                                                    jyske bank group 
december 2020 (dkk 5,227m on 31 december 
2019).  
the group’s statement of loan impairment charges 
and provisions for losses on guarantees, etc. involve 
material amounts and many management's 
estimates. this relates in particular to the probability 
of default, the division of exposures into stages, the 
assessment whether any indication of credit 
impairment has been established, realisable value of 
collateral received as well as the client’s ability to pay 
in the event of default.  
large loans and advances associated with high risk 
are assessed individually, while impairment charges 
on small loans and advances and loans and advances 
with low risk are determined on the basis of models 
that involve management's estimates in connection 
with the establishment of methods and parameters 
for the determination of the expected loss.  
the group recognises additional impairment 
charges based on management's estimates in such 
situations where the impairment charges calculated 
by models and determined individually have not yet 
been assessed to reflect current risks of loss and 
expectations of loss, for instance the impact from 
covid-19.  
audit: our audit covered the group’s procedures and 
internal controls for follow-up on loans and 
advances, division into stages of exposures and 
registration of indications of impairment. through 
analysis and sampling as well as audit of the group’s 
procedures and internal controls, we have checked 
whether the statement of impairment charges for 
expected losses was made in accordance with the 
accounting rules and the accounting policies 
described.  
among other things, the audit included substantive 
audit of the largest and most risky loans and 
advances, including loans with objective evidence of 
impairment. for the impairment charges calculated 
by models, we have reviewed and assessed the 
methods and parameters applied, tested internal 
controls as well as through sampling tested the 
calculations.  
moreover, we have audited the estimates that the 
group management made in addition to the 
impairment charges determined individually and 
calculated by models, including in particular 
impairment charges to cover the estimated impact 
from covid-19. our audit of the management's 
estimates included audit of the group’s basis for the 
methods and assumptions applied, including whether 
these are reasonable and well-founded as regards 
the relevant basis of comparison.   
furthermore, we tested and assessed whether the 
disclosures in the notes relating to loans and 
advances, impairment charges and credit risks 
comply with the relevant accounting rules (notes 14, 
19, 20, 21, 50 and 67). 
statement on the management's review  
the management is responsible for the 
management's review.  
our audit opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent’s financial statements 
does not cover the management's review, and we do 
not express any kind of unmodified audit opinion on 
the management's review. 
in connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent’s financial 
statements, it is our responsibility to read the 
management's review and in that connection 
consider whether the management's review is 
materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or the parent's financial 
statements or our knowledge attained through the 
audit or in other ways seems to contain any material 
misstatement.  
in addition, it is our responsibility to consider whether 
the management's review contains the required 
information according to the danish financial 
business act.  
based on the work performed, we believe that the 
management's review is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent’s 
financial statements and that it has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial business act. we did not find any material 
misstatement in the management's review. 
management’s responsibility for the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent’s financial 
statements  
management is responsible for the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements that offer a true 
and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu 
and in accordance with the additional disclosure 
requirements for listed financial companies as well as 
for the preparation of the parent's financial 
statements that offer a true and fair view according 
to the danish financial business act.  
moreover, management is responsible for the 
internal control that management finds necessary to 
prepare consolidated financial statements and the 
parent's financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.  
when preparing the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent’s financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
group's and the parent's ability to continue 
operations and for disclosing circumstances relating 
to the continued operations, where relevant; and to 
 
 
jyske bank / annual report 2020 / endorsements / page 145 
 
prepare the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent’s financial statements on the basis of the 
accounting principle on continued operations, unless 
management intends to wind up the group or the 
company, discontinue operations or does not have 
any other realistic alternative than doing so.  
the auditor's responsibility for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent’s 
financial statements  
the objective of our audit is that of obtaining a high 
level of assurance and audit evidence that the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent’s 
financial statements are free of material 
misstatements, whether or not due to fraud or error. 
a high level of assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but no guarantee that an audit performed in 
accordance with the international standards on 
auditing and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark will reveal any material misstatement if 
such misstatement has been made. misstatements 
can also be given due to fraud or error and can be 
considered material if it is reasonable to assume that 
such misstatements will individually or collectively 
affect the financial decisions that financial statement 
users make on the basis of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial statements.  
in the course of the audit that is performed in 
accordance with the international standards on 
auditing and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark, we make professional assessments with 
an attitude of professional scepticism during the 
audit. in addition:  
• 
we identify and assess the risk of material 
misstatements in the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial 
statements, whether or not such misstatements 
are due to fraud or error; we design and perform 
audit procedures in reaction to these risks and 
also obtain audit evidence sufficient and suitable 
for the basis of our audit opinion. the risk of not 
detecting any material misstatement due to 
fraud is higher than that in connection with 
material misstatements caused by error, as 
fraud may comprise conspiracy, forgery, 
conscious omissions, misrepresentation or 
disregard of internal control.  
• 
we gain an understanding of the internal control 
relevant for the audit in order to prepare audit 
procedures that are appropriate under the 
circumstances, but not to express an audit 
opinion on the efficiency of the group's and the 
parent's internal control. 
• 
we make a decision wither the accounting 
policies applied by management are suitable, 
and whether the accounting estimates and 
relevant information that management has 
prepared are reasonable.  
• 
we determine whether management's 
preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial 
statements on the basis the of accounting 
principle on going concern is suitable, as well as 
whether, on the basis of the audit evidence 
obtained, there is any material uncertainty linked 
to events or circumstances that may result in 
considerable doubt as to the group's or the 
company's ability to continue operations. if we 
determine that there is material uncertainty, we 
must in our auditors' report draw attention to 
information of this in the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial 
statements, or if such information is not 
sufficient modify our audit opinion. our audit 
opinion is based on the audit evidence that is 
obtained until the date of our auditors' report. 
however, future events or circumstances may 
result in the group and the company not being 
able to continue operations any longer.  
• 
we decide on the overall presentation, structure 
and contents of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial 
statements, including disclosures in the notes, 
and whether the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent's financial 
statements reflect the underlying transactions 
and events in such a way that they render a true 
and fair view of these.  
• 
we obtain a sufficient and suitable audit 
evidence of the financial information in the 
companies or the business activities in the 
group to express an audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. we are 
responsible for directing, supervising and 
performing the consolidated financial 
statements audit. we are solely responsible for 
the audit opinion.  
we communicate with senior management, among 
other things, on the planned extent and the timing of 
the audit as well as considerable audit observations, 
including any considerable shortcomings in the 
internal control that we identify during our audit.  
we also make a statement to senior management to 
the effect that we comply with relevant ethical 
requirements as to independence and disclose to 
senior management all relations and other 
circumstances that may reasonably affect our 
independence and, where relevant, related security 
measures. 
based on the circumstances communicated to 
senior management, we establish the circumstances 
that were of greatest importance during our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent's financial statements covering the relevant 
period and therefore constituted key audit matters.

                                                    jyske bank group 
we describe these circumstances in our auditors' 
report, unless acts of law or other regulation 
preclude publication of the circumstance, or in the 
most rare cases where we establish that the 
circumstance is not to be communicated in our 
auditors' report because the negative consequences 
from this could reasonably be expected to carry a 
heavier weight than the benefit from such 
communication that would be in the public interest. 
declaration of compliance with the esef regulation 
in the course of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the financial statements of 
jyske bank a/s, we have performed actions with a 
view to expressing an audit opinion on whether the 
annual report covering the financial year 1 january-
31 december 2020, with the file name ”jysk-2020-
12-31.zip”, was prepared in accordance with the 
commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 
with regard to the single electronic reporting format 
(esef regulation), stipulating requirements for the 
preparation of an annual report in the xhtml format 
and ixbrl mark-up of the main statements of the 
consolidated financial statements .  
it is the responsibility of the management to prepare 
an annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation, including:  
• 
preparation of the annual report in the xhtml 
format  
• 
selection and use of appropriate ixbrl tags, 
including extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
embedding this to elements in the taxonomy, for 
financial information, that must be marked up, 
subject to estimates where necessary  
• 
to ensure consistency between ixbrl-marked-
up data and the human-readable consolidated 
financial statements 
• 
for the internal control, which management 
considers necessary for the preparation of an 
annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation.  
it is our responsibility, based on the obtained audit 
evidence, to achieve a high level of assurance that in 
all material respects the annual report was prepared 
in accordance with the esef regulation and to 
express an audit opinion. the type, extent and the 
timing of the selected audit procedures depend on 
the auditor's professional assessment, including an 
assessment of the risk of material differences from 
the requirements of the esef regulation, whether or 
not these are due to fraud or error. the audit 
procedures include:  
• 
control of whether the annual report was 
prepared in the xhtml format 
• 
obtaining an understanding of the company’s 
process for ixbrl mark-up and of the internal 
control relating to the mark-up process 
• 
assessment of the completeness of the ixbrl 
mark-up of the consolidated financial 
statements 
• 
assessment of whether the use of ixbrl 
elements from the esef taxonomy and the 
company’s establishment of extensions to the 
taxonomy are appropriate when relevant 
elements of the esef taxonomy have not been 
identified 
• 
assessment of the anchoring of extension to 
elements in the esef taxonomy 
• 
harmonisation of ixbrl marked-up data with 
the audited consolidated financial statements.  
in our opinion, the annual report for the financial 
year 1 january-31 december 2020, with the file 
name ”jysk-2020-12-31.zip” was in al material 
respects prepared in accordance with the esef 
regulation.
