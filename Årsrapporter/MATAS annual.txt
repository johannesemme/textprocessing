matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
to our shareholders 
above all, financial year 2020/21 was characterised by the covid-19 pandemic, and matas was among the 
companies to emerge from the crisis in stronger shape. growing demand for health products and exploding online 
sales translated into historically strong growth, improved customer satisfaction, a net inflow of new members and a 
significant strengthening of the matas brand.  
thanks to its status as a general retailer and a distributor of medical equipment, all physical matas stores were 
allowed – along with supermarkets, pharmarcies, etc. – to remain open throughout the financial year.  
throughout the year, the physical stores constituted a lifeline for many customers and, supported by their more than 
2,000 trained beauty and health therapists, enabled matas to play an important role in society during the crisis, 
supplying large volumes of personal protective equipment, personal care and health products and competent 
advice.  
the crisis provided a further boost to in-store digital innovation and a number of new online tools were introduced in 
the course of the year. the stores were converted into miniature tv studios, enabling customers to consult beauty 
and health therapists from home via video and chat, and matas now hosts several live shopping events every week. 
these measures helped revitalise the stores and will be a permanent feature of their service offering in the years to 
come. physical store upgrades continued in the past financial year, although at a slower rate and with a lower level 
of investments than in the past few years.   
at the same time, danish consumers – particularly during lockdown periods – did a lot more of their shopping online, 
a platform on which matas has built a leading position over the past three years. matas generated online revenue of 
more than dkk 1 billion in the past financial year and, according to the danish chamber of commerce, was the 
second-most used webshop in denmark. at the peak of the covid-19 crisis, online sales at matas.dk were some days 
ten times higher than on the same day the year before and almost level with overall sales at the 265 physical stores. 
overall online sales grew by 100% in the financial year to account for more than 25% of total group sales.   
in the financial year, matas also consolidated its close relations with its partners and suppliers, who found solutions to 
logistic challenges and maintained high levels of innovation and activity.   
matas’ adaptability during the past year translated into unprecedented strong revenue growth of almost 13%, 
earnings (ebitda before special items) of just under dkk 800 million and a historically strong free cash flow of dkk 774 
million. despite uncertainty as to the ramifications of the covid-19 pandemic, matas is thus embarking on a new 
financial year in a very strong position, financially and strategically, to take long-term action in a changing retail 
industry.  
the goals set out in the ‘renewing matas’ strategy have been achieved two years ahead of schedule, the 
company has been transformed, and the crisis has presented new opportunities for matas. against this background, 
management has launched a process to update the strategy, the ambition being to deliver even stronger, 
sustainable long-term growth, while at the same time maintaining a high level of earnings.  
the key guidepost of the strategy is for matas’ online business to more than double within five years. to achieve this 
goal, matas will invest in measures to strengthen three growth platforms – ecommerce (matas.dk and firtal’s 
webshops), connected retail (the physical stores interacting with the digital universe) and brands (matas’ own 
stripes products, nilens jord, etc.) – in the attractive health & beauty market. the strategy will be presented at a 
capital markets day in connection with the release of the q1 interim report on 18 august 2021.  
based on the satisfactory financial results, the board of directors proposes that dkk 150 million, equivalent to 42% of 
matas’ adjusted profit for 2021/21, be distributed to the company’s shareholders. half of this amount will be 
distributed as dividend, equivalent to dkk 2 per share, while the other half will be paid out in the form of a share 
buyback programme with most of the shares bought back being cancelled. 
we wish to take this opportunity to thank, first and foremost, matas’ employees, whose commitment and efforts have 
been critical to matas’ adaptability during a year we will never forget. in appreciation of this, management has 
distributed an extraordinary bonus of dkk 10 million evenly among all employees across the organisation.

strategy and financial ambitions 
renewing matas – strategy going forward to 2023 
launched in may 2018, the ‘renewing matas’ strategy includes three key strategic goals going forward to 2023:  
• 
lift customer engagement 
index 110 relative to the 2018/19 level 
• 
grow revenue  
total revenue of about dkk 4 billion in 2022/23 
• 
secure earnings 
an ebitda margin before special items above 18% in financial year 2022/23  
 
in the past financial year, matas lifted customer engagement to an m-nps score of 64.9 in the fourth quarter from 
62.1 at 31 march 2020.  
at the same time, two years ahead of schedule, matas achieved the 5-year strategic goals defined in 2018 for the 
company’s revenue and earnings. 
against this background, matas has launched a process to update its financial and strategic ambitions. the updated 
strategy will be presented at a capital markets day to be held on 18 august 2021.   
strategic focus areas going forward to 2023 
‘renewing matas’ builds on five strategic focus areas:  
1. 
live our purpose 
2. 
win online 
3. 
reignite store growth 
4. 
open new growth tracks 
5. 
change how we work 
below follows a description of the main components of the strategy and the progress achieved in financial year 
2020/21. 
in the past financial year, management’s primary focus was to adapt the organisation to the new market conditions 
and customer preferences brought about by the covid-19 pandemic. accordingly, investments and efforts were 
primarily directed towards securing the capacity required to meet the strong online sales growth, while upgrades to 
the matas life store concept were scaled down.     
1. live our purpose 
matas’ purpose, ‘beauty and wellbeing for life’, emphasises that matas’ business model relies on lifelong relations 
with its customers.   
matas has defined six guideposts to help it enhance and renew customers’ perception of matas:

matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
• 
more personal – even better at identifying and advising about what is right for each individual customer 
• 
more green – for the many customers who care about living healthy, green and natural lives 
• 
more danish – more danish products created by local enthusiasts rooted in danish values and design traditions 
• 
more sensuous – beauty and wellbeing is about smelling, feeling, seeing and trying 
• 
more simple – shopping at matas’ stores and online should be easier and quicker 
• 
more for everyone – all customers should feel welcome, respected and heard, and they should feel they get 
value for money 
as part of its efforts to live its purpose, matas continued the development of club matas in 2020/21, launching a 
number of new initiatives. club matas retained its position as one of denmark’s largest loyalty concepts with 69% of 
all danish women between the ages of 18 and 65 being members of club matas. the number of club matas 
members making at least one purchase increased by 4% to 1.5 million active users in financial year 2020/21. 
following thorough analysis, the club matas plus concept was launched at the beginning of 2021. an add-on to 
club matas, club matas plus is a subscription service which, for a monthly fee of dkk 29, offers a number of benefits 
in terms of matas points, exclusive discounts, free shipping, exclusive access to new products and more. 
management expects club matas plus to drive value for many of the company’s best and most loyal customers and 
at the same time ensure that these customers form even closer ties with matas and purchase an even greater share 
of their beauty and health products from matas in the future. 
2. win online 
matas aims to be the undisputed online market leader in the danish market for beauty and wellbeing by 2023.  
the danish online market for beauty and wellbeing remains fragmented and consists of danish as well as 
international players, but matas successfully strengthened its position during 2020/21 and was by far the largest 
player by the end of the financial year, which means that the group has achieved its digital ambition two years 
ahead of schedule.  
according to a study published by the danish chamber of commerce, matas was the second largest webshop in 
denmark in 2020, advancing from a position as number 20 in 2017. 
denmark’s largest webshops measured by number of transactions  
 
source: danish chamber of commerce, e-commerce analysis 2017 and 2020 
in the financial year, matas was widely recognised for its unwavering focus on strengthening its online business. the 
danish chamber of commerce jury of e-commerce experts named matas the winner of the gold award for danish 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
9 
online stores and e-commerce suppliers from among a field of more than 500 nominees. in addition to the main 
award, matas won the award for omni-channel retailer of the year. 
overall online sales were up by 100% to dkk 1,083 million in the past financial year an elevenfold increase over the 
past 15 quarters. online sales accounted for 32% of q4 2020/21 revenue against 19% in q4 2019/20. the strong 
growth translated into significantly improved profitability for matas group’s online activities, which now practically 
match the store network in terms of profitability.  
 
 
matas also reached a number of other online milestones in 2020/21. 671,000 club matas members shopped at 
matas.dk during the financial year, 262,000 of them for the first time. 41% of first-time shoppers made more than one 
purchase at matas.dk. the nps for customers shopping at matas.dk during the financial year improved to 68 in q4 
from 58 in the year-earlier period.   
ongoing efforts were made during the financial year to expand the personal dialogue with customers through 
matas’ digital channels, and customers are now able to follow their local matas store on facebook. matas continues 
to increase its social media following and currently has some 295,000 followers on facebook and some 99,000 
followers on instagram, an increase of 3% and 17%, respectively, compared with last year. the chat function at 
matas.dk, which is primarily manned by trained beauty and health therapists, handled more than 57,000 customer 
inquiries in the course of the year. customers seeking advice through the matas.dk chat function have conversion 
rates four times and basket sizes almost twice those of other customers.  
44% of all customers shopping at matas.dk chose to pick up their purchases at a physical matas store, and many of 
these bought additional products while at the store.   
matas maintained its focus on providing a good shopping experience irrespective of which channel the customer 
wishes to use. in 2020/21, 602,000 members made at least one purchase at a physical store and at matas.dk, an 
increase of 59% compared with 2019/20.  
3. consolidate and upgrade the retail network 
matas aims to renew and consolidate its physical store network as consumer behaviour changes. the retail industry is 
changing rapidly with an increasing share of retail shopping migrating to online channels, and customers are 
changing their expectations as to the needs a physical store or a brand should be able to meet.  
the number of matas stores fell by a net three in 2020/21 as five stores were closed and two new ones opened. all 
stores remain profitable except for two, which were severely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic due to their 
location. it remains the company’s long-term ambition to have fewer but bigger stores at better locations, especially 
in areas with several matas stores located relatively close to each other.  
in financial year 2018/19, matas therefore launched a process to develop a new store concept, matas life, that 
seeks to capture all aspects of the strong relations built over 70 years of doing business with danish consumers.  
as part of the matas life concept, matas also introduced new service elements such as mobile check-out devices, 
segregation of service and payment functions and a different physical layout with separate category centres for 
makeup and skincare across mass beauty and high-end beauty ranges. thus, intending to provide a more sensuous 
10  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
experience, the mats life concept invites customers to explore, to be inspired and to indulge, while also offering 
personalised advice and allowing busy customers to have their purchases processed quickly. 
the work to upgrade existing stores to the matas life concept, which offers customers sensuous and personal 
experiences, more inspiration and more activities, continued in the financial year, but investments were at a 
significantly lower level than in the year before, due partly to the restrictions imposed as a result of the covid-19 
pandemic as well as general changes in consumer behaviour.  
in the period since the first four matas life stores opened in march 2019, a total of 37 matas life stores have opened 
across the country.  
as at the end of the financial year, a total of 65 stores, most of them major stores, had been renovated or relocated 
since 2016. updated stores account for 36% of matas’ revenue from physical stores.  
due to matas’ status as a general retailer and a distributor of medical equipment, all physical matas stores were 
allowed to remain open through the pandemic.  
in addition to general efforts to update the retail network, matas stores located outside the main cities and shopping 
centres benefited from the many people working from home and spending more time in leisure homes during the 
pandemic, combined with the general shop local trend. stores located in shopping centres, on the other hand, 
suffered during large parts of the year. 
during the covid-19 pandemic, the stores have been focused on ensuring a safe shopping environment for 
customers and employees. as a result, stores across the country have successfully maintained low infection rates and 
have therefore been allowed to remain open for the benefit of the many customers preferring to shop at physical 
stores during periods of lockdown.  
in terms of development, focus has been on accelerating store digitalisation and on the interaction between stores 
and the online channel. interaction between the online service and the stores is an important value driver for 
customers and strengthens both sales channels by making it easy to get advice, search for products and shop 
whenever and wherever it suits the customer. data show that omnichannel customers generally shop more often 
and purchase more products than customers that only shop in the physical matas stores. interaction between 
channels thus drives greater customer loyalty and higher sales. 
a large number of stores now offer video consultations and organise a variety of online events, and employees from 
many local stores offer advice to online customers at matas.dk. in addition, a team of currently 15 omnichannel 
beauty and health therapists, physically located at five matas stores across the country, work exclusively with online 
sales and advice.   
as part of its increased focus on health, matas has, during the year, built a team of pharmaconomists with special 
skills in otc medicine, special skincare and supplements.  
4. open new growth tracks 
matas works systematically to identify new growth avenues. new business areas must be closely related with the 
group’s core business.  
the results of the year's efforts in relation to a number of growth initiatives were announced after the end of the 
financial year. matas has opened a new growth track through the acquisition of a healthtech platform and the 
establishment of a partnership with an online pharmacy. the portfolio of house brands will be expanded through the 
addition of supplements from novozymes and the launch of aktiviva, an all- inclusive dietary supplement developed 
by matas.  
the matas natur initiative, which provides customers with a broader range of green, natural products across all sales 
channels, was expanded in the financial year. while there were previously two physical matas natur stores, one in 
aarhus and one in copenhagen, the matas natur initiative has now been integrated into most matas stores, leading 
to increased sales. 
as regards its online presence, matas expanded its customised subscription service to include some 800 products, 
primarily from the health & wellbeing and mass beauty categories, in the past financial year.

5. change how we work 
a renewed matas calls for new ways of working, particularly within four key areas:  
commercial excellence helps strengthen customer relations and drive earnings. the efforts to renew the product 
range continued in financial year 2020/21 through the launch of new brands and products. intensified focus on 
matas’ private labels led to a very successful relaunch of matas’ ‘stripes’ hair and body products and the 
introduction of new facecare products.  
the work with strategic supplier partnerships continued and led matas to launch a number of exclusive brands and 
products. the proportion of matas’ revenue generated by private labels and exclusive brands dropped to 15% in 
2020/21 from 16% in 2019/20. this was due to lower makeup sales, the only main category to experience a setback 
during the covid-19 pandemic. 
in spring 2020, matas launched a strategic project entitled ways of working (matas wow) with a view to further 
optimising and digitalising in-store operational and sales processes. store processes were analysed, and the most 
appropriate methods implemented with a view to optimising operations and freeing up more time for customers. 
matas wow makes it easier for store management teams to delegate responsibilities to employees while at the same 
time supporting training and career development across stores.  
in terms of logistics, the relocation of the matas.dk webshop to new premises in humlebæk north of copenhagen in 
autumn 2019 enabled matas to accommodate rapidly changing demand patterns and secure fast delivery to 
customers. all orders placed during black week 2020 had been processed by wednesday the following week. the 
surge in sales through matas.dk also led the webshop at humlebæk to temporarily upgrade by hiring more than 200 
employees over autumn and christmas 2020.   
initiatives to optimise logistics and collaboration agreements with logistics suppliers made additional headway in the 
financial year. matas’ plans for the future logistics set-up (project log) is expected to result in a number of concrete 
initiatives in the current financial year that will require significant investments.  
in the media field, matas strengthened its collaboration with suppliers through supplying them with media-strategic 
advice based on the invaluable insights generated via club matas. matas further accelerated the growth of its 
digital media through the launch of new media channels and packages, including in the matas app, at matas.dk 
and on matas’ social media channels.  
the sales excellence track optimises the ways in which matas meets its customers in the new matas life stores, the 
company's other stores, at matas.dk and in firtal's webshops. this is achieved through locally customised product 
ranges and product placements based on statistical, data-based analysis models. in addition, the ongoing efforts to 
improve store operations through process optimisation based on lean principles continues. the customer experience 
at matas.dk was continually enhanced throughout the financial year.  
the customer excellence track is focused on lifting customer satisfaction and enhancing customer engagement via 
matas’ own channels, including club matas, some and the matas leaflet, on simplifying and digitalising the customer 
journey and on using customer data to ensure relevant, personalised communication with the many active club 
matas members. new ways of communicating developed as part of the matas media platform ensure that club 
matas members are made aware of new relevant products and brands.  
developing new ways of meeting customers on online platforms constitutes an important part of matas’ customer 
excellence efforts, and a number of new digital services were implemented in the financial year, including matas 
skin consultation, an online customer advice service manned by dedicated, specially selected beauty and health 
therapists and a live online shopping service offering customers direct interaction with the beauty and health 
therapists and product specialists hosting the event. at 31 march 2021, the club matas app had more than 800,000 
active users against 780,000 the year before.  
the people & tech excellence track involves the development of two key assets: the technological platform and 
matas’ employees. matas’ it platform is developed on an ongoing basis with a view to supporting the group’s 
strategic priorities, focus being on sustaining matas’ leading technology position in retailing and on ensuring matas 
has a robust it infrastructure to provide strategic and operational agility.  
the work in relation to culture and people, including rethinking how matas works, also continued in the past financial 
year with focus being on renewing and simplifying processes, establishing a new physical setting at matas’ head 
office and making collaboration and job satisfaction key focal points of executive development programmes.

the purpose of matas group’s new strategic direction is to promote health and beauty for life. matas aims to be the 
preferred supplier of health and beauty products and advice to danish consumers throughout their lives. the 
ambition is to create a digital health & beauty group based on nordic values. 
the strategy builds on three mutually supportive platforms: ecommerce, connected retail and brands. the 
interaction between these platforms enables profitable growth and offers protection against competitive threats 
through differentiation. each platform has its own growth and investment programme designed to support the 
group's development which may include acquisitions. key to the three growth platforms is the core, covering the 
core competencies and assets accumulated by matas group over a number of years. 
underlying the strategic direction going forward to 2025/26 is matas’ csr/esg strategy, which underpins the group's 
competitive edge by building the strategic ambition around nordic values. the csr/esg strategy's main areas of 
focus are sustainability, health and diversity. 
financially, the new strategic direction is shaped to enable matas group to boost long-term growth, maintain its 
leading position in terms of profitability and complete the digital transition by doubling of our online revenue.

performance relative to 2020/21 financial guidance  
due to the covid-19 pandemic, matas entered financial year 2020/21 without any financial guidance. matas 
provided its first 2020/21 guidance in connection with the release of its q1 interim report in august and subsequently 
upgraded the guidance three times based on a favourable revenue and ebitda margin performance.  
 
revenue growth for financial year 2020/21 was realised at 12.9% and underlying like-for-like revenue growth was 
13.5%. ebitda before special items as a percentage of revenue was 19.1%.  
the guidance for capex at dkk 120 – 140 million and for the gearing ratio at 2.5 – 3 was maintained from the release 
of the q1 interim report through to year-end.  
capex was realised at dkk 148 million, slightly above expectations, due to significant investments in measures to 
secure capacity to handle growing online sales. investments in the retail network fell year on year. 
the financial gearing ratio was 2.2 at 31 march 2021, below the announced target interval of 2.5 – 3.  
the board of directors recommends to the annual general meeting that a dividend of dkk 2 per share be declared 
and paid and that shares in the amount of dkk 75 million be bought back and most of them cancelled. combined, 
the proposed dividends and buybacks will be equivalent to 42% of the adjusted profit after tax for the year.

financial guidance for 2021/22 
revenue is expected in the range of dkk 4,080 – 4,250 million, corresponding to growth of between 
-2% and +2% 
the ebitda margin before special items is expected in the range of 17% – 18.5% 
investments excluding acquisitions and a possible logistics project (project log) are expected in 
the dkk 140 –160 million range. 
 
financial guidance for financial year 2021/22 is subject to above-normal uncertainty due to the unpredictable 
nature of the covid-19 pandemic and its ramifications for society in general and the retail industry in particular. 
matas has strengthened its market position both organically and through acquisitions and therefore expects to 
maintain revenue at the higher level in 2021/22 despite the exceptionally strong growth recorded in 2020/21.    
matas benefited from a number of extraordinary factors in 2020/21: a general increase in consumer spending on 
groceries, household goods and personal care products, increased demand for health products (personal 
protective equipment in particular), reduced competition from, especially, travel retail and the effects of stimulus 
packages (the release of frozen holiday pay). overall, these factors are estimated to have lifted revenue by dkk 125 
– 150 million in 2020/21, a lift which is expected to be gradually reversed in the course of 2021/22.  
revenue guidance for 2021/22 is based on the following basic assumptions: 
- 
continued, but moderate, growth in consumer spending  
- 
no significant restrictions or retail sector lockdowns during the financial year 
- 
a gradual normalisation of trading patterns and travel activity in the second half of calendar year 2021 
- 
no sales of personal protective equipment but continued strong demand for health products  
- 
continuing shift in sales channels from physical to online shopping but at a more moderate pace than in 
2020/21 
- 
moderately increasing competition, especially online 
given the considerable uncertainty surrounding revenue developments, the 2021/22 earnings performance is also 
subject to increased uncertainty. on the other hand, the profitability of the online business improved considerably in 
2020/21, which means that the expected continued shift in revenue streams from physical stores to online channels 
will not have a significant negative impact on profitability.  
earnings guidance is based on the following assumptions:  
- 
a stable earnings level in physical stores and at matas.dk  
- 
accelerated digital business development activity across matas, which is expected to squeeze the ebitda 
margin by up to 1% in the short term but will secure the company’s long-term growth 
matas has previously provided guidance for both overall revenue growth and underlying like-for-like growth, the 
latter forecast being adjusted for the effects of store openings and closures. given online revenue’s steadily growing 
proportion of overall revenue and the fact that matas expects to continue the consolidation of the store network in 
2021/22, this division is no longer relevant. accordingly, matas will not provide separate like-for-like revenue guidance 
going forward but will continue to report this figure.  
for 2021/22, matas expects capex of dkk 140 – dkk 160 million, excluding acquisitions within web health (see note 
27, events after the date of the statement of financial position) and any other acquisitions, with investments being 
allocated primarily towards it and to a lesser extent towards physical stores. if a decision is made to proceed with the 
logistics project (project log), the total level of investments will increase significantly.  
 
 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
15 
allocation of capital and dividend policy  
matas group’s capital structure must at all times ensure the financial flexibility required to implement the strategic 
objectives announced.  
based on matas’ commitment to secure the company’s long-term growth potential and profitability, investments are 
expected to remain at a historically high level. as a consequence, going forward, distributions by way of dividends 
and share buybacks are expected to amount to at least 20% compared with the previous 30% or more of adjusted 
profit after tax. 
forward-looking statements 
the annual report contains statements relating to the future, including statements regarding matas’ future operating 
results, financial position, cash flows, business strategy and future targets. such statements are based on 
management’s reasonable expectations and forecasts at the time of release of this report. forward-looking 
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a number of other factors, many of which are beyond matas' 
control. this may have the effect that actual results may differ significantly from the expectations expressed in the 
report. without being exhaustive, such factors include general economic and commercial factors, including market 
and competitive conditions, supplier issues and financial and regulatory issues as well as any effects of healthcare 
measures that are not specifically mentioned above.

performance in 2020/21 
revenue in 2020/21 
matas group generated total revenue of dkk 4,164 million in financial year 2020/21, a year-on-year increase of 12.9% 
from dkk 3,689 million in 2019/20.   
consolidated revenue 2016/17 to 2020/21 (dkkm)  
 
  
sales in webshops and physical stores operated by the group in both 2020/21 and 2019/20 (underlying growth) were 
up by 13.5%, which was in line with the full-year revenue guidance announced on 25 february 2021 forecasting 
underlying revenue growth in 2020/21 of more than 12%.  
the revenue was supported by increased sales in the health & wellbeing, high-end beauty and mass beauty 
segments compared with 2019/20. overall footfall was slightly up, and the number of transactions rose by 0.3%. the 
average basket size grew by 13.0%, which was very satisfactory.  
online sales via matas.dk and firtal group were up by 99.6% year on year to account for 26.0% of overall revenue 
compared with 14.7% in 2019/20. 
sales at matas’ own retail stores and via webshops grew by dkk 485 million, or 13.3%, relative to 2019/20 with strong 
growth in online sales more than offsetting the decline in physical store sales. the difference between the underlying 
increase of 13.5% and the own store revenue growth rate of 13.3% was attributable to firtal’s acquisition of din frisør 
shop aps and the net effect of store closures and openings. acquisitions and new stores are not included in 
underlying growth until after 13 months. 
wholesale revenue etc., including kosmolet, was down by dkk 10 million. revenue from club matas relating to 
partners and value adjustments of club matas points is included in this item. this revenue fell sharply, partially 
because the club matas partner programme was discontinued at the end of august 2020. 
the high-end beauty category grew revenue by 13.3% in 2020/21, and sales of mass beauty products were up by 
9.9% year on year. skincare and fragrances reported the strongest sales growth, due partly to weaker competition 
from travel retail. 
the beauty segment’s share of total revenue was 70.2% in 2020/21 against 71.2% in 2019/20. 
18  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
the health & wellbeing category boosted sales by an impressive 18.7%. the increase was driven by higher sales of 
covid-19-related articles such as face masks and hand sanitiser (personal protective equipment). personal protective 
equipment accounted for about 5 percentage points of the 18.7% increase in health & wellbeing sales. 
in summary, 2020/21 revenue was supported by a favourable competitive climate with little competition from travel 
retail. in addition, increasing demand for personal protective equipment and health products in general drove the 
higher footfall in pharmacies and matas alike. the effects of stimulus packages (the release of frozen holiday pay) 
also contributed to matas’ 2020/21 revenue. 
the above-mentioned factors mainly benefited sales in the high-end beauty and health & wellbeing categories. 
sales of personal protective equipment amounted to about dkk 50 million, while the positive revenue impact from 
the competitive climate and the payout of frozen holiday pay is estimated at dkk 75 – 100 million.

revenue in q4 2020/21 
revenue for q4 2020/21 came to dkk 971 million, a year-on-year increase of 18.9%. the strong sales growth should 
be seen in light of the weak final quarter of 2019/20, which was affected by covid-19 with mandatory closures in 
large parts of the retail sector, which had an adverse impact on overall footfall. 
overall retail revenue was up by dkk 155 million, or 19.2%, to dkk 960 million, as the increase in online sales more than 
offset the decline in physical store sales. wholesale revenue was down by dkk 0.6 million to dkk 11 million, a year-on-
year decrease of 4.8%.  
underlying sales, i.e. sales in stores operated by the group in both q4 2020/21 and q4 2019/20, were up by 19.8%.  
online sales via matas.dk and firtal group were up by 99.5% year on year to account for 32.4% of overall q4 revenue 
compared with 19.3% in q4 2019/20.

costs and operating performance in 2020/21 
gross profit for 2020/21 was dkk 1,841 million, a 12.2% increase from dkk 1,640 million in 2019/20. 
the gross margin for 2020/21 was 44.2%, marginally down from 44.5% in 2019/20.  
up by dkk 91 million, overall costs (other external costs and staff costs) amounted to 25.3% of revenue against 26.1% 
the year before. adjusted for special items, which amounted to dkk 9.1 million in 2020/21 and dkk 11.1 million in 
2019/20, overall costs increased by dkk 93 million year on year, driven mainly by higher marketing and logistics costs 
as a consequence of the increased activity in the online area, which, however, also benefited from greater 
economies of scale and, by extension, a relative decline in costs compared with last year.    
other external costs amounted to dkk 301 million in 2020/21, up from dkk 222 million in 2019/20. adjusted for special 
items, which amounted to dkk 6.7 million in 2020/21 and dkk 3.9 million in 2019/20, other external costs were up by 
dkk 76 million year on year.  
the increase in other external costs is explained as follows: 
• 
marketing and logistics costs were up by dkk 85 million as a result of strong online sales growth and the 
continued digital build-up 
• 
covid-19-related costs amounted to dkk 4 million 
• 
underlying other external costs were down by some dkk 13 million, reflecting the group’s ongoing efforts to 
rationalise operations 
other external costs amounted to 7.2% of revenue in 2020/21, up from 6.0% in 2019/20. other external costs 
measured as a percentage of revenue are expected to continue the upward trend as long as online sales continue 
to grow at the current high rate with a higher proportion of costs relating to the online business being classified as 
other external costs, including marketing and logistics costs. 
staff costs amounted to dkk 752 million in 2020/21, a dkk 12 million increase from dkk 740 million in 2019/20. adjusted 
for special items, which amounted to dkk 2.4 million in 2020/21 and dkk 7.2 million in 2019/20, staff costs were up by 
dkk 17 million year on year.  
the increase in staff costs was driven by the strong increase in online activity, while underlying physical store staff 
costs declined.  
sales channels 
at 31 march 2021, matas consisted of 265 physical stores – 263 stores in denmark, one in the faroe islands and one 
associated store in greenland. 73% of revenue in the financial year was generated by the group’s physical stores.  
in addition, matas was present online through matas.dk and 12 webshops run by firtal, of which the most important are 
helsebixen.dk, jala-helsekost.dk and made4men.dk. 26% of revenue was generated through the group’s online channels. 
wholesale sales, including wholesale sales from kosmolet, accounted for 1% of overall sales. 
the group has no physical activities outside denmark as the store in the faroe islands and the associated store in 
greenland are considered danish stores in this context. 
categories 
matas is characterised by its wide product range within beauty, personal care, health & wellbeing and problem-solving 
household products. this broad product range creates a unique one-stop retail value proposition for the group's 
customers in the shape of four categories:   
high-end beauty: luxury beauty products, including cosmetics, skincare and haircare products and fragrances.   
mass beauty: everyday beauty products and personal care, including cosmetics and skincare and haircare products.  
health & wellbeing: medicare (otc medicine and nursing products). vitamins, minerals, supplements, specialty foods and 
herbal medicinal products. sports, nutrition and exercise. mother and child. personal care products (oral, foot and 
intimate care and hair removal). special skincare.  
other: clothing and accessories (footwear, hair ornaments, jewellery, toilet bags, etc.). house and garden (cleaning and 
maintenance, electrical products, interior decoration and textiles) and other revenue.  
20  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
staff costs amounted to 18.1% of revenue in 2020/21 against 20.1% in 2019/20.  staff costs as a percentage of 
revenue are expected to continue to fall as long as online sales continue to grow at the current high rate. 
2020/2021 staff costs were favourably affected by an extraordinary increase of  dkk 30 million in the grant received 
in connection with the training of beauty and health therapist trainees, whereas costs increased by dkk 10 million as 
a result of the extraordinary bonus paid to all employees in recognition of their considerable efforts during the covid-
19 pandemic. lastly, management estimates that covid-19-related precautions in the form of covid-19 guides at the 
stores etc. added some dkk 6 million to staff costs. the company has decided not to account for these costs as 
special items. 
the 2020/21 staff costs included dkk 6.2 million related to the company’s long-term share-based compensation 
programme. the equivalent amount in 2019/20 was dkk 7.0 million. 
in the 2020/21 financial year, the group had 2,152 full-time employees (fte), against 2,197 in 2019/20.

(1.0) million in 2019/20, other external costs were up by dkk 32 million year on year. the increase was driven mainly by 
higher marketing and logistics costs as a consequence of increased activity in the online area.

amortisation, depreciation and impairment 
total amortisation, depreciation and impairment charges were up by dkk 22 million to dkk 408 million in 2020/21, 
driven by increased depreciation of investments made as part of the group’s ‘renewing matas’ strategy. 
net financials and tax 
net financial expenses were down by dkk 16 million year on year to dkk 27 million in 2020/21. the decline was

the company in october 2013 in relation to the proceedings concerning withholding tax on interest instituted by the 
tax authorities.

statement of financial position  
total assets amounted to dkk 6,143 million at 31 march 2021, down from dkk 6,588 million at 31 march 2020.  
current assets totalled dkk 984 million, a year-on-year decline of dkk 248 million attributable to the settlement of a 
dispute with former owners concerning withholding tax in combination with a significant decline in inventories and a 
drop in cash and cash equivalents.   
inventories amounted to dkk 867 million at 31 march 2021, a decline of dkk 96 million compared with the level at 31 
march 2020, reflecting ongoing stock optimisation efforts, which include a new order management system and 
consolidation of campaign purchases. covid-19-related inventories of, e.g., face masks and disinfectants amounted 
to dkk 23 million at 31 march 2021 against dkk 4 million at 31 march 2020. 
inventories accounted for 20.8% of ltm revenue at 31 march 2021 compared with 26.1% at 31 march 2020. 
trade receivables increased by dkk 0.5 million to dkk 15 million, while trade payables increased by dkk 106 million 
relative to 31 march 2020 to dkk 692 million.  
net working capital excluding deposits was minus dkk 126 million at 31 march 2021 against dkk 90 million at 31 
march 2020, an improvement of dkk 216 million that was mainly due to lower inventories combined with a year-on-
year increase in trade payables. 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to dkk 41 million, down from dkk 107 million the year before.  
equity was dkk 3,039 million at 31 march 2021, compared with dkk 2,764 million at 31 march 2020.  
net interest-bearing debt was dkk 1,727 million at 31 march 2021, a year-on-year decline of dkk 772 million – 
equalling 2.2 times ltm ebitda before special items, which is below the long-term target of a gearing ratio between 
2.5 and 3. 
gross interest-bearing debt stood at dkk 1,768 million at 31 march 2021, including lease liabilities of dkk 670 million. at 
31 march 2020, gross interest-bearing debt was dkk 2,606 million, including lease liabilities of dkk 785 million. 
the group's current credit facilities will expire on 31 march 2022. matas anticipates a positive outcome of the 
ongoing negotiations regarding new credit facilities by the end of q1 2021/22. 
at 31 march 2021, the company had 38,291,492 shares of dkk 2.50 each in issue, corresponding to a share capital of 
dkk 95,728,730. after disposing of 81,034 shares in the period under review in connection with the exercise of the 
2017/18 incentive programme, matas held 22,943 treasury shares at 31 march 2021.

statement of cash flows  
cash generated from operations was an inflow of dkk 1,019 million in 2020/21 against an inflow of dkk 495 million in 
2019/20. the dkk 524 million increase was attributable in part to a higher profit before tax but primarily to a positive 
working capital change. the free cash flow was an inflow of dkk 774 million in 2020/21 against an inflow of dkk 111 
million in 2019/20. 
cash generated from operations in q4 2020/21 was an inflow of dkk 84 million, a year-on-year increase of dkk 35 
million. 
cash flows from investing activities were an outflow of dkk 178 million in 2020/21, compared with an outflow of dkk 
336 million the year before. the decline was attributable in part to the acquisitions of kosmolet and din frisør shop 
last year and in part to a drop in investments in the retail network in 2020/21 compared with 2019/20 that was only 
partially offset by larger digital investments. 
for q4 2020/21, cash flows from investing activities were an outflow of dkk 40 million against an outflow of dkk 66 
million in q4 2019/20. 
the q4 2020/21 free cash flow was an inflow of dkk 35 million, compared with an outflow of dkk 34 million in q4 
2019/20.  
cash flows from financing activities were a net outflow of dkk 840 million in 2020/21 against an outflow of dkk 166 
million last year, mainly reflecting the debt repayments made in 2020/21 in contrast to the new loans raised with 
credit institutions in 2019/20.

the parent company generated a profit of dkk 3 million in 2020/21 against a loss of dkk 13 million in 2019/20. the

about matas group  
matas is denmark’s largest beauty, personal care and health products retailer. over the past 70 years or so, matas 
has been a preferred supplier to danish consumers of nearly all categories of beauty, health and wellbeing products 
and has been named one of the best-known danish brands several times.  
matas’ history 
matas was established in 1949 as a chain of independent beauty and health products suppliers. in 1956, the chain 
was unified under a common logo, and a year later matas was granted permission to sell vitamins. in 1967, matas 
introduced the first ‘stripes’ and babycare products as low-end alternatives to common branded products. the 
stripes family has since evolved into a leading danish beauty and wellbeing brand. 
the vital shop with its product range of vitamins and supplements was launched in 1974. the matas natur brand was 
launched in 1989 and was followed by plaisir in 1993. two years later, in 1995, the first of matas’ private labels certified 
according to the nordic ecolabel standard were launched. in 2001, matas launched a series of products and a shop 
under the name of matas medicare.  
 
 
ownership changes and growth initiatives  
• 
in 2006, the matas chain consisted of almost 300 stores. in 2007, the store owners decided to sell matas a/s to 
cvc, the private equity fund. at the same time, cvc took over 208 matas stores.  
• 
matas.dk was launched in 2008, and 2010 saw the launch of the club matas loyalty programme designed to 
strengthen relations between matas and its customers. the club matas app was introduced in june 2011, and 
by 2012, club matas had more than 1 million members.  
• 
matas a/s was listed on omx copenhagen in june 2013.   
• 
in may 2018, matas launched its 2023 strategy entitled ‘renewing matas’.  
• 
in august 2018, matas acquired firtal group, which operates and owns a number of webshops, including 
helsebixen.dk, jala-helsekost.dk and made4men.dk. 
• 
march 2019 saw the launch of the first matas life concept store designed to offer customers a premier 
experience, and this concept has since been rolled out to a number of denmark's largest cities.   
• 
in march 2019, matas acquired kosmolet, the owner of the successful organic danish makeup brand nilens jord.  
• 
in august 2019, an 8,000 sqm webshop opened in humlebæk north of copenhagen to accommodate growing 
online sales. 
26

matas today 
over the past 70 years or so, matas has built its market position to its current strong level. 99% of danish women know 
matas. this widespread awareness is a major asset in building a strong, popular position. matas also has one of 
denmark’s largest loyalty clubs.  
the matas concept is quite unique in both a national and an international context with matas distributing up to 
22,000 items across all price categories at its physical stores alone. while the store concept primarily builds on 
makeup, skincare and fragrances, the health and wellbeing categories also make up a significant part of the 
assortment.  
private labels  
matas markets a number of house brands, including ‘stripes’, ‘matas natur’, ‘nilens jord’ and ‘plaisir’. matas currently 
offers almost 1,400 different private label products characterised by a sound balance between price and quality 
and reduced use of substances harmful to human health and the environment. private label products accounted for 
15% of total 2020/21 revenue, with the mass beauty segment as the biggest contributor. in 2019/20, private labels 
accounted for 16% of total revenue.  
competition 
matas’ main competitors in the high-end beauty segment are department stores, perfumeries, travel retailers and, to 
a lesser degree, e-businesses, while its principal competitors in the mass beauty segment are supermarkets, discount 
retailers, parallel importers, e-businesses and, to a lesser extent, department stores. in the health & wellbeing 
segment, matas primarily faces competition from pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets and to some 
extent also from e-businesses and discount retailers. 
omnichannel marketing strategy 
matas’ retail store concept is supported by centrally managed customer-focused marketing across channels. based 
on their shopping patterns in stores and on matas.dk, matas personalises information and offers to customers across 
sales channels and communication platforms. in addition, advertising leaflets are distributed to some 60% of all 
danish households every two weeks. 
marketing efforts are supported by club matas, which had 1.7 million members at 31 march 2021, of whom more 
than 1.4 million were active, shopping members. 
club matas enables matas to communicate clearly, directly and individually to club members based on their 
shopping history. matas continually works to personalise its communication in order to further enhance customer 
loyalty. this is made possible by closely coordinating club matas, the advertising leaflet, the webshop and social 
media activities, primarily on facebook and instagram.

risk management  
matas is exposed to operational risks affecting the retail industry in general and the beauty, wellbeing and health 
industries in particular.  
if, contrary to expectation, the covid-19 pandemic leads to new lockdowns of the retail industry and other parts of 
danish society, matas’ business may be severely affected. in addition, matas is to some extent exposed to financial 
risk such as interest rate, liquidity and credit risk.  
matas is exposed to digital attacks. matas constantly seeks to improve its cyber security. matas pursues a highly 
segmented network structure segregating data flows from stores, suppliers, employees and other business partners. 
matas continually monitors network traffic and performs regular data backups. 
risk management is an integral part of matas’ management process, the objective being to limit uncertainties and 
risks with respect to the defined financial targets and strategic objectives for the group.  
the executive management is responsible for preparing, implementing and maintaining control and risk 
management systems subject to the approval of the board of directors, which has the overall responsibility for 
management. based on reporting from the executive management, the audit committee continually monitors 
whether the company's internal control and risk management systems are effective and complied with, and it also 
continually monitors the development and handling of key risks. the board of directors is provided with an overview 
of the group’s key risks and their potential impact on group earnings at least once a year so that any measures 
necessary to mitigate such risks can be implemented.  
material operational risks 
changes in economic conditions 
matas is to a significant degree exposed to changes in the prevailing economic climate in denmark, the market 
from which matas derives virtually all of its revenue. matas is strongly exposed to developments in overall retail sales 
in denmark, and danish consumers have for quite some time been somewhat reluctant to spend, while at the same 
time spending is shifting to online channels. experience shows that in boom times, demand from matas’ customers 
tends to shift towards high-end beauty products, whereas demand for mass beauty products typically increases 
during periods of economic decline. management monitors sales trends in matas on a daily basis so that it can 
respond swiftly to any decline in sales by implementing sales-promoting initiatives.  
pandemic 
matas is to a significant degree exposed to changes in footfall in danish shopping centres, pedestrian zones and 
high streets. sales in matas stores located in shopping centres were adversely affected by the partial lockdown of 
shopping centres during parts of the financial year. if, contrary to expectation, a new wave of covid-19 leads to a 
full or partial lockdown of the retail industry and other parts of danish society, matas’ sales may be severely affected.  
international competition  
historically, matas has competed with a large number of danish retail market players such as supermarkets, including 
discount chains, local perfumeries, health food shops, pharmacies, department stores and travel retailers. with 
consumer behaviour changing and spending increasingly shifting to online channels, matas is currently facing 
increasing competition from danish and international webshops. focused on strengthening matas group’s 
competitive power vis-à-vis pure online players within beauty and wellbeing, danish and international alike, the 
’renewing matas’ strategy addresses this channel shift.   
 
 
28  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
industry developments  
the market for beauty, personal care, health and wellbeing products is subject to intense competition from 
established and new players alike and from growing online sales, which are supported by new ways of launching 
and marketing brands and by new technology-driven options. 
strategically, matas aims to bring its many assets into play in new ways in order to pursue the potential provided by a 
stronger market position. it strives to do this by increasing its focus on online trading, launching marketing campaigns, 
leveraging the club matas loyalty programme, developing the store network and enhancing the customer 
experience.  
products and suppliers  
in order to meet any changes in terms of delivery or reduced access to important product categories, matas deals 
with a large number of different suppliers and markets a broad range of different brands within each product 
category.  
product liability 
matas’ operations involve risks which could potentially result in product liability, including personal injury claims. 
matas has laid down a risk management policy and procedures to mitigate such risks and has also taken out 
standard insurance cover in this area. 
legislation and indirect taxation 
matas monitors closely any statutory and regulatory changes that could change the group’s business actions or 
provide new opportunities so that it can take the necessary steps as early as possible. 
data security 
matas has a modern, upgraded it infrastructure focused on data security and protection of the company’s and its 
customers’ data. matas continually considers security issues and risks when choosing system solutions and has 
established comprehensive safeguards to prevent data security breaches. 
matas is exposed to digital attacks and constantly seeks to improve its cyber security. matas pursues a highly 
segmented network structure segregating data flows from stores, suppliers, employees and other business partners. 
matas continually monitors network traffic and performs regular data backups. 
significant financial risks 
matas is to some extent exposed to financial risks such as interest rate, liquidity and credit risk. reference is made to 
note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these risks.

corporate governance 
matas is committed to exercising good corporate governance, and the board of directors therefore evaluates the 
group's management systems at least once a year to ensure that the structure is appropriate in relation to 
shareholders and other stakeholders.  
corporate governance recommendations 
nasdaq copenhagen has incorporated the recommendations of the danish committee on corporate governance 
in its rules for issuers of shares. these recommendations are available at the website of the committee on corporate 
governance, www.corporategovernance.dk. matas complies with all these recommendations. the group's 
corporate governance statements are available at the company's website at investor.matas.dk/governance.cfm. 
communicating with investors and other stakeholders 
matas is committed to maintaining a constructive dialogue and a high level of transparency when communicating 
with shareholders and other stakeholders in order to enable them to exercise the highest possible level of active 
ownership. the board of directors has therefore adopted a communication and stakeholder policy, an investor 
relations policy and a csr policy.  
matas complies with the statutory requirements concerning the publication of material information relevant to 
shareholders’ and the financial markets’ evaluation of the group's activities, business objectives, strategies and 
results. 
in addition to its investor relations policy and communication and stakeholder policy, the company has adopted 
internal procedures to ensure that the disclosure of information complies with applicable stock exchange 
regulations.  
all company announcements are published via nasdaq copenhagen and can subsequently be accessed from the 
company’s website at investor.matas.dk. all announcements are published in danish and english. 
matas publishes interim and annual financial statements and hosts webcasts and investor meetings after the release 
of each interim and annual report. in addition, the executive management and the investor relations department 
meet with danish and international investors and analysts on a regular basis. investors and analysts can also contact 
the investor relations department to clear up any questions regarding published reports, current events or trends, 
etc.  
moreover, the company's general meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders to exercise active ownership. 
the date of the general meeting and the deadline for submitting requests for specific proposals to be included on 
the agenda are announced not later than eight weeks before the contemplated date of the parent company's 
annual general meeting. in accordance with the articles of association, general meetings are convened by the 
board of directors at not more than five weeks' and not less than three weeks’ notice. notices convening general 
meetings are posted on the company’s website at investor.matas.dk and sent by other means to all registered 
shareholders who have so requested. 
shareholders are entitled to have specific business considered at the annual general meeting, provided that a 
written request to that effect is submitted to the board of directors not later than six weeks prior to the general 
meeting. attending shareholders may pose questions to the board of directors and the executive management 
concerning the items on the agenda. 
the company has adopted procedures in the event of takeover bids, according to which the board of directors will 
not without the acceptance of the general meeting attempt to counter a takeover bid by making decisions which 
effectively prevent shareholders from deciding on the takeover bid themselves. 
diversity in management 
the board of directors discusses diversity at the group’s management levels annually and sets measurable targets.  
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
31 
maintaining diversity on the board of directors in terms of competencies, experience, knowledge, gender and age is 
important. consisting of 50% men and 50% women, the board of directors meets the requirement for equal gender 
distribution in its supreme governing body.  
it is the ambition of the board of directors to retain the diversity in management so that the mix reflects equal gender 
distribution as defined in the danish companies act. the management of matas, including members of middle 
management, such as store managers, consists of just over 90% women.   
duties and responsibilities of the board of directors 
at matas a/s, management duties and responsibilities are divided between the company's board of directors and 
executive management. no one person is a member of both of these bodies, and no member of the board of 
directors has previously been a member of the executive management. matas a/s has laid down rules of procedure 
for the board of directors, which are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors.  
the board of directors holds 12 ordinary board meetings plus a strategy seminar each year and will further convene 
as required. in the 2020/21 financial year, 12 board meetings and one strategy seminar were held. in the 2019/20 
financial year, 13 board meetings and one strategy seminar were held.  
the executive management is in charge of the day-to-day management, while the board of directors supervises the 
work of the executive management and is responsible for the overall management and strategic direction.  
in relation hereto, the board of directors every year considers the group's overall strategy in order to ensure 
continuous value creation.  
the requirements for the executive management’s timely, accurate and adequate reporting to the board of 
directors and for the communication between these two corporate bodies are laid down in the rules of procedure of 
the executive management, which are reviewed annually and approved by the board of directors. 
election of members to the board of directors 
the board of directors consists of six members elected by the annual general meeting for terms of one year. board 
members are eligible for re-election. the board of directors elects a chairman and a deputy chairman from among 
its own members. 
composition of the board of directors 
the members of the board of directors are a group of experienced business professionals who also represent 
diversity, international experience and skills that are considered to be relevant to matas. with five out of six 
shareholder-elected members considered to be independent, the overall board is considered to be independent. as 
from 2019, the sixth shareholder-elected member is no longer considered to be independent due to that member’s 
length of service on the board of directors. 
once a year, in connection with the board evaluation, the board of directors defines the qualifications, experience 
and skills the board of directors must possess in order for the board to best perform its tasks, taking into account the 
group's current needs.  
the board of directors evaluates its work on an annual basis.

internal controls and risk management in relation to the financial reporting process 
in order to ensure that the external financial reporting is in accordance with ifrs and other applicable rules, gives a 
true and fair view and is free of material misstatement, a number of internal control and risk management 
procedures have been established for the financial reporting process. 
control environment 
the board of directors lays down the general framework for internal controls and risk management in the group, 
while the executive management has the operational responsibility for establishing efficient control and risk 
management in the financial reporting. the executive management oversees that policies and working procedures 
in connection with the financial reporting are appropriate with a view to mitigating the risk of errors. the internal 
controls are the responsibility of the individual departments, and the accounting and controlling functions are 
segregated.  
the audit committee assists in monitoring the financial reporting process. this includes an annual evaluation of the 
efficiency of the risk management and internal controls, including a review of policies and working procedures and 
an evaluation of staffing and qualifications in the finance and it organisations.  
each year, the audit committee assesses the need for an internal audit department. based on the relatively low 
complexity of the group, the controlling function’s line of reference to the cfo and the ongoing dialogue with the 
auditors, it has as yet not been deemed necessary to establish an internal audit department.  
risk assessment 
the board of directors and the executive management regularly assess the key risks involved in the financial reporting 
based on a materiality concept. this includes an evaluation of general accounting policies and critical accounting 
estimates and the related risk and sensitivity assessment. the risk of fraud is also assessed. for additional information 
on critical accounting estimates, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
control activities 
in order to monitor results, store performance, financing and other risks, standardised monthly reports following up on 
budgets and a number of key performance indicators (kpis) are prepared.  
interim financial statements are closed according to a well-established plan which includes, among other things, 
reconciliation of all material line items and additional financial controls in order to identify and eliminate any errors as 
early as possible. in order to ensure segregation of duties, the controlling function reports directly to the executive 
management through the cfo.  
in order to counter fraud in the stores, cash funds are reconciled on a regular basis, and cash is deposited with 
banks. dual approval procedures in connection with bank transfers have been set up in the finance function.  
information and communication 
the group has established a standardised process for external reporting to ensure that a true and fair view is 
provided of its performance. 
regard being had to matas’ internal rules on inside information, the group maintains an open communication 
process which ensures efficient control of its performance and financial reporting that provides a true and fair view. 
providing clarity for each employee with respect to his or her role and relevant working procedures is an important 
element of this.  
monitoring 
management conducts its ongoing monitoring based on the monthly financial reporting, liquidity analyses and kpi 
reports combined with a continuous dialogue with the accounting and controlling functions.  
the audit committee monitors and reports to the board of directors on the procedures for the key line items and 
checks that the executive management observes group policies and addresses any weaknesses. the external 
34  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
auditors meet with the audit committee at least once a year without the executive management and report any 
material weaknesses in their long-form audit report.  
the group has also established a whistleblower scheme, through which breaches of laws and regulations can be 
reported anonymously if the person reporting a concern wishes to avoid using the normal channels of 
communication. more details on the whistleblower scheme can be found in the section on corporate social 
responsibility.

corporate social responsibility 
the adaptability of the group’s business was tested to the bone in financial year 2020/21, while matas’ position in 
society in terms of supporting public health was in focus as 265 stores remained open during the global pandemic.   
all the group’s some 2,500 employees, the retail and warehouse staff in particular, have worked for a year on the 
covid-19 frontline, providing a safe place to shop for the many customers needing everything from personal 
protective equipment to personal care and health products at the group’s physical stores and online. 
as a natural consequence of the role assumed by matas during the pandemic, the group has upgraded its 
corporate social responsibility ambitions in relation to its main focus areas of sustainability, health and diversity to 
include new priority areas, such as digital health, as well as the group’s traditional core business. 
csr goals 
matas is denmark's largest beauty, personal care, healthcare and health products retailer and as such in close 
touch with a large section of the danish population. 
matas has divided its corporate social responsibility efforts into three main areas: sustainability, health and diversity.  
sustainability denotes the work to give customers access to green and sustainable products, the work to safeguard 
the local environment through systematic efforts to reduce and recycle transport and packaging plastics and the 
work to reduce co2 emissions at all levels of the business.  
health* is defined as the work to promote the health of the general danish population by offering a wide range of 
safe and well-tested health products and an unwavering commitment to providing competent and reliable advice 
online and at the stores. moreover, matas has stepped up its awareness campaign activity concerning sunscreen 
products in collaboration with the danish cancer society, skin problems in collaboration with asthma-allergy 
denmark and on general health advice in collaboration with the danish heart foundation.  
diversity reflects matas’ widespread contact with largely all danish consumers and its related responsibility for 
facilitating a debate on a more balanced view of beauty and mental wellbeing. matas wants to use its 
communications platforms to promote a debate on young girls’ self-esteem and, not least, on not having to 
succumb to pressure to be or look a certain way to feel good about yourself. to that end, matas works with, among 
others, the pride organisation and the girltalk.dk ngo. 
*renamed from “peace of mind”’, the ‘health’ focus area now also embraces the group’s ambitions to play a more 
prominent role in relation to the health of the danish population. 
 
 
36  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
ve new gueposts for corporate social responsibility 
with a view to increasing awareness of and monitoring matas’ efforts in relation to corporate social responsibility, the 
group has defined four specific goals that will be reflected in all future endeavours. these goals apply to day-to-day 
contact between customers and employees and include the more general ambition of contributing towards solving 
some of the major environmental and climate challenges facing the world.  
the common global ambitions defined in the paris agreement, the un global compact and a number of targets 
under the 17 un sustainable development goals are embedded in the goals defined as matas ‘most important 
guideposts. 
1: co2-neutral by 2030  
matas is committed to reducing co2 emissions and aims to be co2-neutral by 2030. in the course of the financial 
year, matas will define sub-targets for how the group can achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and how it can induce 
its many suppliers to also achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.  
2: eliminating100 million plastic units 
matas is committed to promoting a more sustainable transition of the retail industry. as part of this commitment, 
matas will eliminate at least 100 million plastic units from its business. this may be packaging, transport plastics, plastic 
bags, etc. the matas return system, which, dating back to 1993, invites customers to return empty packaging at any 
matas store, will be a part of this overall goal.  
3: promoting public health 
matas is committed to promoting the general health of the danish population by offering an extended range of 
healthy products and competent advice by trained beauty and health therapists and pharmaconomists. at the 
same time, matas aims to provide danish consumers with easy and secure access to health advice through digital 
channels through the development of matas’ own digital platforms and through matas’ collaboration partners, 
including webapoteket.dk, a major danish online pharmacy. as a leading beauty, wellbeing and health influencer in 
denmark, matas is committed to promoting the mental health and wellbeing of the danish population through its 
product offering, communications and customer interactions.   
4: best place to work in the retail industry 
matas aims to be a lighthouse among denmark’s big retail chains. this goal is divided into a number of sub-
ambitions, such as enhancing employee satisfaction, strengthening diversity in management across business areas, 
including by focusing on training female managers, general training and skills upgrading opportunities for the 
employees and involvement of the employees at all levels through the establishment of local ambassador teams.  
matas will report on these four guideposts in the annual report for 2021/22.

international framework agreements and enhanced reporting 
as part of its work to strengthen and systematise its corporate social responsibility efforts, matas discloses which 
national and international framework agreements it supports, is a signatory to or aims to be a signatory to.  
the 17 un sustainable development goals 
the sustainable development goals (sdgs) comprise 17 specific goals and 169 targets committing all 193 un 
member states to end poverty and hunger everywhere, reduce inequalities, ensure quality education and good 
health and wellbeing and promote decent jobs for everyone along with sustainable economic growth. the sdgs 
also promote peace, security, strong institutions and aim to strengthen global partnerships. 
matas’ corporate social responsibility efforts are focused on four of the un’s 17 sustainable development goals:  
• 
goal 5: gender equality (target 5.5: focusing on the number of women in senior management and on the 
board of directors) 
• 
goal 8: decent work and economic growth (target 8.8: protecting labour rights at matas’ sub-suppliers) 
• 
goal 12: responsible consumption and production (targets 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6: reducing the use of 
chemicals and managing waste) 
• 
goal 14: life below water (target 14.1: minimising microplastic litter harmful to marine ecosystems) 
the paris agreement 
adopted in 2015, the goal of the paris agreement is to limit global warming to ‘well below’ 2 degrees celsius. limiting 
co2 emissions to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally is the most important tool for 
achieving this goal. matas contributes towards these goals by working to become carbon-neutral by 2030 and 
through its sub-target to encourage its many suppliers to also become carbon-neutral by 2030. 
un global compact  
matas recently applied to become a signatory to the un global compact. the un global compact, the largest 
global voluntary initiative for responsible companies, provides a common framework for communicating progress on 
and commitment to responsible governance. accordingly, matas has committed to complying with the 
organisation's ten main principles: 
  
1. 
businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights 
2. 
businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses 
3. 
businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective 
bargaining 
4. 
businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour 
5. 
businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour 
6. 
businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 
7. 
businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges 
8. 
businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility 
9. 
businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 
10. businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery  
 
 
 
38  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
esg reporting 
matas will implement a new reporting tool intended to enhance transparency on areas subject to statutory reporting 
requirements and areas which, in matas’ assessment, should be easily appraised by internal and external 
stakeholders.  
systematised according to standards and tools developed and refined by, among others, the financial sector 
through the past decades, the reporting is centred around the three basic esg (environmental, social and 
governance) principles which are also the foundation of the ten main principles of the un global compact. thus, 
starting in the current financial year, the gri (global reporting initiative) standards 
(https://www.globalreporting.org/) will be phased into future annual reports and updates at matas’ investor relations 
site, www.investor.matas.dk.   
the main risks and actions within the main areas are defined as:  
environment: matas believes that the company's key environmental risks are related to unwanted chemicals, the use 
of problematic ingredients (such as non-certified palm oil) in products sold by matas and overall consumption of 
plastics in connection with its operations, including product packaging. matas aims to expand the portfolio of swan-
labelled, blue label-certified and rspo-certified (certified palm oil) products and to reuse part of its product 
packaging through, e.g., the matas return system.      
climate: matas believes that the company's key climate risks are currently related to power consumption at its stores 
and co2 emissions from the transport of parcels from online purchases. matas works continually to reduce power 
consumption at its stores and to contain transport-related co2 emissions. 
human rights: matas’ private labels are developed and manufactured in denmark. accordingly, matas believes that 
the company's key risks in relation to human rights are related to the use of child labour by sub-suppliers and the 
extraction of minerals etc. from occupied territories subject to international embargoes. matas strives to influence 
sub-supplier conduct by incorporating code of conduct clauses into supplier agreements.  
social and employee-related matters job dissatisfaction represents matas’ key risk in relation to employee 
conditions, while the risk of work-related accidents and attrition is not as significant but obviously still present, 
especially at the group’s central warehouse and webshop. striving to continuously improve employee satisfaction, 
matas conducts an employee satisfaction survey once a year. these surveys are customised for hq, warehouse, 
webshop and stores so that appropriate targeted action may subsequently be taken.

financial year due to a number of renovations and the establishment of new and larger stores.    
*3: approx. 9,000 of vaccinations were against pneumonia and approx. 17,000 against the flu. 
*4: the number of swan-labelled and blue label-certified products has fallen slightly due to a general decline in the number of product types, 
especially within sunscreen products.  
*5: since 2018/19, employee satisfaction has been measured on a scale of 1-10 (previously 1-5). in addition, surveys are now customised 
according to business units. the satisfaction measurement method / evi (evidence-based measurement) applied since 2020 (as3) builds on 15 
evidence-based questions divided into four categories. conducted quarterly, the survey includes personal feedback, a personal stress score 
and the option to consult an occupational psychologist. the four areas surveyed are: job meaningfulness, management and cooperation, 
organisational values and work-life rhythm. all employees, temporary and permanent, are invited to participate in the survey.

matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
private label policy (substitution by private labels)  
in the past financial year, matas continued its proactive efforts to improve all the group’s private label products to 
align them with the latest knowledge about environmental and consumer health impacts. matas believes that the 
company's key environmental risks are related to unwanted chemicals in products soldby matas, its consumption of 
plastics in connection with operations and the use of problematic ingredients (such as non-certified palm oil) in 
products sold by matas. the following legal substances have been completely phased out of matas’ private labels: 
microplastics, methylisothiazolinone (mi), triclosane and all perfume substances subject to compulsory declaration. 
the same goes for all parabens, phthalates and all other substances on the eu list of potential endocrine disruptors. 
all private labels comprised by cosmetics legislation are subjected to ongoing bacteriological checks by eurofins 
steins laboratorium. 
 
policy for ingredients in matas’ private cosmetic labels 
matas is in the process of updating its cosmetics policy, which is expected to be implemented during financial 
year 2021/22.  
 
code of conduct for third-party labels 
in addition to the code of conduct governing private labels, all other products in matas’ product range are 
subject to contractual health and environmental requirements stricter than the danish statutory requirements. 
these requirements are laid down in the code of conduct for third-party labels. for example, matas’ suppliers 
have signed declarations that all products supplied to matas are free from pvc, lawsone and a number of other 
substances.  
diversity on the board of directors and among other executives 
matas group believes that a diverse composition of employees and executives contributes to strengthening the 
company’s competitiveness, performance and work environment. accordingly, matas strives for the company’s 
employees, executive management and board of directors to reflect the surrounding community and aims to have 
a reasonable gender balance in executive positions. the board of directors has an equal gender distribution with 
three women and three men. the broad group of executives at the headquarters in allerød consists of 55% women. 
in the retail network, 97% of store managers are women, which is consistent with the general gender distribution 
among the group’s approximately 2,500 shop assistants. efforts are being made specifically in the retail network to 
ensure a broad representation in terms of gender, age and origin in positions, and matas generally aims for both 
genders to be represented among candidates for executive positions. this was a priority also in 2020/21. in addition, 
the new trainee campaigns focus on having more people of both genders in recruitment films and on the 
ambassador teams established among trainees.  
 
human rights policy 
matas supports and respects internationally declared human rights as laid down in the ungp, including by 
avoiding to restrict the rights of its employees to establish labour unions, their freedom of association, right to 
collective bargaining and equal opportunities for women and men. in matas’ opinion, the risks of child labour 
being used, employees being discriminated against or employees’ right to establish labour unions being 
restricted by suppliers or their sub-suppliers constitute matas’ key risks in relation to human rights. accordingly, 
through its code of conduct, matas requires its suppliers to develop and produce their products without using 
child labour. this requirement is incorporated into all supplier agreements.  
matas is committed to promoting diversity among the group's employees, including proper female 
representation in middle and senior management and on the board of directors.  
the results of these efforts are presented in the section on corporate governance. no human rights violations 
were identified in the past financial year. 
privacy policy 
matas stores personal customer data on more than 1.6 million club matas members. in today’s digitalised world, 
personal customer data are a valuable and fragile resource which companies are legally and ethically bound to 
protect. matas is firmly committed to ensuring that personal customer data are never used for purposes for which a 
customer’s full consent has not been obtained and to ensuring full transparency for customers, including as to how 
customers can manage their own profiles.  
accordingly, matas is committed to assuring its customers that their data are treated with respect and in 
accordance with applicable data protection rules. matas makes consistent efforts to comply with applicable rules, 
including rules on transparency and data security. matas’ data protection policies are available at matas.dk. 
 
 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021

anti-corruption policy 
matas is exposed to the risk of non-compliance with anti-corruption legislation by employees, suppliers and other 
partners and to the potential indirect financial and legal effects of such non-compliance. matas’ policy is to 
comply with all applicable legislation and to actively work against corruption in all its forms. matas’ rules in this 
area clearly state that no employee may receive or solicit any services, gifts or payments that may be considered 
an attempt to obtain benefits for themselves or the company. violation of these rules will have serious disciplinary 
consequences for the employees involved.  
matas has set up a whistleblower scheme to allow its employees to anonymously report any suspicion of misconduct 
such as violations of matas’ internal policies or applicable legislation, fraud, etc. the whistleblower scheme was 
evaluated in the financial year, which resulted in a decision to introduce all new employees to the scheme on 
commencing employment. reports are submitted to matas in anonymised form through a portal. reports received 
can only be accessed by the chairman of the board of directors, the head of human resources and the head of 
safety and security. deletion of reports is subject to approval by two of these three people. it is possible to 
communicate with whistleblowers through an anonymised system. no reports were submitted in financial year 
2020/21. 
handling covid-19 
the primary risk facing matas during the covid-19 pandemic has been that of infection among its staff across the 
organisation, including shop assistants, and among customers. 
  
given the important role matas has played in society during the pandemic, implementing guidelines to ensure a safe 
shopping environment for staff and customers alike has been a key priority. guidelines for handling the risk of 
infection have been introduced as and when required, including rules on sanitising, social distancing and personal 
protective equipment, along with guidelines for employees on how and when to inform management in case of 
infection.  
right from the onset, extraordinary safety measures were implemented in order to secure a safe environment for the 
retail staff and customers alike.  
the staff was divided into groups at all levels of the organisation in an effort to reduce infection rates and contain the 
virus. new procedures were developed, significantly affecting the everyday lives of everyone involved. thanks to 
consistent management and relentless discipline, the incidence of covid-19 was lower among the group’s staff than 
in society at large, despite the stores staying open from day one. the situation was the same in the rest of the 
organisation, where the logistics and warehouse staff, in particular, worked exceptionally hard to accommodate the 
increase in business.

42% of matas’ adjusted profit for 2020/21, be distributed to the company's shareholders. half of this amount will be

statement by the board of directors and the 
executive management 
the board of directors and the executive management today considered and adopted the annual report of matas 
a/s for the financial year 1 april 2020 to 31 march 2021. 
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional disclosure requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the group’s and the parent company's assets and liabilities and financial position at 31 march 2021 and 
of the results of the group’s and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 april 2020 
to 31 march 2021. 
furthermore, in our opinion, the management's review includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business, the results for the year and of the group’s and the parent company's cash flows and financial 
position and describes the principal risks and uncertainties that the group and the parent company face.  
we recommend the annual report for approval at the annual general meeting.

matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
 
independent auditor’s report 
to the shareholders of matas a/s 
opinion  
we have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of matas a/s 
for the financial year 1 april 2020 – 31 march 2021, which comprise a statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of financial position, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including 
accounting policies, for the group as well as for the parent company. the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional requirements of the danish financial statements act.  
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the financial position of the group and the parent company at 31 march 2021 and of the results of the 
group's and the parent company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 april 2020 – 31 march 2021 in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional requirements of 
the danish financial statements act.  
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to the audit committee and the board of directors. 
basis for opinion  
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the 
“auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial 
statements” (in the following referred to as the “financial statements”) section of our report. we believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
independence 
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants’ 
code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and additional requirements applicable in denmark, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements.  
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as described in article 5(1) of 
regulation (eu) no. 537/2014. 
appointment of auditors 
subsequent to matas a/s being listed on nasdaq copenhagen, we were first appointed auditors of matas a/s on 30 
june 2014. we have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted 
engagement of seven years up to and including the financial year 2020/21. 
key audit matters  
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements for the financial year 1 april 2020 – 31 march 2021. these matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. for each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.  
we have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the “auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements” section, including in relation to these matters. accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. 
the results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the 
basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements. 
goodwill measurement  
the carrying amount of goodwill is dkk 3,930.6 million at 31 march 2021, corresponding to 64% of the group’s assets. 
goodwill has an indefinite useful life and must under international financial reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu (ias 36) be tested for impairment at least once a year. we did not identify any impairment of goodwill in the 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
49 
financial year. the impairment test is a key audit matter as it relies on assumptions and estimates made by 
management, including about future earnings.  
additional information about the amount of goodwill recognised is disclosed in notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated 
financial statements.   
during our audit, we checked the impairment test prepared by management, which is based on the discounted 
cash flow model, and assessed whether the assumptions made by management are reasonable. we assessed the 
relevance of the calculation model selected and assessed the discount factor and growth rate applied for 
extrapolation purposes. expected net cash flows are based on the budget for financial year 2021/22, extrapolation 
through the remaining budget period to 2025/26 and a terminal value. we examined budget preparation 
procedures and compared budgets with the group’s strategy work in the individual areas. in addition, we assessed 
the adequacy of the goodwill disclosures provided in notes 2 and 15. 
revenue recognition and measurement of performance obligations (loyalty programme)  
in connection with sales from own stores and the allocation of points under the club matas loyalty programme, a 
separate performance obligation related to the non-performed proportion of revenue relating to the allocation of 
club matas points is recognised. the related revenue is recognised as customers redeem their club matas points. the 
recognition of revenue and the measurement of not yet distributed club matas points are key audit matters as the 
statement was based on a fair value estimated by management that is inherently subject to uncertainty in respect of 
actual future redemption.  
additional information about the recognition of revenue and the measurement of prepayments from customers 
(performance obligations) in respect of club matas is disclosed in notes 2 and 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements.  
as regards the measurement of non-distributed club matas points, we checked the fair value measurement models 
applied by management and assessed the fair value of non-distributed club matas points on the basis of the value 
for the customer based on the conversion rate estimated by management and the future redemption rate 
estimated by management based on historical redemption rates. in addition, we tested the mathematical accuracy 
of the fair value model. 
statement on the management's review  
management is responsible for the management’s review.  
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the management’s review, and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.  
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management’s review and, in 
doing so, consider whether the management’s review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management's review provides the information required 
under the danish financial statements act.  
based on the work we have performed, in our view the management’s review is in accordance with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatement of the management’s review.  
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the danish financial statements act and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
independent auditor’s report  
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group's and the parent 
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless management either intends 
to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
50  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and additional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements.  
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:  
• 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. 
  
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s and the parent’s internal control. 
 
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.  
 
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause 
the group and the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
 
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures in the notes, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.  
 
• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.  
 
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.  
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021 
51 
independent auditor’s report  
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021

notes to the financial statements 
note 1 – accounting policies 
matas a/s is a public limited company domiciled in denmark. the annual report and the financial statements of the 
parent company, matas a/s, for the year ended 31 march 2021 include both the consolidated financial statements 
of matas a/s and its subsidiaries (the group) and the separate financial statements of the parent company, matas 
a/s. 
the consolidated financial statements of matas a/s and the financial statements of the parent company, matas a/s, 
for 2020/21 have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted 
by the eu and additional disclosure requirements of the danish financial statements act.  
the board of directors and the executive management considered and adopted the annual report of matas a/s for 
2020/21 on 27 may 2021. the annual report will be presented to the shareholders of matas a/s for approval at the 
annual general meeting to be held on 29 june 2021. 
basis of preparation 
the consolidated financial statements are presented in dkk, and all amounts are rounded to the nearest million dkk 
to one place of decimal (dkkm) unless otherwise stated.  
the accounting policies set out below have been used consistently in respect of the financial year and to 
comparative figures. for standards implemented prospectively, comparatives are not restated.  
matas a/s has implemented all new or amended financial reporting standards and interpretations adopted by the 
eu that apply to the financial year 1 april 2020 – 31 march 2021. these have not significantly affected matas’ annual 
report for 2020/21.  
alternative performance measures 
the annual report includes non-ifrs financial ratios. we believe that non-ifrs ratios provide investors and matas’ 
management with valuable information for purposes of evaluating the group's financial performance. as other 
companies may calculate these ratios in a different way than matas does, they may not be comparable with the 
ratios applied by other companies. accordingly, these financial ratios should not be considered a substitute for 
performance measures defined under ifrs. for a definition of the performance measures applied by matas, see 
‘definitions of key financials’. 
description of accounting policies 
consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company, matas a/s, and 
subsidiaries in which matas a/s has control. matas a/s has control of a company if the group is exposed to or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement in the company and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the company.   
in the assessment of whether the group has control, de facto control and potential voting rights that are real and of 
substance at the date of the statement of financial position are taken into account. 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a consolidation of the parent company’s and the 
individual subsidiaries’ financial statements prepared according to the group accounting policies. on consolidation, 
intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, intra-group balances and dividends, and realised and unrealised 
gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains to the extent that a write-down has not been made. 
the subsidiaries’ line items are included 100% in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
60 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
note 1 – accounting policies, continued 
 
business combinations 
entities acquired or formed during the year are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from the date of 
acquisition or formation. entities disposed of are recognised in the consolidated financial statements until the date of 
disposal. the comparative figures are not restated to reflect acquisitions. 
on acquisition of new businesses in which the group assumes control over the acquired business, the purchase 
method is applied. the acquired entities’ identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair 
value at the acquisition date. identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they are separable or arise from a 
contractual right. deferred tax on revaluations is recognised. 
the acquisition date is the date on which the group effectively assumes control of the acquired business. 
any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired (goodwill) is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets. goodwill is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment. the first impairment test is performed before the end of the acquisition year. upon 
acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit subsequently forming the basis for the impairment test.  
the consideration for a business consists of the fair value of the agreed consideration in the form of assets transferred, 
liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.  if part of the consideration is contingent on future events occurring 
or on agreed conditions being met, that part of the consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
contingent consideration that is not an equity instrument is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
costs attributable to business combinations are recognised directly in other external costs in the year in which they 
are incurred.  
if uncertainties exist regarding identification or measurement of acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities, 
initial recognition will take place on the basis of provisional values. if it subsequently becomes apparent that the 
identification or measurement of the purchase consideration, acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities was 
incorrect on initial recognition, the statement is adjusted retrospectively, including goodwill, until 12 months after the 
acquisition, and the comparative figures are restated. hereafter, goodwill is not adjusted. 
gains and losses on disposal of subsidiaries are stated as the difference between the sales amount and the carrying 
amount of net assets including goodwill at the date of disposal less cost of disposal. 
foreign currency translation 
on initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the 
exchange rates at the transaction date. foreign exchange differences arising between the exchange rates at the 
transaction date and at the date of payment are recognised as financial income or financial expenses. 
receivables and payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the 
functional currency at the exchange rates at the date of the statement of financial position. the difference between 
the exchange rates at the date of the statement of financial position and at the date at which the receivable or 
payable arose or was recognised in the latest consolidated financial statements is recognised as financial income or 
financial expenses. 
derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are recognised at the date a derivative contract is entered into and measured in the 
statement of financial position at fair value. positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are 
included in other receivables and payables, respectively, and set-off of positive and negative values is only made 
when the company has the right and the intention to settle several financial instruments net. fair values of derivative 
financial instruments are computed on the basis of current market data and generally accepted valuation methods. 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as a fair 
value hedge of recognised assets or liabilities are recognised in profit or loss together with changes in the fair value of 
the hedged asset or liability as regards the hedged portion. the portion of the value adjustment of a derivative 
hedging instrument that is not included in a hedge is presented in profit or loss under financial items. 
for derivative financial instruments that are not designated as and/or do not qualify as hedging instruments, changes 
in fair value are recognised as financial income or financial expenses.

note 1 - accounting policies, continued 
statement of comprehensive income 
revenue 
the group generates revenue from sales of mass beauty and high-end beauty products, vitamins, minerals and 
supplements, household and personal care products and over-the-counter medicine through the matas chain’s 
store network and webshops. 
the group’s sales agreements are divided into separately identifiable performance obligations (relating primarily to 
the club matas loyalty programme), which are recognised and measured separately at fair value. if a sales 
agreement comprises more than one performance obligation, the total sales value of the sales agreement is 
allocated proportionately to the individual performance obligations of the agreement. performance obligations in 
relation to the non-performed proportion of revenue related to the allocation of points (and stripes until february 
2021 when the stripes programme was discontinued) under the club matas loyalty programme are deducted. 
income from the sale of gift vouchers is recognised as revenue upon redemption, alternatively upon expiry of the 
validity period. 
revenue is recognised when control of the individual identifiable performance obligation passes to the customer. for 
matas, this is generally when the goods are handed over. 
revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration net of vat and taxes charged on behalf of third 
parties. all discounts granted are recognised in revenue. having regard to matas’ operations, with sales generally 
being made directly to consumers, the fair value corresponds to the agreed selling price net of discounts and the 
value of points earned by the customer. 
the proportion of the total consideration that is variable, for example in the form of discounts, bonus payments, etc., 
is recognised in revenue when it is reasonably certain that it will not be subsequently reversed due, for example, to 
non-redemption of points earned.  
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold comprises costs for purchase of goods for the year plus deviations in inventories in generating the 
revenue for the year.  
cost of goods sold is recognised after deduction of supplier discounts and bonuses. 
other external costs 
other external costs primarily comprise net marketing costs, administrative expenses and other operating and 
maintenance costs. 
staff costs 
staff costs comprise wages, salaries, pensions and other staff costs. 
share of profit or loss after tax of associates 
the group’s share of the profits or losses after tax of associates is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income after elimination of the proportionate share of intra-group gains/losses. 
financial income and expenses 
financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expenses and gains and losses on transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies. furthermore, amortisation of financial assets and liabilities, as well as surcharges 
and allowances under the tax prepayment scheme and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
which are not designated as hedging instruments are included. 
tax on the profit for the year  
the parent company and its danish subsidiaries are subject to the danish rules on mandatory joint taxation of the 
matas group. the jointly taxed entities are taxed under the tax prepayment scheme.  
matas a/s is the administration company in respect of the joint taxation and accordingly pays all corporation taxes 
to the tax authorities. 
on payment of joint taxation contributions, the current danish corporation tax is allocated between the jointly taxed 
entities in proportion to their taxable income.  
62 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
tax for the year comprises current tax and changes in deferred tax for the year. the tax expense is recognised in 
profit or loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
note 1 - accounting policies, continued 
statement of financial position 
intangible assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially recognised in the statement of financial position at cost as described under “business 
combinations”. subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not 
amortised. 
trademarks and trade names 
trademarks and trade names acquired in business combinations are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. trademarks and trade names are amortised on a straight-line basis over 15 
years. 
other intangible assets 
other intangible assets, which primarily comprise software and shares in co-operative property, including intangible 
assets acquired in business combinations, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3-10 years. 
property, plant and equipment 
land and buildings, fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment and leasehold improvements are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset 
is available for use.  
subsequent costs, e.g. in connection with replacement of components of property, plant and equipment, are 
recognised in the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that the costs will result in future economic benefits for 
the group. the replaced components are derecognised in the statement of financial position and their carrying 
amount transferred to profit or loss. all other costs for ordinary repairs and maintenance are recognised in profit or 
loss as incurred. 
where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately. depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful lives of the assets/components. the expected useful lives are as follows: 
buildings 
75 years 
building parts  
10-25 years 
fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 
1-7 years 
leasehold improvements 
2-8 years 
land is not depreciated. 
depreciation is calculated on the basis of the residual value less impairment losses. the useful life and residual value 
are determined at the acquisition date and reassessed annually. if the residual value exceeds the carrying amount, 
depreciation is discontinued. 
when changing the depreciation period or the residual value, the effect on depreciation is recognised prospectively 
as a change in accounting estimates.

lease assets and lease liabilities 
for accounting purposes, leases were classified as finance and operating leases up until 31 march 2019. leases are 
classified as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee. 
all other leases are classified as operating leases. the group has no leases classified as finance leases. operating 
lease payments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. 
effective 1 april 2019, lease assets and lease liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when, 
under a lease concerning a specific identified asset, lease assets are made available to the group for the lease term 
and when the group obtains the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset 
and the right to direct the use of the identified asset. 
on initial recognition, lease liabilities are measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using 
an alternative borrowing rate. the following lease payments are recognised as part of the lease liability: 
• 
fixed payments 
• 
variable payments changing in accordance with changes in an index or a rate based on the applicable index 
or rate 
• 
payments under extension options that the group is highly likely to exercise 
the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. the lease liability is 
remeasured when there is a change in the underlying contractual cash flows due to changes in an index or a rate or 
if the group changes its assessment as to whether it reasonably expects to exercise an extension or termination 
option. 
on initial recognition, the lease asset is measured at cost, corresponding to the value of the lease liability adjusted for 
prepaid lease payments plus any initial direct costs and estimated costs of reinstatement or similar and less any 
discounts granted or other types of incentives received from the lessor. 
on subsequent recognition, the asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. the 
lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the lease asset. the lease asset is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis. 
the lease asset is adjusted for changes in the lease liability resulting from changes in the lease terms or changes in 
the contractual cash flows according to changes in an index or a rate. 
lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term, which is: 
leased stores etc. 
2-8 years 
administration and warehouse buildings etc.  
5-8 years 
cars and other leases 
3 years 
lease assets are presented separately from lease liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
the group has opted not to recognise leases of low-value assets and short-term leases in the statement of financial 
position. lease payments concerning such leases are instead recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis. 
investments in associates 
investments in associates are measured under the equity method at the proportionate share of the enterprises’ 
equity value calculated in accordance with the group’s accounting policies minus or plus the proportionate share 
of unrealised intra-group gains and losses and plus values added on acquisition, including goodwill. 
investments are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. 
associates with negative equity value are measured at zero value. if the group has a legal or constructive obligation 
to cover the associate’s negative balance, such obligation is recognised under liabilities. 
acquisitions of investments in associates are accounted for under the purchase method, see the description of 
business combinations.

note 1 - accounting policies, continued 
impairment testing of non-current assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, initially before the end 
of the acquisition year.  
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together with the other non-current assets in the cash-
generating unit and written down to the recoverable amount through profit or loss if the carrying amount is higher. 
the recoverable amount is generally computed as the present value of the expected future net cash flows.  
deferred tax assets are reviewed for impairment annually and are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that the assets will be utilised. 
the carrying amount of other non-current assets is reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. when there is an 
indication that assets may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. the recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less expected costs to sell and its value in use. value in use is the present value of 
the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit, respectively, exceeds 
the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit. the impairment loss is recognised under 
amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses. 
impairment of goodwill is not reversed. impairment of other assets is reversed only to the extent of changes in the 
assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment loss. impairment losses are only reversed to the extent that the 
asset’s new carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount of the asset after amortisation/depreciation, had 
the asset not been impaired. 
inventories 
inventories are measured at the lower of cost in accordance with the fifo method and the net realisable value. 
goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising the purchase price plus delivery costs. 
the net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs necessary to make the sale and is 
determined taking into account marketability, obsolescence and developments in the expected sales price. 
receivables 
receivables are measured at amortised cost. impairment charges are recognised according to the simplified 
expected credit loss model, under which the total loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 
the same time as the receivable is recognised in the statement of financial position based on the lifetime expected 
credit loss. 
prepayments 
prepayments comprise costs incurred concerning subsequent financial years and are measured at cost. 
equity 
dividends 
dividends are recognised as a liability at the date when they are adopted at the annual general meeting 
(declaration date). the proposed dividend payment for the year is disclosed as a separate item under equity.  
translation reserve 
the translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements comprises the parent company’s share of foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation of financial statements of foreign entities from their functional currencies 
into the presentation currency used by matas (danish kroner). 
treasury share reserve 
the treasury share reserve comprises cost of acquisition for the group’s portfolio of treasury shares. dividends 
received from treasury shares are recognised directly in retained earnings in equity. gains and losses from the sale of 
treasury shares are recognised in share premium. 
 
 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021

note 1 - accounting policies, continued 
incentive programmes 
the value of services received as consideration for options granted is measured at the fair value of the options. 
for equity-settled share options, the fair value is measured at the grant date and recognised under staff costs over 
the vesting period. the balancing item is recognised directly in equity as a shareholder transaction. 
on initial recognition of the psus, the number of psus expected to vest is estimated. subsequent to initial recognition, 
the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual number of exercised psus. 
the fair value of the psus granted is estimated using basic assumptions. the calculation takes into account the terms 
and conditions of the psus granted. 
provisions 
provisions are recognised when, as a result of an event occurring before or at the date of the statement of financial 
position, the group has a legal or a constructive obligation, and it is probable that there may be an outflow of 
economic benefits to meet the obligation. 
provisions are measured as management’s best estimate of the amount which is expected to be required to settle 
the liability. 
on measurement of provisions, the costs required to settle the liability are discounted if the effect is material to the 
measurement of the liability.  
provisions for the reinstatement of leased premises etc. on vacation are measured at the present value of the 
expected future liability at the date of the statement of financial position. the provision is determined based on 
current legislation and estimated future costs, discounted to their present value. any specific risks that are believed 
to apply to the provision are recognised in estimated costs. the discount factor used reflects the general level of 
interest rates. liabilities are recognised as they arise and are adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in 
requirements, price levels, etc. the present value of the costs is recognised in the cost of the items of property, plant 
and equipment in question and depreciated with these assets. the increase of the present value over time is 
recognised under financial expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
employee benefits 
pension obligations and similar non-current liabilities 
the group has entered into pension schemes and similar arrangements with the majority of its employees. 
contributions to defined contribution plans where the group currently pays fixed pension payments to independent 
pension funds are recognised in profit or loss in the period to which they relate, and any contributions outstanding 
are recognised in the statement of financial position as other payables.  
the group has not established any defined benefit pension plans.  
current and deferred tax 
in accordance with the joint taxation rules, matas a/s in its capacity as administration company assumes the liability 
for payment to the tax authorities of its danish subsidiaries’ corporation taxes as the joint taxation contributions are 
received from the subsidiaries. 
current tax payable and receivable is recognised in the statement of financial position as tax computed on the 
taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on the taxable income of prior years and for tax paid on account. 
deferred tax is measured in accordance with the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. however, deferred tax on temporary 
differences relating to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes, office buildings and other items where 
temporary differences – other than business acquisitions – arise at the date of acquisition without affecting either the 
profit or loss for the year or the taxable income is not recognised. where alternative tax rules can be applied to 
determine the tax base, deferred tax is measured based on the planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability, 
respectively. 
 
66 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
note 1 - accounting policies, continued 
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards, are recognised under other non-current assets at 
the expected value of their utilisation; either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred 
tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. 
adjustment is made to deferred tax resulting from elimination of unrealised intra-group profits and losses. 
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax regulations and rates that, according to the rules in force at the 
date of the statement of financial position, will apply at the time when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as 
current tax. changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised in comprehensive income. 
prepayments from customers  
prepayments from customers comprise performance obligations regarding issued gift vouchers and the club matas 
customer loyalty programme. performance obligations regarding gift vouchers are recognised at the date of issue. 
liabilities relating to gift vouchers and the customer loyalty programme are recognised in revenue when used and/or 
expired. 
points (and stripes until the stripes programme was discontinued in february 2021) allocated under the club matas 
loyalty programme are recognised as a performance obligation at the date of recognition of the related sales. the 
performance obligation is measured at the estimated fair value of the club matas points (and stripes until the stripes 
programme was discontinued in february 2021) allocated.  
financial liabilities 
financial liabilities etc. are recognised at the date of borrowing at fair value less transaction costs paid. in 
subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, applying the effective interest rate method, 
to the effect that the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised under financial 
expenses over the term of the loan. 
other non-financial liabilities are measured at net realisable value. 
statement of cash flows 
the cash flow statement shows the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year, the 
year’s changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the 
year. 
the cash flow effect of acquisitions and disposals of businesses is shown separately in cash flows from investing 
activities. cash flows from acquired businesses are recognised in the cash flow statement from the date of 
acquisition, and cash flows from disposed businesses are recognised up until the date of disposal. 
cash flows from operating activities are calculated according to the indirect method as profit before tax adjusted 
for non-cash operating items, changes in working capital, interest and dividends received and corporation tax paid. 
cash flows from investing activities comprise payments in connection with acquisitions and disposals of entities and 
operations and of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets as well as 
acquisition and disposal of securities not recognised as cash and cash equivalents. 
cash flows from financing activities comprise changes in the size or composition of the share capital and related 
costs as well as the raising of loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt, acquisition and disposal of treasury shares 
and payment of interest and dividends to shareholders. 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term marketable securities with a term of three months or less at 
the acquisition date which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
segment information 
the group has one reportable segment. therefore, the segment information only comprises information on products 
and services and geographical information at revenue level.

note 2 – significant accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments 
estimation uncertainty 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes a number of accounting estimates and 
assumptions that form the basis for the presentation, recognition and measurement of matas’ assets and liabilities.  
the computation of the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires that estimates and assumptions be 
made about future events. the estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and other factors 
which management assesses to be reliable, but which are inherently subject to uncertainty. such assumptions may 
be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or circumstances may arise. furthermore, the company is 
subject to risks and uncertainties which may result in actual results differing from these estimates. it may be necessary 
to change previously made estimates as a result of changes in the circumstances on which the previous estimates 
were based or because of new knowledge or subsequent events.  
the special risks to which matas is exposed are described in the management’s review and in the notes.  
impairment testing of goodwill 
in performing the annual impairment test of goodwill, an assessment is made of how the cash-generating unit to 
which goodwill relates will be able to generate sufficient positive net cash flows in the future to support the value of 
goodwill and other net assets of the relevant part of the group. 
due to the nature of the group’s activities, the forecast cash flows cover many years into the future and are as such 
subject to some estimation uncertainty. this uncertainty is reflected in the discount rate applied. 
the impairment test and key sources of estimation uncertainty are described in detail in note 15. 
inventory measurement 
inventories are measured at the lower of cost in accordance with the fifo method and the net realisable value. 
goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising the purchase price plus delivery costs. the net realisable value of 
inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs necessary to make the sale and is determined taking into 
account marketability, obsolescence and developments in the expected sales price. 
the carrying amount of inventories recognised at net realisable value is dkk 12.1 million at 31 march 2021 (31 march 
2020: dkk 9.9 million). 
full stock counts are performed at all stores once a year, predominantly in the last quarter of the financial year. a 
provision for shrinkage corresponding to 1.6% of sales in the period was made at the date of the stock count. the 
shrinkage percentage reflects the shrinkage reported by the majority of the stores performing their stock count in the 
last quarter of the financial year. the shrinkage percentage was at the same level in 2019/20. 
measurement of prepayments 
prepayments from customers comprise performance obligations regarding issued gift vouchers and the club matas 
customer loyalty programme.  
prepayments relating to gift vouchers are recognised at the date of issue. 
for the club matas customer loyalty programme, performance obligations are recognised at the date of recognition 
of the sale related to the allocation of club matas points (and stripes until the stripes programme was discontinued in 
february 2021). the obligation is measured at the estimated fair value of the club matas points (and stripes until the 
stripes programme was discontinued in february 2021) allocated. the estimated fair value is by nature subject to 
some uncertainty with respect to the actual future redemption of points. 
tax disputes 
reference is made to note 20 as regards the dispute with the danish tax authorities concerning prior-year 
withholding tax. 
68 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
matas is involved in a dispute with the danish tax authorities concerning vat on self-supply. reference is made to 
note 28. 
note 2 – significant accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments, continued 
determining the term of a lease 
the lease term covers the non-cancellable period of the lease plus periods comprised by an extension option which 
matas reasonably expects to exercise and plus periods comprised by a termination option which matas reasonably 
expects not to exercise. matas’ store leases often contain options entitling matas to extend the lease in pursuance of 
danish tenancy law. on initial recognition of the lease liability, matas considers whether it reasonably expects to 
exercise the extension option and estimates the expected lease term, which estimates are reassessed upon the 
occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the group’s control. upon 
expiry of the non-cancellable period, the individual leases are assessed in consideration of matas’ strategy. 
determining the discount factor in a lease 
matas applies an alternative borrowing rate for purposes of measuring the present value of future lease payments. in 
determining this alternative borrowing rate, matas divides its portfolio of lease assets into categories with similar 
characteristics and risk profiles. the alternative borrowing rate is determined on initial recognition and in connection 
with subsequent changes resulting from matas revising its assessment as to whether it reasonably expects to exercise 
a purchase, extension or termination option or from the lease being modified. 
note 3 – segment information 
matas has one reportable segment that is selling mass beauty and high-end beauty products, vitamins, minerals and 
supplements, household and personal care products and over-the-counter medicine. 
all the group’s non-current assets are physically located in denmark as at 31 march 2021 (31 march 2020: 100.0%).

revenue from sales of products through matas stores is recognised when a store sells the product to the customer. 
payment is usually received when the customer receives the product, or, if the customer pays by credit card, a few 
days later. revenue from sales through matas webshops is recognised and payment is received when the product is 
sent to the customer. 
a small proportion of matas’ revenue is invoiced, e.g. wholesale sales, in which connection a receivable is 
recognised. reference is made to note 19, trade receivables. 
for the club matas customer loyalty programme, a performance obligation is recognised at the date of recognition 
of the sale triggering the allocation of club matas points. the performance obligation is measured at the estimated 
fair value of the club matas points allocated and amounted to dkk 64.9 million at 31 march 2021 (31 march 2020: 
dkk 72.4 million). the estimated fair value is inherently subject to some uncertainty with respect to actual future 
redemption and considering the flexibility of the customer loyalty programme. revenue is recognised when the 
customer uses points, usually over an average period of three months. customers have the option of returning 
products, but the volume of returns at year-end is insignificant, as is the amount of guarantee commitments. 
geographical information 
matas operates in denmark. revenue from sales through danish retail stores, webshops and wholesale sales via

note 15 – impairment testing  
goodwill 
there was no addition of goodwill in 2020/21. as at 31 march 2021, management tested the carrying amount of 
goodwill for impairment at individual cgu level, defined as the matas chain, firtal group and kosmolet. din frisør 
shop was acquired by firtal group in 2019/20 and fully integrated into firtal group in 2020/21. accordingly, din frisør 
shop was included in the impairment test performed for this cgu.  
goodwill has been allocated as follows between individual cgus:

management monitors goodwill on the basis of the overall group of cgus, and the annual impairment testing of 
goodwill is thus performed for the matas chain, firtal group (including din frisør shop) and kosmolet. 
recoverable amounts are in each individual case calculated as the higher of the value in use and the fair value less 
costs to sell. the descriptions below set out the value on which the recoverable amount is based. 
matas chain 
as regards the matas chain, the recoverable amount is based on the value in use, which is determined using 
expected net cash flows on the basis of the 2021/22 budget approved by the board of directors and a projection for 
the remaining forecast period (the years 2022/23-2025/26).  
for the terminal period, an expected ebitda growth rate of 1.5% p.a. (31 march 2020: 1.5% p.a.) has been used. 
in the longer term, demand is expected to be affected by changes in the demographics, mix of consumers and 
consumer behaviour that support health and beauty trends in denmark, and by developments in product prices. in 
addition, the level of innovation among manufacturers as well as product launches will affect demand. matas’ 
underlying growth is expected to be positive. in the shorter term, growth will depend partly on general economic 
trends. matas anticipates long-term market growth within its product areas of an average 1.5% p.a., assuming stable 
economic growth. 
growth will also depend on inflationary trends and on whether economic growth translates into increased consumer 
spending.  
earnings during the forecast period are based on the ebitda level indicated in the 2021/22 budget and expected 
investments based on management’s strategic forecasts.  
in performing the impairment test, management used a discount factor (wacc) before tax of 8.29% (2019/20: 8.92%) 
and a factor after tax of 6.83% (2019/20: 7.30%). 
the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate future net cash flows for the years after 2025/26 is estimated 
at 1.5% (31 march 2020: 1.5%). the growth rate is not assessed to exceed the long-term average growth rate within 
the matas chain’s markets.  
based on the impairment test performed for the matas chain at 31 march 2021, there is no current evidence of 
impairment. in management’s assessment, likely changes in the basic assumptions described above will not lead to 
the carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount. 
the wacc before tax may increase by 1.62 percentage points or terminal period editda may decrease by 18% 
before there is evidence of impairment.

matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
note 15 – impairment testing, continued 
 
firtal group 
as regards firtal group, the recoverable amount is based on the value in use, which is determined using expected 
net cash flows on the basis of the 2020/21 budget approved by the board of directors and a projection for the 
remaining forecast period (the years 2022/23-2025/26).  
for the terminal period, an expected ebitda growth rate of 1.5% p.a. (31 march 2020: 1.5% p.a.) has been used. 
firtal group was acquired in autumn 2018. firtal group, which operates a number of webshops focused on well-
defined niche segments, has grown faster than was anticipated at the time of the acquisition and is expected to 
continue to report strong growth in the years ahead.  
earnings during the forecast period are based on the ebitda level indicated in the 2021/22 budget and expected 
investments based on management’s strategic forecasts.  
in performing the impairment test, management used a discount factor (wacc) before tax of 10.72% (2019/20: 
11.60%) and a factor after tax of 8.36% (2019/20: 9.05%). 
the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate future net cash flows for the years after 2025/26 is estimated 
at 1.5% (31 march 2020: 1.5%). 
based on the impairment test performed for firtal group at 31 march 2021, there is no current evidence of 
impairment. in management’s assessment, likely changes in the basic assumptions described above will not lead to 
the carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount. 
the wacc before tax may increase by 8.25 percentage points or terminal period editda may decrease by 61% 
before there is evidence of impairment. 
kosmolet 
as regards kosmolet, the recoverable amount is based on the value in use, which is determined using expected net 
cash flows on the basis of the 2021/22 budget approved by the board of directors and a projection for the remaining 
forecast period (the years 2022/23-2025/26).  
for the terminal period, an expected ebitda growth rate of 1.5% p.a. has been used.  
kosmolet, the owner of the danish makeup brand nilens jord, was acquired in june 2019. management believes 
nilens jord was the most popular danish makeup brand in financial year 2020/21 and expects it to retain this position 
in the years ahead.  
earnings during the forecast period are based on the ebitda level indicated in the 2021/22 budget and expected 
investments based on management’s strategic forecasts.  
in performing the impairment test, management used a discount factor (wacc) before tax of 11.21% (2019/20: 
11.60%) and a factor after tax of 8.74% (2019/20: 9.05%). 
the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate future net cash flows for the years after 2025/26 is estimated 
at 1.5% (31 march 2020: 1.5%). 
based on the impairment test performed for kosmolet at 31 march 2021, there is no current evidence of impairment. 
in management’s assessment, likely changes in the basic assumptions described above will not lead to the carrying 
amount exceeding the recoverable amount. 
the wacc before tax may increase by 2.70 percentage points or terminal period editda may decrease by 29% 
before there is evidence of impairment.

note 20 – other receivables 
 
in september 2013, matas a/s was notified of the danish tax authorities’ decision to charge withholding tax for the 
2006, 2007, 2008- and 2009-income years regarding interest payments credited to its former parent company, 
svenska m holding 1 ab.  
at the time when the interest payments were made to the former parent company, svenska m holding 1 ab, tax was 
not withheld, which, in matas’ opinion, was consistent with the tax legislation in force at the time. 
as the danish tax authorities would continue to charge interest on the alleged outstanding withholding tax, the full 
amount was paid in october 2013. the total amount was dkk 79.6 million including interest. matas a/s has appealed 
the decision of the danish tax authorities to the national tax tribunal. 
on 26 february 2019, the european court of justice made a decision on a number of comparable cases, in which a 
number of questions concerning interpretation of eu law had been referred to the court of justice for a preliminary 
ruling. on this basis, management found it likely that the decision of the national tax tribunal would be in favour of 
matas.  
to ensure indemnity from the tax claim, matas a/s in december 2013 reserved a right of recourse against its former 
parent company, svenska m holding 1 ab, on the full amount, including any interest and necessary legal costs. the 
parties agreed to suspend all periods of limitation in relation to the tax case. in march 2018, m holding s.à.r.l took 
over the right of recourse from svenska m holding 1 ab. 
in financial year 2020/21, the danish tax authorities refunded wrongfully charged interest of dkk 29.3 million, and the 
former parent company, svenska m holding 1 ab/m holding s.à.r.l, paid dkk 50.3 million, corresponding to the 
original claim, to matas a/s. as at 31 march 2021, the statement of financial position of matas a/s includes no 
receivables relating to this case. if the national tax tribunal rules in favour of matas a/s in this case, this amount will 
be repaid to the former parent company. 
note 21 – equity 
share capital 
the nominal value of the share capital is dkk 95,728,730 divided into shares of dkk 2.50, equivalent to 38,291,492 
shares and 38,291,492 votes. the shares are not divided into share classes.  
capital structure 
the group’s capital structure must at all times ensure the financial flexibility required to implement the strategic 
objectives announced. 
the financial gearing ratio, measured as net interest-bearing debt to ebitda before special items, may under 
exceptional circumstances, such as major strategic initiatives, temporarily exceed 3.  
the group expects to generate a substantial free cash flow in the years ahead.  the free cash flow will, in order of 
priority, be used to bring down debt if the financial gearing target has not been met; for investing for profitable 
growth within the existing business; and for distribution to the shareholders by way of dividends and, possibly, share 
buybacks. 
the ratio of equity to total equity and liabilities was 49.5% at 31 march 2021 (31 march 2020: 42.0%).

note 23 – prepayments from customers 
prepayments from customers comprise performance obligations regarding issued gift vouchers and the club matas 
customer loyalty programme. prepayments relating to gift vouchers are recognised at the date of issue. 
 
for the club matas customer loyalty programme, performance obligations are recognised at the date of recognition 
of the sale triggering the allocation of club matas points. the performance obligation is measured at the estimated 
fair value of the club matas points allocated. the estimated fair value is inherently subject to some uncertainty with 
respect to actual future redemption and considering the flexibility of the customer loyalty programme.

the fair value of financial liabilities is determined as the present value of expected future instalments and interest 
payments. the current interest rate for similar loan periods in the group is used as discount rate. 
amounts owed to credit institutions carry variable interest rates at an initial margin in the range of 55 -110 basis points 
above cibor (however, at least 0% for the main part of the debt) and include a margin ratchet dependent on the 
level of leverage. at 31 march 2021, the effective interest rate on the net debt was 0.2-1.4% p.a. (31 march 2020: 0.2-
1.7% p.a.). 
in 2018/19, the interest rate swap was replaced by a different interest rate hedging instrument, a cap. see note 29. in 
this connection, matas is applying the hedge accounting rules under ifrs 9, which means that the market value of 
the hedge will no longer be adjusted through profit or loss. 
the group’s credit facility is subject to special covenants. the group has complied with these covenants since raising 
the facility.  
an agreement has been made with the group’s banks concerning a relaxation of the gearing requirement 
(nibd/ebitda before special items) up to and including 30 june 2021. 
matas expects to finalise the negotiations concerning its current debts of dkk 1,100 million in q1 2021/22.

note 27 – acquisition of subsidiaries and operations 
the group made no acquisitions in financial year 2020/21.  
in financial year 2020/21, the group paid contingent consideration of dkk 24 million concerning the acquisitions of 
kosmolet and din frisør shop. 
acquisitions after the date of the statement of financial position 
on 12 april 2021, after the date of the statement of financial position, matas acquired apo-it aps and web-apo aps, 
the technology and sourcing companies behind webapoteket.dk.   
under the agreement, matas will develop and supply it systems and logistics and sourcing services to the online 
pharmacy.  
the total purchase price amounts to up to dkk 85.6 million, of which contingent consideration accounts for up to 
dkk 20 million. of this amount, dkk 40.6 million has been paid upfront, and an additional dkk 25 million is payable by 
1 april 2024. contingent consideration of up to dkk 20 million will be determined and is payable, at the latest, at the 
end of the financial year ending 31 march 2024 (up to dkk 10 million) and the financial year ending 31 march 2025 
(up to dkk 10 million)  
the activities acquired grew revenue by 40% to dkk 72 million, for a positive ebitda margin, in calendar year 2020. 
the acquisition is expected to entail transaction costs of about dkk 6 million, which amount will be recognised under 
special items in the financial statements for 2020/21 and 2021/22. 
the purchase price allocation was still being prepared at the time of presentation of the annual report of matas a/s 
for 2020/21. most of the value added on the acquisition is expected to be allocated to goodwill. the purchase price 
allocation will be included in the q1 2021/22 interim report.  
acquisitions in financial year 2019/20 
on 11 june 2019, matas acquired all shares and all voting rights in the danish company kosmolet a/s. kosmolet a/s 
owns the trademark nilens jord. matas did not hold shares in the company prior to the acquisition. 
 
 
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021

transaction costs in the amount of dkk 3.5 million were incurred in connection with the acquisition, which have been 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under other external costs. 
note 27 – acquisition of subsidiaries and operations, continued 
 
the pre-acquisition balance sheet contains assets of dkk 119.9 million, including trademarks of dkk 58.9 million, 
property, plant and equipment and lease assets of dkk 25.0 million, inventories of dkk 14.7 million, trade receivables 
of dkk 19.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of dkk 0.2 million. liabilities amount to dkk 47.4 million. the fair 
value of acquired net assets is dkk 72.5 million. 
the total purchase price includes contingent consideration of up to dkk 20.0 million, which was recognised at a fair 
value of dkk 20.0 million at the date of acquisition. the fair value was calculated based on assumptions which are 
not observable in the market (level 3 in the fair value hierarchy). management expects the conditions to be met. the 
conditions are deemed to have been met, and the contingent consideration is payable in june 2020. 
the total consideration amounted to dkk 151.9 million, and goodwill arising on the acquisition of kosmolet a/s was 
thus dkk 79.4 million.  
the cash flow from the acquisition of kosmolet a/s was dkk 122.7 million in 2019/20, excluding the fair value of 
contingent consideration (dkk 20.0 million), treasury shares (dkk 10.0 million) and cash and cash equivalents (dkk 0.2 
million). 
description of the acquired activities 
kosmolet a/s is the owner of nilens jord, a successful danish makeup brand. known for its allergy-friendly and natural 
profile, nilens jord is the best-selling makeup brand carried by matas. the brand has dedicated and loyal customers 
spanning all age groups. nilens jord and matas have had a close and fruitful collaboration through three decades.  
nilens jord was a first-mover in making completely perfume-free makeup products and has evolved into one of the 
most popular danish makeup brands. especially through the past ten years, danish consumers have shown a 
growing preference for truly allergy-friendly products. kosmolet a/s is remarkable for its continuous growth and 
product innovation.  
with the acquisition of nilens jord, matas has added the best-selling makeup brand carried by matas to its private 
label portfolio. together, we will be able to accelerate product innovation, expand our product range and provide 
improved accessibility in the years ahead. with the acquisition, matas has welcomed a prosperous and financially 
sound business with strong development potential and a competent organisation to its family.  
the acquisition of kosmolet a/s and nilens jord was a natural step in the ‘renewing matas’ strategy. 
din frisør shop aps 
on 9 october 2019, matas acquired all shares and all voting rights in the danish company din frisør shop. din frisør 
shop’s main activity is online sales through its two webshops. 
transaction costs in the amount of dkk 0.1 million were incurred in connection with the acquisition, which have been 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income under other external costs. 
the pre-acquisition balance sheet contains assets of dkk 13.9 million, including trademarks of dkk 3.0 million and 
inventories of dkk 8.9 million. liabilities amount to dkk 7.0 million. the fair value of acquired net assets is dkk 6.9 
million. 
the cash flow from the acquisition of din frisør shop is dkk 15.0 million, excluding contingent consideration of dkk 5.0 
million calculated on the basis of assumptions which are not observable in the market. the contingent consideration 
fell due in october 2020. 
the total consideration amounts to dkk 20.0 million, and goodwill arising on the acquisition of din frisør shop is thus 
dkk 13.1 million.

note 28 – contingent liabilities and security 
matas is involved in a dispute with the danish tax authorities concerning vat on self-supply and a party to a number 
of minor disputes that are not expected to affect its financial position or future earnings to any significant extent. for 
a description of the dispute concerning withholding tax, reference is made to note 20.  
in addition, matas has, as part of its normal operations, provided security in the form of bank guarantees to store 
lessors for a total amount of dkk 20 million (2019/20: dkk 21 million). 
note 29 - financial risks and financial instruments 
the group’s risk management policy 
as a consequence of its financing, the group is exposed to changes in the level of interest rates. the group has 
limited exposure to changes in foreign currencies. the group does not engage in active speculation in financial risks. 
the group’s financial management is thus aimed solely at controlling the financial risks which are a direct result of 
the group’s operations and financing. 
for a description of the accounting policies and methods applied, including recognition criteria and measurement 
basis, see the accounting policies. 
there are no changes in the group’s risk exposure or risk management compared with previous years. 
interest rate risks 
it is group policy to fully or partially hedge interest rate risks on all its loans when it is assessed that interest payments 
can be hedged satisfactorily. hedging is usually made by means of interest rate swaps, through which floating-rate 
loans are converted into loans with a fixed interest rate. 
in september 2018, the interest rate swap was replaced by a different interest rate hedging instrument, a cap, which 
partially hedges the group’s interest rate risks on loans. in this connection, matas is applying the hedge accounting 
rules under ifrs 9. 
due to the group’s floating-rate cash and cash equivalents and debt to credit institutions, a drop in interest rates of 
1% p.a. relative to the actual level of interest rates would, other things being equal, have a negative effect on the 
profit for the year of dkk 5 million (2019/20: dkk 11 million) and on year-end equity of dkk 5 million (31 march 2020: 
dkk 11 million). 
sensitivity analysis assumptions 
sensitivities are calculated on the basis of financial assets and liabilities recognised at 31 march. no adjustments 
have been made for instalments, raising of loans, etc. during the course of the year. 
estimated fluctuations are based on the current market situation and expectations for developments in the interest 
rate level. 
currency risk 
the group’s currency risk is primarily related to its purchases in eur. the group has not entered into any foreign 
exchange contracts. 
liquidity risk 
the group's liquidity reserve consists of cash and cash equivalents and unutilised credit facilities and amounted to 
dkk 970 million at 31 march 2021 (31 march 2020: dkk 245 million). the group aims to maintain sufficient cash 
resources for, among other things, strategic investments.

maturity analysis assumptions 
the maturity analysis is based on all undiscounted cash flows including estimated interest payments. the estimates of 
interest payments are based on current market conditions. 
on the basis of the group’s expectations regarding future operations and its current cash resources, no significant 
liquidity risks have been identified. 
credit risk 
the group’s credit risks are related to receivables and cash and cash equivalents. the maximum credit risk related to 
financial assets corresponds to the values recognised in the statement of financial position.  
the group is not exposed to any significant risks regarding any one individual customer or partner. accordingly, trade 
receivables are not insured. the group has no significant overdue receivables and has therefore only recognised 
minor loss allowances, see note 19. 
derivative financial instruments (cap) are measured at fair value according to generally accepted valuation 
techniques based on relevant and observable yield curves. the methods applied are unchanged from 2019/20.

derivative financial instruments 
the group uses derivative financial instruments to partially hedge the interest rate risk on the group’s loans. the 
group does not actively speculate in the interest rate risk.  
effective september 2018, the group entered into an agreement concerning a new interest rate hedging instrument, 
a cap, with a principal amount of dkk 550 million for partial hedging of interest rate risks on loans. under the 
agreement, the underlying floating interest rate cannot exceed 0% as regards dkk 550 million of the company’s 
outstanding debt.

matas is the lessee of a limited number of premises. for some of these leases, the full rent is based on revenue, 
while for others, rent is partially based on revenue. 
revenue-based rent is not comprised by ifrs 16 and is therefore not included in the above tables. revenue-based 
rent is, as before, recognised under other external costs and amounted to dkk 3.2 million. 
a total amount of dkk 4.5 million was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income regarding short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets (2019/20: dkk 5.2 million). lease liabilities relating to non-recognised short-

two executives stepped down and one new executive was appointed in financial year 2019/20, as a result of which 
there was a net reduction of one person from the team of other executives.  
in accordance with matas a/s' overall guidelines on incentive pay, matas in 2020/21 granted a total of 129,356 psus 
to purchase shares in matas a/s, consisting of 72,525 psus to members of the executive management and 56,831 
psus to key employees. depending on the achievement of two kpis, which are each weighted 50%, the number of 
psus granted may at vesting vary between 75% and 150% of the number originally granted. one kpi is based on the 
ebitda before special items performance and the other on the revenue performance in the period up to and 
including financial year 2022/23. the psus are granted free of charge, and provided that the psus vest and do not 
lapse, each psu entitles the holder to receive one matas share at the time of vesting. provided that the kpis 
described above are achieved, the psus granted will vest after publication of the annual report for 2022/23. 
assuming minimum and maximum achievement, respectively, of the kpis by the end of financial year 2022/23, the 
psus represent a value of dkk 6.7 million and dkk 13.3 million, respectively.

notes to the financial statements 
note 1 – accounting policies 
the separate financial statements of the parent company are incorporated in the annual report because the danish 
financial statements act requires separate parent company financial statements for companies reporting under 
ifrs. 
the financial statements of the parent company are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional disclosure requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
the accounting policies are consistent with those of last year. 
description of accounting policies 
the parent company's accounting policies differ from the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial 
statements (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) in the following respects: 
financial income 
dividend in subsidiaries is recognised in the parent company's statement of comprehensive income in the financial 
year in which the dividend is declared. an impairment test is performed if more than the comprehensive income of a 
subsidiary is distributed. 
investments in subsidiaries 
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the parent company's financial statements.  cost includes the 
purchase consideration calculated at fair value plus direct acquisition costs.  
if there is an indication of impairment, an impairment test is performed as described in the accounting policies 
applied in the consolidated financial statements. where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the 
investment is written down to this lower value. 
when distributing other reserves than retained earnings in subsidiaries, the distribution reduces the cost of the 
investments if the distribution is in the nature of a repayment of the parent company's investment. 
tax 
matas a/s is subject to the danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the group's danish subsidiaries. matas a/s is 
the administration company in respect of the joint taxation and accordingly settles all corporation taxes with the tax 
authorities. joint taxation contributions to/from subsidiaries are recognised under tax on the profit for the year. tax 
payable and tax receivable is recognised under current assets/liabilities. joint taxation contributions payable and 
receivable are recognised in the statement of financial position under receivables from and payables to group 
entities. 
companies using the tax losses of other entities pay a joint taxation contribution to the parent company at an 
amount corresponding to the tax base of the tax losses used. companies whose tax losses are used by other entities 
receive joint taxation contributions from the parent company corresponding to the tax base of the losses used (full 
distribution). 
 
 
98  
matas a/s | annual report 2020/2021  
note 2 – accounting estimates and judgments 
estimation uncertainty 
the determination of the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires estimates as to how future events 
will affect the value of such assets and liabilities at the date of the statement of financial position. estimates material 
to the parent company's financial reporting are made, inter alia, by reviewing investments in subsidiaries for 
impairment. 
the estimates used are based on assumptions which management believes to be reliable, but which are inherently 
subject to uncertainty. such assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or 
circumstances may arise. furthermore, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual 
results to differ from these estimates. the financial risks affecting the matas group are described in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
the notes to the financial statements comprise disclosures on assumptions of future events and other estimation 
uncertainties at the date of the statement of financial position involving a considerable risk of changes that could 
lead to a material adjustment of the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in the coming financial year.
