organisational agility  
enables strong performance
chairman thomas kähler  
and ceo jens birgersson
dear stakeholders,
the year 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered 
most for the global pandemic, the first in more 
than 100 years. its impact on our world has been 
profound, changing the way we interact, how 
we work and live, and forcing us to adapt to new 
and often inconvenient alternatives. 
looking back on the turbulent year, we are 
proud of how well our colleagues handled the 
many challenges that arose. our local teams 
and leadership ensured employees were safe 
while quickly adjusting operations, sales and 
service activities to match the changing needs 
of the market and our customers. 
at the same time, we kept an eye on the recovery 
and the opportunities for us to help society 
and our communities come back stronger: we 
continued investing in new production facilities 
and more efficient and sustainable technologies; 
accelerated our usage of digital platforms to meet 
customer needs; and made new and ambitious 
long-term commitments regarding sustainability 
goals that you will learn more about in this report. 
robust results 
considering the global nature of the covid-19 
shock, our performance during the year was 
strong. our sales declined overall but were 
supported in regions where the construction 
sector stayed active, as many governments rec-
ognised that building sites could operate safely 
and contribute to the economic recovery at the 
same time. importantly, we maintained a robust 
level of profitability by adjusting our production 
to demand and keeping costs down.
more specifically, net sales for the year were 
down 3.7 percent in local currencies including 
0.6 percent from acquisitions, while ebit margin 
was 13 percent, down 0.5 percentage points. 
profit for the year was eur 251 million, a 12 per-
cent decrease from last year. we have unused 
committed credit facilities of eur 630 million 
and have a net positive cash position of eur 95 
million.
our largest individual investments in 2020 relate 
to ongoing factory projects in the united states 
(west virginia), in norway and in germany.
we made two acquisitions during the year: 
the sweden-based parafon acoustic ceiling 
business, now part of rockfon; and bestofire & 
thermal pte ltd, a singapore-based specialist 
rockwool group annual report 2020

supplying fire protection and thermal insulation. 
both acquisitions strengthen our position in the 
respective markets. 
importantly, our customer satisfaction score 
increased 6.5 percent this year compared 
to 2019, the sixth year in a row customers 
have rated us higher than the year before.
considering the unique challenges everyone 
faced during the year, we are especially proud 
of this result and our employees' ability to 
continue meeting customers' needs. 
recovery, renovation and  
urban regeneration
covid-19 has created simultaneous health and 
economic crises, on top of a climate crisis that 
will not release its grip. that is why greening 
the economic recovery is so important. and 
while climate initiatives may have given way 
temporarily to the immediate requirements of 
the pandemic, governments are increasingly 
focusing on addressing the climate challenge 
also as a means of spurring economic growth 
and creating healthier and safer communities. 
the european commission is leading the 
way on this front – and they recognise that 
buildings are the linchpin for both climate 
action and economic recovery. combined with 
the commission’s aim to raise the eu’s 2030 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction target 
to at least 55 percent, its “renovation wave” 
strategy calls for doubling the eu’s current 
building renovation rate to two percent. they 
are working on important new policy initiatives 
to achieve that goal. 
doing so will require renovating the buildings 
in which we live and work on a large scale. 
buildings are the eu’s biggest carbon emitter, 
responsible for 36 percent of greenhouse 
gas emissions. they are also the eu’s most 
valuable financial asset, worth tens of trillions 
of euros. and crucially in times of economic 
stress, buildings are a job-creation machine: per 
billion euros invested, building renovations are 
estimated to create 18,000 jobs.
our own decarbonisation goals
in december 2020, we announced ambitious 
plans to accelerate the decarbonisation of 
our business, with specific long-term targets. 
verified and approved by the science based 
targets initiative (sbti), these targets include: 
–  reducing total factory greenhouse gas 
emissions in absolute terms by 38 percent  
by 2034 (relative to baseline year 2019); and,
–  reducing non-factory, total lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 
2034 (relative to baseline year 2019)
these absolute emission reduction targets 
supplement our existing sustainability goals to 
continue reducing the carbon intensity (carbon 
emitted per tonne produced) of our production. 
the sbti-approved targets equate to a one-
third reduction of rockwool's lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2034.
we are proud of this commitment, and to be 
among the few energy-intensive manufacturing 
companies whose science-based emission 
reduction targets sbti has verified and 
approved.
health and safety
every year, we strive to achieve the same safety 
goal: zero fatalities and a minimum 10 percent 
annual improvement in the lost time incident 
(lti) rate.
most importantly, we had no fatalities in 2020. for 
the lti rate, our goal was a 10 percent improve-
ment, from 2.9 in 2019 to 2.6 in 2020. although we 
had fewer lost time incidents in 2020 compared to 
2019, the lti rate, based on the number of hours 
worked, was higher in 2020, at 3.0.
looking ahead 
with the pandemic surely leaving its mark 
throughout the year ahead, we anticipate that 
governments will continue prioritising keeping 
construction sites open, owing to the multi-
ple economic, climate, and health benefits of 
especially building renovations. together with 
the strong market focus on non-combustible, 
recyclable building materials, the existing policy 
emphasis on greening the economic recovery 
should positively influence market developments, 
especially in the medium- to longer-terms. 
financially, we forecast sales growth of 3-5 
percent in local currencies for 2021. input costs 
are likely to be higher in 2021, as especially 
energy costs are trending upward, which we aim 
to offset with operational productivity gains and 
cost savings. overall, we thus expect a double-
digit ebit margin of around 11 percent, which is 
slightly down compared to 2020 when adjusting 
for the additional depreciation and costs related 
to new factory start-up. 
the 2021 investment level will be around eur 
370 million, with the west virginia factory and 
the relocation of one of the china factories 
being the main drivers. we will also invest in 
additional rockfon and grodan capacity as well 
as make additional investments supporting our 
sustainability and decarbonisation goals.
we want to thank all our colleagues for the 
hard work, perseverance and creativity that 
contribute so much to the group’s success; 
and our customers whose trust and continued 
business we never take for granted.

the rockwool purpose and strategy
at the pinnacle of rockwool’s strategy is our 
corporate purpose: to release the natural power 
of stone to enrich modern living. this reflects 
our purpose’s unifying nature, conveying that 
stone is our core raw material and the bedrock 
on which our business is based. 
and while the stone we use may be millions 
of years old, what we do with it is cutting-
edge. every day, rockwool’s creative and 
entrepreneurial employees are developing and 
applying new technologies and innovations to 
release the potential of stone to enrich modern 
living.
as we look to the future, stone wool and the 
products we make with it will play an increas-
ingly significant role in addressing two of the 
megatrends influencing virtually every aspect 
of modern society – urbanisation and climate 
change. 
every week, about 1.5 million people move to 
urban environments. by 2030, there will be an 
estimated 43 megacities around the globe with 
more than 10 million inhabitants. and by 2050, 
the earth’s population is expected to be close 
to 10 billion, nearly 70 percent of whom will live 
in cities. 
the rockwool 
business strategy  
is driven by a passion 
for creating solutions 
that connect global 
trends	with	profitable	
business opportunities 
by creating superior 
solutions to protect 
life, assets, and the 
environment, and to 
create comfortable, 
healthy, and attractive 
spaces. in other words, 
by enriching modern 
living. 
the combination of more people living in more 
densely populated urban areas and the worsening 
consequences of climate change will increase 
the demand for modern housing and energy. 
greater urban population density also heightens 
the importance of constructing and renovating 
the buildings in which we live, work and learn with 
non-combustible building materials.
at the same time, the world must feed its 
growing population using fewer resources, while 
also managing the effects of more frequent 
extreme weather events, particularly in urban 
environments. 
the rockwool business strategy is driven 
by a passion for creating solutions that connect 
these global trends with profitable business 
opportunities by creating superior solutions to 
protect life, assets, and the environment, and to 
create comfortable, healthy, and attractive spaces. 
in other words, by enriching modern living. 
our aspiration is to grow faster than the market 
overall by offering top-quality products and 
 services, strengthening our brand, building 
long-term customer relations, and driving 
an operationally effective business across all 
segments and geographies where we are active.
as our business is inherently capital intensive, 
we focus on exploiting our natural strengths to 
balance risks, which includes a differentiated 
approach across selected geographies.
in north america, for example, we are 
expanding our production capacity to capture 
significant growth opportunities within all major 
business areas.
in europe, we will grow faster than the market by 
launching new products and services, while improv-
ing our customer-facing activities and the produc-
tivity of our production platform. we will expand 
capacity where needed to meet steadily growing 
demand in and near core markets and enhance our 
geographic coverage and customer service level.
in asia, the approach is different, in that we 
will develop and grow our business selectively 
where there is a clear demand for our premium 
quality offerings.
at rockwool, everything we do is based on 
releasing the natural power of stone to enrich 
modern living. profitably offering solutions to 
address the challenges created by enduring 
global megatrends will help ensure our 
successful future growth.

outlook 2021
covid-19 will continue to leave its mark in 2021, though  
focus on greening the recovery will contribute to expected  
modest sales growth.
as the new year begins, the ongoing pandemic 
continues to influence market activities to 
varying degrees, which will likely be the case 
for the full year. we do expect, however, that 
governments in many countries will continue 
prioritising keeping construction sites open, 
owing to the multiple economic, climate, 
and health benefits of especially building 
renovations. though still too early to estimate 
its impact, successful vaccination efforts would 
likely positively affect overall economic activity.
the underlying medium- to long-term structural 
growth drivers for stone wool products are 
even stronger today than last year. on top 
of fundamental trends like urbanisation and 
increasingly tighter building regulations, we 
expect several other trends will continue 
driving growth in our business. for example, 
the growing focus on energy efficiency, fire 
safety, and circularity continues to influence 
the decisions of consumers, the building 
rockwool group annual report 2020

industry and policymakers, with the pandemic 
accelerating these trends in multiple ways.
covid-19 created simultaneous health and eco-
nomic crises, on top of an enduring climate crisis. 
that is why greening the economic recovery will 
remain a key focus for national governments, with 
buildings playing a crucial role on all fronts. the 
eu commission, for its part, is making energy ef-
ficiency in buildings a key feature of its economic 
and climate recovery plans. 
this makes sense, as energy efficiency building 
renovations are among the highest-impact 
economic recovery measures to create jobs 
while helping deliver climate goals and ensuring 
more resilient and healthier communities.
for these reasons among others, including re-
newed focus on post-grenfell fire safety and the 
need for regulatory clarity requiring non-combus-
tible cladding and insulation materials on high-
rise and high-risk buildings, we view the medium- 
to long-term renovation outlook as quite positive. 
regionally, in europe, the eu commitment 
to greening the recovery and other positive 
considerations lead us to a cautiously optimistic 
outlook for construction sector recovery. we 
have also seen some early signs of positive 
impact from market-specific incentive schemes 
increasing interest in building renovation. the 
market in russia is developing positively, and we 
expect this to continue in 2021.
in the united kingdom, we do not expect 
that finalising brexit will materially affect our 
business there. as is typically the case for 
rockwool, our uk operations are locally 
anchored with most sales and procurements 
and all of our production taking place in the 
local market. we do expect the post-grenfell 
conversion to non-combustible, fire-safe 
building materials will continue in 2021, thus 
further bolstering demand for rockwool 
insulation and cladding. 
the u.s. market was already back to a relatively 
high activity level by the end of 2020, powered 
by significant financial recovery funds working 
their way into the economy. we do not expect 
that the political shift following the november 
elections will change the fundamentals behind 
the recovery.
in asia, we still see a slow recovery in the sectors 
where we are most active.
competition will increase in certain markets 
and applications. our latest capacity addition in 
europe, in neuburg, germany, gives us a strong 
platform to capture business opportunities with 
a highly efficient factory in a central location.
taking market uncertainties into account along 
with the expectation that eu green recovery 
plans will have limited short-term impact, 
we forecast sales growth of 3-5 percent in 
local currencies for 2021. while we foresee 
the positive impact from increased building 
renovation in europe gaining traction during 
the year, we would expect a noticeable impact 
on insulation sales only after individual member 
states have scaled up local energy efficiency 
incentive schemes.
input costs are likely to be higher in 2021, as 
especially energy costs are trending upward. we 
aim to offset higher input costs with operational 
productivity gains and cost savings. we expect 
some additional costs in connection with the 
factory start-ups in germany and the united 
states as well as an increased depreciation level 
from the investments we have made during the 
past two years as the factories come online. 
relative to 2020, the additional depreciation 
is expected to impact margins by around one 
percentage point.
overall, we thus expect a double-digit ebit 
margin of around 11 percent, which is slightly 
down compared to 2020 when adjusting for the 
additional depreciation and the start-up costs 
for the new factories. 
the 2021 investment level will be around 
eur 370 million excluding acquisitions, with 
the west virginia factory and the relocation 
of one of the chinese factories as the main 
additions within insulation. we will also invest in 
additional rockfon and grodan capacity as well 
as make additional investments supporting our 
sustainability and decarbonisation goals.

contractors chose rockwool insulation 
because it met these performance needs and 
made an otherwise complicated job much 
easier, enabling installers to work efficiently and 
overcome the many angles, gaps and seams on 
the geometric façade. 
“rockwool’s products were favoured due to 
the insulation’s density and ease of install. it also 
had no issues with exposure to the elements, 
thanks to its high drying potential. it held its 
integrity, made installation easier and saved 
on time and costs”, says tony hughes of jj 
acoustics in san jose, california.
the mira’s high-performance design isn’t just 
reserved for silicon valley’s wealthiest residents 
either – nearly 40 percent of the units are 
reserved for people making less than the city’s 
median income. after two years of watching the 
iconic tower rise on the san francisco skyline, 
proud new owners began moving into the 
building in july 2020. 
case study 
the glistening white, twisting façade of the mira 
condominium tower is a fitting addition to a city 
known for its innovation. its spiralling design 
gives residents in its 392 apartments more than 
just access to ample fresh air, natural light and 
sweeping views of the san francisco bay. 
for architect jeanne gang, high performance 
was just as important as good looks, with 
energy efficiency and sustainability being 
top considerations. green roofs, a grey-water 
recycling system and recyclable stone wool 
insulation materials from rockwool helped 
the building meet california’s strict title 24 
building code and earn mira a leed gold 
certification as well as several design awards.
the mira’s high performance starts on 
the outside where a continuous layer of 
rockwool exterior insulation completely 
wraps the 40-story building. this creates an 
energy-efficient envelope that also improves 
the acoustics of each apartment’s walls and, 
compared to using a combustible insulation, 
makes the façade much safer against fire, a top 
priority in such a tall building.

following the sharp pull-back in the second 
quarter, construction activity recovered across 
most markets in the second half of the year 
as countries emerged from lock-down and 
governments shifted focus to the recovery 
by launching financial support and economic 
stimulus packages. 
in many european countries, deep energy ren-
ovation of existing buildings was recognised as 
an effective recovery vehicle – creating jobs and 
stimulating spending, while also contributing to 
long-term decarbonisation goals. as a result, 
renovation of existing buildings was much less 
impacted than the commercial sector for new 
buildings.
this was clear in southern europe, where the 
market dropped significantly in the second 
quarter but quickly bounced back in the second 
half of the year, amid encouraging signs in some 
markets that government support for building 
renovation programmes were gaining interest.
insulation solutions
rockwool	offers	fire-safe,	
thermally-efficient,	highly	durable,	
and recyclable stone wool insulation.
business update
insulation segment
sales of rockwool insulation declined 
compared to 2019. some markets 
performed better than others, depending 
largely on the extent of government 
restrictions	and	financial	constraints	
resulting from covid-19.
in western and eastern europe, sales in 
most countries were down compared to last 
year, except for the nordic markets and the 
netherlands, which showed good growth. 
the nordic region increased sales each quarter 
during 2020, driven by the higher activity levels 
in home renovation; while in the uk, steady 
pressure from regulators and consumers 
bolstered demand for non-combustible building 
materials.
sales in asia were particularly affected by the 
impact of the virus, while in north america 
insulation sales overall were flat. our technical 
insulation business continues to be challenged 
by the slowdown in the oil industry, particularly 
in the united states and asia.

forget the 
weather, in here 
it’s about the 
fashion
“as an artist and designer, i bring creativity and 
passion into my designs and i want to share 
them with my customers through the right kind 
of ambience and atmosphere that allows them 
to be comfortable and inspired. i knew i could 
improve the indoor environment of my boutique 
with roof insulation, but i didn’t know by how 
much”, he says.
the first to comment after the insulation was 
installed was his staff, who noticed it was much 
cooler in the hot and humid afternoons of the 
summer months and strangely quiet when the 
rains hammered down. people could talk without 
raising their voices. then came the first energy 
bills and another benefit of the new insulation.
“since we are open seven days a week and for 
long hours, the electricity costs from cooling 
the store can be quite substantial”, says song-
wattana. “after installing the insulation, we’ve 
reduced the running time of the air conditioning 
while still keeping customers comfortable. i’ve 
managed to lower my electricity bill by at least 25 
percent. all around it’s been a good investment 
for my business”. 
case study 
the same weather that makes thailand one of 
the world’s favourite tourist destinations can be 
a challenge for business owners like somchai 
songwattana. 
the owner of the red warehouse fashion 
boutique, located in bangkok’s popular 
changchui theme park, says it can get loud 
inside his store when it rains on the metal roof, 
making it hard for customers to talk and relax. 
and when temperatures rise outside – to above 
40°c in the hotter months and near 30°c in the 
cooler ones – it also gets difficult and expensive 
for him to cool the store. 
to keep customers comfortable and lower his 
energy bills at the same time, songwattana 
chose to install rockwool insulation on his 
metal deck roof.

ceiling solutions
rockfon ceiling solutions improve 
acoustic performance and indoor 
climates, while resisting humidity  
and inhibiting mould growth.
business update
systems segment
we provide customers with indoor 
acoustic solutions for ceilings and walls. 
our ceiling systems combine stone wool 
acoustic tiles with suspension and decorative 
metal systems that are a fast and simple way to 
create beautiful, comfortable spaces. our stone 
wool-based products are easy to install, durable 
and significantly improve indoor acoustic 
comfort.
sales for rockfon in 2020 declined slightly 
in europe and asia, and more significantly 
in north america. the acquisition of the 
sweden-based parafon ceiling tile business 
contributed positively to the results in europe. 
the rockfon business in north america has a 
higher exposure to the commercial sector than 
in europe and asia, and thus was affected more 
there by pandemic-related market restrictions. 
however, we also grew market share in the 
european and north american markets where 
we focused heavily on sales and customer 
service through the pandemic, leveraging 
digital channels and our supply chain platform 
to continue serving customers without 
interruption. 
with the design community increasingly 
focusing on health, wellbeing and indoor air 
quality, the natural benefits of stone wool 
ceilings are becoming better appreciated and 
recognised within various ratings systems such 
as well, leed and declare, for example. overall, 
we are encouraged by the growing interest in 
our acoustic ceiling tiles and sound absorbing 
solutions. 
rockwool group annual report 2020

quiet comfort for 
patients and staff
for example, white rockfon acoustic tiles in halls 
and above workstations reflect 85 percent of the 
light coming in through the building’s floor-to-
ceiling windows and skylights, brightening rooms 
and spirits. in patient waiting areas, the maple 
wood linear ceiling creates a warm, inviting area 
– only the ceiling isn’t wood at all, but part of 
rockfon’s metal ceiling offering, which is more 
durable and easier to maintain than real wood.
finally, rockfon’s specially treated medical 
and hygienic ceiling tiles in the procedure and 
consultation rooms help maintain a high-level 
of cleanliness, safety and patient privacy. these 
stone wool tiles are easy to clean and don’t 
absorb moisture, so they won’t mildew, mould or 
deteriorate. 
 
“we chose three rockfon products, each one 
serving a specific purpose”, says lauren dickey, 
director of interiors for wer. “together they 
really helped us get the design and aesthetics 
that we needed for the client”. 
case study
for its new location in little rock, arkansas, 
premier gastroenterology associates (pga) 
wanted to create an environment where patients 
and staff felt at home – safe, comfortable and 
welcome.
   
one potential issue in the 9,300 m2 space was 
noise. “we’re a high-volume clinic that sees 
thousands of patients a month, so sound control 
is critical”, says william e. greene iii, ceo of 
pga. communication among doctors, nurses 
and patients is vital and good acoustics help 
protect privacy of those conversations, increase 
comprehension and limit disturbances to others 
nearby.  
local architect, wer, chose three different 
rockfon ceiling products throughout the space 
to get the desired effect – and to enhance 
certain other key elements of the architectural 
design.

based on precision growing principles, these 
solutions are used to cultivate a variety of crops. 
compared to soil-based methods, our solutions 
produce higher yields per square metre, require 
far less water and fertiliser and create the 
possibility to use biocontrol and reduce or even 
eliminate chemical plant protection products.
we also offer customer-specific advice and 
tailor-made analytic tools, facilitating the 
sustainable production of healthy, safe, and 
fresh food produce.
the grodan business grew in 2020, with sales 
increasing across all markets. it is clear that 
demand was not impacted by covid-19. other 
factors contributing to the growth are a growing 
awareness and interest in fresh produce that is 
sustainably grown and a shift in eating habits 
– indicated by the proliferation of plant-based 
foods into supermarkets, fast-food chains and 
diets in general. fundamentally, we expect 
continued population growth and urbanisation –

bringing the  
farm inside
this first plant factory currently produces a 
variety of leafy greens, which are well-suited for 
vertical farms since they are small and grow fast. 
soon, farminova expects it will begin growing 
strawberries and mushrooms as well as tomatoes, 
peppers and eggplants.
“grodan’s stone wool products and technology 
are essential for us to grow and track the 
development of our crops and help us achieve the 
high yields and resource efficiency of our plant 
factories. and with grodan’s ‘green advisors’ 
always reachable by phone or email, we know we 
have their support when we need it”, he says.
so while bozkurt doesn’t expect vertical farming 
will replace conventional farming, he sees it as an 
important alternative that will help humanity meet 
its food needs with a lower impact on the planet. 
“whether it’s in the united states or europe 
where more consumers are increasingly looking 
for food with certain traits – locally produced, 
fresh, organic – or it’s in africa where there is a 
significant food access problem, vertical farming 
will be part of the solution and we’re excited to 
be a part of that”. 
case study 
looking up at the rows of lettuce in his 
company’s first vertical farm, kerem bozkurt is 
optimistic about his company’s role in shaping 
the future of food production.
 
farminova plant factories is a new venture from 
turkey’s cantek group. this one, in antalya, 
turkey, is the first of many the company plans 
to build to meet a growing global demand for 
sustainable food production.
“field farming agriculture alone cannot meet 
the world’s food demands in the coming 
decades", says bozkurt, business development 
director of farminova plant factories. “we 
need alternatives that use fewer resources to 
produce healthy food, year-round, and that can 
be placed anywhere”.  
using led lights, hydroponics, and grodan’s 
growing media and sensor technology, the 
factory produces 4,000 heads of lettuce per 
day in its 1,000 m2 space. it’s a yield that would 
require 45,000 m2 on a conventional farm 
according to farminova, and it does this with no 
soil, no pesticides, and 95 percent less water.

design freedom
whether shape, colour, engraving 
or even bending the boards, design 
freedom is at the heart of rockpanel 
facades. 
business update
systems segment
our cladding and other boards are robust 
and flexible, and fit perfectly with modern 
architectural trends such as organic shapes, 
natural materials and sustainability, while 
also providing cost efficiency and ease of 
installation.
especially in its core benelux markets,  
rockpanel delivered good growth in both the 
roof-detailing and façade project segments. 
at the start of 2020 rockpanel launched its 
exclusive product line, rockpanel premium, 
to compete in the high-end board segment. 
the premium product offers customers the 
design and technical possibilities of the entire 
rockpanel product portfolio in one board.
a focus on greater and more frequent 
communication with customers via digital 
channels allowed rockpanel to improve its 
brand awareness and generate sales leads 
during the year, despite challenging covid-19 
market conditions. importantly, delivery service 
performance also remained at a high level. 
among our products, the woods product 
line continues to shine. wood lookalikes are a 
major trend in interior and exterior applications 
and our attention to this segment has proven 
valuable: the two newest woods designs 
launched in september have been well received 
by customers.

a custom façade, 
fit for a designer
“it’s a 200-metre long façade at the headquarter 
building. it’s what you see first, so it needed to 
be beautiful and durable over time”, says martijn 
de waal. “eromesmarko wanted the look of 
wood, but without the high maintenance and 
other challenges that come with it, like the need 
for weather treating and the risks of discoloration 
and rot over time”. 
when the architect approached rockpanel with 
a real wood sample of the colour the customer 
wanted, rockpanel had nothing like it among 
the more than 200 colours in its portfolio – so 
they custom made a new one. two weeks later, 
caramel oak was available. 
“we have a lot of colours to choose from but if 
the desired colour isn’t in our portfolio, we will 
do our best to customise a colour for them”, says 
raf millis, director of marketing for rockpanel. 
“eromesmarko wanted the durability of stone 
with the natural look of wood. we’re very happy 
to have met their expectations”. 
case study 
the eye-catching façade of the eromesmarko 
headquarters building in wijchen, the nether-
lands, looks so much like wood, visitors can’t 
believe it isn’t the real thing.
“they want to know how we made such a 
beautiful wooden façade”, says architect martijn 
de waal from dual architects. “when i tell 
them it’s rockpanel stone wool, they are very 
surprised. they have to touch it”. 
it is called caramel oak and it’s the newest 
colour in the rockpanel woods line of façade 
products, custom-made for the eromesmarko 
renovation project. 
the dutch furniture company has a reputation 
for innovative products specially designed to 
improve school environments, and a strong 
commitment to sustainability. they wanted the 
renovated building to reflect their work and 
their values by holding its good looks and func-
tionality for decades, meeting the netherlands’ 
highest standard for fire protection, and making 
employees proud and happy to come to work.

lapinus precision-engineered stone 
wool solutions contribute to reducing 
vibration, noise, dust and to better 
water management.
business update
systems segment
all our products improve people’s lives by 
addressing increasingly common challenges 
– especially in dense urban areas – like noise 
and vibrations from traffic, non-exhaust vehicle 
emissions and the effects of climate change.
global trends of urbanisation and climate 
change are central to our global strategy 
to help create resilient cities. the rockflow 
water management products help urban areas 
mitigate the effects of extreme rains, making 
them safer and more attractive places to live, 
work and play. this year was another strong one 
for this part of the business, with several new 
projects and increased interest from markets. in 
2021, we plan to enter new markets to continue 
growing.
in the automotive product line, sales of our 
fibres, used in passenger car brake pads, were 
negatively impacted by covid-19 and a global 
decline in automotive sales. our fibres improve 
safety and comfort and reduce emissions 
related to braking. we expect this market to 
recover in the coming years. 
in the urban acoustics product line, acoustic 
fences and noise-absorbing mats for train tracks 
help growing urban communities maintain com-
fort and quiet, by reducing vibration and noise 
disturbance from transportation, infrastructure 
and other surroundings. for tracks, 2020 was 
a good year with large projects in scandinavia 
and canada. an improved product portfolio for 
acoustic fences in 2021 is expected to boost this 
market segment, which is currently stable. 
we develop and supply innovative, stone 
wool-based products used in a wide 
range of applications in three core areas: 
automotive, urban acoustics and urban 
climate adaptation.

climate solutions 
that blend right in
meanwhile above ground, traditional pavement 
in some areas has been replaced by ceramic 
surface tiles that absorb rain into the soil below. 
in other areas, the pavement has been replaced 
by plants and grasses that support biodiversity, 
and help retain rainwater and lower summer 
temperatures. 
when climate maps made clear the challenges 
facing the residents of horst aan de maas, 
they chose to act – and adapt. the chosen 
combination of nature and technology makes 
horst aan de maas a more comfortable and 
safer place to live that is also more resilient to 
climate change. 
“i expect we’ll see more projects like this that 
bring nature and technology experts together 
with towns to create the best solution for them”, 
says linda de vries, business developer at 
lapinus. “horst is a good example of how we 
can make communities safer, more resilient and 
more attractive places to live”. 
case study 
as the world takes steps to mitigate climate 
change, many urban areas are already adapting 
to its effects. in the netherlands, horst aan de 
maas is an example that others can learn from.
the dutch municipality used a combination of 
above- and below-ground solutions, mixing 
nature and technology to address its key 
challenges – abnormal summer heat and flood 
risks, caused by too much pavement and an old 
sewer system. 
under the roads, parking lots, and walkways 
around the popular gasthoes area is one of the 
technologies at work: rockflow, the stormwater 
management system by lapinus. when the hard 
and heavy rains come, a network of gullies and 
pipes direct water away from sewers and into an 
underground stone wool buffer that retains and 
slowly releases the water into the surrounding 
soil –retaining valuable groundwater and 
unburdening the sewer system.

for sailing
rockwool group annual report 2020

clara nielsen is electric as her feet land on the 
boat dock in copenhagen harbour. “wow! we 
were so high above the water”, she says, catching 
her breath. “i’ve never been on a foiling boat like 
that before – there’s so much power!”
clara and her sailing partner, malene petersen, 
just had the thrill of a lifetime, whipping through 
the waters outside copenhagen on one of 
the fastest sailing vessels in the world, team 
rockwool racing’s foiling gc32 boat.  
it is 1 august 2020 and the two 21-year old danes 
aren’t just lucky bystanders, they’re participants at 
the #rocktheboat academy. it’s a special sailing 
school of sorts that for two weekends during the 
summer brought together denmark’s top young 
sailors to learn from some of the best in the world, 
the six members of the denmark sailgp team.
ranging in age from 13 to 21, more than 40 
up-and-coming sailors attended the two 
weekend academy sessions in august, first in 
copenhagen and then across the country in 
aarhus. 
each day, with the sailgp athletes as their 
coaches, clara and the others received individual 
and group on-the-water coaching in race tactics, 
specific skills and techniques, strength and 
conditioning and everything else it takes to make 
it to the top of their sport. they also got to push 
their limits, testing out what they learned at high-
speed on the team’s foiling gc32 boat.
for clara and malene, it was an unforgettable 
experience. both have their sights set on 
representing denmark at the 2028 olympic 
games, so to meet and learn directly from 
athletes who have already competed at a world-
class level was priceless.
“just talking to them about their experiences 
was motivating, but then we get to train with 
them, too, and sail these amazingly fast boats”, 
says clara. “it was great to hear their stories 
and advice on how we can get better and go 
further in our sport. it’s so important to get new 
inspiration and different points of view all the 
time – and to get it from some of the best in the 
world was really special”.
one man who knows a lot about what it is like 
to represent denmark on the world’s biggest 
stage is martin kirketerp. he is a “grinder” on 
the denmark sailgp team, the guy responsible 
for generating power in all the boat’s 
manoeuvres. he’s also an olympic champion, 
having won gold for denmark in the 49er class 
at the 2008 olympic games in beijing, china.
“i remember being a young sailor and going 
to events to hear from big danish sailing stars, 
and to this day i still remember their advice”, 
says martin. “those moments are important in 
an athlete’s development, and passing on that 
legacy and knowledge to the next generation is 
something that we as professional athletes feel 
very strongly about”.
“the #rocktheboat academy is all about 
showing the next generation that with hard 
work, energy and passion, there is a path to 
create a bright future in professional sailing. it’s 
inspiring for us to see so many hungry young 
athletes coming into the sport. and these 
opportunities are only made possible with the 
support of rockwool. i hope we see some of 
them in the future sitting where we are today, as 
olympians or on the denmark sailgp team”.
building the future – on and off the water
at rockwool group, we’re optimistic 
about the future. we believe that if we use the 
knowledge and solutions out there, we can 
achieve success, together.
the #rocktheboat 
academy isn’t just 
about sailing – it’s about 
showing rockwool’s 
commitment to a brigh ter, 
more sustainable future.
jens birgersson, ceo, rockwool group
with so much experience in the denmark sailgp 
team – from olympic medallists, to round-the-
world racers and much more – there’s no one 
better to coach and inspire the next generation 
than this group of sailgp athletes.
clara and malene were part of an almost 50 
percent female turnout at the academy, a 
statistic that encourages denmark sailgp team 
helmsman nicolai sehested.
“it’s awesome to see female participation grow-
ing in the sport, and it creates a more balanced 
atmosphere and culture at the sessions. we 
want to showcase sailing as an inclusive and 
truly sustainable sport”, says nicolai. 
rockwool’s involvement with denmark 
sailgp team provides an opportunity to 
build awareness around the importance of 
sustainability and the connection among urban 
living, outdoor recreation and the important 
role of stone wool in enriching modern living.
with sailgp’s season 2 set to take place in some 
of the world’s most iconic locations – beginning 
in 2021 – there is no better platform for 
rockwool to show that #thisfuturerocks.

contributions to the sdgs, which include setting 
non-financial goals reflecting key material issues 
within the group's operations that help drive 
improvements in our environmental and safety 
performance.
in 2016, we set six ambitious sustainability 
goals, aligned with six of the sdgs, to drive

substantial improvements in our sustainability 
performance by 2030. we made good progress 
on all the goals in 2020 with a view to fulfilling 
the intermediate goals latest 2022. 
in 2020 we signed up to the science-based 
targets initiative (sbti), committing to reducing 
our factories' total greenhouse gas emissions2 
(scope 1 and 2) by 38 percent in absolute terms 
and the non-factory lifecycle emissions3 (scope 
3) by 20 percent by 2034, both targets relative 
to the baseline year 2019 (see p. 33). this is 
equal to an ambitious one-third reduction 
of rockwool’s lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
we will continue to report on quantitative 
progress toward achieving our goals in the 2020 
sustainability report.

2 according to the greenhouse gas protocol, scope 1 
emissions are all direct emissions from the activities of an 
organisation or under their control e.g. fuel combustion. 
scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from electricity 
purchased and used by the organisation. emissions 
are created during the production of the energy that is 
eventually used by the organisation.
3 according to the greenhouse gas protocol, scope 3 
emissions are all other indirect emissions from activities 
of the organisation, occurring from sources it does 
not own, or control e.g. procured fuels and materials, 
transportation, waste disposal.

climate and energy efficiency
rockwool is a net carbon negative company, 
in that over their lifetime, the building insulation 
pro ducts we sold in 2020 will save 100 times the 
carbon emitted and energy consumed in their 
production (see next page).
and while the products we make save substantial 
amounts of energy and combat climate change 
on a large scale, we recognise that we need to do 
more. to help society reach climate change tar-
gets, rockwool has partnered with the science 
based targets initiative (sbti) to accelerate green-
house gas emission reductions in our factories and 
the non-factory product lifecycle. 
 
this is an enormous albeit necessary step 
for rockwool. with this commitment, we 
join a small number of other energy-intensive 
manufacturing companies that have science-
based emission reduction targets that are 
verified and approved by sbti. 
reducing emissions significantly in 
manufacturing and throughout the lifecycle 
is necessary for society to meet the global 
ambition to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions to net zero by 2050. 
we increase our positive impact on the planet by 
continuously	maximising	the	benefits	of	our	products	
while minimising the footprint of our operations.

in parallel with our sbti-approved emission 
reduction targets, we will continue tracking 
our progress towards achieving 20 percent 
reduction in carbon intensity at our factories  
by 2030 compared to 2015.
in 2020 we have seen an additional improve-
ment compared to the four percent improve-
ment we achieved in 2019.
we have also set a goal to increase energy 
efficiency within our own (non-renovated) offices 
by 75 percent by 2030 compared to 2015, with 
an intermediate goal of 35 percent in 2022. in 
2019, we achieved a six percent improvement. 
we had a similar performance in 2020 because 
of covid-related delays in finalizing a number 
of renovations.
circular economy
of rockwool’s three sustainability goals 
relating to circularity, two pertain to exploiting 
the inherent recyclability of stone wool.
rockwool has a goal to offer recycling 
services for our products in 30 countries by 
2030 with an intermediate goal of 15 countries 
by 2022. in 2019, we offered comprehensive 
recycling services in 11 countries and in 2020 we 
introduced the service in additional countries. 
we have also set a goal to reduce waste from 
operations going to landfill by 85 percent by 
2030 compared to 2015, with an intermediate 
goal of 40 percent in 2022. in 2020, we further 
reduced the amount of waste going to landfill 
from the 19 percent in 2019. 
reaching the 2034 targets will come primarily 
from ongoing efforts in three areas: improved 
energy efficiency of our own operations, 
technology innovation, and exploiting the 
inherent circularity of stone wool.
one example is our fuel-flexible melting tech-
nology. where this technology is used, it allows 
rockwool to switch to less-carbon intensive 
fuels – for example, switching from coal or coke 
to natural gas or biogas. the two factories in 
denmark, one in poland and another in the 
united states will use this technology to shift to 
lower carbon fuels in 2021. in denmark, the tran-
sition to biogas will reduce our absolute carbon 
emissions in 2021 by 70 percent compared to 
1990.
reclaimed  
waste
 our goal:  
increase the number of countries where 
we offer recycling services for our 
products to 30 by 2030. 
landfill  
waste
 our goal:  
reduce landfill waste from our 
manufacturing facilities by 85%  
by 2030.
co2  
emissions
 our goal:  
reduce co2 intensity from our 
manufacturing facilities by 20%  
by 2030.
energy  
efficiency
 our goal:  
increase energy efficiency within own  
(non-renovated) offices by 75% by 2030.
large-scale electric melting technology is anoth-
er example. operating at our moss, norway fac-
tory since december 2020, this pioneering new 
melter will reduce the factory’s carbon emissions 
by 80 percent and production-related waste wool 
going to landfill by 99 percent. this new technol-
ogy is environmentally well-suited in countries 
like norway where the electricity grid is already 
low carbon. the learnings rockwool gains 
from these multiple innovations will be applied 
elsewhere throughout our global operations.
regarding the circularity of our products, the 
ability to infinitely recycle stone wool without 
any loss of performance sets it apart from non-
recyclable construction materials that might 
otherwise be incinerated, resulting in end-of-life 
emissions. recycling stone wool at our factories 
contributes to reducing production-related 
carbon emissions. 
rockwool group annual report 2020

we have also set a goal to improve water 
efficiency by 20 percent in 2030 compared to 
2015. in 2019, we improved water efficiency by 
seven percent and in 2020 moved even closer to 
the intermediate goal of 10 percent in 2022. 
in march 2021, rockwool group will publish 
its annual group sustainability report with de-
tailed information on the group’s sustainability 
performance and progress towards our goals.
environmental management
we continuously aim to minimise the impacts of 
our processes on people and the environment. 
for some environmental areas, we have internal 
mandatory minimum requirements. in cases 
where our own requirements exceed legal 
requirements, our standards prevail.
in line with the group’s policy for safety, health 
and environment (she), it is the responsibility 
of the managing director of each business unit 
to provide leadership for the she management 
systems at the individual factories and be 
accountable for the effectiveness, continual 
improvements and alignment to the overall 
strategic direction. 
the she management systems are based 
on the principles of iso 14001:2015 and iso 
45001:2018. by the end of 2020, 75 percent 
of our production facilities had at least one 
external certification within safety, health, 
environment or energy management and 
several were certified across all areas.
we conduct regular internal she audits, and as 
part of our iso certifications we are externally 
audited to improve the she performance and 
awareness across the group. 
in 2020, due to the covid-19 pandemic, we 
postponed our scheduled internal she audits. 
this has not resulted in any compromises on our 
she performance.

us/sustainability/ for more information.

renovation 
and urban 
regeneration  
in several areas around pamplona, spain, a large-
scale renovation programme is slashing the energy 
costs and emissions of hundreds of old buildings 
and breathing new life into communities. 
spain
rockwool group annual report 2020
36
from the outside, the impact of a large-scale 
renovation effort in this neighbourhood in pam-
plona, spain, is unmistakable. once rundown, 
the 23 public housing buildings – all of them 
between 40 and 70 years old – glisten like new. 
the improvement for the residents in these 
nearly 600 dwellings goes much deeper than a 
beautiful new façade, though. a new thermal 
envelope that includes 10 cm of rockwool 
external façade insulation has sharply lowered 
energy consumption and costs and improved 
acoustic comfort inside. 
some of spain's best performers
the project that has turned these buildings 
– once some of spain’s least energy efficient – 
into some of spain’s best energy performers is 
called efidistrict. 
started in 2015, the efidistrict project is now 
in its third phase with renovation planned or 
underway on more than 1,000 additional homes 
in social housing buildings in other neigh-
bourhoods around pamplona-iruna. 
the success of efidistrict has been recognised 
inside and outside of spain as a reference case for 
other municipalities seeking to combine large-
scale renovation with urban regeneration. the 
results are tangible, and the approach – including 
close cooperation with the community to ensure 
open communication during the renovation – has 
led to minimal disruption to the lives of residents. 
since starting the project, the government 
of navarra has invested eur 44 million in the 
renovation and regeneration of residential 
buildings in the txantrea neighbourhood with 
impressive results so far.

social
how we act towards employees, partners, 
customers and the communities we are in 
shapes our reputation as a company among 
these constituencies and determines the 
opportunities we will have to grow with them  
in the future. 
during the pandemic, our priority has been 
the health and safety of our people and those 
with whom we interact. it has been a test of 
our policies and procedures but more so our 
leadership and company culture – two areas 
critical to rockwool's success that we looked 
deeper into during the year. 
what it means to be a rockwool employee
within the last couple of years, group 
human resources conducted an extensive 
internal survey to better understand, from the 
employee's perspective, what it means to work 
at rockwool.
 
we treat our employees fairly, ensuring a safe and 
healthy working environment, and aim to maintain 
strong relationships with our customers, suppliers 
and the communities where we operate.
rockwool group annual report 2020
38
this survey, combined with market research, 
formed the basis for what is now the rockwool 
group employer value proposition (evp). the evp 
explains our identity as an employer and how that 
identity contributes to attracting and retaining 
employees – all of which is represented in one 
motto: “greater together”.
“greater together” is both a promise and 
an expectation. it combines what is valuable 
to employees with what rockwool group 
offers and expects as an employer: a culture of 
skilled and passionate people and a collabora-
tive working environment; a solid and reliable 
company with a strong history and legacy; and 
an opportunity to develop innovative products 
that have a positive impact on society and  
the world.
the evp exemplifies how we work, our culture and 
values. it serves as inspiration for how we should 
aim to work, the culture that we should seek to 
maintain and what kind of employees we want to 
attract – ultimately supporting the group's goals 
of growth and profitability as one big team.
integrating new colleagues
our current method of integrating new 
employees differs greatly across the group. 
therefore, a global project was initiated in 
2020 with the purpose of ensuring that our 
new employees feel prepared in their positions 
and ready to contribute, no matter where they 
work.  
loyalty, immediate manager, senior manage-
ment, co-operation, working conditions, job 
content, remuneration, learning and develop-
ment and safety. 
engagement in 2020 achieved some all-time 
highs, including: the response rate (82 percent) 
and also the scores for satisfaction and 
motivation. analysis of the response data and 
follow-up meetings are conducted throughout 
the organisation among teams and together 
with hr to learn from the results and discuss 
with employees how to improve. 
immediate manager scores varied again 
this year across the group; and while most 
employees report they are satisfied with their 
immediate manager, our new rockwool 
leadership programme will give all our 
managers the opportunity to learn and improve.  
for rockwool, an aligned and consistent 
method of bringing new employees into the 
group ensures new hires have the same experi-
ence from recruitment until they begin their job. 
for the employee, it ensures a consistent and 
improved understanding of the business, culture 
and history, and how they will contribute to the 
organisation’s goals. the new global onboarding 
programme focuses on the following knowledge 
areas through a timely and relevant introduction:
1. organisation knowledge
2. role knowledge
3. team knowledge
4. workplace knowledge
this programme was launched in the beginning 
of 2020 as a pilot in north america, sweden, 
denmark and norway and in group functions 
at rockwool headquarters in hedehusene, 
denmark. after an evaluation period, we expect 
to roll out the programme globally in the first 
quarter of 2021.
engaging employees
we are continuously striving to improve the 
engagement level of our employees. we have a 
yearly engagement survey on a broad range of 
topics, including: satisfaction and motivation, 
developing our people
in 2020, we launched our new three-tier 
rockwool leadership programme. 
in tier one, “managing rockwool people”, 
we began training the first groups of leaders  
in classroom settings, before switching to virtual 
sessions for the remainder of the year because 
of covid-19. we are training a growing number 
of leaders and plan to roll out the programme to 
the upper ranks of management in 2021. 
the two other tiers are still under development 
and will address middle and senior management.
our operational excellence programme continues, 
with the first participants graduating in 2020 and a 
third group of participants expected to graduate 
in 2021. the programme provides participants with 
focused learning about operational excellence.

diversity
as always, we are committed to provide equal 
opportunities to all employees, promote 
diversity, and work against all forms of 
discrimination among rockwool employees. 
policies and procedures that raise awareness 
about these topics are part of most of our 
global processes.
the group believes that diversity among 
employees and management, including an even 
distribution of age, nationality and educational 
background, contributes positively to the 
working environment and strengthens the 
group's competitiveness and performance. 
we have long been a diverse workplace where 
employees have vastly different backgrounds, 
nationalities and competencies – not only in 
relation to gender, age and ethnicity but just as 
much in relation to education, experience and 
personality. 
for some illustration, there are 68 different  
nationalities represented across the group,  
including 31 at our headquarters in hedehusene, 
denmark. in addition, there are three nationalities 
represented in the board of directors; and five in 
group management. 
our employees also have a wide variety of skills 
and educational backgrounds and range in age 
from 19 to 77, with the majority of them between 
31 and 40. it is our goal to continue ensuring 
this diversity in the candidate field through 
recruitment and promotion.
in 2020, the overall ratio of females to males in 
the group remained stable with an 18/82 split. 
among middle management, the ratio of 
women is higher and similarly stable over time. in 
2018, group management set a target of 25-35 
percent female leaders in executive and middle 
management positions. in 2020, 27 percent of 
all leaders in middle management positions 
were female, including 44 percent of new hires. 
in 2020, as in 2019, two members of group 
management were female.
another target for 2020 was to have at least 
one shareholder-elected female member of the 
board of directors by the end of year. in april 
2020, rebekka herlofsen joined the board. we 
have now set a new target to achieve 33 percent 
female representation among our shareholder-
elected members by 2024. 
the target in rockwool a/s, in denmark, is 
still to have at least one shareholder-elected 
female member of the board of directors.
this section on diversity covers the require-
ments in the danish financial statement act 
§99b and §107d.
health and safety of our employees
we have an annual goal of zero fatalities and 
a minimum 10 percent annual improvement 
in the lost time incident (lti) rate. for 2020, 
we set a goal of lti 2.6, which represents a 10 
percent improvement compared to the 2019 
performance of 2.9. 
we had no fatalities in 2020, and although we 
had fewer lost time incidents in 2020 compared 
to 2019, the lti rate, based on the number of 
hours worked, was higher in 2020, at 3.0.
human rights commitment
during 2020, we disclosed the group’s 
commitment to respect human rights. 
we support the united nations universal 
declaration of human rights and the universal 
principles defined in the un global compact 
relating to human rights, labour, environment 
and anti-corruption. we oppose any kind of 
discrimination due to age, gender, race, colour, 
safety, health  
and wellbeing
 our goal:  
reduce lost time incident (lti) 
frequency rate by 10% and ensure  
zero fatalities annually.
religion, political opinion, social origin, or any 
other aspects of human rights. 
another right we take seriously is the right to 
exercise freedom of association and collective 
bargaining. we do not use child labour, forced 
or compulsory labour or knowingly engage with 
business partners that do so. as is the case with 
group policies, the managing directors of the 
business units and group function heads are 
responsible for ensuring that this commitment 
is fully understood and implemented in the 
respective business units. 
community engagement
rockwool’s factories are essential to the 
group’s success, as is maintaining constructive, 
positive relations in the communities around 
our existing facilities and those we are building. 
the factories create local employment and 
investment in their communities, and we always 
work to create and maintain positive relations 
with community members, their representatives, 
and other stakeholders. in many of the locations 
where we operate, we have active programmes 
supporting community initiatives and activities. 
when questions or issues arise, we seek to 
respond as expeditiously as possible.

governance
corporate governance at rockwool group 
regulates the interaction among shareholders, 
the board of directors, and group management, 
with the aim to ensure optimal operational  
performance while at the same time securing  
an appropriate level of accountability and trans-
parency of our business practices.
organisation
the supervision and management of 
rockwool group is divided among the 
annual general meeting (agm) of shareholders, 
we act with integrity and in accordance with 
our values, rules and regulations.
the board of directors (with well-defined 
committees), and group management.
the annual general meeting
the agm is the supreme body of the corporate 
governance structure and elects the board of 
directors as well as independent auditors. the 
agm approves any changes to the articles of 
association and to the capital structure, including 
any issuance of new shares. the company is not 
aware of shareholder agreements containing 
pre-emption rights or restrictions on voting rights. 
rockwool group annual report 2020
41
there is an agreement among members of the 
founding kähler family to meet regularly to discuss 
their interests in the company, including items at 
the agm, but there is no requirement for them to 
vote jointly.
the board of directors
the board of directors outlines the overall 
purpose and strategy of the company and 
ensures that the business is developing on track 
toward agreed short- and long- term goals. 
the members of the board of directors are 
non-executive members in accordance with the 
danish companies act.
the board of directors today consists of nine 
members. six are elected by shareholders at 
the agm for a period of one year and may be 
re-elected. of these, four members are deemed 
independent per the danish recommendations 
on corporate governance. three members are 
elected by employees, for a period of four years, 
pursuant to the danish companies act. the 
next election is in 2022.
in 2020 the board of directors conducted an 
annual evaluation facilitated by an external 
consultancy firm. based on this evaluation, the 
board concluded that its present composition 
is appropriate and sufficient for it to perform its 
tasks. as for the special competences of each 
board member, please refer to the cvs listed on 
the website, www.rockwool.com/group/about-
us/rockwool-group/people/
group management
the ceo, together with his group management 
team, is responsible for the day-to-day 
management, strategy execution and timely 
reporting to the board of directors. at the end 
of 2020, the team consisted of eight executives, 
of which the ceo and cfo are the registered 
directors with the danish business authority.
board chairmanship and committees
the board of directors has established three 
substructures.
 
the chairmanship
the board of directors has established a 
chairmanship consisting of the chairman and 
the deputy chairman. they prepare the board 
meetings and undertake several functions of a 
nomination committee.
audit committee
the board of directors has appointed an audit 
committee consisting of four members. the 
majority of its members are independent.
the audit committee monitors and report on 
the statutory audit, accounting and audit policies 
and the financial and sustainability reporting 
processes including auditor independence. 
the committee also conditions which policies 
or processes, if determined by the board of 
directors or the audit committee, should be 
subject to thorough evaluation.
the audit committee monitors compliance with 
applicable legislation, standards and regulations 
and the internal controls and risk management 
systems. 
the audit committee also monitors potential 
cases from the whistle-blower system.
remuneration committee 
the board of directors has appointed a 
remuneration committee consisting of the 
chairman of the board of directors and up to 
two other members of the board.
the remuneration committee ensures that 
the company maintains a remuneration policy 
for the members of the board of directors and 
the registered directors and the compliance 
hereof, and that the guidelines for group level 
variable pay schemes support the strategy.
at the 2020 annual general meeting, a revised 
remuneration policy was approved.
the remuneration committee makes proposals 
for the remuneration of the board of directors 
and reviews and approves remuneration for the 
registered directors and other members of 
group management.
the remuneration committee also ensures 
the preparation of the annual remuneration 
report. the remuneration report will be 
subject to a non-binding advisory vote from the 
shareholders. the remuneration report can be 
found on the website.
internal control
control environment
rockwool group considers strong internal 
control to be an essential management tool. 
the control environment in rockwool group 
is based on clear guidelines and accountability 
and a continuous effort to maintain that 
environment with due consideration of 
materiality and risk.
the entire structure of the group is designed 
based on the group’s commercial activities 
with a clear segregation of management 
responsibilities.
 
all group policies are approved by group 
management and assigned to one group man-
agement member overseeing implementation 
throughout the line organisation. policies and 
manuals have been adopted within all essential 
areas of operation, legal compliance and finan-
cial reporting.
control activities
minimum internal control requirements are 
stipulated in rockwool group standards, 
based on the risks identified. the control 
activities include procedures for authorisation, 
approval, reconciliation and separation of 
functions. the control system includes both 
manual and automated controls.

the local management teams are responsible 
for ensuring that the control environment in 
each local entity is sufficient to meet local and 
group requirements.
information and communication
rockwool group has established standard-
ised information and reporting systems to iden-
tify, collect and communicate relevant informa-
tion and reports on an ongoing basis and on all 
levels to facilitate an effective, reliable workflow. 
in addition, an in-depth business review is 
performed each quarter with participation of 
relevant members of group management.
the group’s position on risk management 
and changes in the reporting requirements is 
regularly communicated at financial meetings 
for the local finance directors, through the 
group intranet and dialogue.
 
monitoring
the internal control systems in relation to 
the presentation of financial statements are 
monitored at various levels, e.g. monthly 
reports to group management on segments 
and markets and by regular control visits to the 
local entities.
in addition, the group’s integrity committee 
consisting of the ceo, cfo, a member of 
group management, the group general 
counsel and group integrity officer,

the recommendations issued by the danish 
committee on corporate governance. the 
company is generally in compliance with such 
recommendations but has, in five cases, chosen 
to differ as described below. the variations are 
generally due to company-specific views on 
the recommendations to optimise value for its 
shareholders.
the company complies with recommendation 
3.1.5. the company’s board of directors will, how-
ever, not exclude that a situation can arise, where 
the board of directors may wish to constitute 
itself with a former member of the company’s 
management as chairman or deputy chairman.
rockwool group publishes its statutory 
report on corporate governance for the 
financial year 2020 cf. the danish financial 
statements act §107b on the company’s 
website, including a detailed description of the 
board of directors’ consideration regarding  
all the recommendations. the statutory report 
on corporate governance can be found at  
www.rockwool.com/group/about-us/corporate-
governance/
exceptions
to a broad extent, the company is following 
the committee on corporate governance’s 
recommendations, except for the following five 
sub-recommendations, where the company 
has assessed that its present set-up is more 
appropriate:
3.1.3
recommendation
the committee recommends that the selection 
and nomination of candidates for the board of 
directors be carried out through a thoroughly 
transparent process approved by the overall 
board of directors.
explanation
the board of directors has authorised the 
chairmanship to nominate qualified candidates 
to the board of directors. the board of 
directors will then evaluate the candidates 
before it recommends them for election at the 
annual general meeting.
3.3.2
recommendation
the committee recommends that the 
management report includes information 
about the number of shares, options, warrants 
and similar in the company, and other group 
companies, owned by each member of the board 
of directors, as well as changes in the portfolio 
of the member of the securities mentioned that 
have occurred during the financial year.
explanation
the company considers the portfolio of shares, 
options warrants and similar in the company 
of each member of the board of directors to 
be a private matter, and it is the company’s 
judgement that disclosure of such information 
will not add additional value for shareholders and 
other stakeholders. board member remuneration 
does not include share-based elements.
3.4.2
recommendation
the committee recommends that a majority 
of the members of a board committee be 
independent.
explanation
the board of directors finds that the chairman, 
as a non-independent, and the deputy 
chairman, as an independent, can perform the 
functions of the remuneration committee in a 
prudent manner.
3.4.6
recommendation
the committee recommends that the board of 
directors establish a nomination committee.
explanation
the board of directors has not established 
a nomination committee. instead, the 
chairmanship performs duties recommended 
concerning the candidates for the board of 
directors.

the board of directors selects candidates to 
the positions as ceo and other registered 
directors based on their qualifications.
4.2.3
recommendation
the committee recommends that the company 
prepares a remuneration report that includes 
information on the total remuneration received 
by each member of the board of directors and 
the executive board from the company and 
other companies in the group and associated 
companies for the last three years, including 
information on the most important content of 
retention and resignation arrangements and 
that the correlation between the remuneration 
and company strategy and relevant related 
goals be explained.
explanation
the 2020 remuneration of the registered 
directors is disclosed in the remuneration 
report, which from now on will show each year’s 
remuneration in the table of the report.   
the remuneration of the members of the board 
of directors and committees can be found in 
the remuneration report and on the website.
responsible tax
we acknowledge that tax is an important part 
of society and an equally important part of 
responsible corporate citizenship. tax matters 
and risks as well as our tax policy are governed 
rockwool group annual report 2020
44
by the board of directors and discussed on a 
regular basis with the audit committee.
tax matters are operationally managed and 
monitored by the cfo and the group tax 
department in close relationship with the 
financial management of rockwool group 
subsidiaries.
the aim of our tax policy is to reflect and 
support our business by ensuring a sustainable 
tax rate, mitigating tax risks and complying 
with rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in 
which we operate.
in all tax matters, we apply the same values and 
integrity as in our code of conduct by making 
sure that our primary focus is the ordinary oper-
ation of the group. we only adopt tax positions 
that are defendable under full disclosure.
we are committed to being a responsible tax 
payer and avoid aggressive tax planning. we 
have a clear and transparent corporate structure 
with no contrived entities or structures. 
rockwool does not have any activities in any 
of the countries listed on the eu black list of 
non-cooperative jurisdictions.
there are many transactions among 
rockwool group companies, and the 
transfer pricing policy for these transactions 
is driven by the activities undertaken and the 
value created in each part of our businesses. 
the key component in our profit allocation is 
our transfer pricing setup and methods in which 
we are committed to the principle of paying tax 
where value is created.
we acknowledge that international tax matters 
are increasingly complex and we are committed 
to assigning the necessary resources to 
ensure compliance with relevant tax laws and 
regulations.
rockwool group is at the same time 
committed to being as transparent about its 
tax matters as can reasonably be expected, and 
we pursue an open dialogue and relationship 
with tax authorities in a proactive approach to 
handle uncertainties.
 
for example, we already have a bilateral 
advance pricing agreement between denmark 
and poland. we have applied for two more 
agreements in other key countries, and have 
a fourth application in progress. once these 
are established, our ambition is to add more 
agreements in other important markets.
an advance pricing agreement is an up-front 
agreement between the tax authorities in 
two or more countries, covering the pricing 
methodologies for five tax years, thereby 
determining the level of taxable income for 
the countries in question. in addition to an 
open dialogue with tax authorities, we also 
participate and engage in an open dialogue on 
tax matters through industry associations and 
other external bodies.
from time to time, rockwool group is 
allocated different types of tax incentives. 
tax incentives are government measures that 
are intended to influence business decision-
making or to encourage businesses to invest 
by reducing the amount of tax they must pay. 
several of the territories in which we operate 
offer incentives of various kinds. we seek to use 
these incentives where they are aligned with our 
business and operational objectives.
   
business integrity
our code of conduct serves as our most important 
instrument to communicate and provide guidance 
on rockwool group’s way of doing business 
with integrity. the code of conduct includes 
group policies related to anti-corruption, gifts and 
hospitality, conflict of interest, competition law, 
data privacy, human rights and labour rights, health 
and safety, and environment.
beginning in 2021 around 6,000 targeted 
employees will be obligated to complete our 
code of conduct e-learning. this will repeat 
the e-learning conducted in 2019. as part of 
the enrolment package, new employees are 
obligated to complete the code of conduct 
e-learning to focus attention from the outset on 
the importance of the code of conduct.
tackling corruption
rockwool group has zero tolerance towards 
any kind of fraud, corruption, bribery and 
facilitation payments. 
the anti-corruption policy also applies to 
suppliers, agents and other third-parties. in 
2020 the risk assessment of fraud, corruption 
and bribery was updated. the risk assessment 
is partly based on interviews covering the 
sales, finance, procurement, legal and the 
management area across the group. based 
on the risk assessment, new initiatives have 
been adopted and are being implemented to 
reduce the risk of corruption and bribery. these 
include screening of sales and procurement 
employees as part of the recruitment process 
and monitoring of sales activities to reduce the 
risk of corruption.
whistleblower system
all employees are encouraged and required 
to report knowledge or suspicion of non-
conformance with the rockwool code of 
conduct to management, the group integrity 
as part of the enrolment package, new 
employees are asked to complete the code 
of conduct e-learning to focus attention 
from the outset on the importance of the 
code of conduct.

respecting human rights and  
supply chain due diligence
our commitment to respect human rights is an 
integral part of how we work with our suppliers. 
the rockwool supplier code of conduct 
is an important part of that work, outlining our 
expectation that suppliers respect the united 
nations universal declaration of human rights 
and un global compact.
we acknowledge there is a risk connected with 
the categories and countries where we do busi-
ness, including: compliance with international, 
national and local laws and guidelines relating 
to employment; environmental and manufac-
turing practices; as well as ethics and bribery, 
particularly in relation to sourcing.
rockwool’s supplier code of conduct is de-
signed to mitigate these risks by explaining our 
expectations to suppliers and their supply chain.
before being approved to do business with 
rockwool group, suppliers must register in 
our online supplier portal and answer questions 
related to our supplier code of conduct. this 
helps us understand the extent to which the 
supplier is in compliance with international, 
national and local laws and standards. 
in 2019, we evaluated the sustainability risks 
related to three overall areas: human rights and 
labour rights; environment; and anti-corruption 
and bribery across the countries in which we 
currently operate and have suppliers and the 
type of materials and services we procure. 
this work resulted in a risk matrix that we use 
as a guideline to proactively manage and limit 
potential sustainability-related risks from high 
risk category suppliers.
due to the pandemic, we were unable to deploy 
the knowledge from the matrix in our supplier 
due diligence processes in 2020. this work is 
now planned to begin in 2021.
privacy and data protection
privacy compliance is essential to gaining 
and maintaining the trust of our employees, 
customers and suppliers. a global data privacy 
organisation with a regional presence ensures 
support and governance.
the privacy compliance programme includes 
a privacy policy, a privacy manual and a 
handbook with guidelines for selected business 
areas as well as specialised templates and 
privacy notices. additional e-learning has 
been targeted at employees in functions with 
highest potential risk. these are designed to 
enable employees to perform their daily work in 
accordance with all privacy requirements. 
officer or through the whistleblower procedure. 
we do not accept any form of negative 
employment consequences for employees 
reporting in good faith actual or suspected non-
conformance.
 
in 2020, rockwool updated its whistleblower 
reporting tool. reporting is now possible via 
a dedicated website and on the rockethics 
whistleblower app. reports can be made 
in multiple languages and anonymously. all 
communication with the whistleblower is 
encrypted and reporting is made in compliance 
with national data protection regulation and 
gdpr. the updated whistleblower reporting 
tool has been communicated across the group. 
in 2020, 16 potential cases were reported through 
the whistleblower system. nine of them qualified 
under the whistleblower policy and were handled 
in accordance with the procedure in the whistle-
blower manual, and decided by the integrity com-
mittee. the nine whistleblower cases compare to 
13 in 2019 and included two cases each of alleged 
fraud, conflict of interest, safety issues and harass-
ment; and one involving bribery.
investigations into most of the cases have 
been completed, while several are pending 
completion. so far, two employees have been 
dismissed and one employee is subject to 
disciplinary actions. other cases have resulted in 
corrective actions.
the other seven cases that did not qualify as 
whistleblower cases related to hr issues (three), 
customer complaints (three), and one concerning 
an ordinary management issue. all were handled 
outside the whistleblower policy by the relevant 
department.
the new system has simplified reporting of 
whistleblower cases for both employees and 
third parties and allows reporting of cases in local 
language via the web or mobile app.
management and the group integrity officer 
continue to promote and increase awareness 
and knowledge of business ethics and the whis-
tleblower arrangement in rockwool group, 
using tools like the new e-learning course.
the audit committee is informed about all 
integrity and whistleblower cases. to create 
awareness of unethical behaviour and underline 
the group’s zero-tolerance policy, a summary of 
integrity cases is communicated to all employees 
on group intranet to make sure that we learn 
from past mistakes and take proper actions.
in 2020, nine whistleblower  
cases were reported, compared  
to 13 in 2019. all reported integrity 
and whistleblower cases are 
investigated.

systems and processes
the board of directors is responsible for 
ensuring that the group’s risk exposure is 
consistent with its targeted risk profile. the 
board also evaluates that appropriate awareness 
and management processes are in place. 
managing the risk process is part of the chief 
financial officer’s area of responsibility and 
includes providing regular updates to the audit 
committee and board of directors.
all managing directors of our subsidiaries and 
group functional heads must ensure that a 
risk review within their areas of responsibility is 
conducted at least once a year; and that risks 
are discussed, described, scored for severity 
and likelihood, and quantified in terms such as 
predicted financial impact.
appropriate mitigating actions for identified 
risks are proposed by the subsidiary or group 
function and studiously evaluated to ensure 
effective risk management at group level. 
the group has a risk committee, consisting 
of members from business areas and group 
functions. the committee is responsible 
for reviewing and updating the internal risk 
management framework and for implementing 
related processes. the committee meets 
quarterly to decide on the top risks to be 
included in the quarterly updates to the board.
deep dives into the group’s top risks are 
selected by the audit committee and 
presented by the “risk owner” for the risk 
committee, group management and finally 
to the audit committee and the board of 
directors. with these systems and processes, 
the group identifies and mitigates the risk. the 
objective is to ensure that any residual risks are 
at an acceptable level.
key risks 2020
among the risks deemed to have had the 
highest potential to impact rockwool group 
in 2020 were: climate risks, competition law 
compliance and cyber threats.
the risk matrix combines an assessment of the 
probability and impact of each risk to reach a 
measure of the total risk.
climate risks
description
rockwool has publicly supported the 
recommendations of the task force on climate-
related financial disclosures (tcfd) since 2019, 
and we annually disclose our climate-related 
risks and opportunities through the cdp 
(formerly the carbon disclosure project).
as part of an energy-intensive industry, 
rockwool faces specific climate-related risks 
on both the regulatory and technological fronts. 
key developments in our melting technology 
have enabled us to commit to a roadmap 
for deep decarbonisation that is reflected in 
our new science-based targets, verified and 
approved by the science based targets initiative 
(sbti). read more about our sbti commitment 
on pp. 32-34.

these developments reduce our technological 
risks and our regulatory risks. for example, all the 
group’s european factories are included in the 
eu emission trading scheme (ets) phase iv from 
2020-2030. whilst the inclusion of the mineral 
wool sector on the eu carbon leakage list for the 
ets will significantly reduce the risk of having to 
purchase additional allowances, our decarboni-
sation path will reduce this risk even more.
mitigation
we are developing and implementing 
innovative technologies with lower carbon 
intensity to reduce the footprint of our 
production processes. while many of our 
factories currently rely on coke and coal for the 
core melting processes, we are increasingly 
using less carbon-intensive energy sources such 
as natural gas, biogas and renewable electricity.
 
in norway, a newly developed electrical melter 
will reduce co2 emissions by 80 percent 
compared to the conventional coke-burning 
furnace it replaces, while in denmark, our 
two factories converted to using biogas in 
january 2021. combined, these technological 
developments will help us achieve at least a 70 
percent absolute reduction in co2 emissions in 
the nordic region compared to 1990.
the board of directors monitors progress 
against our sustainability goals as well as 
reviewing and guiding the strategy and risk 
mitigation for the climate-related issues.
competition law compliance
description
non-compliance with national and international 
competition and antitrust laws could lead 
to fines and claims as well as damage to the 
rockwool brand and reputation.
mitigation
the group has zero tolerance for any compliance 
violations. guided by our values and code of 
conduct, rockwool group competes in a 
fair manner on prices, quality, customer service, 
innovative products and more.
 
we maintain a strong group-wide control 
framework. a variety of measures are provided 
to relevant employees to equip them with 
sufficient knowledge to make day-to-day 
business decisions in accordance with 
applicable competition and antitrust laws as 
well as internal policies.
our compliance programme includes a 
competition law compliance manual, interactive 
training seminars and internal audits. in 2020, 
we arranged for all relevant employees to brush 
up on competition law compliance through an 
e-learning programme. 
new employees must complete the e-learning 
programme as part of their introduction to 
the group, including training and guidance on 
compliance.
cyber threats
description
like all other companies, it systems, networks 
and related processes are essential to day-to-
day business, and it makes the group vulnerable 
to systems outages, cyberattacks and failed it 
implementation. with increased digitalisation 
of business processes, cyber-attack or non-
availability of it systems could have severe 
financial and reputational consequences for our 
business and the rockwool brand.
mitigation
key objectives for it include preventing digital 
theft of intellectual property; limiting and 
quickly rectifying operational disruptions; and 
protecting the rights of external and internal 
data subjects. also high on the it security 
agenda is the protection of consumers against 
misinformation or misuse of rockwool 
brands.
the group’s it strategy therefore comprises 
a continued effort to increase the protection 
against cyberthreats. it involves investments in 
cyber protection practices and tools regarding 
core it infrastructure, factory it & operations 
technology, and user devices that access 
rockwool’s internal systems. 
furthermore, the it strategy focuses on 
reducing the human element risk of it, 
by continually improving the group’s 
authentication practices and usage of 
credentials, and continuous education of users.
 
the group's centralised it department 
systematically mitigates risks based on internal 
assessments as well as the findings of external 
it auditors and the evaluations of external 
experts. the activities carried out by the group 
and its partners are expected to maintain the 
operational stability and integrity of all digital 
services rendered for internal or external use.

the official share price at 31 december 2020 
was dkk 2,296 (b share) and 2,075 (a share). the

the year was dkk 47,062 million.
capital structure and dividend
management regularly assesses whether the 
rockwool international a/s capital structure 
is in the interests of the company and its 
stakeholders. the overall objective is to ensure 
a continued development and strengthening of 
the company’s capital structure that supports 
long-term profitable growth.
it is the intention of rockwool international a/s 
that the ratio of net debt to ebitda should be no 
larger than one, with due regard to the company’s 
long-term financing requirements. the dividend 
policy is to pay out a stable dividend that is at 
least one-third of the profit after tax.
at the annual general meeting on 7 april 2021, 
the board of directors will propose a dividend of 
dkk 32.00 per share for the financial year 2020 
(2019: dkk 32.00) amounting to eur 94 million 
(2019: eur 94 million). dividend to be paid out in 
2021 for 2020, net of dividend on own shares held 
at 31 december, will amount to eur 93 million 
(2019: eur 94 million). the dividend payment 
occurs three banking days after the annual 
general meeting.
after assessing the outlook for the economic 
cycle, investment plans, and structural business 
opportunities, and considering the dividend 
policy, the company can further decide to 
initiate share buy-backs to adjust the capital 
structure.
rockwool international a/s initiated its first 
share buy-back programme up to an amount 
of eur 80 million on 6 february 2020,  to be 
completed within the following 12 months. in 
2020, a total of 345,584 shares have been bought 
back, corresponding to a transaction value of 
around eur 77 million. rockwool foundation 
has participated proportionally to their 
ownership. at the annual general meeting, the 
board of directors will propose that the shares 
purchased under this programme be cancelled.

shareholders on 31 december 2020. by the end

financial 
performance
net sales recovered well – with a local currency growth of two 
percent	in	the	last	quarter	and	strong	profitability	achieving	an	
ebit margin of 13.0 percent for the year. 
global sales development
after the significant second quarter sales impact 
from the covid-19 lock down, construction 
activities and our sales in the second half of the 
year recovered in most markets, reflecting the 
view that keeping construction sites open during 
the pandemic and providing financial incentives 
to promote building renovations were economic 
recovery priorities. 
all factories were in operation during the 
second half of the year and local outbreaks 
of covid-19 were handled effectively and 
with focus on employee safety and continued 
uninterrupted customer deliveries. during 
the year, we maintained a low positive pricing 
impact in the aggregate.
rockwool group annual report 2020

net sales reached eur 2,602 million, a decrease 
of 3.7 percent in local currencies including a 
positive impact of 0.6 percent from the parafon 
and bestofire acquisitions, which is in line with 
the latest announced expectation. foreign 
exchange rates had a negative impact of 1.9 
percent on net sales, primarily due to the u.s. 
and canadian dollars and the russian rouble, 
resulting in a sales decrease of 5.6 percent in 
reported figures for 2020.
compared to the outlook announced in the 
annual report 2019, the covid-19 pandemic 
disrupted the sales growth and the dynamic in 
the markets, especially in the second quarter 
while sales for the second half of the year partly 
recovered.
regional sales development
sales in western europe reached eur 1,575 
million, a decrease of 4.8 percent in local 
currencies including a 1.0 percent positive 
impact from the parafon acquisition and 5.0 
percent in reported figures. overall, sales in 
in the rest of the world, sales reached eur 
578 million, a decrease of 1.9 percent in local 
currencies, and 4.3 percent in reported figures 
due to negative currency impact from the u.s. 
and canadian dollars. after a few slow months 
during the second and third quarters, north 
american sales activities increased in the 
fourth quarter, particularly in the united states, 
resulting in a full year sales growth compared 
to 2019.  this growth continues to be driven 
by demand for non-combustible building 
insulation as well as increased new building 
and renovation activity levels in the residential 
segment.
in asia, sales were down in china and many 
southeast asian markets compared to 2019. this 
decline is largely the result of lower building 
activity related to covid-19 shutdowns and 
lower technical insulation sales related to the oil 
and gas sectors. the acquisition of bestofire in 
singapore only had a minor impact.
most countries decreased compared to last 
year, although many did recover in the second 
half of the year. in particular, the nordic markets 
and the netherlands showed good growth in 
the second half of the year. the nordic region 
increased sales each quarter during 2020, driven 
by the higher activity levels in home renovation. 
overall, central western europe experienced 
continued difficult market conditions primarily 
from lower construction activity.
sales in eastern europe reached eur 449 
million, down 2.1 percent in local currencies 
and 9.1 percent in reported figures mainly due 
to negative currency impact from the russian 
rouble. poland faced difficult market conditions 
during the year from lower construction activity. 
in the second half of the year, especially 
hungary and romania as well as russia bounced 
back from the covid-19 pandemic, and 
achieved full year sales at level or with growth 
compared to 2019.
group profitability
operational cost savings combined with lower 
raw material prices led to an ebit increase of 
9 percent in local currencies in the second half 
of the year and a reported ebit margin of 13.0 
percent for the full year, which is in the upper 
range of the latest guidance, due to solid sales 
performance in december. 
operational efficiency improved as we 
continued prioritising cost savings activities 
during the year. this entailed a focus on 
driving efficiency, while still investing in new 
competencies, digitalisation and growth 
initiatives, which helped deliver improved 
profitability for the group.
since the second wave of the covid-19 pande-
mic became more visible, we took measures to 
reduce costs, including organisational initiatives 
to preserve productivity. the main part of the 
severance costs was recognised during 2020.

ebitda decreased five percent to eur 522 
million with an ebitda margin of 20.1 percent, an 
improvement compared to 2019 of 0.2 percentage 
points. adjusting for the positive eur 10 million 
ebitda impact from the 2019 legal settlement 
involving rockfon north america, 2020 ebitda 
margin increased 0.6 percentage points. 
in 2020, depreciation amounted to eur 184 
million, an increase of eur 8 million compared 
2019 due to investments in new capacity 
especially in romania, poland and the united 
kingdom as well as in digital solutions. 
depreciation of the new facility in germany 
commenced january 2021.
ebit for the year reached eur 338 million, resulting 
in an ebit margin of 13.0 percent, a decrease of 0.5 
percentage points compared to 2019. adjusting for 
the 2019 legal settlement related to rockfon north 
america, the comparable ebit margin for 2020 was 
only 0.2 percentage points below that of the record 
year 2019, mainly due to the negative currency 
impact of 0.2 percentage points.
there is no direct comparison to the initial 
outlook announced in february 2020 on ebit 
margin as the covid-19 pandemic completely 
altered the underlying assumptions. the result 
is at the upper end of the outlook announced 
later in 2020 mainly due to an improved 
performance in the last quarter with higher net 
sales and positive impact from lower input costs 
and operational efficiencies.
net financial costs amounted to eur 14 million, 
an increase of eur 9 million compared to 2019. 
the increase is mainly related to unrealised 
currency fluctuations and fees related to the 
share buy-back programme. 
tax on profit for the year amounted to eur 74 
million compared to eur 82 million in 2019. 
the effective tax rate increased slightly to 
22.8 percent (2019: 22.4 percent) mainly due 
to higher withholding taxes on dividends and 
lower recognition of deferred tax assets.
group profit after tax totalled eur 251 million, 
a eur 34 million decrease, which we consider 
to be a satisfactory result taking the global 
covid-19 pandemic into account.
profit after tax in the parent company totalled 
eur 241 million, a decrease of eur 33 million 
mainly due to lower income from investment in 
subsidiaries as the earnings were impacted by 
the covid-19 pandemic.
balance sheet and equity
net working capital ended at eur 213 million, a 
decrease of eur 34 million in reported figures 
compared to 2019, primarily due to lower 
inventory and trade receivables as well as a 
negative currency impact and only partly offset 
by a small increase in trade payables. as a 
percentage of sales, net working capital was 8.2 
percent compared to 9.0 percent in 2019.
the ability to quickly adapt to dynamic market conditions 
and keep costs under control was key in maintaining robust 
profitability
rockwool group annual report 2020
61
total assets at the end of 2020 amounted 
to eur 2,744 million, an increase of eur 50 
million compared to 2019 mainly from ongoing 
investments partly offset by lower inventories, 
trade receivables as well as cash.
equity of the group totalled eur 2,092 million 
as of 31 december 2020 compared to eur 2,118 
million in 2019, corresponding to an equity 
ratio of 76 percent. equity was mainly affected 
by the profit for the year, the share buy-back 
programme, dividend pay-out, and exchange 
rate adjustments. 
the proposed dividend for 2020 is dkk 32.00 
per share, unchanged from 2019. 
invested capital
return on invested capital decreased in 2020, 
mainly due to higher investments and lower 
profit, reaching 17.6 percent compared to 21.7 
percent in 2019. invested capital amounted to 
eur 1,961 million compared to eur 1,889 million 
in 2019.
cash flow and investments
covid-19 increased uncertainties in the early 
part of the spring and ensuring the group had 
adequate funding facilities was important. 
rockwool decided to draw a loan of eur 
150 million, allowing the group to maintain 
its investment programme, pay dividend to 
shareholders and keep the share buy-back 
programme running. furthermore, additional 
eur 200 million was secured in committed 
facilities for additional safety through an extra 
revolving credit facility.
at the end of 2020, the group had a net cash 
positive position, amounting to eur 95 million, 
down eur 117 million. in addition, the group 
had unused committed credit facilities of eur 
630 million by year-end.
cash flow from operating activities increased, 
from eur 402 million in 2019 to eur 438 million 
in 2020. the decrease in operating profit, 
mainly from the lower sales, was more than 
compensated by the positive impact from 
less cash tied up in net working capital, which 
decreased eur 27 million in the cash flow 
compared to 2019. the eur 9 million decline in 
tax payments also contributed positively.
capital expenditure excluding acquisitions 
and received investment grants reached eur 
362 million. this decrease of eur 38 million 
compared to 2019 is in line with our latest 
expectation although negatively impacted 
by the currency development. compared to 
our expectation announced in february 2020, 
some investment expenditures relating to the 
ongoing factory projects in the united states 
and norway and the relocation project in 
china were postponed from 2020 to 2021. the 
largest individual investments in 2020 relate to 
the factory projects in the united states (west 
virginia), in norway and in germany.

in december 2020, additional eur 1 million 
grant was received as planned from the chinese 
authorities in connection with the ongoing 
relocation of one of our factories in china; the 
sum of the grants received now amounts to eur 
19 million.
in february 2020, rockwool acquired the 
parafon acoustic ceiling business, comprising 
the swedish ceiling tile factory, and its nordic 
sales organisation, which are now part of 
rockfon in our systems segment. in september 
2020, rockwool acquired the assets of 
bestofire & thermal pte. ltd., a singapore 
business that specialises in supplying fire 
protection and thermal insulation in both the 
marine and building sectors in singapore and 
which is now part of our insulation segment. 
the consideration for both businesses totalled 
eur 19 million.
free cash flow amounted to eur 76 million, an 
increase of eur 74 million compared to 2019, 
primarily due to lower investments and lower 
working capital.
cash flow from financing activities ended at 
negative eur 92 million as the share buy-back 
programme of eur 77 million and increased 
dividend payments were offset by proceeds 
from borrowings of net eur 96 million in the year 
as part of the new loan of eur 150 million was 
repaid in november 2020.

business segments
sales in the insulation segment reached eur 
1,914 million, a decrease of 5.8 percent in local 
currencies and 7.8 percent in reported curren-
cies. the sales decrease came primarily from 
insulation sales in central europe and the tech-
nical insulation business. the building insulation 
business in north america ended 2020 with 
good growth despite the global pandemic.
the insulation segment’s ebit reached eur 236 
million with an ebit margin of 10.7 percent, a 
decrease compared to 2019 of 0.6 percentage 
points. the operational efficiency in the 
factories could not fully compensate the start-
up costs in the german factory and the electric 
melter project costs in norway, combined with 
the overall lower capacity utilisation from the 
sales decrease.
the systems segment’s sales amounted to eur 
688 million, which is an increase of 2.7 percent 
in local currencies including 2.4 percent from 
parafon and 1.3 percent in reported figures. the 
growth was driven primarily by grodan and a 
good second half of the year for rockfon and 
rockpanel in europe.
the systems segment generated an ebit of 
eur 102 million with an ebit margin of 14.8 
percent, down 0.3 percentage points compared 
to 2019. adjusting for the positive impact from 
the 2019 legal settlement involving rockfon 
north america, the ebit margin increased 
1.2 percentage points, with most businesses 
contributing positively.

increase of four percent with an ebitda margin 
of 21.1 percent compared to 19.9 percent in q4 
2019. this results primarily from continued good 
contribution margin and a reduced cost base.

growth of six percent compared to q4 2019. ebit 
margin ended at 14.3 percent, 1.1 percentage

tain good productivity.

statement of changes in equity
dividend is included as a liability at the time of adop-
tion by the annual general meeting. dividend that is 
expected to be paid for the year is shown separately in 
the equity. 
sale and purchase of, as well as dividends on own 
shares are recognised under retained earnings in the 
equity. the reserve for currency translation adjustments 
consists of exchange rate differences that occur when 
translating the subsidiaries’ financial statements from 
their functional currency into eur. 
hedging adjustments comprise changes in the fair val-
ue of hedging transactions that qualify for recognition 
as cash flow hedges and where the hedged transaction 
has not yet been realised. 
non-controlling interests 
non-controlling interests are recognised at the minor-
ity’s share of the net assets. the difference between 
the costs and the non-controlling interests’ share of the 
total carrying amount including goodwill is transferred 
from the minority interests’ share of the equity to the 
equity belonging to the shareholders of rockwool 
international a/s.

net sales
the group produces and sells a range of non-combus-
tible stone wool insulation products, including solutions 
for ceiling systems, ventilated facades, friction and 
water management and stone wool substrate solutions 
for the professional horticultural.
 
sales are recognised when control of the products has 
transferred to the customer, being when the products 
are delivered to the customer and the risk has been 
transferred. 
the products are often sold with retrospective volume 
discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12-month 
period. revenue from these sales is recognised based 
on the price specified in the contract, net of the esti-
mated volume discounts. accumulated experience is 
used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using 
the expected value method.
the sales include no element of financing as the sales 
are made with credit terms of normally 30-60 days 
consistent with market practice.
a receivable is recognised when the products are de-
livered as this is the point in time that the consideration 
is unconditional because only the passage of time is 
required before the payment is due.
segmented accounts
group management has determined the business seg-
ments for the purpose of assessing business performance 
and allocating resources. primarily segments are based on 
products and thermal performance, as systems segment 
notes
1.1  net sales and segmented account
is primarily defined as non-thermal insulation products. 
nearly all external sales consist of sales of products.
segmental data is stated for business areas and 
geographical areas. the split by business areas is in 
accordance with the group’s internal reporting. 
the segmental data is presented according to the same 
principle as the consolidated financial statements. the 
segmental ebit includes net sales and expenditure in-
cluding non-recurring expenditure operationally related 
to the segment.

rockwool group operates in two business segments 
based on products: insulation segment and systems 
segment. the information is based on the management 
structure and internal management reporting to group 
management and constitutes the reportable segments.
headquarters costs are allocated to the business 
segments based on allocation keys used in the internal 
management reporting. these allocation keys are 
reassessed annually based on planned activity in the 
segments. intangible and tangible assets and related 
amortisation/depreciation are not fully allocated to 
business segments as all stone wool production is done 
in the insulation segment. financial income and expens-
es, and income taxes are managed at group level and 
are not allocated to business segments.

remuneration of group management (key management 
personnel) complies with the principles of the group's 
remuneration policy. 
the variable part of the total remuneration, measured 
as short-term incentive maximum and annual long-term 
incentive grant, can be maximum 50 percent of the 
total remuneration. the short-tem incentive (bonus) is 
dependent on achievement of individual targets and tar-
gets for the group's financial performance, as approved 
by the remuneration committee. in addition, pension 
and other benefits are offered in line with market prac-
tice with a total value not exceeding 20 percent of base 
salary.
the individual remuneration elements of each regis-
tered director are disclosed in the annual remunera-
tion report.
no termination costs is included in the remuneration in 
neither 2020 nor 2019.
internal net sales from the insulation segment to  
the systems segment are at arms’ length prices. the 
insulation segment includes among others interior 
building insulation, façade insulation, roof insulation 
and industrial and technical insulation. the systems 
segment includes acoustic ceilings, cladding boards, 
engineered fibres, noise and vibration control, and 
horticultural substrates.
in 2020 and 2019 write-down of software was recognised 
affecting both segments. for additional information 
please refer to note 2.4.
the geographical net sales information is based on the 
location of the customers, while the information regard-
ing the geographical assets distribution is based on the 
physical placement of the assets. 
the domestic sales in denmark are in the range of 2-3% 
(2019: 2-3%) of the group’s net sales. the domestic 
intangible and tangible assets in denmark amount to 
eur 159 million (2019: eur 168 million).
no customers exceed 10% of the group’s net sales 
neither this year nor last year. in germany, france and 
the united states net sales amounts to between 10-20% 
of the group’s total net sales in both 2020 and 2019. 
in no other country do the net sales exceed 10% of the 
group’s total net sales. 
intangible and tangible assets in the united states, 
germany and poland exceed 10% of the group's total 
intangible and tangible assets in both 2020 and 2019.

1.3  long-term incentive programmes
stock options
no stock options have been granted since 2015. the 
outstanding options are all exercisable and fully vested 
at the end of the reporting period.
the average share price at exercise in 2020 was eur 
267 (2019: eur 214). in 2020, the stock options granted 
in 2012 expired and all the stock options were exer-
cised. no stock options expired in 2019.

two different share-based incentive programmes have 
been established: a stock option programme and a re-
stricted share programme (rsus). both programmes are 
classified as equity based, as they are settled in shares. 
due to local rules, a minor part of both programmes are 
given as phantom shares and is classified as cash-based, 
as they are settled in cash. the programmes are offered 
to group management and other senior executives. the 
incentive programmes are part of the variable part of 
the remuneration and follows the group’s remunera-
tion policy. participation in the programmes are at the 
remuneration committees discretion and no individual 
has a contractual right to participate or receive any 
guaranteed benefit.
stock options
on issuance of stock options, the fair value of the options 
is assessed using the black & scholes formula at the time 
of grant and is recognised in personnel costs in the in-
come statement and in equity over the three-year vesting 
period.
a part of the stock options are given as phantom shares 
(cash-based programme) and are adjusted to fair value 
through financial expenses in the income statement 
against a related provision.
restricted share units (rsus)
when rsus are issued, the value of the rsus at grant date 
is recognised in personnel cost in the income statement 
and in equity over the three-year vesting period. on initial 
recognition of the rsus, the number of rsus expected to 
vest is estimated. subsequently, the estimate is revised so 
the total cost recognised is based on the actual number of 
rsus vested. the fair value of rsus is determined based 
on the quoted share price at grant adjusted for expect-
ed dividend payout (based on historic dividend payout 
ratio). the participants are compensated for any dividend 
payment by receiving additional rsus.
a minor part of the rsus are given as phantom shares 
(cash-based programme) and are adjusted to fair value 
through financial expenses in the income statement 
against a related provision.

restricted share units
restricted share units (rsus) will be subject to a 
vesting period of three years. after the vesting period 
the shares are transferred to the participants without 
payment, subject to continued employment with  
rockwool group in the vesting period.
in line with the remuneration policy, a one-time award 
of conditional rsus was granted to the ceo in 2020. 
the award is subject to a five-year vesting period and 
only upon achievement of three parameters: a) reduc-
tion of co2 per tonne line wool, b) growth in sales; and 
c) earnings.
the rsus represent the employee's right to shares but 
do not carry voting rights nor have any tangible value 
before the rsus are exercised and become actual b 
shares of rockwool international a/s. the terms of 
the share incentive may provide that shares may be set-
tled in cash in which case, the related provision equals 
the share price at the time of vesting.
the estimated fair value of rsus granted in 2020 was 
eur 3 million (2019: eur 2 million) at grant date. 
eur 3 million was expensed in 2020 relating to the 
rsus (2019: eur 2 million), of which eur 2 million was 
recognised in personnel costs and eur 1 million in 
finance expenses (fair value of phantom shares).

cash-settled programmes
the cash-settled programmes consists of phantom 
shares granted during the years 2018-2020.
the employees granted the phantom shares participate 
on terms and conditions similar to those applying to the 
share options and the rsus.
there are no more phantom options outstanding from 
the 2013-2015 stock options (2019: 2,350). the out-
standing rsus from 2018-2020 include 6,449 phantom 
shares (2019: 7,652).
the total intrinsic value of the phantom stock options/
rsus at year-end amounts to eur 1 million (2019: eur 1 
million), which is recognised as a liability.

the costs of research activities are carried as expend-
iture in the year in which they are incurred. the costs 
of development projects which are clearly defined and 
identifiable, and of which the potential technical and 
commercial exploitation is demonstrated, are capital-
ised to the extent that they are expected to generate 
future revenue. other development costs are recog-
nised on an ongoing basis in the income statement 
under operating costs.
intangible assets, apart from goodwill, are stated at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and write-downs.
amortisation of the following intangible assets is made 
on a straight-line basis over the expected future lifetime 
of the assets, which is:
development projects: 2-10 years
patents: up to 20 years
software: 2-4 years
trademarks: up to 20 years
customer relationships: 10-15 years
goodwill arisen from acquisition of enterprises and ac-
tivities is stated at cost. the carrying amount of good-
will is allocated to the group’s cash-generating units 
at the acquisition date. identification of independent 
cash-generating units is based on business structure 
and level of internal control of cash flow. 
acquired co2 rights are capitalised under intangible 
assets. granted co2 rights are not capitalised.
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and the 
book value of other assets is reviewed on indications of

2.1 intangible assets (continued)
goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (cgus) 
in insulation segment at an amount of eur 51 million 
(2019: eur 50 million) and to cgus in systems segment 
at an amount of eur 45 million (2019: eur 47 million).
goodwill has been impairment tested for the identified 
cgus, which for both years have not resulted in any 
value adjustments. 
the impairment test of goodwill is based on current 
and future results for the cgus to where the results are 
allocated. most of the goodwill in the group is related 
to the acquisition of flumroc in 2017, chicago metallic 
in 2013 and csr in 2010 and they are performing 
according to plan.
please refer to note 2.5 for further details.
in 2020 a write-down of eur 3 million of software 
was recognised affecting both segments due to low 
utilisation.
in 2019 a write-down of eur 2 million of software in 
progress was recognised affecting both segments 
due to lower benefits and utilisation compared to the 
original expectation.
the carrying amount of other intangible assets includes 
brands amounting to eur 12 million (2019: eur 11 
million), patents amounting eur 8 million (2019: eur 
9 million) and development projects of eur 1 million 
(2019: eur 1 million).
2.2 tangible assets
tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated de-
preciation and impairment losses. the cost of technical 
plant and machinery manufactured by the group com-
prises the acquisition cost, expenditure directly related 
to the acquisition, engineering hours, including indirect 
production costs and borrowing costs.
depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis, 
based on current assessment of their useful lives and 
scrap value. 
the expected lifetimes are:
buildings: 20-40 years
plant and machinery: 5-15 years
other operating equipment: 3-10 years
on sale or scrapping of assets, any losses or gains are 
included under other operating income for the year.
investment grants are deducted in the cost of the 
equivalent tangible assets. the investment grants are 
recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the 
expected lives of the related assets as reduced depreci-
ation expense.
the expected lifetime for tangible assets is determined 
based on past experience and expectations for future 
use of the assets. especially the estimated lifetime of 
plant and machinery is linked to uncertainty due to 
varying utilisation and the significant amount of mainte-
nance costs. the expected future lifetime for the assets 
is evaluated annually. 
when there is an indication of a reduction in the prof-
itability of an asset, an impairment test is performed  
for the assets in question and write-downs are made,  
if necessary.
the recoverable amounts of the assets and cash-gen-
erating units are determined based on value-in-use 
calculations and fair value less cost to sell. these 
calculations require the use of estimates as they are 
based on budgets, business plans and projections for 
five years and take into account previous experience 
and represent management’s best estimate of future 
developments.

of the carrying amount of buildings and sites, eur 
114 million (2019: eur 114 million) represent sites not 
subject to depreciation.  
accumulated capitalised interests amounting to eur 
3 million (2019: eur 4 million) are included in the cost 
of tangible assets. there is no additional capitalised 
interest neither this year nor last year.
for the recognised investment grants the conditions are 
fulfilled or are reasonable assured to be fulfilled. some 
of the received investment grants are subject to repay-
ment obligations provided that the attached conditions 
are not fulfilled within a number of years. 
the group’s investment grants are for the main part 
received in poland, spain, the united states and china. 
the investment grants are in most cases linked to 
expansion of the group including the amount of invest-
ment in tangible assets and the creation of jobs - and is 
given as cash or loans. only limited contingent liabilities 
exist.
contractual obligations for the purchase of tangible 
assets at 31 december 2020 amount to eur 90 million

2.3 leases
whether a contract contains a lease is assessed at 
contract inception. for identified leases, a right-of-use 
(rou) asset and corresponding liability are recognised 
on the lease commencement date. 
assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially 
measured on a present value basis. lease liabilities 
include the net present value of the payments, which 
are fixed or variable payments dependent on an index 
or a rate. when adjustments to lease payments based 
on an index or a rate take effect, the lease liability is re-
assessed and adjusted against the lease asset. service 
components are excluded from the lease liability except 
from those relating to cars.
to measure the lease liability at an amount equal to the 
net present value of the lease payments, a discount rate 
is used. for this purpose, the group generally uses its 
incremental borrowing rate (ibr). the ibr is calculated 
per main country/region per asset type considering 
different length of the lease terms. 
 
the lease payments have been split into an interest cost 
and a repayment of the lease liability. 
rou assets are measured at cost corresponding to the 
lease liability recognised, adjusted for any lease prepay-
ments or directly related costs, including restoration 
costs.
rou assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the expected lease term and the 
asset’s useful life. rou assets are tested for impairment 
when ever there is an indication that the assets may be 
impaired. 
extension and termination options are included in a 
number of property and equipment leases across the 
group. the majority of extension and termination op-
tions held are exercisable only by the group and not by 
the respective lessor. if the lease contract contains an 
extension or purchase option that the group considers 
reasonably certain to be exercised, these are included 
in the measurement of the liability.
short-term leases and leases of low value are recog-
nised on a straight-line basis as cost in the income 
statement.
the group’s portfolio of leases covers leases of office 
buildings, warehouses and other equipment such as 
cars and forklifts. leases for offices and other buildings 
have lease terms between 2-22 years, warehouses be-
tween 3-10 years while car and forklift leases generally 
have lease terms between 3-5 years. the group also 
has a few long-term site leases with lease terms up to 
99 years.

2.5 impairment tests (continued)
when preparing impairment tests, estimates are used 
to calculate the future value. significant estimates are 
made when assessing long-term growth rates and 
profitability. in addition, an assessment is made of the 
reasonable discount rate. 
changes in the growth rate in the budget period or 
discount rate may result in significantly different values. 
the assessments are made based on budgets, business 
plans and projections for five years and take into 
account previous experience and represent manage-
ment’s best estimate of future developments. 
key parameters are growth in sales, margin, discount 
rate and future growth expectations.
management has performed the yearly impairment 
test of the carrying amount of goodwill. in addition, 
impairment test of other assets has also been made, 
where indication of reduction of value was found. in 
the impairment test, the carrying amount of the assets 
is compared to the discounted value of the future cash 
flows. the assessment of future cash flows is typically 
based on five-year management reviewed budgets 
and business plans, where the last year is used as a 
normalised terminal year. net sales, raw material prices, 
discount rate and future growth assumptions constitute 
the most material parameters in the calculation.
the average growth rate in the terminal period is set to 
0.5 percent similar to last year. the average growth rate 
in the budget period is estimated to be between 0-10 
percent depending on the businesses. 
the high growth rates are used in countries where we 
historically have seen steep increases after a slow period. 
gross margins are based on average values the last three 
years and adjusted over the budget period for efficiency 
improvements and expected raw material inflation based 
on past actual price movements and future market 
conditions. future investment is derived from the historic 
investment level to secure a smooth operation of the fac-
tories and the capacity utilisation is based on the current 
situation including investment plans. the discount rate 
calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the 
group and the operating segments and is derived from 
the weighted average cost of capital (wacc).
2020
the impairment test for 2020 has not shown a need for 
write-downs or reversals of write-downs recognised 
previous years. during 2020 heck wall systems has been 
monitored closely. heck wall systems follows the expec-
tations and market outlook outlined in the impairment 
test last year. the net present value of heck wall systems 
amounts to eur 28 million in 2020 which gives a head-
room of eur 4 million to the carrying amount. the main 
driver is conversion to stone wool products and in 2021 it 
is expected to fully convert to stone wool products.
2019
the impairment test for 2019 has not shown a need for 
write-downs or reversals of write-downs recognised 
previous years. during 2019 heck wall systems has 
been monitored closely. heck wall systems follows the 
expectations and market outlook outlined in the impair-
ment test last year. the net present value of heck wall 
systems amounts to eur 28 million in 2019, which gives 
a headroom of eur 1 million to the carrying amount. 
the main driver is conversion to stone wool products 
and this has shown good progress.
sensitivity analysis
as part of the preparation of impairment tests, sensitivity 
analyses are prepared on the basis of relevant risk factors 
and scenarios that management can determine within 
reasonable reliability. sensitivity analyses are prepared by 
altering the estimates with a range of probable outcomes.
2020
the sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all other 
things being equal; an increase in the discount rate of 1%, 
a decrease in the growth rate of 1% p.a. and an increase 
of input costs of 1% p.a. the write-down in heck wall

2.6 pension obligations
pension payments concerning defined contribution 
plans are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income 
statement. 
defined benefit plans are stated at the net present 
value at the balance sheet date and included in the 
consolidated financial statements. adjustments of the 
plans are carried out on a regular basis in accordance 
with underlying actuarial assessments. actuarial gains 
or losses for defined benefit plans are recognised in 
full in the period in which they occur in other compre-
hensive income. the actuarial assessment is carried out 
every year.
funded benefit plans have assets placed in trustee-ad-
ministered pension funds, which are governed by local 
regulations and practice in each country.
the payments to the pension funds are based on the 
usual actuarial assessments and are recognised in the 
income statement after maturity. provided that the 
actuarial assessments of pension obligations show 
noticeable excess solvency or insolvency in relation to 
the pension fund’s assets, the difference is entered to 
the balance sheet and the future payments are adjusted 
accordingly. with regard to these schemes, the actuari-
al assessment is also carried out every year.
the present value of defined benefit pension 
obligations depends on a number of factors that are 
determined on an actuarial basis using a number of 
assumptions. any changes to these assumptions will 
impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.  
the discount rate and other key assumptions are based 
in part on the current market conditions.

2.6 pension obligations (continued)
a number of the group’s employees and former em-
ployees participate in pension schemes. the pension 
schemes are primarily defined contribution plans. 
however, defined benefit plans are also used, mainly 
in switzerland, the united kingdom and germany. the 
benefit plans in the united kingdom and germany are 
closed for new entries.
under a defined benefit plan the group carries the risk 
associated with the future development in e.g. interest 
rates, inflation, salaries, mortality and disability.
defined benefit plans typically guarantee the employ-
ees a retirement benefit based on the final salary at 
retirement.
the pension benefit plans in the united kingdom and 
switzerland have assets placed in independent pension 
funds. the remaining plans are unfunded, where the 
main part relates to germany. for these plans the 
retirement benefit obligations amount to approximately 
22% (2019: 22%) of the total gross liability.

except for the swiss and uk plans, the mentioned 
defined benefit plans are not subject to regulatory 
requirements regarding minimum funding.
the granted pension payments of the mentioned 
defined benefit plans are based upon the salary of the 
participating employees during the period of employ-
ment. the group’s contributions are derived from the 
split of the pension premium between the employee 
and employer.
the actuarial assessment of the pension obligation is 
based on assumptions specific to each country. the 
latest actuarial calculation is prepared by authorised 
experts. the valuation of the assets is based on the 
composition and the expectations to the economic 
development. the assumptions used are weighted 
averages:

2.7 provisions
provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive 
obligation has been incurred as a result of past events 
and if it is probable it will lead to an outflow of financial 
resources and if the size of the liability can be measured 
on a reliable basis. the provision is calculated as the 
amount expected to be paid to settle the obligation.
provisions relate primarily to jubilee obligations and 
retirement benefits, fair value provision for phantom 
shares, restructuring, warranties and ongoing disputes, 
lawsuits.
as at 31 december 2020 other provisions include a 
provision of eur 5 million (2019: eur 4 million) for 
restructuring measures. this provision is expected to 
be utilised within one year.

3.2 trade receivables
trade receivable are measured at amortised cost less 
allowance for bad debt based on the expected credit 
loss model.
the group applies the simplified approach to measure 
expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected 
loss allowance for all trade receivables. 
to measure the expected credit losses, trade receiv-
ables have been grouped based on shared credit risk 
characteristics and the days past due.

the expected loss rates are based on the payment 
profiles of sales over a period of 60 months before 1 
january 2020 and the corresponding historical credit 
losses experienced within this period. the historical loss 
rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-look-
ing information on macroeconomic factors affecting the 
ability of the customers to settle the receivables.
the costs of allowance for bad debts and realised loss-
es during the year are included in other external costs.

4.1  financial income and financial expenses
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 
in the balance sheet at cost price and are subsequently 
measured at fair value. derivative financial instruments 
are recognised in other receivables and other payables. 
changes to the fair value of derivative financial instru-
ments, which meet the conditions for hedging the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability, are recognised in 
the income statement together with any changes in the 
fair value of the hedged asset or liability. 
changes to the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments, which meet the conditions for hedging 
future cash flow, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income provided the hedge has been effective. hedge 
effectiveness is determined at the inception of the 
4.2  financial risks and instruments
hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective 
effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic  
relationship exists between the hedged item and 
hedging instrument. the accumulated value adjustment 
related to these hedge transactions is transferred 
from other comprehensive income when the position 
is realised, and is included in the value of the hedged 
position e.g. the adjustment follows the cash flow.
for derivative financial instruments, which do not 
qualify as hedging instruments, changes to the fair 
value are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income 
statement as financial income or financial expenses.
financial income and financial expenses also include 
adjustments to fair value hedges, and income and 
costs relating to cash flow hedges transferred from 
other comprehensive income on realisation of the 
hedged items.

4.2  financial risks and instruments (continued)
as a consequence of rockwool group’s extensive 
international activities, the group’s income statement 
and equity are subject to a number of financial risks. the 
group manages these risks in the following categories:
– exchange rate risk, 
– interest rate risk
– liquidity risk
– credit risk
the group’s policy is to identify and hedge significant 
financial risks on an ongoing basis. this is the respon-
sibility of the individual companies in which financial 
risks might arise and overall supported by the group’s 
treasury department. the parent company continuous-
ly monitors the group’s financial risks in accordance 
with a framework determined by group management 
and/or the board of directors.
exchange rate risk
as a consequence of the group’s structure, net sales 
and expenditure in foreign currency are to a significant 
degree set off against each other, so that the group is 
not exposed to major exchange rate risks.
commercial exchange rate risks in the companies, 
which cannot be set off are hedged on a continuous 
basis, to the extent that they may significantly affect 
the results of the individual company in a negative di-
rection, using currency loans, currency deposits and/or 
financial derivatives. exchange rate risks are hedged in 
the individual companies. the group’s hedging reserve 
is disclosed under “statement of changes in equity” 
with an insignificant amount.
the group’s net sales and expenditures will be subject 
to exchange rate fluctuations on translation into eur. 
a sensitivity analysis is made for the group’s result and 
equity based on the underlying currency transactions. 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity 
analysis are cash, receivables, payables, current liabil-
ities and financial investments without taking hedging 
into consideration. the result of the sensitivity analysis

cannot be directly transferred to the fluctuations on 
translating the financial result and equity of sub sidiaries 
into eur.
the impact on the net sales of the difference between 
average rate and year-end rate amounts to eur 42 
million (2019: eur 15 million) for the 5 largest currencies 
(usd, rub, cad, pln and gbp), which is a change of 
-1.5% (2019: 0.5%).
the group’s policy is not to hedge exchange rate risks 
in long-term investments in subsidiaries. when relevant, 
external investment loans and group loans are, as a 
general rule, established in the local currency of the 
company involved, while cash at bank and in hand are 
placed in local currency. 
in the few countries with ineffective financial markets 
loans can be raised and surplus liquidity placed in dkk 
or eur, subject to the approval of the group’s finance 
function. most group loans, that are not established 
in dkk or eur, are hedged via forward agreements, 
currency loans and cash pools or via the swap market.
interest rate risk
currently the group does not have any significant 
non-current interest-bearing debt or assets. the 
group’s policy is that necessary financing of invest-
ments should primarily be affected by raising five to 
seven year loans at fixed or variable interest rates.
drawings on credit facilities at variable interest rates 
generally match the funds, and all group loans are 
symmetrical in terms of interest rates. consequently, 
changes in interest rates will not have a significant 
effect on the result of the group.
liquidity risk
the current surplus and deficit liquidity in the group’s 
companies is set off, to the extent that this is profitable, 
via the parent company acting as intra-group bank and 
via cash pool systems. when considered appropriate, 
underlying cash pool systems are established in foreign 
companies. 
to the extent that the financial reserves are of an appro-
priate size, the parent company also acts as lender to 
the companies in the group.
to ensure adequate financial reserves as defined by the 
board of directors, investment loans can be raised on a 
continuous basis to partly cover new investments and to 
notes
4.2  financial risks and instruments (continued)
refinance existing loans. the parent company has made 
guarantees for some credit facilities and loans. the 
parent company has issued ownership clauses and/or 
deed of postponements in connection with intercom-
pany loans.
the parent company ensures on an ongoing basis that 
flexible, unutilised committed credit facilities of an 
adequate size are established with investment grade 
credit-rated banks. the group’s financial reserves also 
consist of cash at bank and in hand, and unused over-
draft facilities.
credit risk
due to the considerable customer spread in terms of 
geographical location and numbers, the credit risk is 
fundamentally limited. to a minor degree, when consid-
ered necessary, insurance or bank guarantees are used 
to hedge outstanding receivables.
as a consequence of the international diversification of 
the group’s activities there are business relations with 
a number of different banks in europe, north america 
and asia. to minimise the credit risk on placement of 
funds and on entering into agreements on derived 
financial instruments, only major, financially sound 
institutions are used.
customer credit risks are assessed considering the 
financial position, past experience and other factors. 
individual risk limits are set based on internal and exter-
nal ratings. for impairment of trade receivable please 
refer to note 3.2.
no customer exceeds 10 percent of the group’s net 
sales neither this year nor last year.
categories of financial instruments
financial assets and liabilities at fair value are related 
to foreign exchange rate forward contracts, foreign 
exchange rate swaps or interest rate swaps all of which 
have been valued using a valuation technique with 
market observable inputs (level 2). 
the group is using no other valuation technique. the 
group enters into derivative financial instruments with 
financial institutions. 
derivatives valued using valuation techniques with 
market observable inputs are mainly foreign exchange 
forward contracts. the most frequently applied valua-
tion techniques include forward pricing models using 
present value calculations. the models incorporate vari-
ous inputs including the credit quality of counterparties 
and foreign exchange spot rates.

bank loans are measured at amortised cost. the carry-

bank loans amounted to eur 100 million at 31 decem-
ber 2020, mainly related to a new bank loan of eur 150 
million denominated in eur. part of the loan was repaid 
in november 2020 amounting to eur 55 million. the 
full loan is due within one year and is a fixed interest 
loan. the remaining loans amount to eur 5 million and 
are also due within one year.
in 2019, bank loans amounted to eur 5 million, of 
which eur 1 million was due within one year, and none 
were due more than five years after the balance sheet 
date. all bank loans in 2019 had fixed interest and were 
denominated in eur.

distributed. tax on profit for the year, which includes 
current tax on profit for the year and changes to 
deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement. 
tax on changes in other comprehensive income is 
recognised directly under other comprehensive income.
provisions for deferred tax are calculated on all 
temporary differences between accounting and taxable 
values, calculated using the balance-sheet liability 
method.
deferred tax provisions are also made to cover the

5.1 tax
companies within the group may be entitled to claim 
special tax deductions for investments in qualifying 
assets or in relation to qualifying expenditure. the 
group accounts for such allowances as tax credits. con-
sequently, the allowance reduces income tax payables 
and current tax expense. a deferred tax asset is recog-
nised for unclaimed tax credits that are carried forward.
deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable, 
that the assets will reduce tax payments in coming years 
and they are assessed at the expected net realisable value. 
deferred tax is stated according to current tax reg-
ulations. changes in deferred tax as a consequence 
of changes in tax rates are recognised in the income 
statement.

while conducting business globally, transfer pricing 
disputes, etc. with tax authorities may occur, and man-
agement judgement is applied to assess the possible 
outcome of such disputes. the most probable outcome 
is used as the measurement method, and management 
believes, that the provision made for uncertain tax 
positions not yet settled with local tax authorities is ad-
equate. however, the actual obligation may deviate and 
is dependent on the result of litigations and settlements 
with the relevant tax authorities.
the group is subject to income taxes in numerous 
jurisdictions. significant judgement is required in 
determining provision for uncertain tax positions or  
the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
a tax asset is recognised if it is assessed, that the asset 
can be utilised in a foreseeable future based on strong 
indications, that sufficient future profits are available to 
absorb the temporary differences including the group's 
future tax planning. 
the valuation of tax assets related to losses carried for-
ward is done on a yearly basis and is based on expected 
positive taxable income within the next 3-5 years.

5.2  commitments and contingent liabilities
for the group, commitments comprise eur 28 million 
(2019: eur 4 million). the increase in commitments is 
supplier related. contingent liabilities amount to eur 6 
million (2019: eur 8 million). contractual obligations for 
purchase of tangible assets are mentioned in note 2.2.
the group is engaged in a few legal proceedings. it is 
expected that the outcome of these legal proceedings 
will not impact the group’s financial position in excess 
of what has been provided for in the balance sheet as at 
31 december 2020 (as well as at 31 december 2019).
provisions for legal proceedings are recognised, if they 
are certain or probable at the balance sheet date, and 
if the size of the liability can be measured on a reliable 
basis. legal proceedings for which no reliable estimate 
can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

5.5  new and amended standards and general accounting policies
the annual report for rockwool international a/s 
has been prepared in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act. 
the financial year for the group is 1 january –  
31 december 2020.
5.5.1 new and amended standards  
and interpretations 
implementation of new standards, amendments  
and regulations
the group has implemented the following amendments 
or new standards (ifrs) for financial year 2020. the

statements and ias 8 accounting policies, changes 
in accounting estimates and errors: amended defini-
tion of materiality.
–  amendments to ifrs 16 leases: modifications as a 
consequence of covid-19.
it is assessed that the amendments to ifrs 3 might have 
an impact on the future recognition and measurement 
of business combinations for the group financial state-
ments. the remaining new standards and amendments 
are assessed not to be relevant to the group or to have 
no significant effect on the group financial statements.
new and amended standards and interpretation  
not yet entered into force
the following new standards, amendments and inter-
pretations is issued, but not yet adopted by eu, could 
be relevant for the group:
–  ifrs 3 business combinations: amendments to the 
reference of the conceptual framework (effective 
date 1 january 2022).
–  ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 7, ifrs 4 and ifrs 16: ibor 
reform phase 2 (effective date 1 january 2021).
–  ias 1 presentation of financial statements: clar-
ification of classification of liabilities as current or 
non-current (effective date 1 january 2023).
–  ias 16 property, plant and equipment: amendment

rockwool's policy is to follow the 70 percent fee  
cap restriction on non-audit services provided by price-
waterhousecoopers statsautoriseret revisionspartner-
selskab, denmark, the auditor of the parent company. 
pricewaterhousecoopers statsautoriseret revisions-

reporting under the esef regulation
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 
on the european single electronic format (esef reg-
ulation) has introduced a single electronic reporting 
format for the annual financial reports of issuers with 
securities listed on the eu regulated markets.
the esef regulation sets out the annual financial 
reports shall be disclosed using the xhtml format and 
that the primary consolidated financial statements shall 
be tagged using inline extensible business reporting 
language (ixbrl).
ixbrl tags shall comply with the esef taxonomy, which 
is included in the esef regulation and developed based 
on the ifrs taxonomy published in the ifrs foundation.
as part of the tagging process financial statement line 
items are marked up to elements in the esef taxono-
my. if a financial statement line item is not defined in 
the esef taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy is 
created. extensions have to be anchored in the esef 
taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.
the annual report submitted to the danish finan-
cial supervisory authority (the officially appointed 
mechanisms) consists of the xhtml document together 
with some technical files all included in a zip file named 
rock-2020-12-31.zip.
5.5.2 general accounting policies
group accounts
the consolidated financial statements comprise 
rockwool international a/s and the entities in which 
the company and its subsidiaries hold the majority of 
the voting rights.
the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared as a consolidation of the parent company’s 
and the individual subsidiaries’ financial statements, de-
termined according to the group’s accounting policies, 
and with elimination of dividends, internal revenue and 
expenditure items, internal profits as well as intercom-
pany balances and intercompany shareholdings.
besides shares, capital investments in subsidiaries 
include long-term loans to subsidiaries if such loans 
constitute an addition to the shareholding.
translation of foreign currency
the annual report has been presented in euro (eur) 
which is the group’s presentation currency. each compa-
ny in the group determines its own functional currency. 
transactions in foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rate at the transaction date or a hedged 
rate. monetary items in foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. ac-
counts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date for balance 
sheet items, and the periodic average exchange rates 
for items of the income statement.
 
all exchange rate adjustments are recognised in the 
income statement under financial items, apart from the 
exchange rate differences arising on:
–  conversion of equity in subsidiaries at the beginning 
of the financial year using the exchange rates at the 
balance sheet date
–  conversion of the profit for the year from average 
exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date
–  conversion of long-term intercompany balances that 
constitute an addition to the holding of shares in 
subsidiaries
–  conversion of the forward hedging of capital invest-
ments in subsidiaries
–  conversion of capital investments in associated and  
other companies

assumptions that form the basis of the presentation, 
recognition and measurement of the group’s assets and 
liabilities. the most significant accounting estimates 
and judgements are presented below.

independent auditor’s reports
to the shareholders of rockwool international a/s
key audit matter
impairment of intangible and tangible assets
intangible and tangible assets might be impaired 
due to for example increased competition in local 
markets, changes in the global economy and 
changes in the strategy of the group.
we focused on this area as the determination of 
whether or not an impairment charge for intangible 
and tangible assets was necessary involves 
significant estimates and judgements made by 
management, including especially:
–   estimation of future cash flows, including 
sales margin, and the significant assumptions 
underlying management’s expectations; 
–   discount rates applied in discounting future cash 
flows; and
–  long-term growth rates
reference is made to notes 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
we tested the impairment tests prepared by 
management and evaluated the reasonableness of 
estimates and judgements made by management in 
preparing these.
our audit procedures included assessing the group’s 
 impairment model. special focus was given to the key 
drivers of the future cash flows, including growth in net 
revenues, cost inflation and efficiency improvements, 
as well as the significant assumptions concerning dis-
count rates and long-term growth rates applied.
we examined sensitivity analyses performed over 
changes in discount rates, revenue growth and 
efficiency improvements.
moreover, we tested the historical reliability of man-
agement’s estimates by comparing budgeted figures 
to actual figures for the past years. 
we evaluated the disclosures of impairment testing 
in the notes.
report on the audit of the financial statements
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the group’s financial position at 31 
december 2020 and of the results of the group’s opera-
tions and cash flows for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020 in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and further 
requirements in the danish financial statements act.
moreover, in our opinion, the parent company financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the parent 
company’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and 
of the results of the parent company’s operations for 
the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-
form report to the audit committee and the board of 
directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements of rockwool 
international a/s for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 (pp. 67-106) comprise the 
consolidated income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, 
the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies. 
the parent company financial statements of 
rockwool international a/s for the financial year 1 
january to 31 december 2020 (pp. 112-121) comprise the 
income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of 
changes in equity and the notes, including summary of 
significant accounting policies.
collectively referred to as the “financial statements” 
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. our 
responsibilities under those standards and requirements 
are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the international ethics standards board 
for accountants’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. we have also 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the iesba code. 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-
audit services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation 
(eu) no 537/2014 were not provided.
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of rockwool 
international a/s on 9 april 2014 for the financial 
year 2014. we have been reappointed annually 
by shareholder resolution for a total period of 
uninterrupted engagement of 7 years including the 
financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements for 2020. these 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
consolidated financial statements

statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review 
 (pp. 3-66 and p. 107).
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
management’s review, and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read management’s review and, 
in doing so, consider whether management’s review 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, we considered whether management’s 
review includes the disclosures required by the danish 
financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, in our view, 
management’s review is in accordance with the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the  
financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of con-
solidated financial statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and further requirements 
in the danish financial statements act and for the prepa-
ration of parent company financial statements that give a 
true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control as manage-
ment determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material mis-
statement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the 
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, 
we exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
–  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
independent auditor’s reports
(continued)
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-
sentations, or the override of internal control.
–  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s and the parent company’s internal control.
–  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
–  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause the group or the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
–  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
–  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to commu-
nicate with them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independ-
ence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial statements we 
performed procedures to express an opinion on whether 
the annual report of rockwool international a/s for 
the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with 
the file name rock-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the commission 
delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the european 
single electronic format (esef regulation) which 
includes requirements related to the preparation of the 
annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an annual 
report that complies with the esef regulation. this 
responsibility includes:
–  the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format;
–  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl 
tags, including extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, 
for all financial information required to be tagged 
using judgement where necessary;
–  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and 
the consolidated financial statements presented in 
human-readable format; and
–  for such internal control as management determines 
necessary to enable the preparation of an annual 
report that is compliant with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on 
whether the annual report is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef regulation 
based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a 
report that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and 
extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material departures from the requirements set out in the 
esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error.  
the procedures include:
–  testing whether the annual report is prepared in 
xhtml format;
–  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl 
tagging process and of internal control over the 
tagging process;  
–  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of 
the consolidated financial statements;
–  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of 
ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxonomy and 
the creation of extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been identified;
–  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements 
to elements in the esef taxonomy; and
–  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited 
consolidated financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of rockwool 
international  a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020 with the file name rock-2020-12-31.zip 
is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with 
the esef regulation.

1.1  accounting policies
the financial statements of rockwool international 
a/s have been prepared in accordance with the danish 
financial statements act (accounting class d). 
the financial statements for 2020 are presented in eur.
changes in accounting policies
the accounting policies applied remain unchanged 
from previous year.
the accounting policies are the same as for the con-
solidated financial statements with the adjustments 
described below. for a description of the group’s 
accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated 
financial statements.
recognition and measurement in general
income is recognised in the income statement as earned. 
all costs incurred in generating the year’s revenue are 
also recognised in the income statement, including 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses.
value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value or amortised cost are also recog-
nised in the income statement.
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is 
considered probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the company and the value of the asset can be 
measured on a reliable basis. liabilities are recognised 
in the balance sheet when they are considered probable 
and can be measured on a reliable basis. at initial 
recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. 
assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as 
described below for each item.
net sales
the company produces and sells machinery and consul-
tancy service. the projects typically include one deliver-
able. revenue from the projects is recognised over time 
based on the progress and is based on the price of the 
projects. as the work is done at the customer's site, con-
trol is transferred along with the progress of the project. 
recognition is based on the actual costs spent relative 
to the total estimated costs for the project, as this meth-
od is estimated to reflect the transfer of control. the 
credit terms are normally end of month plus 20 days.
royalty is received for the use of the rockwool 
brand and technology. royalty is based on the level of 
sales in the subsidiaries and recognised when earned 
according to the terms in the agreement.
intangible assets
the accounting policies for intangible assets follow 
those of the group with the exception of goodwill, 
which is amortised over a period of 10 years using the 
straight-line method.
an amount equal to the total capitalised development 
costs after tax is recognised under shareholders’ equity 
in the reserve for development costs.
fixed assets investments
investments in subsidiaries are recognised initially at 
cost and measured subsequently using the equity meth-
od. the company’s share of the equity of subsidiaries, 
based on the fair value of the identifiable net assets on 
the acquisition date, minus or plus unrealised inter-
company profits or losses, with addition of any residual 
value of goodwill, is recognised under investments in 
subsidiaries in the balance sheet.
if the shareholders’ equity of subsidiaries is negative 
and rockwool international a/s has a legal or con-
structive obligation to cover the company’s negative 
equity, a provision is recognised. net revaluation of 
investments in subsidiaries is recognised under share-
holders’ equity in the revaluation reserve according to 
the equity method. the reserve is reduced by payments 
of dividends to the parent company and adjusted to 
reflect other changes in the equity of subsidiaries.
the proportionate share of the net profits of subsid-
iaries less goodwill amortisation is recognised under 
income from investments in subsidiaries in the income 
statement. goodwill in subsidiaries is amortised over a 
period of 10 years using the straight-line method.
receivables from subsidiaries
receivables from subsidiaries are recognised at amor-
tised costs and are subsequently measured after de-
duction of allowance for losses based on an individual 
assessment.
leases
leases in which a significant portion of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. payments made under 
operating leases are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
dividend
the dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as 
a separate item under shareholders’ equity.
cash flow statement
rockwool international a/s has in accordance with 
the danish financial statements act, section 86 (4) not 
prepared separate cash flow state ments. please refer to 
the consolidated cash flow statements.

ments for the following notes, see information in the

reference is made to note 4.2 to the consolidated 
financial statements concerning derivatives.
the policy is not to hedge exchange rate risks in long-
term investments in subsidiaries.
when relevant, external investment loans and group re-
ceivables are, as a general rule, established in the local 
currency of the company involved, while cash at bank 
and in hand are placed in the local currency. 
in the few countries with ineffective financial markets 
loans can be raised and surplus liquidity placed in dkk 
or eur, subject to the approval of the parent company’s 
finance function.
4.3  derivatives
most group receivables that are not established in dkk 
or eur are hedged via forward agreements, currency 
loans and cash pools or via the swap market.
to ensure adequate financial reserves as defined by the 
board of directors, investment loans can be raised on a 
continuous basis to partly cover new investments and to 
refinance existing loans.
ownership clauses have been issued and/or deed 
of postponements in connection with intercompany 
receivables. please refer to note 5.3.
