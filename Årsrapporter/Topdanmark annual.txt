results for 2020 
topdanmark’s post-tax profit for 2020 was dkk 1,124m 
(2019: dkk 1,547m). 
 
pre-tax profit was dkk 1,453m (2019: dkk 1,987m). 
 
the technical result decreased by dkk 218m to  
dkk 1,316m. the decrease is caused by lower run-off  
(dkk 269m), and by a higher claims trend on house 
insurance (dkk 187m). covid-19 related issues 
improved the technical result in 2020 by an estimated 
amount of dkk 121m of which dkk 22m is run-off loss 
included above.  
 
the investment return adjusted for return on non-life 
insurance provisions decreased by dkk 81m to  
 
 
 
dkk 15m (loss). the investment return was impacted by 
the turmoil in the danish mortgage market during  
q1 2020 due to the covid-19 outbreak, resulting in a 
substantial spread widening that impacted the portfolio of 
danish mortgage bonds which is used for hedging of the 
provisions. 
 
the profit on life insurance decreased by dkk 210m to 
dkk 117m, primarily due to a lower investment return  
(dkk 167m). 
 
the profit of dkk 1,124m is better than assumed in the 
latest model profit forecast in the q3 report, showing a 
post-tax profit of dkk 750-850m. the profit improvement 
is mainly due to a higher investment return, run-off profits 
and a lower level of weather-related claims in q4 2020 
than assumed.
 
 
 
results for q4 2020 
the profit for q4 2020 was dkk 571m (q4 2019: 
dkk 431m). 
 
pre-tax profit increased by dkk 180m to dkk 731m. 
 
the technical result increased by dkk 96m to  
dkk 371m due to, among other things, benign weather 
conditions (dkk 49m) and covid-19 related issues, 
including motor- and travel insurance (dkk 63m).  
 
on the other hand, a lower run-off level (dkk 40m) and a 
higher claims trend on house insurance (dkk 38m) had a 
negative impact on the claims trend in q4 2020. 
 
after return on non-life insurance provisions, the 
investment return in non-life insurance increased by  
dkk 65m to dkk 277m. the investment return was 
mainly driven by gains on listed equities. 
 
the profit on life insurance increased by dkk 38m to  
dkk 74m. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
impact of the covid-19 situation 
topdanmark has a robust business model with a high 
degree of diversification between the business activities, 
a very low liquidity risk and a solid capital base (a 
solvency cover of 170 at the end of 2020). 
 
in the q3 report, the impact from covid-19 on the 
combined ratio for 2020 was assumed to be positive  
0.5-1.0pp. also in q4, covid-19 reduced the number of 
claims on i.a. travel and motor insurance. consequently, 
covid-19 impacted the combined ratio for 2020 by 
results and profit forecast model

1.2pp. including the investment return, the total impact of 
covid-19 is assumed to be dkk 21m in 2020.  
 
during the covid-19 pandemic, topdanmark’s online 
claims handling platform has been used by a large 
number of customers. also, the use of chatbot services 
tripled when the amount of customer inquiries within 
travel insurance peaked. 
 
 
non-life insurance in 2020 
premiums earned 
premiums earned increased by 3.6% to dkk 9,732m. 
the private segment accounted for a 1.3% increase, and 
the sme segment accounted for a 6.2% increase. 
adjusted for a change in segmentation, premium growth 
was 2.1% and 5.3% in the private segment and sme 
segment, respectively. 
 
the growth was impacted by a change in provisions for 
future losses in illness and accident (0.8%) caused by the 
strengthening of provisions in q4 2019 and by price 
increases in h2 2020. 
 
in the private segment, premiums were negatively 
impacted by the termination of the distribution agreement 
with danske bank at the end of h1 2019. however, the 
new distribution agreement with nordea starting on  
1 january 2020 has been off to a good start.  
 
in 2020, the change of distribution partner had a negative 
impact of 1.1pp on topdanmark’s total non-life premium 
income, split between 1.0pp growth from the new 
distribution agreement with nordea and a decline of 2.1pp 
from the previous distribution agreement with danske 
bank. 
 
topdanmark continues to assume that distribution 
through nordea will compensate fully for the terminated 
distribution agreement with danske bank during 2021 in 
terms of premiums. 
 
on 1 october, sydbank terminated the distribution 
agreement with topdanmark. the distribution agreement 
was established in 2015. at the end of 2020, the sydbank 
portfolio represented dkk 0.5bn of which dkk 0.3bn was 
written by topdanmark before the agreement was 
established. the distribution agreement with sydbank 
represented approx. 5% of topdanmark’s new sales in 
2020. the termination of the agreement became effective 
by the end of 2020. as topdanmark has good momentum 
in new sales and low churn rates, the terminated 
distribution agreement with sydbank only has a marginal 
negative impact on the premium growth in 2021.  
 
according to the top 1-2-3 strategy, topdanmark intends 
to expand through organic growth, through direct sales, 
digital sales and distribution partners. when it comes to 
growth through distribution partners, topdanmark will 
further strengthen its cooperation with existing distribution 
partners, and in addition to this, look for new distribution 
partners including banks. 
 
claims trend 
the claims trend deteriorated to 70.1 in 2020 from 67.6 in 
2019. 
 
the run-off profit excluding covid-19, net of reinsurance, 
was dkk 186m (2019: dkk 433m), representing a 2.5pp 
negative effect on the claims trend. run-off profits were 
primarily generated in workers’ compensation, in illness 
and accident and on motor third-party liability whereas 
run-off losses were generated within accident, property 
and professional liability. 
 
the lower level of run-off profits in 2020 compared with 
previous years was affected by outliers in the short tail 
business lines with substantial run-off losses on 
professional liability and property, but also by the steady 
fall of the risk premium on motor third-party liability and 
accident, which has characterised the past many years, 
now levelling off. as stated in the q2 report, topdanmark 
assumes that the risk premium on motor third-party 
liability and accident will remain stable in the coming 
years. 
 
in 2020, weather-related claims amounted to  
dkk 102m (2019: dkk 70m), representing a 0.3pp 
deterioration of the claims trend. thereby, the level of 
weather-related claims was dkk 68m below the assumed 
normal level of dkk 170m. 
 
the level of large-scale claims (claims exceeding  
dkk 5m by event after refund of reinsurance) increased 
by dkk 34m to dkk 86m in 2020, representing a 0.3pp 
deterioration of the claims trend. the large-scale claims 
were dkk 14m below the assumed normal annual level 
of dkk 100m. 
 
on motor insurance, the claims trend, adjusted for the 
covid-19 effect, improved due to higher average 
premiums. the development on motor improved the 
claims trend by 0.8pp. 
 
on illness and accident, and workers’ compensation, the 
claims trend improved due to price increases and more 
efficient claims handling. the improvements were 1.0pp 
and 0.3pp respectively.  
 
the claims trend on house insurance deteriorated by 
dkk 187m in 2020 corresponding to a negative impact on 
the claims trend of 1.9pp. among the reasons are a 
higher level of water claims due to the rainy start of the 
year, and that covid-19 caused a higher level of 
refurbishment on houses increasing the number of water 
 
announcement no. 03/2021 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 6 of 94 
pipe and fungus claims, and that topdanmark was hit by 
a couple of very large fire claims.  
 
the increased level of claims on house insurance 
especially from houses built in the 1960s and 1970s 
represents a change in the risk picture. consequently, 
topdanmark has taken actions by way of risk-based price 
increases, stricter acceptance criteria and increased 
focus on claims prevention.  
 
 
   
 
the claims trend adjusted for run-off, weather-related 
claims, large-scale claims, and other positions including 
change of risk margin improved by 0.7pp to 70.4 in  
2020. 
 
as already mentioned, the claims trend in 2020 was 
impacted by many water claims on houses owing to a 
record high level of rain. claims related to the high level 
of rain impacted the claims trend negatively by 0.5pp. 
 
the claims trend was negatively impacted by the lower 
level of interest rates. the discounting effect (movements 
in the yield curve used for discounting the provisions) had 
a negative impact on the claims trend of 0.2pp compared 
with 2019.  
 
compared with 2019, covid-19 is assumed to have had 
a net positive impact on the adjusted claims trend of  
dkk 121m (1.2pp) including a run-off loss of dkk 22m on 
income protection insurance. the positive impact of 
covid-19 was on motor (dkk 76m), on contents  
(dkk 44m), on travel (dkk 58m), and on accident  
(dkk 26m).  
 
on the other hand, covid-19 impacted the adjusted 
claims trend related to income protection insurance 
negatively by dkk 63m due to the increase in 
unemployment.  
 
in addition, covid-19 is assumed to have a negative 
impact on illness and accident (dkk 10m) and workers’ 
compensation (dkk 10m). illness and accident will be 
affected by a higher level of customers making use of 
their health insurance getting treatments in private 
hospitals as the public hospitals have focused on  
covid-19 patients.  
 
both illness and accident as well as workers’ 
compensation will be hit by the higher level of 
unemployment (harder to reactivate injured employees).   
 
the underlying claims trend, which is adjusted for the 
extraordinary rain claims in q1 and q3 2020, discounting 
and covid-19 impact, improved by 0.1pp to 71.0.  
 
expense ratio 
the expense ratio was 16.3 up from 16.0 in 2019. 
 
the increase in expense ratio is impacted by high sales 
through nordea, and covid-19 related expenses. 
 
the level of the expense ratio is also affected by 
significant investments in digital solutions and 
automation. topdanmark expects that these investments 
will pay off in the coming years through efficiency gains, 
see “targeted gross efficiency gains of dkk 500m in 
2025” and “profit forecast model for 2021” on  
pages 12-14. 
 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio was 86.5 in 2020 (2019: 83.7). 
excluding run-off, the combined ratio was 88.2 (2019: 
88.3). 
 
the general trend of wages and salaries and the increase 
in pay roll tax from 15.0% in 2019 to 15.2% in 2020 
impacted the combined ratio by 0.4pp.

respectively. 
 
the change of distribution partner from danske bank to 
nordea had a net negative impact of 0.1pp in q4 2020. 
 
the growth was positively impacted by a change in 
provisions for future losses in illness and accident (1.2%). 
 
the claims trend was 68.3 in q4 2020 down from 71.5 in 
q4 2019. 
 
large-scale claims were dkk 16m in q4 2020, which

representing an improvement of the claims trend of 0.5pp.  
 
the run-off profit excluding covid-19, net of reinsurance, 
was dkk 48m (q4 2019: dkk 90m), representing a 
1.9pp negative effect on the claims trend. 
 
the claims development on motor adjusted for covid-19 
improved due to higher average premiums, improving the 
claims trend by 1.5pp. 
 
the claims trend was impacted by a dkk 38m 
deterioration on house insurance (1.5pp) due to an  
 
 
 
increased claims frequency and an increased average 
size of claims on burst water pipes and fungus claims. 
 
the claims trend adjusted for run-off, weather-related 
claims, large-scale claims and change of risk margin 
improved by 4.1pp to 69.6 in q4 2020. 
 
in q4 2020, covid-19 had an assumed positive impact 
on the adjusted claims trend of dkk 63m (2.5pp).  
 
covid-19 impacted the claims trend positively on travel 
insurance (1.3pp), motor (0.7pp), and contents (0.7pp). 
 
in q4 2020, covid-19 negatively impacted the adjusted 
claims trend related to income protection insurance by 
dkk 11m (0.4pp). 
 
the underlying claims trend, which is adjusted for 
discounting and the impact of covid-19, improved by 
1.3pp to 72.4.

the combined ratio was 85.1 in q4 2020 (q4 2019: 88.3). 
excluding run-off, the combined ratio was 87.1 (q4 2019: 
92.1). 
 
in q3 2020, topdanmark launched a new online sales 
platform targeting the private segment in the topdanmark 
brand.  
 
following the introduction of the online sales platform, 
topdanmark launched a branding campaign in print, on

topdanmark for.  
 
during q4 2020, the branding campaign continued on 
broad channels, albeit with a significant reduction towards 
december. the campaign still performs well and before 
the christmas downturn, there was a significant increase 
in the level of unaided awareness. campaign spending 
resumes in the new year, aiming at improving digital 
sales. 
 
segment reporting 
private 
the private segment offers policies to individual 
households in denmark. 
 
premiums increased by 1.3% to dkk 5,179m. 
premiums were negatively impacted by an adjusted 
segmentation in terms of accounting between the private 
and sme segments (dkk 43m). with this adjustment, 
premiums increased by 2.1%. 
 
the technical result was dkk 527m in 2020, representing 
a decrease of dkk 159m compared with 2019. 
 
the claims trend deteriorated by 3.0pp to 73.9. the 
claims trend was negatively impacted by a lower level of 
run-off profits (2.0pp), a higher level of weather-related 
claims and house insurance see pages 5-6. 
compared with 2019, the claims trend was favourably 
influenced by a positive development in motor, travel 
insurance, and on theft due to the covid-19 situation.  
 
the expense ratio deteriorated to 15.9 from 15.7 in 2019 
due to increased acquisition costs and investments in 
digitalisation and automation. 
 
the combined ratio was 89.8 (2019: 86.6). 
 
excluding run-off, the combined ratio was 92.1 in 2020 
(2019: 90.9). 
 
in q4 2020, premiums increased by 3.0% to  
dkk 1,304m. adjusted for the change in segmentation 
(dkk 25m) and change in reservation for future losses in 
illness and accident (dkk 29m), premiums increased by 
2.7%. 
 
in q4 2020, the claims trend improved by 5.9pp to 73.5 
due to a lower level of claims from illness and accident 
and improved claims trend on motor, contents, and travel 
insurance related to covid-19. 
 
the combined ratio in q4 2020 was 90.1 compared with 
96.2 in q4 2019. excluding run-off, the combined ratio 
improved to 92.0 in q4 2020 from 98.7 in q4 2019.   
 
 
    
sme 
the sme segment offers policies to danish-based smes 
and agricultural businesses. 
 
premiums increased by 6.2% to dkk 4,571m. adjusted 
for the change in segmentation between the private and 
the sme segments, premiums increased by 5.3%.  
 
topdanmark continues to have positive momentum in 
new sales to smes and agricultural businesses. 
 
 
 
the technical result decreased by dkk 59m to 
dkk 789m in 2020. 
 
the claims trend deteriorated by 2.2pp to 66.0 caused by 
a lower level of run-off profits (3.6pp) and a higher level of 
weather-related claims. by contrast, especially workers’ 
compensation and motor improved. 
 
the expense ratio was 16.8 compared with 16.4 in 2019.

the expense ratio in 2020 was impacted by changes in 
the sales force organisation and by covid-19 related 
issues. 
 
the combined ratio was 82.7 in 2020 up from 80.3 in 
2019. 
 
excluding run-off, the combined ratio was 83.8 in 2020 
(2019: 85.2). 
in q4 2020, premiums increased by 9.2% to  
dkk 1,186m. adjusted for the change in segmentation 
(dkk 25m), premiums increased by 6.9%. 
 
the claims trend in q4 2020 deteriorated by 0.5pp to 62.8 
impacted by a lower level of run-off profits. 
 
in q4 2020, the combined ratio deteriorated by 0.4pp to

life insurance in 2020 
the result from life insurance was a profit of dkk 117m 
(2019: dkk 327m). 
 
profit on life insurance activities comprises the profit on 
life insurance plus the investment return of topdanmark 
 
 
 
liv holding. these profits are calculated in accordance 
with the stated policy for the calculation of profit for the 
life insurance company: see www.topdanmark.com → 
about topdanmark → strategy and business → non-life 
and life insurance → policy for the calculation of profit in 
life insurance.  
 
 
developments in 2020 
compared with 2019, the negative development in 2020 
for life insurance primarily derives from investment return 
on shareholders’ equity. the investment return on  
shareholders’ equity was dkk 19m in 2020 (2019:  
dkk 186m) and was impacted by the situation on the 
financial markets due to covid-19. 
 
the result of sales and administration which decreased 
by dkk 21m to dkk 43m (loss) derived from costs  
 
 
 
 
connected to the implementation of the new core it 
system launched in 2019. the insurance risk result has  
decreased by dkk 33m to dkk 10m (loss). the 
insurance risk result is quite volatile. 
 
trend in premiums 
gross premiums decreased by 1.1% to dkk 10,981m in 
2020, of which premiums on unit-linked pension schemes 
were dkk 10,216m, representing a 1.9% increase 
compared with 2019.

life insurance in q4 2020 
the result in q4 2020 increased from dkk 36m to  
dkk 74m, primarily due to an improved investment return 
on shareholders’ equity.  
 
gross premiums decreased by 13.9% to dkk 2,575m in 
q4 2020 of which premiums on unit-linked pension 
schemes were dkk 2,399m, a 13.0% decrease 
compared with q4 2019.  
 
regular premiums increased by 1.0% to dkk 882m in  
q4 2020, whereas single premiums decreased by 20.1% 
to dkk 1,693m. 
 
 
 
investment activities  
topdanmark group excl. life insurance 
the investment return of the topdanmark group 
excluding life insurance was dkk 426m in 2020 (2019: 
dkk 794m). return and revaluation of non-life insurance 
provisions were a loss of dkk 374m in 2020 (2019: loss 
of dkk 616m). 
 
the investment return including return and revaluation of 
non-life insurance provisions was dkk 52m, and thus 
dkk 150m lower than the projected return for 2020, when 
calculated using topdanmark's forecast model at the 
beginning of 2020. the lower return should be seen in the 
light of covid-19. lockdowns imposed by numerous 
countries slowed down the economic activity in large 
parts of the world. the economic uncertainty has had a 
negative impact on some high-risk assets such as clos.  
 
others, such as global equities have fully recovered, and 
during q4 reached a new record high. 
 
 
 
the danish mortgage bond market is dominated by aaa 
bonds where spreads to swaps in march widened much 
faster and further than during the financial crisis a decade 
ago. despite some easing of tensions up to the end of q1 
2020 and in the following three quarters, the losses from 
the assets hedging of the interest sensitivity of the 
provisions still dominate their revaluations by a wide 
margin.  
 
topdanmark's policy is to accept a certain level of 
financial risk, given its strong liquidity and stable, high 
earnings from insurance operations. among other things, 
topdanmark has invested in equities, property, and clos 
to improve the average investment return.

the equity exposure was dkk 1,159m pre-tax and 
excluding associated companies but including the impact  
of derivatives. the equity portfolios are well diversified 
with no large individual positions. the composition of the 
portfolios is based on omxccap for danish equities, 
representing approx. 20% of the portfolio as of 30 
december 2020, and the foreign portfolios are based on 
msci world dc in local currency for foreign equities.  
 
the class “unlisted equities and hedge funds” includes 
private equity positions (dkk 75m) and positions in 
hedge funds where the investment mandates aim at 
positioning in the credit market (dkk 194m). 
 
the group's investments have no significant 
concentration of credit risk except for investments in aaa-
rated danish mortgage bonds.  
 
the class “government and mortgage bonds” mainly 
consists of danish government and mortgage bonds. the 
interest rate sensitivity of this asset class is to a 
significant extent equivalent to the total interest rate  
sensitivity of the technical provisions in topdanmark 
forsikring, and the illness and accident provisions in 
topdanmark livsforsikring (the life insurance company).  
consequently, the return on “government and mortgage 
bonds” and the return and revaluation of non-life 
insurance provisions should be assessed on an 
aggregate level. however, as mentioned above during 
times of financial distress, proper interest risk 
management does not necessarily ensure that losses on 
liabilities are offset by gains on assets and vice versa.  
 
the class “credit bonds” is composed of a minor share of 
a well-diversified portfolio of credit bonds, primarily issued 
from businesses in europe. 
 
the class “index linked bonds” comprises bonds, 
primarily danish mortgage bonds, for which the coupon 
and principal are index linked. 
 
the class “clos” primarily comprises positions in clo 
equity tranches. the underlying assets of clos are 
mostly senior secured loans, while the remainder are 
primarily investment grade investments. 
the property portfolio mainly comprises owner-occupied 
property (dkk 837m). the properties are valued in 
accordance with the rules of the danish fsa (the danish 
financial supervisory authority) i.e. at market value 
taking into account the level of rent and the terms of the 
tenancy agreements. 99% of the property portfolio is 
currently let when adjusting for properties under 
construction or conversion for other purposes. 
 
“expenses, money markets etc.” comprises money 
market deposits, intra-group balances, the result from 
currency positions, other returns and expenses not 
included in the other classes. 
 
“subordinated loan capital” comprises subordinated loans 
issued by the parent company and by topdanmark 
forsikring. 
 
topdanmark uses the solvency ll discounting curve with 
volatility adjustment (va) for assessing insurance 
provisions. the va component comprises a corrective 
element for the development in pricing of danish

development in pricing of european business credits. the 
va component was 19bp at the beginning of the year and 
22bp at the end of 2020.  
 
 
parent company etc. 
the parent company, topdanmark, does not perform any 
independent activities. the profit of the parent company  
etc. includes the profits of subsidiaries not within the 
insurance business (primarily topdanmark asset 
management), finance costs and other expenses. 
the profit of the parent company decreased dkk 26m to 
dkk 34m in 2020.  
 
 
taxation 
the tax charge was dkk 329m of the pre-tax profit of  
dkk 1,453m, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 
22.6% (2019: 22.2%). 
 
 
targeted gross efficiency gains of 
dkk 500m in 2025 
as mentioned in the q3 2020 report, topdanmark will 
upscale the level of investments to improve the efficiency 
of the company. 
 
the main focus areas in the efficiency programme are: 
• 
automation/digitalisation of routine-based processes  
• 
risk and pricing 
• 
procurement and cost 
 
the annual gross efficiency gains are targeted to be  
dkk 500m in 2025. it is assumed that this improvement 
in efficiency will provide a good basis for topdanmark’s 
competitive position in the future market. 
 
dkk 120m of the efficiency gains are assumed to impact 
the 2021 result. compared with 2020, additional costs 
following the increased level of investments in the 
efficiency programme will impact the technical result for 
2021 negatively by approx. dkk 100m. 
 
consequently, the net impact of the efficiency programme 
will be dkk 20m in 2021, and the dkk 20m are included 
in the 2021 forecast. 
 
 
 
the net effect of the annual gross efficiency gains of  
dkk 500m may be impacted by deviations to the 
assumed future: 
• 
due to competition, some of the efficiency gains 
may be lost by way of lower prices. 
• 
new efficiency programmes may affect the gains 
expected to be realised before 2025.  
• 
the market environment may be different from the 
one assumed. 
• 
the automatic price indexation is expected to cover 
claims inflation, and it is assumed that topdanmark 
will make no general price increases above the 
automatic price indexation. this may not be the 
case. 
• 
it is assumed that there will be no major external 
obstacles like new pandemics, additional levies, 
etc. 
 
 
new it systems 
a key element in unfolding topdanmark’s 1-2-3 strategy 
is new core it systems in both life and non-life. in the life 
division, the new core it system was implemented in 
2019. in non-life, the it system will start being 
implemented in 2021. consequently, topdanmark will 
start depreciating the cost in relation to the new non-life 
system in 2021. 
 
the new core it systems support topdanmark’s ambition 
of increasing the strategic and operational use of data-
driven processes for business transformation and 
optimisation across all business areas in topdanmark. 
 
the assumed level of depreciation on the non-life core 
system will increase from approx. dkk 25m in 2021 to a 
peak at approx. dkk 230m in 2026.

profit forecast model for 2021 
traditionally, topdanmark does not publish actual profit 
forecasts, but instead, the expected level of results 
provided that a number of assumptions about the return 
in the financial markets are met. the return on financial 
assets changes on a daily basis, and consequently 
topdanmark's profit forecast model will already deviate 
from actual expectations by the time it is published.  
therefore, set out at www.topdanmark.com → investors 
→ risk management, we provide additional information 
on how changes in the assumptions underlying the profit 
forecast model will affect the results. 
 
as can be seen, the investment return forecast model is 
not based on a specific estimate of the expected 
investment return for the rest of the year, but solely on a 
long-term standard assumption regarding the return. 
 
non-life insurance 
in the q3 report, it was disclosed that topdanmark 
assumed premium growth for 2021 of just above 3%. this 
was based upon the following assumptions: 
• 
the change in distribution partner from danske bank 
which was terminated at the end of q2 2019 and the 
new distribution agreement with nordea as at 1 
january 2020 will in terms of premium level out 
during 2021. 
• 
the terms of the termination of the distribution 
agreement with sydbank have yet to be finally 
negotiated, but it is expected that the termination will 
have a negative impact on growth of approx. 0.2pp.  
• 
the automatic premium indexing in the private 
segment will be 2.3% in 2021. approx. 70% of 
topdanmark’s premiums earned are comprised by 
automatic premium indexing. thus, the premium 
effect of the automatic premium indexing on non-life 
insurance is approx. 1.6%. 
 
the claims trend on house insurance has deteriorated in 
2020. in order to improve profitability on house insurance, 
topdanmark has launched price increases in 2020 which 
will be implemented during 2021 and 2022. furthermore, 
price increases on illness and accident insurance and 
income protection insurance have been launched.  
 
topdanmark still assumes premium growth for 2021 in 
non-life of just above 3%. 
 
in the q3 report, topdanmark also assumed a combined 
ratio for 2021 of about 90, excluding run-off. 
this was based on the following assumptions: 
• 
weather-related claims of dkk 170m. the weather-
related claims, broken down by quarter, are assumed 
to be as follows: 
o 
q1: dkk 50m 
o 
q2: dkk 25m 
o 
q3: dkk 45m 
o 
q4: dkk 50m 
• 
large-scale claims (large-scale claims of a value 
exceeding dkk 5m after reinsurance) of dkk 100m 
• 
a negative impact of covid-19 of 0.6 compared with 
2020 
• 
an expense ratio of approx. 16 
• 
a level of interest rates corresponding to the interest 
rate curve on 30 september 2020 
• 
efficiency gains of approx. 0.7pp from the efficiency 
programme   
• 
topdanmark will upscale investments in the 
efficiency programme and compared with 2020 the 
increased level of investments will impact the 
combined ratio for 2021 negatively by approx. 1pp. 
• 
consequently, the net impact of the efficiency 
programme is assumed to impact the combined ratio 
negatively by approx. 0.3pp in 2021. 
 
since the announcement of the q3 report, the assumed 
efficiency gains in 2021 have been improved by  
dkk 50m. as a result, the assumed net impact on the 
combined ratio in 2021 has been improved from negative 
0.3pp to positive 0.2pp. 
 
furthermore, profitability improving measures on house 
insurance are assumed to improve the combined ratio in 
2021 by 0.5-0.7pp compared with 0.25-0.5pp which was 
assumed in the q3 report. 
 
the outbreak of a new covid-19 mutation has had a 
positive impact on the 2021 assumptions. it is expected 
that the new lockdowns will lead to a positive impact on 
travel and motor insurance and a negative impact on 
income protection insurance, thus resulting in net 
improvement of the combined ratio to the tune of  
0.3pp. 
 
finally, discounting rates (including changes in va) have 
decreased relatively to the guidance for 2021 in the q3 
report, representing a 0.5pp deterioration of the 
combined ratio. therefore, the assumed combined ratio 
for 2021 is improved from about 90 to 89-90, excluding 
run-off. 
 
the overall assumed pre-tax result for non-life insurance 
is dkk 1,130-1,230m. 
 
life insurance 
in the q3 report, topdanmark assumed a pre-tax profit 
in the life division of dkk 50-100m in 2021.  
 
the assumed life result for 2021 was affected by teething 
problems in the implementation of the new core it 
system. the work is progressing, but some problems are 
yet to be solved, meaning that some of the implementing 
costs are carried over to 2021 and 2022. on top of this, 
the assumptions for the investment return for life was 
lowered due to the lower interest rate and lower 
assumptions for the investment return in general.  
 
announcement no. 03/2021 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 14 of 94 
topdanmark assumes a decrease in regular premiums of 
0-5% in 2021. at this time, it is pointless to make 
assumptions about the level of single premiums. 
 
the profit forecast model for life insurance is based on 
the following assumptions: 
• 
full recognition as income of risk return for 
shareholders’ equity from all interest rate groups 
• 
no profit from the shadow account. 
 
since the announcement of the q3 report, the assumed 
investment return has improved due to price increases 
and growth in aum. 
  
consequently, the pre-tax profit for the life division has 
been upgraded from dkk 50-100m to dkk 100-150m. 
 
the result is very sensitive to fluctuations particularly in 
the investment return. the risk return and shadow 
account will not be finally determined before year end. 
 
parent company 
the profit forecast model for the parent company plus 
subsidiaries outside of the insurance group assumes a 
pre-tax profit of dkk 40-50m. 
taxation 
given a corporation tax rate of 22%, the tax charge is 
expected to be dkk 270-330m. 
 
total group profit 
topdanmark’s overall post-tax profit according to the 
profit forecast model for 2021 is dkk 1,000-1,100m 
representing an eps of dkk 12.0. the assumed profit is 
exclusive of run-off. 
 
the profit forecast model assumes an annual 7.0% return 
on equities, and unchanged foreign exchange rates from 
the level as at 30 december 2020. 
 
furthermore, it is assumed that the return on interest-
bearing assets hedging the discounted provisions exactly 
suffices to cover discounting and revaluation of the 
provisions, while the return on the remaining interest-
bearing assets is assumed to be 1.47% (risk-free interest 
rate plus 2.0pp).
  
 
 
 
risk management 
topdanmark's policy is to hedge against risks arising from 
the company's activities or to limit such risks to a level 
that allows the company to maintain normal operations 
and implement its planned measures even in the case of 
highly unfavourable events in the outside world. 
 
as a consequence of this policy, for a number of years 
the company has identified and reduced or eliminated the  
risks which could potentially cause losses exceeding what 
topdanmark considers to be acceptable. for example,  
major strategic shareholdings have been sold, the 
catastrophe cover for weather-related events or terror has  
been increased significantly and the financial risk has 
been reduced. 
 
 
 
 
 
at the end of 2020, topdanmark’s solvency ratio was 
170. topdanmark assesses that with this solvency ratio, 
the company will be able to maintain normal operations 
and implement planned measures even in the event of, 
for example, another collapse in the financial markets as 
in 2008. 
 
the solvency ratio can be adjusted to a certain extent in 
accordance with the board of directors’ wishes. for 
example, the board of directors can choose to increase 
the solvency ratio by reducing capital requirements via a 
reduction of the group’s investment-related risk profile. 
an element thereof could be to offer life insurance 
customers having with-profit products to switch to unit-
linked products, for which the capital requirement is 
significantly lower. it is an ongoing consideration process,

because both risk-reducing measures will reduce the 
profitability of the topdanmark group. 
 
topdanmark’s assessment is that the current level of the 
solvency ratio is comfortable considering the wish for a 
sound own funds base and satisfactory profitability. 
in order to ensure strict control of the overall risk, the 
exposures are calculated as often as deemed necessary,  
i.e. daily, monthly, quarterly or in a few cases annually, 
according to the nature of the exposure. 
 
the board of directors determines the overall risk policies 
and limits. the internal auditors report to the board of 
directors and report on, among other things, the 
observance of these risk policies and limits. 
 
topdanmark's risk management function identifies, 
assesses and quantifies risks. it reports to the risk 
committee, which is responsible for risk policies, risk 
limits, solvency calculation, capital plans, topdanmark's 
own risk and solvency assessment (orsa), and 
topdanmark's partial, internal model for non-life 
insurance risks. the members of the risk committee are 
the cfo of the group, the head of the compliance 
function and the heads of the primary risk areas, which 
are: asset management, statistical services, 
reinsurance, finance and life actuarial services.  
 
the risk committee reports and recommends to the 
board of directors via the executive board. the risk 
committee has set up the model committee, which is 
responsible for developing and operating topdanmark's 
internal model for calculation of results probabilities and 
risks of the non-life insurance portfolio based on random 
simulation. the model is used for, among other things, 
optimising the reinsurance programme, calculation of cost 
of capital, forecast balancing and calculating capital 
requirements. 
 
the internal model has been used in solvency 
calculations since 2014 in accordance with the danish 
solvency rules, and from 2016 it has been amended to 
meet the eu solvency ii rules in force. the danish fsa 
has approved the use of topdanmark’s internal model 
when calculating solvency capital requirements.  
 
the risk management function implements an annual 
orsa process identifying risks in the business, 
quantifying these risks and collecting them in a risk 
register. additionally, the principles of solvency 
calculation are reviewed, and the risk management 
process is updated. an orsa report has been prepared, 
which, together with the risk register and risk 
management process, was considered at a board 
meeting in the autumn of 2020. 
 
on an ongoing basis, the risk management function 
addresses the rules for solvency calculation and reporting 
etc. of the solvency ii directive to ensure that 
topdanmark meets this set of rules. 
 
overview 
topdanmark believes that the group's most important 
risks relate to the following main areas: 
• non-life insurance 
• life insurance 
• market 
• counterparty 
• operational 
• compliance 
• climate 
• strategy. 
 
please refer to note 46 for a more detailed description of 
the above-mentioned risks. 
 
risk scenarios 
the group's risk factors are illustrated in the following 
table of the most significant risk factors calculated as the 
post-tax impact on profit and shareholders’ equity. the 
given assumptions do not reflect topdanmark's expected 
risks but are shown only as examples which could be 
used as a basis for assessing the company's exposure to 
the risks mentioned. 
 
 
 
 
solvency calculation and capital 
requirements 
solvency ii gives the companies the opportunity to fully or 
partially develop their own internal risk model for solvency 
calculation. topdanmark uses a partial internal model 
developed in-house to calculate the non-life risk.

+ deferred tax on security funds 
+ profit margin

own funds 
 
as at 11 december 2020, topdanmark forsikring a/s 
has redeemed subordinated notes of dkk 500m issued in 
2015. the subordinated notes were replaced by a new 
subordinated loan of dkk 500m with provisions in  
accordance with the requirements of solvency ii as at  
30 december. the issue was a private placement 
subscribed by if p&c insurance ltd.  
 
topdanmark has an outstanding subordinated tier 1 loan 
(restricted tier 1 capital notes) of dkk 400m. this loan is 
perpetual, but includes an option enabling topdanmark to 
redeem the loan as at 23 november 2022. 
 
topdanmark forsikring has outstanding subordinated tier 
2 notes in two tranches: 
• 
dkk 500m, call in 2025, expiry in 2030.  
• 
dkk 850m, call in 2021, expiry in 2026. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
capital model 
topdanmark pursues a policy of keeping its shareholders' 
equity at a relatively low level. any amounts in excess of 
the conservatively estimated shareholders' equity 
considered necessary to support the underlying business 
are paid out to shareholders by means of payment of 
dividend. 
 
the size of the necessary solvency capital, i.e. 
shareholders’ equity reduced by the value of assets not 
included in the solvency cover, has been calculated at 
dkk 3,400m. further solvency cover is ensured through 
outstanding subordinated notes. 
 
 
 
capital structure and ownership 
topdanmark's board of directors has an authorisation  
granted in the articles of association to increase the 
company's share capital, to raise convertible loans  
and/or issue warrants. the issues may be with or without 
pre-emptive rights for the company's shareholders. the 
authorisations are limited to a total of 2,500,000 shares. 
they expire on 12 april 2023. 
 
at the end of 2020, topdanmark’s share capital totalled 
dkk 90,000,000 divided into shares of dkk 1 each, 
corresponding to 90,000,000 voting rights. as at 5 
february 2021, topdanmark held 2,403,487 shares 
representing 2.67% of the share capital.

board of directors and articles of 
association 
appointment and replacement of 
members of the company's board of 
directors 
the board of directors, which is elected at the annual 
general meeting and by the employees of the 
topdanmark group, is the company's top level 
management formulating the company's objectives, goals 
and strategies, and making decisions on matters that are 
of significant importance or unusual in nature to the 
company.  
topdanmark's board of directors comprises nine 
members, six of them elected by the annual general 
meeting and three by topdanmark's employees in 
accordance with the danish companies act. 
in accordance with this act, the number of board 
members elected by employees must be at least half the 
number of those elected by the shareholders at the 
annual general meeting. the rights, duties and 
responsibilities of the board members elected by 
employees are the same as those of the board members 
elected by shareholders at the annual general meeting.  
the term of office for members elected by shareholders 
at the general meeting is one year, while according to 
legislation, it is four years for members elected by 
employees. 
board members are elected individually.  
the board of directors has addressed its composition 
and qualifications in “policy on diversity at board level”. 
the company believes that, by imposing in advance very 
specific requirements on the board members, it may 
prevent the election of an evidently qualified board 
candidate, if they do not fully meet the requirements. 
topdanmark wants to make an individual decision on 
each board candidate based on an overall consideration 
of the candidate's qualifications as compared with the 
company's business model and associated risks, present 
needs and the composition of the rest of the board of 
directors. topdanmark believes that in a company like 
topdanmark, its board members should possess 
combined skills within organisation, strategic 
management, insurance operations, reinsurance, long-tail 
business, financial and insurance reporting, general 
statistics, risk management and risk assessment, sales to 
the private and commercial markets, marketing and 
branding, outsourcing, finance, own funds, solvency and 
minimum capital requirements, rules for internal models, 
audit, financing and investment, regulatory environment, 
compliance, it and it security, digitalisation as well as 
recruitment and human resources. information on the 
defined competencies possessed by each of the board 
members elected by shareholders at the annual general 
meeting is provided in the section on the board of 
directors in the annual report. taking the latest 
evaluation of the board into account, it is assessed that 
topdanmark's board of directors with its current 
composition possesses the above-mentioned skills and 
qualifications. 
diversity 
topdanmark’s current board of directors reflects diversity 
in many areas, including professional background and 
education, gender and age. its members have experience 
from the financial and industrial sectors, nationally and 
internationally. the board of directors believes that this 
composition enables it to consider a given problem from 
many different angles which is confirmed by experience 
from the day-to-day board duties. read more about each 
board member’s background, competencies and rate of 
attendance on www.topdanmark.com → about 
topdanmark → organisation → executive board and 
board of directors, and under board of directors and 
executive board in this annual report. 
four of the nine board members are women, two of them 
elected by the annual general meeting and two by 
topdanmark's employees. consequently, topdanmark 
 
announcement no. 03/2021 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 18 of 94 
meets its goal: that the board has a minimum of three 
persons of each gender. topdanmark meets the statutory 
definition of an equal gender distribution. 
topdanmark has signed up to the un global compact 
intended to ensure, among other things, the prevention of 
discrimination in businesses. 
topdanmark works to maintain and develop openness in 
the company culture to counter any form of discrimination 
due to gender, race, colour, nationality, social and ethnic 
origin, religion, beliefs, political opinion, disability, age and 
sexual orientation. topdanmark believes that diversity 
provides business value, and that it is important that all 
employees may advance to managerial positions at all 
levels.  
topdanmark's board of directors has adopted policies on 
diversity. “policy on diversity at board level” and “policy 
on diversity and the under-represented gender in the 
management body of topdanmark” have been published 
on topdanmark’s website. more information on diversity 
including “women in management” is available in the 
csr report 2020.  
evaluation of the board of directors 
on a regular basis, the board of directors evaluates the 
board assignments, the full board and the contributions 
and results made by the individual members, cooperation 
with the executive board, the chairman’s management of 
the board of directors, the board composition, the work in 
the committees and the set-up of the committees, the 
organisation of the work and the quality of the material for 
the board of directors. the board evaluation is based on 
anonymous questionnaires on the work in the board and 
cooperation with the executive board, anonymous 
evaluation of the individual members of the board of 
directors and the executive board, optional individual 
interviews between the chairman of the board and each 
member of the board and questionnaires on the expertise 
of each board member. the board of directors carries 
out a self-evaluation once a year. the chairman of the 
board is in charge of the evaluation with no involvement 
of the executive board. on the basis of a specific 
evaluation, the board of directors decides if it is 
necessary and/or relevant to involve external consultants 
in the evaluation process. 
any additional directorships undertaken by the board 
members including the significance and extent of each 
duty form part of the evaluation of topdanmark’s board of 
directors. the evaluation of overboarding is based on the 
guidelines prepared by iss and additionally, a subjective 
evaluation is made. none of topdanmark’s board 
members is considered to be overboarded. 
 
amendments to the company's 
articles of association 
the annual general meeting is topdanmark's ultimate 
decision-making vehicle. resolutions at annual general 
meetings are passed by a simple majority of votes, unless 
a special majority or representation is required by the 
danish companies act or the articles of association. the 
articles of association provide that resolutions amending 
the articles of association are only valid if adopted by an 
affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of the votes 
cast as well as of the capital represented at the general 
meeting. the articles of association provide no 
restrictions on voting rights. 
 
 
severance pay 
in order to ensure full loyalty, focus and performance for 
the topdanmark group during the period until a potential 
takeover is finalised, topdanmark has agreed with a few 
members of the executive board and orienteringsforum, 
that  under certain circumstances, they will receive 
compensation in the form of an extended period of notice 
and increased severance pay, if they resign or are 
dismissed or if their position is made redundant because 
topdanmark and/or the company in the topdanmark 
group where the member is employed is taken over by or 
merges with a company outside the group, or if one or 
more owners take control of topdanmark and/or the 
company in the topdanmark group where the member  is 
employed. the maximum amount of compensation will 
represent two years’ remuneration. 
 
in accordance with the rules in force from time to time, 
topdanmark group can sign agreements on severance 
pay with directors, orienteringsforum and other material 
risk takers. for agreements signed after november 2017, 
the total value of remuneration for the period of 
termination, including severance pay, cannot exceed two 
years’ salary including all remuneration components. for 
agreements signed before november 2017, severance 
pay cannot exceed the value of the remuneration for the 
past two years.  
 
for two members of the present executive board and one 
member of orienteringsforum and one member of 
topdanmark’s other management level, it was agreed 
that, in continuation of sampo group’s take-over of de 
facto control of topdanmark in 2013, they would earn 
remuneration equivalent to six months' salary per vesting 
year over a period of three years. the vesting period is 
over, and the remuneration will be paid when employment 
ends. the remuneration is regulated annually in relation 
to the current salary level.  
 
 
remuneration structure 
topdanmark's remuneration policy is intended to optimise 
long-term value creation at group level and support 
 
announcement no. 03/2021 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 19 of 94 
topdanmark business strategy. at the same time, 
topdanmark’s remuneration policy should strengthen the 
attraction, retention and motivation of qualified members 
of topdanmark’s management, as well as ensure 
consistency between the interests of management, the 
company and shareholders. the annual general meeting 
has adopted "remuneration policy of the topdanmark 
group." 
 
the remuneration policy covers topdanmark's board of 
directors, executive board, other material risk takers and, 
as provided by legislation, employees involved in control 
functions and audit. if specifically stated, topdanmark's 
remuneration policy also covers its senior management 
team composed of a number of divisional and service 
area directors (“orienteringsforum”) and certain other 
employees, at the discretion of the board of directors. 
the remuneration policy, as adopted by the annual 
general meeting, is available on www.topdanmark.com → 
about topdanmark →  corporate governance → 
remuneration structure. 
 
the overall purpose of topdanmark’s remuneration policy 
is to ensure transparency and shareholder influence on 
topdanmark’s remuneration. the share price reflects the 
anticipated value creation at group level. this is one of 
the reasons why topdanmark believes that share-based 
incentive pay, including revolving share options, ensures 
that management is exposed to the development in share 
prices and thus encourages individual managers to make 
decisions which support value creation as much as 
possible from a holistic perspective.  
 
the decision of the application of short-term and long-
term, incentive remuneration has been made for the 
purpose of securing a balance between short-term and 
long-term results. 
 
in addition to a policy on salaries, the remuneration policy 
also includes the pension policy and the guidelines for 
granting variable salary components, severance pay and 
identification of other employees whose activities have 
material impact on topdanmark’s risk profile. 
 
the remuneration paid to the executive board, 
orienteringsforum and other material risk takers should 
be competitive with remuneration at comparable 
companies and can be composed of the following 
remuneration components: fixed basic remuneration, 
additional remuneration, pension, other benefits, 
employee shares, option-based long-term incentive 
programme (“lti programme”), cash- and share-based 
short-term incentive programme (“sti programme”) and 
extraordinary variable remuneration. 
 
the determination of the fixed basic remuneration paid to 
the executive board, orienteringsforum and other 
material risk takers is based on a specific assessment of 
each employee. i.a. based on the position, individual 
characteristics, and performance of the individual. the 
fixed basic remuneration for the executive board and 
orienteringsforum is reassessed annually and is 
determined by individual negotiations with each member 
of the executive board and orienteringsforum on the 
basis of a framework set by the board of directors. 
 
topdanmark’s lti programme for the executive board 
and orienteringsforum is a revolving share option scheme 
which entails that a fixed proportion equivalent to 10% of 
(the cash salary + pension + company car value) is paid 
in the form of share options according to a revolving 
option programme.  
 
in addition to options paid to the executive board and 
orienteringsforum in accordance with the revolving share 
option scheme, the executive board can grant up to a 
total of 200,000 options to employees, including other 
material risk takers, who have made special efforts or in 
other ways contributed extraordinarily to the value 
creation.  
 
topdanmark’s sti programme is a cash- and share-
based incentive programme which is tied up with the 
completion of a number of predefined goals for each 
member of the programme. sti bonus cannot exceed 
40% of the employee’s fixed basic salary including 
pension.  
 
the variable remuneration for a director cannot exceed 
50% of the director’s fixed basic remuneration, including 
pension. the variable remuneration for other material risk 
takers, including members of orienteringsforum, cannot 
exceed 100% of the employee’s fixed basic remuneration 
including pension. for directors, the share options and 
other derivatives cannot exceed 12.5% of the fixed basic 
remuneration including pension at the time of calculation. 
 
the executive board is not paid a special pension 
contribution. the remuneration takes this into account in 
the form of a personal supplement of 25% of the cash 
pay. consequently, topdanmark does not have any 
pension-related obligations to the executive board, and 
there will be no payment of pension on retirement.  
 
orienteringsforum and other material risk takers receive a 
pension contribution of up to 25% of their cash 
remuneration. the amount is paid to the pension supplier 
and consequently, all pension obligations are fully 
covered by the pension supplier. reference is also made 
to the topdanmark group's remuneration report 2020 
and payment report 2020  
 
share options 
for 2021, topdanmark has granted 77,684 share options 
to its executive board and 148,279 share options to 
senior management. the strike price of dkk 291 was 
 
announcement no. 03/2021 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 20 of 94 
fixed at 110% of the market price of topdanmark's shares 
on 30 december 2020 (average of all trades). 
besides the revolving scheme referred to above, further 
80,000 share options have been granted for 2021 to a 
number of other executives who have made a special 
effort or otherwise contributed extraordinarily to value 
creation in the company. 
 
 
the options granted for 2021 are not to be exercised any 
earlier than subsequent to the publication of the 2023 
annual results in 2024, and any later than subsequent to 
the publication of the 2025 annual results in 2026. in the 
intervening period, the options can only be exercised up 
to three banking days after topdanmark's publication of 
its annual, half year and interim reports. 
 
the value of issuing the options amounts to dkk 10m, 
using the black and scholes model assuming a share 
price of dkk 264.37, an interest rate equivalent to the 
zero coupon rate based on the swap curve of 30 
december 2020, future annual volatility of 22%, a pattern 
of exercise similar to topdanmark's previous allocations 
of share options and otherwise in accordance with ifrs 2 
on share-based payments. 
 
including the granted options for 2021, the exposure of 
the options held by the executive board represented 
0.3% of the number of outstanding shares. 
 
topdanmark’s remuneration report for 2020 and 
topdanmark’s payment report for 2020 provides 
additional information on remuneration in topdanmark 
and topdanmark’s option scheme. detailed information is 
available on www.topdanmark.com → investors →  
reports and presentations → remuneration reports and 
payment reports.  
 
 
distribution of dividend for 2020  
given topdanmark’s solid own funds, the board of 
directors will recommend to the agm that a distribution  
of an ordinary dividend of dkk 1,035m from this year’s 
profit of dkk 1,124m will take place, representing a pay-
out ratio of 92.1. to comply with the danish fsa’s 
recommendation of 18 december 2020 on continued 
prudence in relation to financial companies’ capital 
distribution, topdanmark has been cautious when 
determining the recommended distribution of dividend, 
and has, as a precautionary measure, secured that the 
pay-out ratio is kept below topdanmark’s customary pay- 
out level, and that topdanmark’s conservative capital 
base is maintained.  
 
the recommended ordinary dividend distribution 
represents a dividend yield of 4.4 and a dividend of  
dkk 11.5 per share.  
 
as a consequence of the covid-19 situation in 2020, 
only dkk 8.5 of the previously announced dividend of  
dkk 17 per share for 2019 was paid out in connection 
with the agm on 2 april 2020. 
 
during 2020, it was stated that when the situation was 
back to normal, the board of directors would have the 
option to distribute in part or in full the remaining dkk 8.5 
of the previously announced dividend of dkk 17 per 
share as extraordinary dividend. if so, this extraordinary 
dividend would be paid out later in 2020 or after the 
ordinary general meeting in 2021. 
 
on 26 june 2020, the danish fsa decided to 
recommend danish financial companies not to complete 
capital distribution for the remainder of 2020. based on 
the danish fsa’s recommendation topdanmark’s board 
of directors decided to postpone the pay-out of the 
share options granted

goodwill and development projects under construction are subjected to an impairment test at the end of the year.
goodwill:
goodwill relates primarily to the purchase of non-life insurance companies in 1999.
the future cash flows are based on three years’ expected technical result and a terminal value of the private segment
to which goodwill relates. 
the expected technical results are calculated as part of an ongoing, quarterly forecast process.
primary assumptions:
the calculation of premiums earned is based on the insurance portfolio adjusted to reflect the expected effect of
business decisions and market development. the portfolio is indexed by the wage and salary index. claims
incurred are based on the current levels adjusted to reflect the normalised level of weather and large-scale claims. 
furthermore, in general, the expected development in the level of claims and the effect of loss prevention activities
are included. the levels of claims are adjusted to reflect the expected inflation. expenses are calculated by 
projecting the expenditure base by the expected changes in activities and pay increases obtained through
collective agreement, changes in taxes and duties etc. the reinsurance result is calculated in accordance with
the current reinsurance programme and adjusted to reflect known and expected changes in prices and the size
of cover. the calculation of the terminal value includes a growth rate of 0% (2019: 0%).
the pre-tax discount rate is 7.7% (2019: 7.7%) and the post-tax rate 6.0% (2019: 6.0%).
it is believed that there are no scenarios in which a probable change in the assumptions of the expected technical
result or the discount rate will result in a situation where the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its recoverable
amount for the private segment.
development projects:
completed development projects primarily comprise the new policy administration systems for life, dkk 521m.
the remaining expected useful lifetime end of 2020 is 8 years. completed development projects are assessed for
impairment end of year and at indications of impairment. the assessment showed no need for write-downs.
development projects under construction mostly comprise a new customer and core system for non-life. the
impairment test did not show any need for write-downs.
amortisation of intangible assets is primarily included in claims incurred and operating expenses.

share options
topdanmark's share option scheme comprises the executive board and senior executives. the strike price has been
fixed at 110% of the market price on the last trading date in the prior financial year (average of all trades).
the options may be exercised 3-5 years subsequent to the granting. the scheme is settled by shares
(equity instruments).
there are no other earnings conditions to the option scheme than employment in the full year of allocation. 
options are allocated at the beginning of the year and in connection with resignation in the year of allocation a
proportional deduction in the number of allocated options is made.

the fair value of the granting for the year has been calculated using the black and scholes model assuming a price of
dkk 329.05 (2019: dkk 302.68) per share, an interest rate corresponding to the zero coupon rate based on the swap
curve end of december the previous year, future volatility of 22% (2019: 22%) p.a. and a pattern of exercise similar to
topdanmark's previous granting of share options, resulting in an average life of the options of approximately 4 years.
the volatility has been calculated on the basis of previous years' volatility, which continues to be management's best 
estimate of future volatility. the stated strike prices for outstanding options are reduced by dividend distributions.

due to the covid-19 situation, end of march topdanmark transferred structured products as clos of dkk 6,628m
from level 2 to level 3 implying valuation models based on non-observable inputs.
collaterised loan obligations (clo) are actively managed loan portfolios investing in leveraged loans. each clo 
contains different investment opportunities, ranging from the most secure aaa rated tranche to unrated sub-ordinated 
notes (equity). topdanmark asset management invests across the debt-stack and has investments within equity
as well.
clo investments are measured based on the present value of expected future cashflow. the cashflows are estimated
by modelling the collateral pool in each clo ensuring that the deal is in compliance with e.g. collateral quality tests on 
each payment date. if such tests are breached, cashflows for lower rated tranches are diverted to buy additional 
collateral and/or redeem tranches with the highest rating. cashflows are to be diverted as long as collateral tests are 
breached. lower rated tranches might receive paid-in-kind coupons during such periods which are to be paid in full  
before cashflows to unrated tranches are resumed.

topdanmark's policy is to accept a certain 
level of market risk in order to profit from 
the group's strong liquid position and its 
high, stable earnings from insurance 
operations. 
 
in order to improve the average 
investment return and limit the overall 
market risk, topdanmark invests in a wide 
range of asset categories. 
topdanmark's board of directors has set 
limits on the acceptance of market risks in 
the form of risk limits. 
 
compliance with these limits is checked 
regularly.

strategic risks 
most important risks

risk reducing activities 
generally, strategic risks are related to 
the company's business model, political 
conditions, reputation, alliance partners' 
and competitors' conduct as well as 
macroeconomic conditions. 
 
low strategic risk due to strong business 
model. 
 
topdanmark's business model stands 
strong against strategic risks. the results 
of the company will, to a very high degree 
of probability, be positive even in the 
event of another collapse in the financial 
markets as in 2008. the company’s 
result will also be positive if it is hit by a 
storm like the 1999-hurricane, which was 
the largest storm event in the company's 
history. the covid-19 pandemic that 
occurred in 2020 has also shown the 
robustness of topdanmark’s business 
model. 
 
the following description of risks in the topdanmark group elaborates on the above matrix. 
 
 
non-life insurance 
underwriting risk 
acceptance policy 
topdanmark's acceptance policy is based on a wish to 
make a profit from both products and customers. 
topdanmark varies the pricing of its products depending 
on the relevant risk criteria and the costs of administering 
those products.  
 
topdanmark's pricing has been aligned with the individual 
markets and types of customer. in the private and 
commercial markets, prices are mostly based on 
standardised rates, while major commercial customers 
are offered more individualised charges. 
 
danish insurance companies do not cover damage 
arising from floods or the cost of replanting forests 
following storms, industrial diseases, war or warlike acts, 
earthquake or other natural disasters and with certain 
exceptions damage due to nuclear energy or radioactivity. 
 
follow-up policy 
in order that both products and customers are profitable, 
topdanmark systematically acts upon changes in its 
customer portfolios. 
 
customer scoring is used in the private market. the 
customers are divided into groups according to the 
expected level of profitability. the customer scoring helps 
ensure the balance between each customer's price and 
risk. this intends to ensure that no customer pays too 
much to cover losses on customers who pay too little. 
 
the historical profitability of major sme customers with 
individual insurance schemes is monitored using 
customer assessment systems. 
 
general insurance rates are re-calculated on a regular 
basis. 
 
provisions are generally calculated on a monthly basis 
across all lines of business. the claims trend is assessed 
monthly and followed up by any necessary price changes. 
 
topdanmark continues to improve its administration 
systems to achieve more finely meshed data capture, 
which in turn enables it to identify the claims trends at an 
earlier point in time and compile information on the 
constituent parts of the various types of claim. 
 
claims handling 
in order to ensure uniform and efficient claims handling, 
topdanmark has grouped the handling of all types of 
claim into one operational unit. 
 
the handling of claims is intended to make the customers 
feel "well-helped" and safe while at the same time ensure 
efficient management and control of the claims incurred. 
 
 
topdanmark helps its customers when they require 
assistance 
focus is on the customer experience, ensuring that the 
single customer finds topdanmark delivering an excellent 
service.  
 
customers’ satisfaction with visits and email-, telephone- 
and internet contact is monitored daily to act immediately 
on each dissatisfied customer enabling us to help the 
customer and learn from the incident too. 
 
efficient management of claims incurred 
topdanmark is continuously focusing on making its 
claims handling processes more efficient under the 
following three main headings: 
• 
promptness 
• 
better claims procurement 
• 
quality. 
 
promptness 
it is important to promptly obtain an overall impression of 
the size of a claim, implement any damage controlling 
actions and/or commence the repair. prompt attention not 
only reduces the compensation paid but also provides a 
better experience for the customer. 
 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 65 of 94 
typically, the claims department operates with day-to-day 
management of claims notifications and other claims 
handling in order that the value of the claim does not 
increase. customers increasingly undertake notification of 
claims online. turnaround times are continuously 
monitored. 
 
better claims procurement 
topdanmark always seeks to optimise procurement for 
the benefit of both customers and shareholders. 
 
quality 
topdanmark has developed procedures for all major 
claims processes to ensure that they are handled in a 
uniform and controlled manner. these are supplemented 
by rules governing the level of professional and financial 
competence expected of each of the employees in the 
claims department. 
 
the overall professionalism is controlled by regular 
quality assessment of a random sample of claims. for 
example, it is investigated whether the cover, reason for 
the claim and provisioning are correct, the recourse 
possibilities have been tested and that the excess, vat 
etc. have all been charged. 
 
claims handling supported by topdanmark’s claims 
handling system 
topdanmark’s claims handling system supports 
professional accuracy, and topdanmark continuously 
works to optimise its systems in order to improve the 
claims handling processes through automation.  
 
the claims organisation works with the version of the 
lean concept used by the service organisations, based 
on the customer’s needs and focusing on providing the 
right help in the first contact with the customer. 
 
besides improved customer satisfaction, the correct 
assessment of the damage also reduces the claims 
handling time and the average compensation.
contingency plan 
topdanmark has a contingency plan to ensure that 
prompt, correct and targeted action is taken on a major 
weather event such as storm, hurricane, cloudburst or 
flood. the contingency programme consists of several 
levels, and this enables a proportional response 
depending on the size of the event. topdanmark has 
appointed emergency helpers throughout the company 
whose claims handling knowledge is regularly kept up-to-
date by training targeted at the knowledge level of the 
individual emergency helper. furthermore, automation 
technology and robot processes are being implemented 
on an ongoing basis in order to improve the scalability of 
the contingency programme.  
 
loss prevention and loss limitation 
topdanmark focuses on loss prevention and loss 
limitation by investing in, among others, iot-solutions and 
machine learning. the main objective is to incline 
customers towards pro-active risk handling so that they 
themselves can keep abreast of reducing their 
vulnerability. by doing this, topdanmark ensures security 
for the customer and reduces its own risk at the same 
time. 
 
provisioning risk 
provisions for outstanding claims 
traditionally, the insurance classes are divided into short-
tail i.e. those lines where the period from notification until 
settlement is short and long-tail, i.e. those lines where the 
period from notification until settlement is long. 
 
examples of short-tail lines are buildings, personal 
property and comprehensive motor insurance. long-tail 
lines relate to personal injury and liability such as workers' 
compensation, accident, motor third-party insurance and 
commercial liability. 
 
 
composition of topdanmark’s overall provisions for outstanding claims: 
 
 
 
the much higher provisioning risk in long-tail than in 
short-tail lines is due to the longer period of claims 
settlement. it is not unusual that claims in long-tail lines 
are settled three to five years after notification and in rare 
cases up to 10-15 years. 
during such a long period of settlement, the levels of 
compensation could be significantly affected by changes 
in legislation, case-law or practice in the award of 
damages adopted by, for example, the danish labour 
market insurance which awards compensation for injury

and loss of earnings potential in all cases of serious 
industrial injuries. the exposure to industrial injuries has 
been reduced substantially over the past five years. 
 
the practice adopted by the danish labour market 
insurance also has some impact on the levels of 
compensation for accident and personal injury within motor, 
liability and commercial liability insurance. 
 
the provisioning risk represents mostly the ordinary 
uncertainty of calculation and claims inflation, i.e. an  
increase in the level of compensation due to the annual 
increase in compensation per policy being higher than the 
level of general indexation or due to a change in judicial 
practice/legislation. 
 
the sufficiency of the provisions is tested in key lines by 
calculating the provisions using alternative models as  
well, and then comparing the compensation with 
information from external sources, primarily statistical 
material from the danish labour market insurance and 
the danish road sector/road directorate. 
 
the actuarial team is continuously in dialogue with the 
claims departments on any changes in the practices 
stemming from new legislation, case law or compensation 
awards as well as the impact of such changes on the 
routines used to calculate individual provisions. 
 
provisions for unearned premiums 
premium provisions are measured based on an estimate 
of future payments for incidents in the remaining period of 
cover. a significant uncertain and estimated assessment 
is involved in the determination thereof. premium 
provisions must be seen in connection with the profit 
margin as an increase in the estimated cashflow will be 
absorbed by the profit margin up to a combined ratio of 
100. financial estimates and assessments with effect on 
the result of the year and shareholders’ equity are 
therefore primarily relevant within businesses with 
combined ratio of 100 or more,  where premiums are 
insufficient for covering expected payments and a risk 
margin, and consequently provisions to cover losses must 
be made. 
 
catastrophe risks 
topdanmark limits its insurance risk on significant events 
through a comprehensive reinsurance programme. 
 
storm and cloudburst 
reinsurance covers storm claims of up to dkk 5.1bn with 
a retention of dkk 100m. snow load, snow thawing and 
cloudburst are also covered. reinstatement for the 
proportion of the cover used up is activated by payment 
of a reinstatement premium. in the event of another storm  
within the same year, there is cover of a further  
dkk 5.1bn with a retention of dkk 100m. in the event of 
a third and fourth storm, there is cover of up to dkk 670m 
with a retention of dkk 20m if the events occur within the 
same calendar year. to this should be added the cover 
not already hit twice by the first two storms. the cover of 
a third or fourth storm is dependent on the storm 
programme not having been hit previously by two 
individual storms each exceeding dkk 2.9bn. the storm 
programme is renewed on 1 july. 
 
specific reinsurance cover of dkk 100m for cloudburst 
takes effect if accumulated annual cloudburst claims 
exceed dkk 50m. for a claim to be accumulated, the 
single event must exceed dkk 10m. the maximum 
retention in the event of an extreme cloudburst is  
dkk 75m plus reinstatement premiums. 
 
fire 
topdanmark has a proportional reinsurance programme 
for fire with a maximum retention of dkk 25m per claim 
on any one business. 
 
terrorism 
with certain restrictions, terrorism is covered by the 
reinsurance contracts. 
 
the nbcr terrorism risks are covered by a public 
organisation financed by fees on insurance covers if a 
claims event take place. this is according to an act on 
nbcr terror in force as at 1 july 2019. 
 
workers' compensation 
in workers' compensation, up to dkk 1bn is covered with 
a retention of dkk 50m. 
 
cumulative risk 
known cumulative risk is where it has been recognised 
prior to the event that several policyholders could be 
affected by the same event. in personal lines, 
topdanmark's retention is dkk 15m for the first claim, 
dkk 5m for the subsequent claims up to a total 
aggregated amount of dkk 50m. dkk 15m for further 
claims after exhausting of the aggregate cover of  
dkk 50m. the retention is a maximum of dkk 25m in the 
sme line. unknown cumulative risk is where several 
policyholders could be affected by the same individual 
event (conflagration damage) without the common risk 
being recognised prior to the event occurring. the 
retention is a maximum of dkk 50m. 
 
 
life insurance 
loss absorbing buffers in the event of low 
interest rates 
customers’ individual and collective bonus potential is the 
loss absorbing buffers in life insurance against any losses 
incurred by customers on investment activities. 
 
low interest rates mean that the market value of the 
guarantees granted is high, and that the related bonus 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 67 of 94 
potential is low. the lower the bonus potential, the higher 
the risk of any losses being wholly or partially borne by 
shareholder's equity. if interest rates are high, the same 
losses could, to a larger degree, be absorbed by the 
bonus potential. 
 
declines in the collective bonus potential are most 
frequently due to the investment return being lower than 
the addition of interest to deposits. declines in collective 
bonus potential are also possible if interest rates are 
relatively high. 
 
in order to protect shareholders' equity, it will in general 
be relevant to reduce market risks in the event of low 
interest rates. all policies have been split into contribution 
groups according to the guaranteed benefit scheme. in 
each contribution group, the investment policy is intended 
to ensure the ability to meet the guaranteed benefits, and 
the market risk is adjusted in accordance with the risk 
capacity of the contribution groups. the movements in 
interest rates are followed in order that risk reducing 
actions may be taken when needed.  
 
disability 
disability risk is the risk of increasing disability intensity or 
declines in the rates of resumption of work, in that the 
benefits have been guaranteed until expiry. losses may 
incur due to an increase in disability frequency or due to 
inadequate health evaluation when the policy is written. 
 
extra costs due to a permanent change in disability risk 
will be partially covered by individual and collective bonus 
potential. the remainder affects profit/loss for the year 
and consequently shareholders' equity. 
longevity 
longevity risk is the risk that customers with life 
dependent policies, primarily annuities, live longer than 
expected, which will increase provisions for lifetime 
products. 
 
extra costs due to longer lifetimes will be partially covered 
by individual and collective bonus potential. the 
remainder affects profit/loss for the year and 
consequently shareholders' equity. 
 
pandemic risks 
extraordinary losses as a result of a pandemic affecting 
the age groups insured in the company’s group life 
portfolio must be financed by shareholders equity. 
 
 
market 
market risk represents the risk of losses due to changes 
in the market value of the group's assets, liabilities and 
off-balance items as a result of changes in market 
conditions. market risk includes interest rate, equity, 
property, currency, inflation and liquidity risk.  
 
the limits for these financial risks are set by 
topdanmark's board of directors. in practice, 
topdanmark kapitalforvaltning (asset management) 
handles the investment, finance and risk alignment 
processes. compliance with the limits set by the board of 
directors is regularly controlled. the result of this is 
reported to the board of directors.

market risks 
risk reducing activities 
interest rate risk 
topdanmark is exposed to an interest rate risk due to 
provisions for outstanding claims in non-life insurance 
and guaranteed benefits in life insurance. 
 
generally, the interest rate risk is limited and controlled 
by investing in interest-bearing assets in order to 
reduce the overall interest rate exposure of the assets 
and liabilities to the desired level. 
 
with regard to cover of interest-bearing assets, 
supplementary hedging by interest rate swaps will be 
bought as required. 
equity risk 
topdanmark is exposed to an equity risk from direct 
investments as well as investments made via 
derivatives. 
 
the equity risk is alleviated by trades in the market and 
by derivatives. 
 
property risk 
topdanmark is exposed to a property risk from 
investments in properties rented out for business or 
private residence. 
 
the risk on the property portfolio is limited by a strategy 
focusing on copenhagen and aarhus. topdanmark 
invests preferably in well-situated properties within the 
segments of housing and flexible office properties. 
credit spread risk 
topdanmark is exposed to a credit spread risk from 
bonds and other investments where prices are 
dependent on counterparty creditworthiness. 
 
the credit spread risk is alleviated by focusing predo- 
minantly on bonds etc. with very high creditworthiness 
and by a spread on counterparties. 
concentration risk 
concentration risk is a risk that increases when 
investments are consolidated with individual issuers, 
whereby dependence on these issuers’ solvency 
grows. 
 
the concentration risk is limited by ensuring that 
investment size reconciles with counterparty 
creditworthiness. 
currency risk 
topdanmark's currency risk relates in practice only to 
investments. 
 
the currency risk is alleviated by derivatives. 
inflation risk 
future inflation is implicitly included in a number of the 
models topdanmark uses to calculate its provisions. 
 
workers' compensation and illness/accident insurance 
differ from the general principles regarding the 
inclusion of an allowance for inflation. the provisions in 
workers' compensation insurance are calculated on the 
basis of the expected future indexation of wages and 
salaries, and those in illness and accident insurance on 
the basis of the expected net price index. 
 
an expected higher future inflation rate would generally 
be included in the provisions with a certain time delay, 
while at the same time the result would be impacted by 
higher future indexation of premiums. 
 
in order to reduce the risk of inflation within workers' 
compensation and illness and accident insurance, 
topdanmark uses index-linked bonds and derivatives 
hedging a significant proportion of the expected cash 
flows.  
liquidity risk 
in insurance companies the liquidity risk is very limited 
as premiums are paid prior to the beginning of the risk 
period. topdanmark’s liquidity risk is therefore primarily 
related to the parent company. 
 
 
 
topdanmark performs an ongoing monitoring of the 
liquidity risk based on scenario-based stress reporting. 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 69 of 94 
the liabilities of the group's insurance companies are 
primarily technical provisions on which the payment
obligation is met by means of the cash flow from 
operations. 
 
 
 
the group uses derivatives to hedge investment risks. 
the hedging of currency risk in particular often results in 
significant positive or negative balance values. 
 
topdanmark pays or receives cash security for any 
changes in value. the extent of these daily changes is 
limited so that there is no challenge to liquidity. 
 
generally, there are no maturity concentrations on 
derivative contracts. 
 
the group's insurance companies may raise money 
market loans as part of the day-to-day liquidity 
management. typically, the maturity of such loans is less 
than a month. both the subordinated loans raised by 
topdanmark forsikring and any outstanding money 
market loans will be repaid from the cash generated from 
operations. 
 
furthermore, the group has a significant liquidity base of 
high-quality liquid bonds. 
 
 
counterparty risk 
counterparty risk, also known as credit risk, is the risk of 
losses caused by one or more counterparties' full or 
partial breach of their payment obligations. topdanmark 
is exposed to credit risks in both its insurance and 
investment business. 
 
reinsurance 
within insurance the reinsurance companies' ability to 
pay is the most important risk factor. topdanmark 
minimises this risk by spreading and primarily buying 
reinsurance cover from reinsurance companies with a 
minimum rating of a-. accordingly, almost 100% of its 
storm cover has been placed with such reinsurance 
companies. 
 
investment 
topdanmark may suffer losses due to its counterparties’ 
inability to meet their obligations on bonds, loans and 
other contracts including derivatives. the majority of 
topdanmark’s interest bearing assets comprise of danish 
mortgage bonds. in order to minimise the risk to a single 
debtor, topdanmark strives to always have a well-
diversified portfolio of bonds not only in regard to a debtor 
but also geographically. 
 
 
 
to limit the counterparty risk of financial contracts, 
including derivative contracts, the choice of 
counterparties is restrictive, and security is required when 
the value of the financial contracts exceeds the 
predetermined limits. the size of the limits depends on 
the counterparty's credit rating and the term of the 
contract.

life insurance provisions for unit-linked products are covered by investments. the provisions and related bonds are therefore not
included.
the expected cash flow s of the bond portfolio are calculated based on option adjusted durations that are used to measure the
duration of the bond portfolio. the option adjustment relates primarily to danish mortgage bonds and reflects the expected duration
capturing the shortening effect of the borrow er´s option to cause the bond to be redeemed through the mortgage institution af any
point in time.

operational risk 
operational risk includes the risk of losses incurred due to 
errors and deficiencies in internal processes, human 
errors, fraud, system errors, breakdowns of it systems 
and the risk of losses incurred due to external events. 
 
topdanmark regularly develops and improves it 
systems, routines, and procedures. the responsible 
business units are also responsible for the risk 
management of this development. 
 
projects are to carry out a risk assessment with a 
description of the risks, possible consequences and 
measures to limit these risks. 
 
new it systems will not be put into production until 
completion of an extensive test procedure. 
 
it 
the department group information security is 
responsible for topdanmark’s general information 
security. 
 
risk assessment 
risk assessments of each operational it risk are made 
regularly. group information security reports on risks and 
events to the management on a quarterly basis. 
 
topdanmark's it risk assessment, information security 
policy, prioritisation of risks and it emergency strategy, 
are based on is027001, revised each year and approved 
by the board of directors. 
 
cybercrime risk 
the general threat from cybercrime is increasing. in 
general, topdanmark handles the risk via an it security 
committee/cyber-security board that regularly assesses 
the threat and the preventive actions necessary to secure 
the required security level.  
 
two external firms possessing special expertise within 
cyber-crime are members of topdanmark’s it security 
committee/cyber-security board and thus act as 
advisers to topdanmark’s chief information security 
officer. one of the firms provides consultancy on security 
solutions to maintain an effective defense against 
cybercrime while the other firm conducts regular tests to 
verify topdanmark’s resilience against critical attacks 
from outside. the firm also gives advice about 
vulnerabilities which must be fixed. topdanmark’s it 
security committee reviews and prioritises the results 
from these tests. 
 
new employees are informed about information security 
and all employees and consultants in topdanmark must 
undergo an e-learning course annually on information 
security.  
 
outsourcing is increasingly used in topdanmark. 
consequently, topdanmark investigates and evaluates 
the information security with new cooperation and service 
partners. topdanmark also monitors the information 
security with existing partners to prevent cybercrime. 
 
topdanmark’s technical it security is based on several 
layers of protection (defense in depth) and technology & 
solutions also tests infrastructure and new applications, 
among others. relevant employees have been trained to 
use the tools to conduct such tests. 
 
it emergency plan 
the it emergency plan includes plans for re-establishing 
the it environment if the systems suffer breakdowns. the 
it emergency plan is tested regularly. topdanmark's 
business critical systems can be inaccessible for 24 hours 
without causing larger business consequences. in order 
to reduce the probability of breakdowns of the it systems 
and limit their duration, topdanmark has invested in, for 
example, emergency power plants with a diesel 
generator, disk mirroring, alarms and automatic 
firefighting equipment. critical it equipment is in duplicate 
and placed in two physically discrete machine rooms. 
back-up of systems and data is made and a duplicate of 
the back-up is kept with an outsourcing partner. 
 
accessibility 
topdanmark's goal is for the accessibility of its main 
systems to be no less than 99.5%.  
 
the mainframe platform has a higher average 
accessibility level than the decentralised systems, 
because these often depend on the mainframe platform. 
 
digitisation/automation 
topdanmark is working continuously on digitisation and 
automation to ensure efficient business and a good 
customer experience. focus is on automation of a 
number of processes, which will help to reduce the risk of 
human errors. digitisation is not only robots of which 
topdanmark has introduced some so far. topdanmark 
also needs to focus on the future and what it requires to 
navigate in an increasingly and rapidly changing 
technological development going forward. 
 
in order to control the operational risk connected to 
processes based on algorithms, machine learning and 
artificial intelligence, robots are tested regularly in order to 
prevent and eliminate possible programming and system 
errors. tests are always carried through prior to new 
releases and in case of breakdowns of operation. 
 
the robot handling bad weather damage is tested 
regularly to ensure that it works properly in case of major 
events. 
 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 71 of 94 
the robots are working according to the specified rules. 
in case that the correct parameters have not been 
implemented in the robot enabling it to find and register 
the required information, the task is channeled to the 
relevant employee. subsequently, the employee will 
ensure that the parameters are updated. 
 
the algorithms saved in the robots’ software are based 
on the experience of expert employees within the subject 
area. for example, the software calculating prices is 
adjusted as actuarial adjustments of the tariff in question 
are made.  
 
thus, topdanmark has been assessed to have the 
proper rules of procedure and competencies to detect 
and handle technology related risks.  
 
errors in internal processes, human errors, 
insurance fraud and deceit 
topdanmark's well-documented routines, procedures and 
efficient control environment minimise these risks. it has 
made emergency plans for the most significant areas. 
 
internal audit 
the routines and procedures in all critical areas are 
regularly checked by the auditors in order to assess the 
risks and recommend measures to limit each individual 
risk. 
 
central claims 
central claims is a minor department solely dealing with 
cases where fraud is suspected. topdanmark believes 
that honest customers should not have to pay for the 
dishonest customers. therefore, we owe it to our 
customers to examine any suspicion of insurance fraud. 
 
incident register 
topdanmark monitors and reports on operational risks in 
order that the organisation will learn from its mistakes. 
consequently, a process has been established including 
a tool to register incidents, which are then collected 
centrally in an incident log and communicated onwards in 
the management system.  
 
pandemic risk 
topdanmark has a robust business model with a high 
degree of diversification between the business activities, 
a very low liquidity risk and a solid capital base. in case of 
a pandemic like the covid-19 escalating, topdanmark will 
operate with an effective contingency plan. the 
contingency plan concerns both topdanmark internally 
and in relation to changed risk factors for non-life, life- 
and market risks.  
compliance risk 
at topdanmark, compliance comprises compliance with 
all statutory and managerial requirements for 
topdanmark's corporate governance. 
 
compliance risk is the risk that topdanmark does not 
have sufficient knowledge of current or future rules. 
additionally, compliance risk is the risk of contravention of 
rules and the losses this might cause topdanmark and 
topdanmark's customers. such losses can be direct 
financial losses or indirect losses in the form of sanctions 
or bad publicity as a consequence of not acting in 
accordance with the rules. 
 
rules comprise all rules, internal rules of topdanmark's 
policies and the relevant guidelines as well as all relevant 
legislation and its sub-rules. furthermore, rules comprise 
fixed business practices for the performance of activity in 
topdanmark.  
 
accordingly, compliance comprises compliance with the 
rules which are necessary and required to ensure that 
topdanmark's business is conducted in an appropriate 
and, in terms of business, proper way. documentation of 
compliance for topdanmark's stakeholders is part of 
compliance. 
 
compliance function's work 
the compliance function is intended to: 
• 
issue rules for identification, management and control 
of compliance risks 
• 
exercise control and advise the group on compliance 
with legislation and internal rules. 
 
topdanmark's compliance function exercises control 
and provides advice to ensure that the group's divisions 
and service departments comply with relevant legislation 
and internal rules. the compliance function's work is 
part of topdanmark's overall control environment, which 
covers the procedures, control and organisation ensuring 
observance of rules.  
 
the compliance function's work comprises the following 
principal tasks: 
• 
control of compliance 
• 
annual status with all of the group's divisions and 
service departments 
• 
reporting on compliance risks to the executive board 
and the board of directors 
• 
administration and updating of the compliance 
function's routines and tools. 
 
incident register 
the compliance function administers topdanmark's 
incident register.

climate risk 
risks due to climate change include both insurance and 
investment risks. insurance risks in topdanmark non-life 
related to climate are especially storm and cloudburst. 
the company includes these risks in underwriting and 
hedges the assumed risk in the reinsurance programme. 
stress tests show that a storm event on the company's 
current insurance portfolio will only, in one out of 900 
years, exceed the reinsurance coverage of dkk 5.1 
billion. 
 
stress tests regarding cloudburst events cause 
significantly less damage, e.g. as a result of the 
municipalities' efforts against floods. overall, the 
company has hedged the climate risks of non-life 
insurance satisfactorily.  
 
topdanmark livsforsikring does not have significant 
climate-related insurance risks. investment risks for the 
companies related to climate mainly comprise the 
property portfolios and are hedged through investments in 
new / newer properties as well as maintenance of existing 
properties. in addition, the investment policies include an 
exclusion list which i.a. includes companies with activities 
within tar sands and thermal coal. in topdanmark’s active 
investment management, there is a focus on acquiring 
attractive investment opportunities in “green companies” 
and divestments of holdings which in the long run are 
considered to be unattractive as a result of their climate 
footprint, etc. overall, topdanmark has the necessary 
focus on climate conditions in relation to the investment 
company.

notes to the financial statements • group  
 
topdanmark group's 2020 annual report has been 
prepared in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and 
the additional danish disclosure requirements of the 
danish financial business act on annual reports 
prepared by listed financial services companies. 
 
topdanmark group has implemented the ifrs standards 
and interpretations that take effect from 2020. none of 
these has affected recognition or measurement in 2020. 
 
apart from this, the accounting policies remain 
unchanged compared with 2019. 
 
 
future accounting standards 
ifrs 
the iasb has issued a number of new and revised 
standards and interpretations, which have not yet taken 
effect and/or been approved by the eu of which the most 
significant are: 
 
ifrs 9 “financial instruments” came into force on 1 
january 2018. however, under certain circumstances, 
insurance groups may postpone ifrs 9 to 2023 at the 
time where ifrs 17 “insurance contracts” is expected to 
come into force. however, ifrs 17 has not yet been 
adopted by the eu. 
 
topdanmark group meets the conditions for 
postponement given that the group has not previously 
implemented ifrs 9-standards and since provisions for 
insurance and investment contracts represent more than 
90% of the total liabilities. 
 
as a consequence, the topdanmark group has chosen to 
postpone the implementation of ifrs 9 to the 
implementation of ifrs 17, which is expected to take 
effect on 1 january 2023. 
 
the standard classifies the financial assets based on the 
company's business model for holding of assets and the 
cash flow generated by the asset. the standard is not 
expected to substantially affect the presentation of 
accounts for the group.  
 
ifrs 17 “insurance contracts”  
this standard defines the principles for recognition and 
measurement of insurance contracts. ifrs 17 is 
expected to come into force on 1 january 2023. however, 
the standard has not yet been adopted by the eu. 
topdanmark has initiated an analysis of the standard. 
the financial effect has not yet been clarified. 
 
from 2021, expenses for loss preventing activities will be 
reclassified from administrative expenses to claims 
incurred due to a change in the danish fsa's executive 
order on financial reports for insurance companies. 
the effect is expected to be insignificant. 
 
 
accounting estimates and judgements  
in the preparation of topdanmark's financial statements, 
estimates and judgements have been made which affect 
the size of assets and liabilities and consequently the 
results and shareholders’ equity in this and subsequent 
financial years. 
 
the most significant estimates and judgements are made 
in the calculation of insurance provisions, as well as 
measurement of the fair value of collateralised loan 
obligations (clo´s) and investment properties. 
 
provisions for claims  
provisions for claims incurred, but not yet paid, have 
been calculated as the best estimate at the end of any 
given year. as all necessary information is not available, 
there will be deviations between the actual claims paid 
and the provisions made in the form of either run-off 
losses (provisions too low) or run-off profits (provisions 
too high).  
 
the provisioning risk is significant, particularly in lines 
with a long period of claims settlement such as workers' 
compensation, accident, commercial and motor liability. 
the levels of compensation could be significantly affected 
by any changes in legislation, case -law or the practice in 
the award of damages adopted by, for example, the 
danish labour market insurance. 
 
the five-year summary discloses the most recent 
financial years' run-off results. the movement in the 
provisions for outstanding claims and run-off analysed by 
claims year is shown in the note on provisions for 
outstanding claims. the note on “technical result − non-
life” specifies run-off for the year analysed by line of 
business. for further details, see management's review. 
 
provisions for unearned premiums 
premium provisions are measured based on an estimate 
of future payments for incidents in the remaining period of 
cover. a significant uncertain and estimated assessment 
is involved in the determination thereof. premium 
provisions must be seen in connection with the profit 
margin as an increase in the estimated cashflow will be 
absorbed by the profit margin up to a combined ratio of 
100. financial estimates and assessments with effect on 
the result of the year and shareholders’ equity are 
therefore primarily relevant within business lines with 
note 47. accounting policies
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 74 of 94 
combined ratio of 100 or more,  where premiums are 
insufficient for covering expected payments and a risk 
margin, and consequently provisions to cover losses must 
be made. 
 
life insurance provisions 
the uncertainty related to the value of the life insurance 
provisions is based on a number of actuarial estimates of 
disability, lifetime etc., and the frequency concerning 
surrenders and termination of premiums which may have 
a significant effect on the size of the life insurance 
provisions. 
 
clo’s 
the transfer of clo´s in march 2020 from valuation 
according to indicative prices (level 2) to valuation models 
based on unobservable input (level 3), implies inputs, 
such as probability of default, recovery etc., based on 
best estimates. towards the end of 2020 market liquidity 
is starting to improve, and if continued a transfer to level 2 
is anticipated during 2021. 
 
investment properties 
a return model based on market-determined net earnings 
and rates of return with various parameters such as 
location, idleness, quality of tenants etc. is used for 
determining the fair value of investment properties. 
 
 
general 
consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the parent 
company topdanmark a/s and all of the companies that 
are controlled by the parent company. the parent 
company is deemed to control the companies through 
direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the 
voting rights, or when it otherwise can have or has a 
controlling influence. 
 
the income statement and balance sheet are presented 
in accordance with the danish fsa's ifrs-compatible 
executive order on financial reports for insurance 
companies and multi-employer occupational pension 
funds. 
 
consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared by aggregating items within the financial 
statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries 
on a line-by-line basis. the same accounting policies are 
applied by the subsidiaries as by the parent company. 
 
properties owned by the subsidiaries and used by the 
group have been re-classified from investment properties 
to owner-occupied properties. 
 
intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, 
balances and dividends as well as gains and losses on 
intra-group transactions have all been eliminated. 
 
companies acquired during the year have been included 
in the consolidation from the date of assumption of control 
and those companies sold during the year, until the date 
of relinquishment of control. 
 
recognition and measurement 
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the 
group, and where the asset has a value that can be 
measured reliably. liabilities are recognised in the 
balance sheet, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow from the group, and where the value of 
the liability can be measured reliably. the recognition and 
measurement take into consideration predictable losses 
and risks, which have occurred prior to the presentation 
of the annual report, and which provide evidence of 
conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. 
 
income is recognised in the income statement when 
earned. similarly, all expenses are recognised which 
relate to the financial year, including amortisation and 
impairment. 
 
the initial recognition of financial instruments is made at 
fair value on the date of settlement. any changes in the 
value between the trade and settlement dates are 
included in the balance sheet under the heading 
derivatives. direct expenses on the acquisition or issue of 
financial instruments which are measured at fair value 
with any revaluation of the fair value taken to the income 
statement are included in expenses on investment 
activities, when incurred. however, financial instruments 
which, subsequent to the initial recognition, have been 
measured at amortised cost are recognised at fair value 
adjusted for direct expenses on the acquisition or issue of 
the financial instrument. 
 
true sale and repurchase transactions and true purchase 
and resale transactions (repo/reverse transactions) are 
recognised and measured as secured loans. 
 
measurement of fair value 
fair value is the price which would be achieved on the 
sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in a 
normal transaction between the market players at the 
time of measurement. 
 
the ifrs defines a hierarchy of three levels for 
measurement of fair value: 
 
level 1 
the calculation of fair value should always be based on 
the listed prices of transactions in active markets 
whenever possible. if there is no listed price, another 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 75 of 94 
public price is used, which is believed to be the most 
appropriate. if the transaction on the open market is 
limited or if there is no closing price, prices from 
banks/brokers can be used if these are calculated based 
on fully updated market data and are deemed to be in 
accordance with the closing price.  
 
level 2 
if the transaction on the open market is limited or if listed 
prices are not set on the market, indicative prices from 
banks/brokers specifying the non-forced sale value can 
be used. if this is not possible, valuation methods in 
which input is based on publicly available information are 
used. 
 
level 3 
if the valuation of the investment asset cannot be based 
on publicly available market information alone, valuation 
models that could imply the use of estimates of both the 
future and the nature of the current market situation are 
used. 
 
the accounting policies for measurement of properties 
are described below under “owner-occupied properties” 
and “investment properties” respectively. 
 
insurance and investment contracts – 
classification 
the topdanmark group writes contracts which transfer 
insurance risk, investment risk or both. 
 
an insurance contract is a contract under which the 
insurer accepts significant insurance risk from the 
policyholder by agreeing to compensate if a specified 
uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. 
insurance risk is always considered to be significant in 
non-life insurance. in life insurance, it is considered to be 
significant when it covers disability including premium 
waiver or when the contract is with profit. 
 
the classification is carried out on contract level. 
contracts with related joint and several premium waiver 
or group products are considered insurance contracts in 
full. 
 
an investment contract is one in which the insurance risk 
is not sufficient for it to be classified as an insurance 
contract. payments received and made on investment 
contracts have been recognised directly in the life 
insurance provisions for investment contracts. 
 
currency 
as the predominant rule, dkk is the group companies' 
functional currency and the presentation currency of the 
annual report. 
 
the initial recognition of transactions in currencies other 
than dkk is made at the exchange rates prevailing at the 
date of the transactions. debts and receivables, and other 
monetary items which have not been settled on the 
financial position date, are translated at the closing 
exchange rates. translation differences are recognised in 
revaluations in the income statement.  
 
expenses 
expenses are recognised in the group’s income 
statement classified by function. the allocation of 
expenses, which do not directly relate to a function, is 
based on an assessment. 
 
share options 
the executive board and senior executives participate in 
a share option scheme. 
 
the fair value, on the date the option is granted, is 
included as staff costs in the income statement, with a  
set-off in shareholders’ equity. the fair value is calculated 
using the black & scholes model. 
 
the options are primarily settled with own shares. any 
strike amount received on the exercise of the options is 
taken to shareholders’ equity. 
 
employee shares 
topdanmark has established an employee share scheme 
implying a pay cut. the value of the shares is included as 
staff costs in the income statement with a set-off on 
shareholders’ equity. 
 
calculation of profit in life insurance 
the calculation of profit in life insurance is regulated by 
the danish financial business act. topdanmark's policy 
on the calculation of the profit for the year has been 
reported to the danish fsa. 
 
the result of life insurance comprises unconditional and 
conditional profit elements. 
 
the unconditional profit elements comprise the return on 
assets allocated to shareholders' equity, acquisition cost 
result and the profit on contracts outside of contribution. 
 
the conditional profit elements comprise the risk return 
which is calculated for each contribution group. the risk 
return for each contribution group (cost, risk and interest 
rate groups) has been based on their estimated risk on 
shareholders' equity and on the profit margin determined 
by the company for the year. 
 
the risk return is transferred to shareholders' equity if it 
can be covered by individual and collective bonus 
potentials. 
 
shareholders’ equity must contribute to the financing of a 
potential negative result for each contribution group if it 
cannot be covered by collective bonus potential and 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 76 of 94 
individual bonus potential. a deficit which is not covered 
by the bonus potentials is assigned to a shadow account 
for the group which can be restored at a later time when 
bonus potential is sufficient. 
 
segment information 
the topdanmark group´s insurance business is divided 
into three business segments: 
 
private offers non-life insurance policies to individual 
households in denmark. in this segment is also included 
illness and accident insurance offered through the life 
company.  
 
sme offers non-life insurance policies to danish-based 
agricultural and sme businesses. 
 
life offers products within life insurance and pension 
funds to both private and sme customers in denmark.  
 
recognition and measurement in the segments follow the 
same accounting policies as those applied by the group. 
 
management reporting for non-life segments comprises 
reporting on technical results. 
 
topdanmark conducts insurance business only in 
denmark and, therefore, no specific geographical 
segmental information is provided. 
 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement of the group has been prepared 
in accordance with the direct method disclosing cash flow 
from operations, investments and financing as well as the 
changes in the group’s liquid funds between the 
beginning and the end of the financial year. investment 
activities also include amounts received and paid on the 
purchase and sale of investment, intangible and tangible 
assets. cash flows from financing comprise changes in 
capital, including the purchase and sale of own shares. 
furthermore, it includes the raising of loans and 
repayments on interest-bearing debt. cash and cash 
equivalents comprise liquid funds as well as deposits with 
credit institutions. 
 
 
income statement 
premiums earned 
gross premiums in non-life insurance comprise those 
premiums which are due within the financial year.  
premiums earned net of reinsurance are recognised in 
line with the distribution of risk over the period of cover. 
for onerous insurance contracts, the expected loss is 
included when the contracts are underwritten or when the 
contracts become onerous. 
 
as premium provisions and profit margin are calculated at 
a discounted basis, an element of interest is included in 
premiums earned. in life insurance, gross premiums 
comprise those premiums for insurance contracts, which 
are due within the year. 
 
allocated investment return net of reinsurance 
in life insurance 
allocated investment return is calculated as the overall 
investment return in life insurance net of return relating to 
illness and accident insurance and shareholders' equity in 
accordance with the definition of profit reported to the 
danish fsa. 
 
pension return tax 
pension return tax comprise individual tax on pension 
returns, calculated on the interest accrued on 
policyholders´ savings, and tax on return allocated to 
collective bonus potential and accumulated revaluations 
etc.  
 
the tax rate is 15.3%. 
 
claims incurred and benefits paid 
claims incurred in non-life insurance comprise claims 
relating to the year as well as any adjustments to the 
claims provided for the year before. furthermore, claims 
incurred comprise direct and indirect expenses on claims 
handling. the effect on change in provisions for 
outstanding claims due to amortisation and revaluation is 
transferred to return and revaluations non-life insurance 
provisions. revaluation of derivatives partially hedging 
the provisions for workers’ compensation and annuities in 
illness and accident insurance against changes in future 
wage and price indexation is included in claims incurred. 
 
in life insurance, claims and benefits paid comprise 
payments relating to claims, pensions and annuities, 
surrenders and cash bonuses. 
 
bonuses and rebates 
bonuses and rebates include those premiums that have 
been or will be paid back to policyholders where the 
amount is calculated based on the claims trend using 
criteria determined prior to the beginning of the financial 
year, or when the insurance contracts were written. 
 
operating expenses 
technical operating expenses which relate, either directly 
or indirectly, to the acquisition and renewal of the 
portfolios are included in acquisition costs. sales 
commission is generally recognised in the income 
statement on the date the insurance contract takes effect. 
administrative expenses comprise other costs incurred in 
the administration of the portfolios which relate to the 
financial year, and which have been accounted for on 
accruals basis. commission received from reinsurers has 
been accounted for on accruals basis over the 
reinsurance contracts’ period of cover.

income from associates comprises a share of the post-tax 
results of the associates calculated in accordance with 
the group's accounting policies. income from investment 
properties comprises the operating results excluding 
interest charges and revaluations. interest income and 
dividends etc. comprise all earned interest income and 
dividends received in the year. realised and unrealised 
gains and losses on investment assets, exchange rate 
adjustments, and realised gains and losses on owner-
occupied properties are included in revaluations. 
administrative expenses on investment activities 
comprise the cost of asset management including 
transaction costs. 
 
return and revaluation of non-life insurance 
provisions

include amortisation and revaluation of premium 
provisions, claims provisions, profit margin and risk 
margin, net of reinsurance. 
 
other income and expenses 
income and expenses that do not relate to the 
administration of insurance portfolios or investment 
assets are included in other income and expenses. 
 
taxation  
the tax charge for the year comprises the current 
corporation tax for the year and any changes in deferred 
tax. the tax charge related to profit for the year is 
included in the income statement, and the share related 
to other comprehensive income and shareholders' equity 
are taken to other comprehensive income and 
shareholders' equity respectively. the current tax for the 
year is calculated using the tax rates and rules applicable 
on the financial position date. 
 
topdanmark a/s is jointly taxed with all the danish 
companies of the topdanmark group and all danish 
companies and affiliates in the sampo group. as the 
management company of the joint taxation, topdanmark 
a/s settles all corporation tax payments with the tax 
authorities. 
 
the joint tax contributions are distributed to the jointly 
taxed companies on a proportionate basis relative to their 
taxable income. furthermore, those companies with tax 
losses receive joint tax contributions from those 
companies which have been able to use this loss to 
reduce their own taxable income. 
 
 
assets 
intangible assets 
goodwill relates to the acquisition of companies prior to 
2004 and is recognised at the carrying amount on the 
date of transition to ifrs. goodwill is not amortised but 
subjected to an impairment test at the end of the financial 
year and written down to a lower recoverable amount. 
 
acquired software licences are measured at cost and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful life of a maximum of three years. development 
projects which are clearly defined and definable are 
measured at costs incurred and depreciated over the 
expected useful life of a maximum of 10 years. 
impairment is assessed end of year, and the carrying 
amount is written down to a lower recoverable amount. 
 
development projects under construction are subjected to 
an impairment test end of year. the carrying amount is 
written down to a lower recoverable amount. 
 
tangible assets 
operating equipment 
operating equipment is measured at cost less 
depreciation on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful life with respect of the residual value, which is 
annually revalued. impairment is assessed end of year, 
and the carrying amount is written down to a lower 
recoverable amount. 
 
it equipment, other equipment and cars as well as 
improvements of rental properties are depreciated over 
their expected useful life of up to five years. solar cell 
plants are depreciated over their expected useful life of 
25 years. 
 
owner-occupied properties 
owner-occupied properties are those properties used for 
the group's own operations. the properties are measured 
at a revalued amount being the fair value on the date of 
revaluation. the buildings are depreciated on a straight-
line basis, given an expected life of 50 years and an 
annually re-assessed residual value. land is not 
depreciated. the fair value of the revaluation of owner-
occupied properties is assessed on the same basis as 
investment properties. any revaluation surplus is included 
in other comprehensive income unless the revaluation is 
a reversal of a previous impairment. impairments are 
included in the income statement unless the impairment 
is a reversal of previous revaluation included in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
investment properties 
the initial recognition of investment properties is made at 
cost, which comprises the purchase price of the 
properties plus any directly related initial expenditure. 
 
in accordance with the guidelines of the danish fsa, the 
subsequent measurement of the investment properties is 
made at fair value representing the estimated amount at 
which the property could be sold within a reasonable time 
frame to an independent buyer. the fair value is 
calculated, using the return model, as the calculated 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 78 of 94 
capital value of the expected cash flow from each 
property. 
 
the expected cash flow is based on the assumed net 
earnings for the next year adjusted to reflect normal 
earnings, including the current market rent. adjustments 
are made for factors which are not reflected in normal 
earnings, for example, major renovation works, expected 
idleness etc. 
 
the calculation of the capital value uses a rate of return 
which is set for each property on the basis of the current 
market conditions on the balance sheet date for the type 
of property concerned, the location of the properties, the 
quality of the tenants etc. with the effect that the rate of 
return is estimated to reflect the market’s current rates of 
return for corresponding properties. 
 
market trends and the rates of return of the market are 
regularly analysed. each property is assessed annually 
by the group's own valuers.  
 
the calculated fair values are regularly tested to other 
valuation models and by use of external valuers. 
 
the revaluation for the financial year of the fair value of 
the properties is recognised in the income statement. 
 
associates 
associates are companies which are not subsidiaries, 
and over which the group has substantial influence 
through a significant shareholding and representation on 
the board of the company. 
 
equity investments in associates are measured according 
to the equity method, in accordance with the group's 
accounting policies with paid goodwill added. 
 
the equity investments held are regularly tested for 
impairment and written down to a lower recoverable 
amount. 
 
financial assets 
financial assets are classified at the time of their initial 
recognition as:  
• financial assets measured at fair value with any value 
adjustment through profit and loss or,  
• loans and receivables measured at amortised cost. 
 
financial assets at fair value with any value adjustment 
through profit and loss are financial assets which are 
either included in a trading portfolio, are derivatives or at 
their first recognition are designated in this classification, 
because the assets are managed and measured on a fair 
value basis, or because this eliminates or significantly 
reduces accounting inconsistency. 
 
all financial assets included in "other financial 
investments assets" and "investment assets related to 
unit-linked products" are measured at fair value with any 
value adjustment through profit and loss. 
 
receivables at amortised cost 
on initial recognition receivables are measured at fair 
value, and subsequently at amortised cost. the 
receivables are regularly assessed for impairment and 
written down to a lower recoverable amount. such 
impairments are generally made collectively on the basis 
of a due date analysis. when an individual receivable is 
considered irrevocable, the impaired amount is 
transferred from the account for collective allowances. 
 
reinsurers' share of provisions 
reinsurers' share of the provisions for unearned 
premiums represents the proportion of reinsurance 
premiums paid, net of commission received, which based 
on the spread of risk during the period of cover, relate to 
the period after the end of the financial year. 
 
reinsurers' share of the provisions for claims represents 
the amounts expected to be received from reinsurance 
companies according to the reinsurance contracts 
concluded. expected future payments are discounted 
using an interest rate structure. the reinsurers' share is 
regularly assessed for impairment and written down to a 
lower recoverable amount. 
 
 
shareholders' equity 
revaluation reserves 
gains on the revaluation of owner-occupied properties 
are transferred to the revaluation reserves net of 
corporation tax. the reserve will be dissolved if the 
revaluation is reversed or the property is sold. 
 
security fund reserves 
the security funds are special funds under shareholders' 
equity. prior to 1989, they were transferred to 
shareholders' equity for capital adequacy and were tax-
deductible. 
 
the security funds can only be used for strengthening the 
technical provisions or otherwise for the benefit of 
policyholders and only if permitted by the danish fsa. 
 
other reserves 
other reserves comprise a reserve at net asset value 
relating to non-life insurance. 
 
proposed dividend 
dividend forms part of shareholders´ equity until the 
adoption at the annual general meeting. from the time of 
adoption, the dividend is recognised as a liability.

page 79 of 94 
liabilities 
other subordinated loan capital 
the initial recognition of other subordinated loan capital is 
made at fair value less transaction costs and, 
subsequently, measured at amortised cost. any 
difference between the proceeds (less transaction costs) 
and the nominal value is recognised in the income 
statement over the loan period based on an effective 
interest rate. 
 
provisions for insurance and investment 
contracts 
provisions for unearned premiums 
premium provisions are calculated as the best estimate of 
expected payments for future insurance events covered 
by insurance contracts concluded.  
 
premiums for insurance contracts concluded comprise 
due and undue premiums for insurance contracts for 
which the group is committed on the reporting day.  
 
topdanmark’s insurance contracts are mostly written for 
a 1-year period, and the provisions are calculated based 
on the prognosis for combined ratio for the next 12 
months. the prognosis is based on analyses of the trend 
in premiums, claims and expenses and for change of 
ownership also statistical analyses of trend in claims 
notification in relation to the time when the insurance 
contracts were written. 
 
expected payments are calculated at present value 
discounted by the volatility adjusted interest rate curve. 
 
best estimate of undue premiums for insurance contracts 
concluded is deducted, considering expected customer 
defection. 
 
changes in provisions due to a change in the interest rate 
curve used and amortisation are transferred to “return 
and revaluation of non-life insurance provisions”. 
 
profit margin on non-life insurance contracts 
profit margin is the expected profit during the remaining 
part of the period of cover for insurance contracts 
concluded. 
 
profit margin is calculated as the difference between 
expected premiums for future periods of cover for 
insurance policies concluded and present value of the 
expected payments included in premium provisions. 
 
changes in the value due to changes in the interest rate 
curve used and amortisation are transferred to “return 
and revaluation non-life insurance provisions”. 
 
the share of the risk margin related to settlement of 
premium provisions is deducted from the profit margin. 
 
profit margin for a portfolio of insurance contracts with 
similar risks cannot be lower than zero. 
 
life insurance provisions 
life insurance provisions for with-profit products are 
measured at fair value. accordingly, the liabilities are 
calculated based on market value independent of the 
original technical base. the fair value of the life insurance 
provisions is based on the realistically expected future 
premiums to be received, benefit payments to be made 
and administrative expenses incurred on the contracts 
written. 
 
the future payments to be received and made have been 
based on the assumed incidents of death, disability, 
resumption of work, renewal and premium expiry. the 
mortality rate is calculated by considering the danish 
fsa's population mortality rate and topdanmark's own 
observed mortality rate. furthermore, the danish fsa's 
assessed improvement in future life expectancy is 
applied. the other parameters stated are best estimates 
based on topdanmark’s observations. 
 
the life expectancy for a 60-year-old man and a 60-year-
old woman is as follows: 
 
 
 
the provisions include amounts to cover the expected 
expenses on the future administration of the insurance 
contracts written. these expenses have been calculated 
using annual indexation of 2%. 
 
the present value of the expected future payments has 
been calculated using an interest rate curve determined 
in solvency ll (eiopa interest rate curve). the interest 
rate curve is volatility adjusted and for contracts subject to 
pension return tax - each interest rate used is reduced by 
the tax rate of 15.3%. 
 
the provisions include a risk margin corresponding to the 
percentage which would be demanded by an independent 
purchaser of the company's portfolio of life insurance 
policies to compensate for the risk of fluctuations in the 
expected payments. the risk margin is calculated as the 
increase in guaranteed benefits stressing the biometric 
risks. 
 
life insurance provisions are calculated as the sum of a 
best estimate for guaranteed benefits, best estimate for 
unguaranteed benefits and the risk margin. 
 
best estimate for guaranteed benefits is measured as the 
present value of current, guaranteed benefits plus future 
administration expenses and deduction of present value

of agreed premiums. guaranteed benefits are calculated 
considering amendments of the insurance contracts to 
paid-up policies and surrender. 
 
best estimate for unguaranteed benefits is calculated at 
contribution group level as the group’s collective bonus 
potential adjusted for risk margin and positive values of 
the difference between, on the one hand, the 
accumulation of the insurance contracts (retrospective 
provisions) and on the other hand, best estimate of 
guaranteed benefits of these insurance contracts. 
 
collective bonus potential is used for equalisation of each 
year’s bonus allocations. thus, in years where the 
investment and insurance results are better than the 
allocated bonus, transfer to collective bonus potential will 
be made, while in years when the result is insufficient to 
finance the allocated bonus, funds will be transferred from 
the collective bonus potential. 
 
life insurance provisions for unit-linked products are 
calculated at fair value corresponding to the assets 
related to the insurance contracts less the profit margin. 
 
profit margin on life insurance and investment 
contracts 
profit margin is the expected future profit for the company 
from contracts concluded and when possible, profit 
margin for products with guarantees and profit sharing is 
financed by the individual bonus potential and secondarily 
by the collective bonus potential. the value is calculated 
as an interest margin of 0.05%. the profit margin has 
been calculated on the basis of the expected duration of 
the insurance contracts.  
 
provisions for claims 
claims provisions must cover future payments of claims 
incurred and their administration. 
 
claims provisions are assessed for each line of business, 
either on a claim-by-claim basis (individual provisions), or 
by using statistical methods (collective as well as incurred 
but not reported (ibnr) and incurred but not enough 
reported (ibner) provisions). claims exceeding a fixed 
amount, dependent on the line of business, are assessed 
individually, and provisions for smaller claims are 
assessed collectively. ibnr provisions cover expenses 
on post-notified large claims. ibner provisions cover 
extra expenses on claims already reported for which the 
individually assessed provisions are not sufficient due to, 
for example, inadequate information at the time of 
assessment. the collective provisions are calculated 
using de vylder's credibility model adjusted for each line 
of business. the ibnr and ibner provisions are 
calculated using models developed in-house. in 
agricultural and commercial lines, claims are assessed 
individually. ibnr and ibner provisions are also 
included in the total provision. in personal lines, claims 
not exceeding dkk 100,000 are assessed collectively 
while larger claims, and all claims on change of 
ownership policies are assessed individually. ibnr and 
ibner provisions are also included in the total provision. 
in motor and accident lines, total provisions comprise the 
sum of the collective and individual provisions. individual 
provisions are the result of an assessment where the 
claims handler has assessed the total claim payment to 
exceed dkk 1.5m, and the case is estimated to exceed 
the amount paid out. large claims and claims relating to 
previous years are individually assessed within personal 
liability in motor insurance.  
 
ibnr provisions for illness and accident insurance are 
calculated using models developed in-house. 
 
inflation is taken into account when calculating the value 
of the provisions as future inflation is implicitly included in 
a number of the statistical models used. therefore, an 
expected higher future inflation rate would generally be 
included in the provisions with a specific time delay. 
 
the annuity reserves for disability in illness and accident 
insurance are calculated using an inflationary structure. 
provisions for claims in workers' compensation insurance 
comprise provisions for annuities and other provisions for 
claims and benefits. the assessment of the future 
annuities is based on the annuities in force including the 
expected wage and salary indexation, and a rate of 
mortality corresponding to g82 with monthly age write-
downs on annuities based on the act on accidents and an 
adjusted g82 rate of mortality on annuities on the act on 
workers´ compensation amended to comply with 
topdanmark’s experience base within death intensity for 
annuitants. workers’ compensation claims are often paid 
as the capitalised value of an annuity. the capitalisation 
rate at the time of capitalisation is to be calculated as a 
moving average of the most recent five years’ interest 
rate on leading mortgage bonds less tax. the 
capitalisation rate is calculated as the forward swap rates 
plus 0.85% p.a. and less a deduction for tax 
corresponding to the base tax rate. 
 
the assessment of other provisions for claims relating to 
injuries, loss of provider and expenses is based on 
traditional actuarial triangulation models. due to the 
special conditions surrounding payments on disability 
claims, it is not possible to use traditional actuarial 
triangulation models for this type of provisions. 
topdanmark, therefore, uses a model developed in-
house, which, among other things, takes into account the 
stage each claim has reached. the calculation includes 
an allowance for the expected wage and salary 
indexation. 
 
provisions for claims already incurred for disability in 
illness and accident insurance are calculated using an in-
house statistical model that is based on the relationship 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 81 of 94 
between the possibility of resumption of work and the 
period passed since the occurrence of the claim. 
 
topdanmark has purchased derivatives partially hedging 
the provisions for workers’ compensation and annuities in 
illness and accident insurance against changes in future 
wage and price indexation. the revaluation of these 
derivatives is included in claims incurred. 
 
the provisions for claims and benefits include the 
amounts that are expected to be included to cover direct 
and indirect expenses on settlement of the liabilities.  
 
all provisions have been measured at present value by 
discounting the expected future payments using an 
interest rate curve determined in solvency ll (eiopa 
interest rate curve). the interest rate curve is adjusted for 
volatility. 
 
in illness and accident administered by the life insurance 
company, interest rates are reduced by the tax rate of 
15.3%. 
 
risk margin for non-life insurance contracts 
risk margin is calculated as the amount which would be 
demanded by a purchaser of the company's insurance 
portfolio for taking on the risk that actual expenses 
deviate from best estimate relating to settlement of the 
insurance provisions. 
 
topdanmark forsikring calculates risk margin by means 
the “cost of capital” model using a cost of capital rate of 
6% in addition to the risk-free interest rate. for illness and 
accident insurance administered by the life company a 
proprietary model stressing the biometric risks is used. 
 
provisions for bonuses and rebates 
provisions for bonuses and rebates are the amounts 
payable to policyholders as the result of a favourable 
claims trend. 
 
other liabilities 
provisions for pensions and similar liabilities 
provisions for anniversary bonuses and retirement 
benefits are built up on an on-going basis over the period 
of employment. the liability is calculated taking into 
account the expected level of staff reduction based on the 
company's experience. the liability is measured at 
present value by discounting the expected future 
payments using the interest rate structure. 
 
corporation tax and deferred tax 
current tax liabilities and tax receivable, including joint tax 
contributions, are included in the balance sheet as 
calculated tax on taxable income for the year adjusted for 
tax on previous years' taxable income and prepaid tax on 
account. deferred tax on temporary differences between 
the accounting, and tax value of assets and liabilities is 
charged in accordance with the balance sheet liability 
method. deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates is not included where the group controls the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and 
where it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
be reversed within the foreseeable future. the calculation 
of deferred tax is based on the planned use of each asset 
and the settlement of each liability, using the tax rates 
expected to be in force when the deferred tax is expected 
to crystallise as current tax, based on the tax rates and 
rules in force on the financial position date. 
 
deferred tax on security funds comprises deferred tax on 
untaxed amounts transferred to the security funds under 
shareholders' equity. the security funds will be taxed in 
the proportion of 10% for every 10pp decline in technical 
provisions net of reinsurance from the level at 31 
december 1994. a decline of 10% from the 1994 level is 
considered improbable as long as topdanmark 
forsikring, in which the transfers were made, continues 
its current operations. therefore, the security funds will 
only be taxed if the insurance portfolio is transferred or 
the company ceases to conduct insurance business. 
 
deposits received from reinsurers 
deposits received from reinsurers represent amounts 
deposited to cover reinsurers' liabilities to the company. 
 
debt 
amounts due to credit institutions and derivatives are 
measured at fair value. the fair value of amounts due to 
credit institutions usually corresponds to their nominal 
value. the fair value of derivatives is calculated on the 
same basis as financial assets. 
 
other loans are measured at amortised cost.

notes to the financial statements • parent company 
 
the annual financial statements of the parent company 
topdanmark a/s have been prepared in accordance with 
the danish financial business act, including the 
executive order issued by the danish fsa on financial 
reports for insurance companies and multi-employer 
occupational pension funds. 
 
the accounting policies remain unchanged from 2019. 
 
the company’s accounting policies for recognition and 
measurement are in accordance with the group’s 
accounting policies with the following amendment: 
 
equity investments in affiliates are recognised and 
measured according to the equity method. if the net asset 
value exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is 
written down to this lower amount. the share of the post-
tax results of affiliates is included in the income statement 
under income from affiliates less any write-downs. where 
investments in affiliates are revalued to net asset value, 
the net revaluation reserve is included in shareholders' 
equity. the share of the changes in other comprehensive 
income items and equity of affiliated companies is 
included directly in other comprehensive income items 
and shareholders' equity respectively. 
 
the net asset value of affiliates is calculated without 
providing for deferred tax on security funds, unless it is 
probable that a situation creating such a tax liability will 
arise within the measurable future. 
 
other 
generally, all the amounts in the report are disclosed in 
whole numbers of dkkm. the amounts have been 
rounded, and consequently the sum of the rounded 
amounts and totals may differ slightly.

to the shareholders of topdanmark a/s

the danish financial business act.  
 
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to the audit committee and the board of directors. 
 
basis for opinion  
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the "auditor's responsibilities for the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements" (hereinafter collectively referred to as  
"the financial statements") section of our report. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.  
 
independence  
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants' code of ethics for 
professional accountants (iesba code) and additional requirements applicable in denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements.  
 
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as described in article 5(1) of regulation (eu)  
no. 537/2014.  
 
appointment of auditor 
at the annual general meeting on 12 april 2018, we were elected as auditor for topdanmark a/s for the first time. we have been re-
elected annually by the annual general meeting for a total period of three years up to and including the financial year 2020. 
 
key audit matters  
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for the financial year 2020. these matters were addressed during our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in 
forming our opinion thereon. we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. for each matter below, our description of how our 
audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
 
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the "auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section, 
including in relation to the key audit matters below. our audit included the design and performance of procedures to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. the results of our audit procedures, including the 
procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

measurement of provisions for insurance and investment contracts 
at 31 december 2020, provisions for insurance and investment contracts amounted to dkk 16.5bn in respect of non-life insurance 
contracts and dkk 79.3bn in respect of life insurance contracts of these life insurance provisions for unit-linked contracts amounted to 
dkk 56.1bn. 
 
measurement of provisions for insurance and investment contracts involves management estimates and assumptions regarding future 
events which materially affect the carrying amount. consequently, we consider it a key audit matter.  
 
significant management estimates regarding non-life insurance provisions include: 
• 
determination of calculation methods and models 
• 
future inflation and wage rate development (workers’ compensation) 
• 
expected future cash flows on insurance contracts 
• 
expected future payments for claims that occurred before the balance sheet date and expected closing of claims, especially within 
workers’ compensation, accident and liability, including claims handling expenses. 
 
significant management estimates regarding life insurance provisions include:  
• 
determination of calculation methods and models 
• 
mortality, disability and reactivation rates 
• 
future inflation and wage rate development 
• 
expected future cash flows on insurance contracts. 
 
the interest rate curve applied in measuring the provisions for insurance and investment contracts is also material to the value. 
 
information on provisions for insurance and investments contracts is disclosed in notes 24 and 28 (provisions regarding non-life 
insurance contracts) and notes 25-27 (provisions regarding life insurance contracts). 
 
unit-linked contracts do not involve guaranteed returns. consequently, we do not consider the measurement of these provisions to be 
associated with significant risk of material misstatement apart from risks related to the measurement of unlisted investments. 
 
our audit of provisions for insurance and investment contracts  
based on our risk assessment, we have examined the measurement of provisions for insurance and investment contracts performed by 
management. 
 
our audit has comprised assessing the models, methods, assumptions and data applied by management in connection with the 
calculation of the provisions. 
 
the audit procedures performed in cooperation with our actuarial specialists included:  
• 
assessment and test of design, implementation and performance of key controls in the actuarial models, data collection and data 
analysis as well as processes for determination of assumptions 
• 
assessment of the methods applied using our industry knowledge and experience, focusing on changes compared to last year 
• 
assessment of any significant deviations in the assumptions in relation to statutory and reporting requirements and industry 
standards 
• 
assessment of assumptions about probability of mortality, disability, reactivation and expected loss experience compared with 
historical data and market practice 
• 
analysis of the development, especially run-off results (non-life insurance) and interest, risk and cost results (life insurance) 
• 
re-calculation of claims provisions in respect of insurance contracts in selected lines of business 
• 
test of reconciliations of provisions to insurance systems. 
 
measurement of unlisted investments  
unlisted investments include at 31 december 2020, among other things, investment properties, unlisted securities, loans, derivatives, 
and clos, with a total value corresponding to 17% of the group’s investment assets. 
 
measurement of unlisted investments involves management estimates which materially affect the carrying amount. consequently, we 
consider it to be a key audit matter. 
 
significant management estimates include: 
• 
determination of valuation methods and models 
• 
determination of yield assumptions 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 93 of 94 
• 
expectations of future cash flows 
• 
assessment of data and information obtained from external parties as well as management's determination of specific risks affect 
the fair value. 
 
information on unlisted investments is disclosed in notes 17, 34 and 47.  
 
our audit of unlisted investments  
based on our risk assessment, we have examined the measurement of unlisted investments performed by management. 
 
our audit has included assessing models, methods, assumptions and data applied by management in connection with the measurement 
of fair value of unlisted investments. 
 
the audit procedures performed in cooperation with our valuation specialists comprised: 
• 
assessment and test of models and key assumptions applied in measuring investment properties, including test of key controls, 
parameters and calculations in the valuation process 
• 
assessment and test of key controls in the valuation process for unlisted securities, loans and derivative financial instruments, 
including recording and monitoring of market information and valuation reports obtained from external parties. in addition, we have 
tested and verified the calculations of fair values to underlying documentation on a sample basis.  
 
statement on the management's review  
management is responsible for the management's review.  
 
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the management's review, and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.  
 
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management's review and, in doing so, consider 
whether the management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management's review meets the disclosure requirements of the danish 
financial business act.  
 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the management's review is in accordance with the financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial business act. we did not identify any material 
misstatement of the management's review.  
 
management's responsibilities for the financial statements  
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for listed financial 
institutions in accordance with the danish financial business act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial business act.  
 
moreover, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
 
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with  
 
auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
 
 
announcement no. 03/2020 from topdanmark a/s 
 
page 94 of 94 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements.  
 
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:  
• 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control  
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's and the parent company's 
internal control 
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management 
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor's report. however, future events or conditions may cause the group and the parent company to cease 
to continue as a going concern 
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether 
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view 
• 
obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
 
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  
 
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
based on the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine which matters were of most importance in our 
audit of the financial statements for the current period and therefore are key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor's 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
