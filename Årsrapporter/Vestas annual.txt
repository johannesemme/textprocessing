in brief
letter from the chairman & the ceo
continued leadership in a tough year
when looking back on a year just passed, it is 
usually wise to wait some time before making 
definitive statements about how that year 
will be remembered; about how its events will 
impact the years and decades ahead. some 
events feel groundbreaking as they unfold, 
but end up having only minimal long-term 
impact. other events go almost unnoticed in 
the moment but can change the way we live 
our lives in the future. however, it is already 
safe to say that 2020 was totally unprece-
dented and everything that took place during 
the year will be remembered in the context of 
the covid-19 pandemic.
for the energy industry, 2020 was without 
question the year of covid-19. the pandemic 
affected every part of the value chain and 
forced everyone to be even more resilient and 
innovative to ensure stable energy systems 
across the globe. in a year when covid-19 
dominated the agenda and challenged mobil-
ity as well as safety, the renewable energy 
industry’s ability to ensure continuity and sta-
bility was potentially game-changing. it may 
have gone a little unnoticed, but we believe 
the contribution made by renewables during 
the crisis will have huge implications for the 
future. when the stakes were highest, we 
showed resilience and proved we can serve 
as the backbone of energy systems around 
the world.
this achievement is significant because the 
climate crisis remains the biggest challenge 
the world has ever faced, and questions have 
been raised about whether renewables are 
ready to replace fossil fuels to limit co₂ emis-
sions. to this end, one positive to emerge from 
the covid-19 pandemic was the clear evi-
dence that renewables can provide the foun-
dations for more resilient societies, offering 
clean, stable, and cost-competitive energy, as 
well as sustaining and creating jobs. as a tes-
tament to this, governments across the globe, 
including in the usa, eu, china, and japan, 
developed green recovery plans or intentions 
to do so in 2021. in this respect, we believe 
the world turned a corner in 2020, paving the 
way for a more sustainable planet.
at vestas, we are proud that we continued 
to play a key role in the fight against climate 
change in 2020, and underlined our leader-
ship by achieving market-leading revenue, 
scale, technology, order intake, and profitabil-
ity. during the year, we consolidated our lead-
ership position and took strategic steps to 
expand our presence across the value chain. 
we also had to face unfamiliar challenges, 
such as living up to the quality provisions 
expected of vestas. nonetheless, every one 
of our employees did an extraordinary job 
in making sure our installed base of more 
than 75,000 turbines delivered sustainable 
energy across the globe. 
and discipline and looking ahead, we aim to 
increase the gross margin on our projects 
and reduce the costs associated with quality 
issues. indeed, any shortfall in quality can 
impact our profitability; for example, in the 
second quarter of 2020 we made the extraor-
dinary warranty provisions of eur 175m 
to repair and upgrade turbine blades. a key 
strategic focus area is therefore to ensure 
our quality across the value chain lives up to 
customer expectations, and is befitting of our 
heritage as the industry leader. 
our work to become the safest company 
in the energy industry continued in 2020, 
although covid-19 meant the introduction of 
new policies and guidelines to keep our global 
workforce safe. throughout the year, everyone 
at vestas acted diligently to keep the covid- 
impact at a minimum, underscoring how we 
take care of each other and continually evolve 
our safety culture. 
building the future vestas
the close collaboration between our board of 
directors and executive management is key 
to ensuring a clear direction for everyone at 
vestas. through a well-established process, 
with a yearly strategy seminar and frequent 
operational follow-ups, the board of directors 
and executive management continuously inter-
act to ensure alignment on major priorities. 
through this collaboration, the board of 
directors and executive management has set 
out the future direction for vestas as outlined 
in our strategy. concretely, this means that 
vestas’ focus on the climate crisis translates 
into addressing three key challenges. these 
challenges, which offer huge business oppor-
tunities and which vestas has the capabilities 
to solve, are: 
 · accelerate the deployment of renewable 
energy, 
 · drive society-wide electrification, and 
 · implement solutions for non-electrifiable 
use. 
vestas’ vision and strategy address these 
challenges by setting strategic priorities and 
defining the best executional sequence. we 
see this as a very directional way of enabling 
the whole organisation to engage in our 
vision: to be the global leader of sustainable 
energy solutions.
these priorities will require the integration 
of our onshore and offshore businesses into 
one efficient and winning operating model in 
2021. following meticulous planning since 
the announcement of the strengthened part-
nership with mhi in october 2020, we are 
well underway with this project, but we remain 
realistic about the effort required to create a 
unified culture focused on accelerating the 
energy transition. we want to build an organi-
sation that will become a leader in offshore by 
2025, which means we need to catch up fast 
and successfully introduce our new offshore 
platform by this annual report 2020 release: 
the v236-15.0 mw™.
we also continue to invest in sustaining our 
technology leadership through modularisa-
tion, and through nurturing talent, diversity, 
and leadership while strengthening our 
customer focus. to support this development 
and ensure we have the right capabilities in 
executive management, we were excited to 
welcome tommy rahbek nielsen as chief 
operating officer and anders nielsen as chief 
technology officer in may 2020. anders 
nielsen replaced anders vedel, who contin-
ues as chief scientific advisor and whom we 
would like to thank for his ongoing service to 
wind energy and vestas. 
on the brink of a new sustainable era
2020 was a remarkable year that pushed 
the world into its worst crisis in more than a 
lifetime. at the same time, 2020 was also 
the year in which the world’s co₂ emissions 
decreased more than ever before and where 
renewable energy showed it is ready to 
become the dominant energy source.
 “ when the stakes were highest, 
we showed resilience and proved 
we can serve as the backbone 
of energy systems around the 
world.”
bert nordberg
chairman of the board of directors
 “ among the most important 
milestones, in 2020 we 
managed to scale our business 
to meet demand, increasing 
revenue to eur 14.8bn, 
representing 22 percent 
growth compared to 2019.”
henrik andersen
group president & ceo
as such, we are on the brink of a sustainable 
era where we will see unprecedented change 
across all areas of society. transportation, 
heating, and cooling will soon be electrified, 
and the shift to renewables will create a 
strong drive to integrate sustainability in 
everything we do. the journey ahead will not 
be a straight line and emissions will most 
likely increase again in 2021, but 2020 has 
shown that the solutions are ready. during 
the year, our supply chain and partners spent 
substantial time planning mutual steps to 
decarbonise the world’s most sustainable 
assets – wind turbines – even further. at the 
end of 2020, our 129 gw of installed wind 
turbines saves the world 186 million tonnes 
of co₂ annually, and during the year we 
reduced our own carbon emissions with 33 
percent, illustrating that we together with our 
suppliers and partners can do this with even 
greater momentum and speed.
however, we would not be where we are today, 
and vestas would not be playing the key role 
it is playing in creating a sustainable planet 
for our children and grandchildren, were it not 
for our employees. during an exceptionally 
challenging year, everyone at vestas demon-
strated incredible passion and purpose, 
and made individual and team sacrifices, to 
ensure we kept our promises and helped to 
accelerate the deployment of renewables for 
our customers and societies. on behalf of the 
board of directors and executive manage-
ment, we want to thank all vestas colleagues 
across the globe for their efforts in 2020. 
to this end and despite being outside the 
earnings guidance announced in february, 
eligibl  e vestas employees will receive an 
extraordinary reward totaling eur 25m for 
ensuring business continuity and driving the 
global activities forward through this unprec-
edented year. the decision was made by the 
board on recommendation from nomination 
& compensation committee, and excludes 
executive management because we didn’t 
meet our performance kpis. this special rec-
ognition reflects the tremendous contribution 
from team vestas in 2020 and that covid-
19 will impact our business well into 2021.
in the future, 2020 will be remembered as 
the year of covid-19, but for vestas it was 
also the year where we set the direction for 
the next decade. together with our 29,000 
colleagues, we have an even stronger intent 
in 2021 to create a more sustainable planet 
and bring us closer to our vision of being the 
global leader in sustainable energy solutions. 
thank you to every external and internal 
stakeholder for your support and commitment 
in 2020.
early in the year, we concluded that by lever-
aging our strong safety culture and establish-
ing clear governance around our covid-19 
crisis management, we could combine safety 
and business continuity during the pandemic. 
today, we know that the simplicity and direc-
tional nature of this decision helped create 
a united team at vestas, enabling us to find 
solutions to the challenges and complexities 
we faced. for this and much more, we owe all 
our 29,000 colleagues a heartfelt thank you.
expanding and delivering on our core 
to grasp future growth
onshore and offshore wind and service 
remain the core of our business, creating 
opportunities for us to grow and expand our 
reach into new areas of renewables and the 
energy transition. we are therefore pleased 
that in 2020 we achieved several important 
milestones and executed on strategic initi-
atives that will shape vestas’ evolution over 
the next decade. among the most important 
milestones, in 2020 we managed to scale our 
business to meet demand, increasing revenue 
to eur 14.8bn, representing 22 percent 
growth compared to 2019 and 46 percent 
compared to 2018. we also became the first 
company with 100 gw of wind turbines under 
service, underlining the key role our service 
business will play in terms of future revenue 
and cash flow. at the same time, we took 
huge steps forward in sustainability, including 
efforts to electrify our service vehicles and 
benefit cars. we also optimised our product 
portfolio by introducing new localised vari-
ants, installing the first enventustm turbines, 
and made the tough decision to discontinue 
product development that didn’t provide suf-
ficient returns.
in 2020, we continued to progress and 
execute on our strategic priorities for the 
mid- and long-term to remain the industry 
leader towards 2030. most prominently, this 
process included strengthening our partner-
ship with mitsubishi heavy industries (mhi) 
and acquiring all shares in the joint venture, 
mhi vestas offshore wind. through these 
developments, we made an emphatic move 
within offshore that will help accelerate the 
deployment of large-scale renewables and 
take us closer to our vision as the global 
leader in sustainable energy solutions. we 
therefore want to thank our close partner in 
mhi for collaborating with us since 2014, 
and for sharing the vision to create a more 
sustainable future. we are also delighted 
that kentaro hosomi, president & ceo of mhi 
energy systems, will be nominated to joining 
our board from april 2021. 
in recent years, vestas has also increased its 
presence in the development of renewable 
energy projects and built a strong global 
development pipeline. as a result, in 2020 
we established a development business unit 
which, in close collaboration with the rest 
of the company, will create a new revenue 
stream to the benefit of our global customers, 
local communities, and shareholders. in close 
alignment with our development activities, 
vestas also acquired a 25 percent stake in 
copenhagen infrastructure partners, the 
world’s largest dedicated fund manager in 
greenfield renewable energy infrastructure. 
through this acquisition we aim to build 
another pathway to value creation, accessing 
the long-term returns generated by renewa-
ble energy projects. we also aim to go beyond 
our development business’ current focus of 
co-development and early-stage investment 
in renewables projects. 
since 2018, we have grown revenue by 46 
percent, but in that period our profitability 
and quality have not followed the same posi-
tive trajectory. although covid-19 increased 
executional cost, in early 2020 we made the 
decision to decline financial support from 
governments, as this allows us to manage 
our operations and capital structure in both 
the short and long term. the key to improving 
our profitability is through our own execution

1)  for definitions and accounting policies for the sustainability key figures, see the notes on page 134. comments to the indicators related to specific sustainability targets can be found in 
this report, pages 019-024. the developments in the remaining indicators are commented on in the vestas sustainability report 2020. 
2)  data only available from 2019 onwards.
3)  the decrease from 2019 to 2020 is attributable to a design change in 2020 that has optimised the metal content in the turbine hub after which the blade mass corresponds to a bigger 
share of the total rotor mass. 
4)  the 2019 baseline has been updated from 44 percent to 42 percent recyclability due to adjustments in the bill of materials.
5)  this covers 70 percent of the scope 3 emissions.
6)  in the vestas annual report and sustainability report 2019, this number was 151 million tonnes saved. since then, the fleet average capacity factor used has been corrected, and the 
number adjusted accordingly.
7)  only board members elected by the general meeting are included.
8)  employees in leadership positions comprise managers, specialists, project managers, and above.
9)  the cases not registered here as substantiated or unsubstantiated are still under investigation at the end of the year.

long-term financial ambitions
wind power has outcompeted fossil fuel alternatives in most parts of 
the world, volumes in the global wind turbine market are good, and the 
prospects for the coming years promising, with wind power’s expected 
central role in the electrification of societies, industries and mobility 
systems and forecasts of average annual growth of wind power capac-
ity of 8 percent towards 2030.²)
at the same time, the wind power industry has seen consolidation, 
giving way for a more stable competitive environment. the profitability, 
however, is still not at a satisfactory level, and hence this needs to be a 
focus area for wind turbine manufacturers in the coming years. 
ambitions for the three business areas
onshore
the demand for onshore wind power globally is expected to remain sta-
ble or grow slightly from the current high level the next two-to-three-
years. after that, a new phase of growth is expected, driven by new pol-
icies, increased electrification, and corporate ambitions and activities. 
adding to that, vestas expects to see increasing contributions from its 
development activities.
on this background, vestas maintains its long-term ambition for the 
onshore wind power segment to grow faster than the market and be 
market leader in revenue.
offshore
the projections for the offshore market suggest a development in 
three phases for vestas’ newly acquired offshore segment. based on 
the order backlog, vestas will see a couple of years with high activity 
levels and solid financial performance. then, from 2023, the company 
expects to see a decline in activity towards 2025. these first two 
phases will be under the influence of heavy investments both in the 
organisation, supply chain, and technology. by 2025, when a steep 
increase in annual offshore installations is expected, and vestas’ new 
platform will be gaining traction in the market, vestas aims to be a lead-
ing player in offshore wind power. 
based on these assumptions, vestas has an ambition to achieve reve-
nue in the offshore segment of eur +3bn by 2025, with an ebit mar-
gin on par with the group's overall margin. 
service
the wind power service market is expected to continue growth at the 
current rate, and vestas maintains its ambitions for the long-term for 
the service revenue to grow faster than the market. the service ebit 
margin is expected at a level of around 25 percent in the coming years, 
accounting for the integration of the offshore business, which currently 
generates lower margins than onshore.
ambitions on group level
vestas maintains its ambition on an overall level to grow faster than the 
market and be market leader in revenue. even with the integration of 
the offshore business, the company remains optimistic about reaching 
a 10 percent ebit margin based on the current market conditions and 
projections. the introduction of a new offshore wind power platform 
will impact free cash flow, but vestas nevertheless expects to generate 
a positive cash flow each year. the ambition is still to achieve a long-
term roce of minimum 20 percent over the cycle.

the beginning of a sustainable era
energy is one of the fundamental building blocks of society. it powers life 
and prosperity, defines entire eras in human history, and dictates how we 
live our lives. when energy sources change, societies change with them, 
and we are currently on the brink of a new era defined by renewables. 
renewables are now the cheapest source of electricity in most parts of 
the world,¹ and global efforts to combat the climate crisis and create sus-
tainable societies are gaining momentum. the need for change is urgent, 
and the sustainable energy solutions to deliver it are available today.
the sustainable era will be characterised by unprecedented change 
to energy systems as well as societies at large. entire industries and 
mobility systems will need to be electrified in order to take advantage 
of renewable energy sources, and as a result renewable energy sources 
will redefine how we produce, distribute, and use energy. as such, the 
entire planet is embarking on an industrial and societal transition never 
seen before, opening up new opportunities for value creation for sus-
tainable companies.
today, electricity constitutes just 20 percent of the global energy sys-
tem, and of this wind energy provides around 6 percent. with less than 
2 percent of all energy coming from wind turbines, it is clear the growth 
potential for renewables is enormous, as illustrated on page 11.² 
global electricity demand is expected to have grown almost 60 percent 
by 2050 as electrification accelerates and energy demand in develop-
ing economies increases. wind and solar pv are expected to play a key 
role in this expansion and supply 56 percent of global electricity, up 
from just 9 percent in 2019.¹
for the last 40 years, vestas has pioneered wind energy, and this will 
remain our key focus. to create a sustainable planet for future genera-
tions and continue to provide an economic return to our shareholders, 
we must, however, also look beyond wind energy. today, we are there-
fore increasingly investing in solutions that enable both the continued 
deployment of renewables and allow us to integrate sustainability in 
everything we do.
who we are
with a vision to become the global leader in sustainable energy 
solutions, everything we do revolves around the development and 
deployment of sustainable energy solutions. every day, our 29,000 
employees help to create a better world by designing, manufacturing, 
installing, developing, and servicing wind energy and hybrid projects all 
over the world. with 129 gw of wind turbines installed in 83 countries, 
our sustainable energy solutions have already prevented 1.5 billion 
tonnes³ of co₂ being emitted into the atmosphere and contributed 
to a more sustainable energy system. we have more than 40 years of 
experience in wind energy and were the first company to reach the 100 
gw landmarks for both the installation and service of wind turbines. 
as such, we believe we have already played a crucial role in laying the 
foundations for the sustainable era, and that we are uniquely posi-
tioned to show the path to a sustainable planet. 
wind energy is our heritage and core competence. we believe wind will 
form the backbone of the sustainable energy systems of the future, and we 
remain focused on developing solutions that accelerate the energy transi-
tion and strengthen vestas’ continued leadership in wind.

sions,² global warming remains on the wrong trajectory. according to the 
intergovernmental panel on climate change, a 1.5 °c increase in global 
average surface temperature will have devastating consequences 
for our planet, causing extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and 
climatic changes.⁴ the temperature increase is largely caused by the 
growing concentration of co₂ in the atmosphere, and energy production 
and usage remain the primary emitter.⁵ it is therefore abundantly clear 
that urgent change is needed in the world’s energy mix. for instance, 
according to the international energy agency, a 40 percent reduction in 
emissions by 2030 will require nearly 75 percent of global electricity 
generation to come from low-emission sources by this time.²
to change our planet’s trajectory, the most cost-effective and immedi-
ate path to meaningful emissions reduction is large-scale deployment 
of renewable energy. however, as the penetration of renewable elec-
tricity increases, this alone will not be enough to avoid a temperature 
increase above 1.5 °c. we must therefore address the following three 
challenges:

1. accelerate the deployment of renewable energy
wind and solar energy only account for around 9 percent of the global 
electricity generation mix today;⁶ it is therefore clear that the deploy-
ment of renewables needs to accelerate substantially for the world to 
stay within a 1.5 °c scenario. 
2. drive society-wide electrification
today, only certain elements of society are powered by electricity and 
renewable energy – in fact, only 20 percent of energy consumption is 
electricity.⁷ a key lever to creating a sustainable energy system is to 
drive electrification forward and ensure mobility, heating, and indus-
tries can be powered by electricity from renewables.
3. implement solutions for non-electrifiable use
in some industries and sectors electrification is not feasible anytime 
soon. however, power-to-x and green hydrogen are well-known solu-
tions that show great potential to address the challenges we face – for 
example, by helping to shift steel production and heavy transport to 
renewable energy sources.
pioneering solutions to all three of these challenges, and deploying 
them at scale and low cost, is the key to achieving a sustainable energy 
future. founded with the aspiration to help create a more sustainable 
planet, vestas’ vision and strategy address these challenges with solu-
tions underpinned by our leadership in wind, and by the knowledge that 
the climate crisis remains the greatest challenge and opportunity of 
our time.
a strategy to lead from the front
in 2020, vestas celebrated its 75th anniversary, and its 40-plus years 
of pioneering the development and deployment of wind energy. since 
1979, when we installed our very first wind turbine, we have been lead-
ing the wind energy industry from the front. today, wind and/or solar 
pv are the cheapest new sources of electricity in countries making up 
around 73 percent of world gdp,⁶ and vestas’ total installed capacity 
displaces more co₂ emissions than any other company in the sustain-
able energy sector.
with global wind power capacity expected to grow on average 8 per-
cent per year until 2030,⁸ and with our leading position in the industry, 
vestas’ core continues to revolve around wind and the accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy. ensuring competitive and compatible 
wind energy solutions remains vital to a sustainable energy mix. only 
by continuing to innovate superior solutions for wind power generation 
and the energy system surrounding it can we address the climate crisis 
and continue to grow our company. with power capacity expected to 
rise sixfold from 2019 to 2050, and with renewables expected to 
surge from 28 percent in 2019 to 69 percent in 2050,⁶ the growth 
opportunities are significant. in fact, this growth is expected to drive 
investments of around usd 11 trillion in renewables, of which usd 5.9 
trillion will be invested in wind energy.⁶
the strong outlook for renewable energy has been a key driver of change 
for the wind energy industry over the last ten years. in particular, the 
industry has moved from niche to mainstream and become more mature, 
making renewables even more competitive, consolidating the industry, 
and driving more sustainable operations across the entire value chain. as 
a consequence, only a few wind energy companies are currently profita-
ble and those that will benefit as the industry expands will be those that 
can scale over time. simultaneously, the immense growth in renewables 
has led to a rapid expansion of key industry job functions – for example, 
service technicians and manufacturing workers. in this way, the energy

transition is stimulating local job creation – both in the short term during 
construction, and in the long term via servicing and manufacturing.
2020 was a remarkable year that pushed the world into its worst crisis 
since world war ii. vestas and the wider industry showed remarkable 
resilience during the global pandemic, demonstrating that renewables 
can form the backbone of our energy systems. covid-19 has chal-
lenged the entire energy value chain and restrained global mobility, but 
during 2020 renewables and wind in particular ensured that produc-
tion and installation schedules remained on track. turbine performance 
was also maintained to the benefit of all societies with renewable 
energy assets. 
at the same time, covid-19 recovery stimulus and increasingly 
ambitious climate targets, such as the eu’s green deal, china’s 2060 
net-zero co₂  target, the us re-entry to the paris climate accord, and 
japan’s 2050 net-zero co₂ ambitions, are all having a positive impact. 
together, these developments are stimulating increased investments 
in renewable energy and adjacent technology that will help create a 
sustainable energy mix.
vestas has the scale, reach, track record, and technological expertise 
to continue leading the buildout of renewable energy and the electri-
fication of societies. leveraging these qualities, our strategy revolves 
around three pillars: 
 · enabling electrification through low-cost renewable energy
 · driving increased deployment of renewable energy
 · pioneering new solutions to indirect electrification 
as part of our strategy, and as part of our efforts to play a leading role 
in the energy transition, in 2020 we took major steps towards the reali-
sation of our vision. these steps will affect vestas in the short term and 
shape the future vestas of 2030. they include:
 · making an emphatic move in offshore by acquiring mhi vestas 
offshore wind
 · launching the industry’s most ambitious sustainability strategy
 · making vestas the first oem in renewable energy with verified climate 
targets in line with the 1.5°c scenario
 · expanding our development activities and investing in copenhagen 
infrastructure partners 
 · forming a partnership with mitsubishi heavy industries focused on 
green hydrogen 
in the mid-term, our priorities remain to integrate sustainability in 
everything we do and lead the market in both wind power plant solu-
tions and in service. we also aim to ensure industry-leading profitabil-
ity, sustaining our preferred partner status with customers, and attract-
ing the best talent in the energy industry. 
to achieve our goals and lead the energy transition, we focus on three 
strategic business areas: onshore, offshore, and service.
our three strategic business areas - outlook and priorities
a global leader in onshore wind energy solutions 
onshore wind remains a key driver in the energy transition and will form 
a key part of future sustainable energy systems. although not expected 
to grow at the same rate as offshore wind, the market for onshore is 
expected to constitute 60-70 gw a year in the coming years.⁹ with 
the increased economic competitiveness and global applicability of 
advanced wind power plant solutions, the potential for onshore wind is 
significant, albeit with some short-term regional fluctuations. 
activity levels in 2019 and 2020 reached record highs, around 
which the market is expected to stabilise in the coming two-to-
three years. after this period, a new phase of stable global growth 
is expected as a result of demand from new policies, increased 
electrification, and corporate activities.⁹ over the years, onshore wind 
energy has outcompeted fossil fuel alternatives in most parts of the 
world.¹⁰ however, more importantly wind energy’s predictability and 
production profile now make it possible to build a carbon-free economy 
around wind energy and adjacent technologies, including storage, 
interconnectors, grid expansion, and energy analytics.  
in 2020, industry dynamics and record-breaking volumes of deliver-
ies, as well as disruptions linked to covid-19, increased the pressure 
on many players. this pressure in turn drove further consolidation 
and challenged profitability across the sector. as a result, vestas’ key 
strengths and capabilities mean the company is well positioned to 
emerge stronger from the global pandemic.
following a successful increase in vestas’ global development 
activities over the past three years, we have now established a new 
business unit committed to the development of renewable energy 
projects. the new unit supports our ambition to accelerate the 
deployment of sustainable energy, marking an important step in 
vestas’ journey towards becoming the global leader in sustainable 
energy solutions. 
9) 
 source: wood mackenzie: market outlook update q4/2020. december 2020.
10)  source: bloomberg new energy finance: bloomberg new energy outlook. september 2020.
the development business unit will see vestas playing a more influ-
ential role in progressing the deployment of renewable energy across 
national energy systems, as well as expanding our presence across a 
larger part of the renewable value chain. this acceleration is necessary 
if we are to meet the ambitious timeline of global climate goals, and 
progress on our commitment to the green energy transition. we are 
therefore seeking to advance our overall growth journey by ramping up 
development as an autonomous area within our core business, drawing 
on our strength and expertise from other parts of the renewables value 
chain. in this way, vestas is taking a major step towards expanding its 
presence across the entire value chain, from technology development 
to manufacturing. we will also be supporting governments in the 
deployment of renewables, financial solutions, installations, service, 
and long-term returns on assets.
to leverage our leading position in onshore wind, our priorities in the 
power solutions segment are to: 
 · provide leading wind turbine products globally, for example the 
v162-6.0 mw enventus™ turbine and the v155-3.3 mw™ turbine. 
 · expand our solutions that address customer needs beyond turbines, 
such as our epc and co-development activities, and support our 
customers by facilitating tailored financial solutions.
 · optimise our operations in a cost-effective manner that minimises 
risk for vestas and our supply chain partners, and safeguards delivery 
for our customers globally.
 · continue growing faster than the market by maintaining market 
leadership in our core regions, and further building out our position 
in new markets. such markets include brazil, china, and india, fast-
growing markets like south africa, russia, the middle east and north 
africa, and new ones like colombia and vietnam.
 · lead the industrialisation of the wind power value chain while 
continuing to offer our customers unique solutions that maximise 
value for their wind sites. to this end, we are accelerating a multi-year 
journey to modularise our products, systems, and organisation. 
 ·  continue prioritising industry-leading quality by ensuring the safety 
and reliability of wind power plants is the key focus for vestas, while 
having robust processes in place to handle any incidents, determine 
causes, and resume operations.
a leading player in offshore wind 
vestas is the leader in onshore wind power. however, to accelerate the 
energy transition and achieve our vision we must play a larger role in 
offshore wind. the demand for offshore wind energy has accelerated 
in recent years and is expected to reach more than 25 gw per year 
by 2030.¹¹ initially, this includes solid growth from 2021 to 2024 
from the current high single-digit gw level; but from 2025, when new 
markets are expected to open, projections foresee a step-change 
growth of the annual installed capacity. this development is being 
driven by a 69 percent decline in levelised cost of offshore wind 
energy since 2012.¹² it is also the result of the growing applicability 
of offshore wind energy. this is mainly driven by high-system value, 
proximity to load centres, improved permitting, and public acceptance, 
as well as the application of large-scale power-to-x solutions.  
 
in response to these conditions, and as part of our ambition to become 
a leader in offshore wind, in 2020 we acquired mitsubishi heavy 
industries’ shares in the mhi vestas offshore wind joint venture.

strategy 
and ambitions
creating the global energy 
system of the future
for years, renewable power producers, utilities, and policy makers have been grappling with a key 
question: in a global power system that was designed for the trading and distribution of fossil-fuel 
generated power, how can we make the transition to a system driven by renewables? 
w
ith the renewables industry gaining 
momentum, and electrification set 
to trigger huge changes in power 
consumption, it is a question that 
requires an urgent answer. in an effort to find a 
solution and help build a sustainable planet for 
future generations, at vestas we are investing 
heavily to address the technological challenges 
currently facing the renewables industry. 
as part of this process, tackling the twin 
issues of intermittency and limited dis-
patchability in renewables is key. simply put, 
energy intermittency concerns the fact that 
renewable energy sources such as wind and 
solar can only produce power when the wind 
is blowing and the sun is shining. this poses 
a challenge to the daily operation of the 
electricity grid because electricity supply and 
demand need to be constantly balanced to 
ensure grid stability. in turn, dispatchability of 
power refers to power that can be dispatched 
on demand, with generators adjusting output 
to local market needs.
at vestas, lars christian christensen, vice 
president of storage & energy solutions, is 
looking at innovative ways to address the 
challenge of intermittency. according to lars 
christian: “critics of renewable energy often 
present intermittency as a challenge that will 
make renewable energy unviable as the back-
bone of the energy system. there’s no doubt 
we need cost of storage and other solutions to 
drop further, but right now it looks like we need 
to reach a renewable energy penetration of 70 
or 80 percent before costs soar. in the early 
21st century we thought costs would soar at 
five percent, so we’re very optimistic.”
as the world transitions from a power system 
designed around large, controllable electric 
generators to a decentralised system based 
on renewable energy, there are many ways to 
address intermittency. interconnectors, smart 
grids, power-to-x, and battery storage will 
all play a prominent role in this conversation. 
vestas is exploring several of these avenues, 
including battery energy storage solutions 
(bess), as anders nielsen, executive vice 
president & cto, explains:
“our bess is a battery energy storage solution, 
storing renewable, co₂-free energy generated 
by vestas wind turbines. with a capacity of 
900 kw and delivery potential of 650 kwh, 
the battery is linked to the electricity grid, but 
is also synchronised with vestas turbines via 
a data and control link. the battery therefore 
charges when the wind blows and stores the 
energy generated when not in use, ensuring 
the availability of fully sustainable energy. ”
although not yet capable of mitigating intermit-
tency in larger grids, bess is fully transportable                
and therefore scalable, with the potential to 
deliver sustainable energy to areas without tra-
ditional infrastructure. just as renewable energy 
has scaled massively in recent years, we need 
the same to happen for solutions that enable a 
decentralised energy grid based on intermittent 
renewable energy sources. 
as lars christian concludes: “solutions like 
bess, power-to-x, and interconnectors are 
central to ensuring a successful transition 
toward sustainable energy. as such, bess 
is a great example of how we can electrify 
areas of society, mitigate the use of car-
bon-based fuels, and address the global 
climate crisis. it’s a small step, but every step 
counts.” ▪
 “ critics often present 
intermittency as a challenge, 
but we’re very optimistic.”

while vestas is not yet a leading player in offshore wind, we are taking 
a long-term perspective on the segment due to the length of offshore 
wind business cycles. to fulfil our ambitions in offshore wind, our priori-
ties in the offshore segment are to:
 · deliver on customer projects based on the v164/v174 platform, 
where we face high levels of activity in the coming one-to-two years. 
key commitments include installations on some of the largest and 
most noteworthy projects in the offshore sector to date, such as the 
1.1 gw seagreen project in scotland.
 · launch and ramp-up of a new industry-leading offshore wind power 
platform with the v236-15.0 mw™ turbine, which takes offshore 
wind turbine technology to a new level – not only in terms of energy 
production, but in terms of lowest cost of energy, reliability and 
industrialisation to drive and scale the offshore wind sector globally. 
 · develop and deploy new technologies and concepts, such as floating 
offshore wind power and power-to-x.
 · drive a smooth integration process to establish a unified product and 
business platform within vestas for future profitable growth across 
offshore and onshore. this process will be characterised by respect for 
our employees and strong capabilities, with a clear goal to create the 
same scalability in offshore as we have in onshore. 
a global leader in wind energy service solutions 
in 2020, vestas became the first company to reach 100 gw of wind 
turbines under service, highlighting wind energy’s growing importance 
in providing cheap and stable electricity across the globe. similarly, 
wind turbines played a key role during the covid-19 pandemic, 
providing stable electricity and jobs when supply chains were 
disrupted, and industries were hit by economic slowdown. 
 
primarily driven by high installation volume, service market activity 
continued to grow in 2020 and offered strong value to owners of 
wind power plants. with the high level of new annual additions set to 
continue, service is expected to grow at a significant pace. at the same 
time, the service segment continues to mature, driving further efficien-
cies and creating new revenue streams from a broad range of compet-
itive new solutions. such solutions include increasing more advanced 
and value-accreting contracting scope to asset owners, expanding our 
offering of new solutions for multibrand platforms and ageing assets, 
and driving industry-leading digitalisation and ecommerce offerings.
as vestas looks to expand its onshore and offshore footprint in service 
while sustaining leadership in this area, our priorities in the service 
segment are to:
 · ensure we streamline our global service delivery model.
 · continue growing our service business, ensuring we remain the 
preferred partner for both existing and new customers by providing 
dedication, professionalism, and technical expertise, and by 
developing specific new offerings they need.
 · continue investing in and focusing on the expansion of technical 
capabilities across more turbine platforms, while developing higher 
scope and longer-term contracts. 
strategy execution
to drive our strategic priorities and ensure we focus on the key chal-
lenges we face, vestas runs a yearly strategy cycle and review where 
we discuss, adjust and optimise our strategy based on market changes 
and future scenarios. the yearly cycle ensures close alignment on stra-
tegic priorities between the board of directors (the board) and execu-
tive management, providing the organisation with a strong focus and 
ensuring clear direction for all of our colleagues around the world. 
in 2020, our key strategic priorities included among others the follow-
ing ‘must win battles’: 
 · modularisation: modularisation is both a tool and a mindset. it will 
guide vestas’ continued transformation to meet the future demand 
for wind energy and customer requirements – onshore as well as 
offshore. in this way, modularisation combines customisation and 
standardisation, making it possible for us to serve broad market 
requirements at competitive costs. our platforms have served us 
well until now, but the increasing number of variants has increased 
the competitive pressure; our response is continued standardisation 
and cost-out, without compromising on providing the solutions our 
customers need. to succeed, we must remain disciplined by investing 
in the right initiatives, while discontinuing projects that look unlikely 
to provide the returns we originally expected. as an example, in april 
2020 we discontinued the development of a specific aspect of our 
technology programme.
 · quality: new product introductions, accelerated cost-out and high 
activity levels have challenged production ramp-ups and delivery 
plans, which in turn has put pressure on the entire vestas value chain, 
including our quality. as a result, we are now seeing higher warranty 
provisions and consumption due to increased rework and delays in the 
launch and execution of new products, which reduces our profitability. 
addressing these challenges and enforcing a strong quality culture 
across the value chain is a strategic priority for vestas. our aim is to 
ensure issues are contained and solved close to their origin, while 
providing best-in-class quality for future customer solutions.
 · talent & leadership: vestas’ growth ambitions require us to have the 
right employees with the right capabilities. we need to attract, recruit, 
develop, and retain business-critical talents, not only in established 
markets but in new markets where the vestas brand may not be so 
well known. to fulfil our strategy, we therefore must build a strong 
talent pipeline, improve leadership capabilities, and increase diversity 
to foster sustainable success and growth. we already have around 
30,000 skilled and dedicated employees, but we are on a journey and 
we must do even more to be successful in the future – especially in 
terms of diversity and succession.

sustainability  
– progress on targets
the board of directors and executive management regularly assess 
whether vestas’ capital structure, i.e. how the company funds its overall 
operations and growth, is in the shareholders’ best interest. they also 
consider the ways in which it supports the vestas corporate strategy.
financial management 
in relation to financial management, the objective is to create the neces-
sary flexibility and stability to implement strategic development work, 
while in the long term achieving a competitive return for the company’s 
shareholders. at the same time, vestas aims to reduce the cost of capital. 
capital structure targets 
as a key player in a market where projects, customers, and wind energy 
investors are increasing in size and number, vestas aims to be a strong 
financial counterpart. vestas will maintain capital resources to ensure 
compliance with its capital structure target of net interest-bearing debt 
to ebitda below 1x at any time.
capital allocation priorities 
vestas applies the following principles to capital allocation:
 · provide the investments and r&d required to realise vestas’ 
corporate strategy and its long-term vision of being the global leader 
in sustainable energy solutions. 
 · make bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate or increase profitable growth 
prospects. all investments in organic growth and acquisitions must 
support vestas’ long-term financial ambition of achieving return on 
capital employed. 
 · pay shareholder dividends based on the board’s intention to 
recommend 25-30 percent of the company’s annual net result after 
tax, which will be paid out following shareholder approval at the 
annual general meeting. 
 · from time to time, initiate share buy-back programmes to 
adjust the capital structure. any decision to distribute cash 
to shareholders will be based on the capital structure target 
and availability of excess cash. the level of excess cash will be 
determined in line with the company’s growth plans and liquidity 
requirements. share buyback programmes, if any, will likely be 
initiated in the second half of the year based on performance. in 
years without major investments, most of the free cash flow may 
be distributed to shareholders through dividends and share buy-
backs. 
the board and executive management consider that vestas’ current 
capital and share structure serves the interests of shareholders 
and the company well. it also provides strategic flexibility to pursue 
vestas’ vision of becoming the global leader in sustainable energy 
solutions.
on 1 february 2021, vestas obtained a baa1 long-term issuer 
credit rating with a stable outlook from moody's investors service, 
inc.,which will secure access to attractive funding sources.
capital structure strategy
 “ during 2020, we continued to execute on our 
strategy, acquired full control of our offshore wind 
activities, and once again paying dividends to our 
shareholders. ”

progress on sustainability strategy targets 
committed to a leading role in the renewable energy 
transition, vestas via its installed capacity of 129 
gw helps avoid more carbon emissions than any 
other company. this creates a unique opportunity for 
vestas to help shape the energy market of the future 
and combat the climate crisis. to make sure vestas 
drives change beyond the renewable technology and 
products, the company has introduced an ambitious 
sustainability strategy.
this section is dedicated to a high-level description of vestas’ progress 
on targets connected to its four sustainability strategy goals. sustain-
ability key figures can be found on page 007, and governance matters 
are elaborated in a separate section, see page 052. further informa-
tion on vestas’ sustainability strategy, corresponding initiatives, gen-
eral esg approaches and principles, as well as full reporting for the year 
can be found in the comprehensive vestas sustainability report 2020. 
in 2020, vestas launched its sustainability strategy, sustainability in 
everything we do. while vestas continues to create and service prod-
ucts that are crucial to mitigating climate change, it is also now focused 
on becoming a fully sustainable company, having made sustainabil-
ity an integrated part of its day-to-day operations. the company is 
working to improve the environmental performance of its full value 
chain, create value for local communities, promote a safe, diverse and 
inclusive workplace, and lead the transition to a world powered by sus-
tainable energy. to succeed in these ambitions, vestas is ramping up 
its efforts to integrate sustainability not only across the business, but 
throughout its operations and value chain.
within its new sustainability strategy, vestas has defined four key 
goals with connected targets: 
goal no. 1: carbon neutrality by 2030  
– without using carbon offsets
reducing emissions in own operations
the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral company requires vestas 
to reduce carbon emissions in its operations (scope 1 and 2) by 55 
percent by 2025 and by 100 percent by 2030, with the year 2019 
as baseline. committed to leading the transition to a world powered 
entirely by sustainable energy, vestas will not use carbon offsets to 
help achieve carbon neutrality.
in august 2020, vestas’ targets for reducing greenhouse gasses in its 
own operations were validated by the science based target initiative 
(sbti). the sbti confirmed that vestas’ carbon neutrality target is in 
line with the efforts required to keep global warming to no more than 
1.5°c above pre-industrial levels, granting vestas the most ambitious 
designation available through the sbti validation process.
in 2020, vestas achieved a 33 percent reduction in carbon emissions 
in its own operations compared to the 109 tonnes emitted in 2019. 
this reduction was largely the result of sourcing 100 percent of vestas’ 
electricity consumption across all operations from renewable sources. 
in addition, vestas launched three other initiatives to support the com-
pany in reaching carbon neutrality by 2030: switching to plugin-hybrid 
and electric benefit cars; increasing the use of renewable energy for 
heating in factories; and replacing service vehicles with sustainably 
fuelled alternatives. regarding the latter initiative, vestas introduced 
127 sustainably fuelled service vehicles in 2020. 
to support the transition to a fleet of electric cars, in december 2020 
vestas signed a global collaborative framework with enel x s.r.l., the 
enel group’s advanced energy services business line. through the 
agreement, enel x will be providing vestas with the charging infrastruc-
ture to support vestas’ service and benefit car fleets across workplace 
locations in 15 of vestas’ largest markets.
to date, vestas’ installed fleet has helped to avoid 1.5 
billion tonnes of carbon emissions globally, and this 
years' produced and shipped capacity is expected to 
discplace 493 million tonnes over its lifetime – placing 
vestas as one of the world leaders in preventing co₂ 
from being emitted into the atmosphere. 
reducing emissions in the supply chain
vestas is furthermore dedicated to reduce carbon emissions in its sup-
ply chain (scope 3) by 45 percent per mwh generated by 2030, com-
pared to 2019. the company will pursue this goal via a two-pronged 
strategy, the results of which are only likely to be seen in the long term. 
on the one hand, vestas will support its main suppliers in developing 
strategies to reduce their emissions. on the other hand, the company 
will have a direct impact on these emissions by focusing on how its 
products and supply chain are designed.
in 2020, the first ten strategic suppliers were engaged to set carbon 
emissions baselines and formalise targets within business plans. in 
2021, the scope will increase to focus on 27 strategic suppliers. during 
the vestas supplier forum in november 2020, expectations for 2021 
were shared with suppliers. these include an expectation to commit to 
100 percent electricity consumption from renewable energy sources, 
targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions, and the measurement of produc-
tion waste for products delivered to vestas. in 2022, suppliers will be 
expected to commit to scope 3 emission targets.
furthermore, in 2020 vestas entered into sustainability partnerships 
with its suppliers dsv panalpina a/s and hempel a/s, systematically 
and collaboratively working to reduce emissions from transport and 
coating solutions. 
the scope 3 carbon emissions from vestas in 2020 amounted to 6.49 
kg co₂e per mwh generated, at the same level as was seen in 2019.

by the end of 2020, vestas has installed 129 gw of wind turbines globally. on an annual basis, this energy generation 
capacity spares the planet around 186 million tonnes of carbon emissions. via vestas’ total deployed capacity since 1981, 
it is estimated that 1,492 million tonnes of carbon emissions have been avoided over the years.* the table below provides 
examples of what this equates to when translated into everyday activities.**

goal no. 2:  
zero-waste wind turbines by 2040
committing to the production of zero-waste turbines means vestas aims 
to create a value chain that generates no waste materials. vestas plans 
to achieve this goal by developing and implementing a circular strategy 
for the different phases of the vestas value chain: design, production, 
service, and end-of-life. vestas will present this strategy in 2021.
today, vestas wind turbines are on average 85 percent recyclable. how-
ever, the wind turbine rotors (blades and hubs) are currently comprised of 
composite materials which are difficult to recycle. as a first step, therefore, 
vestas is working to improve the recyclability of all turbine rotors, with the 
goal of increasing the recyclability rate of these components from 42 per-
cent in 2019¹ to 50 percent by 2025, and to 55 percent by 2030. 
in 2020, vestas introduced a number of initiatives to increase the recy-
clability of its wind turbine rotors. as a founding member of the uk’s 
national composites centre, vestas supports the suswind project, 
which was launched in november 2020. this initiative aims to discover 
viable ways of recycling composite materials in wind turbine blades 
and explore sustainable materials for new blades.
furthermore, together with one of its epoxy suppliers, vestas imple-
mented a project to develop new composite technologies that enable 
resin dismantling for end-of-life turbine blades. this would potentially 
enable ‘design-for-disassembly’ to be integrated into future blade 
technology. 
then, in january 2021, the decomblades project was initiated, focusing 
on value chains for recycling wind turbine blades reaching their end of 
life. in collaboration with other major wind turbine manufacturers, recy-
cling companies and knowledge partners, decomblades aims to identify 
one or more sustainable, globally available and economically feasible 
recycling routes for turbine blades. specifically, vestas will support the 
development of material and value streams for three recycling routes. 
the recycling technologies will undergo a complete life cycle analysis 
and mapping for global warming potential. the project runs for three 
years and is partly funded by the innovation fund denmark. 
the means of reaching zero-waste wind turbines cannot be applied 
quickly, but will need to be developed and tested over time. vestas 
therefore does not expect to see a significant increase in recyclability 
rates in the short term. for 2020, the recyclability rate for vestas 
turbine hubs and blades was 41 percent recyclability by weight. the 
slight decrease results from of a design change, which has optimised 
the metal content in the turbine hub, after which the blade mass corre-
sponds to a bigger share of the total rotor mass. 
 “ at vestas, we have started to realise a future in 
which sustainability is integrated into everything 
we do. this work is crucial, not least because the 
renewables sector has some way to go. as our 
industry scales, we commit to showing the way for 
doing so sustainably.”

1)  absolute figures and accounting principles for these indicators can be found on page 007 and 134 respectively.
2)  the 2019 baseline has been updated from 44 percent to 42 percent recyclability due to adjustments in the bill of materials. the decrease from 2019 to 2020 is attributable to a de-
sign change in 2020 that has optimised the metal content in the turbine hub after which the blade mass corresponds to a bigger share of the total rotor mass. 
3)  for diversity and inclusion, the initiative “expanding access to inclusive leadership and unconscious bias training” was removed as it is considered more of an enabler to the kpi related to women 
in leadership positions. since 2020, diversity and inclusion training elements are mandatory in all onboarding processes. read more in the vestas sustainability report 2020, on page 027.

safety
every day, vestas employees manufacture, install and service wind farms 
all over the world. without exception, they always operate under the 
principle of ‘safety first’ and have done so for the last 15 years. during 
the same period, vestas has successfully reduced the occurrence of work 
injuries by 96 percent, to a lost time injury rate in 2020 of 1.2 per one 
million work hours. in order to become the safest company in the energy 
industry, vestas is committed to reducing its total recordable injury rate 
(trir) to 1.5 by 2025 and to 0.6 by 2030. these efforts would ensure 
an overall average trir reduction of 15 percent year-on-year. 
with a trir of 3.3 for 2020, vestas achieved the targeted 15 percent 
reduction compared to 2019, and continues to implement initiatives 
to reduce the occurrence of work injuries. see the vestas sustainability 
report, pages 022-023 for more information on safety initiatives.  
in 2020, during the covid-19 pandemic, vestas’ priority was to mini-
mise all risks to keep employees safe, while continuing to manufacture, 
install, and service wind farms around the world. in this way, the com-
pany worked to ensure ongoing stable energy supply throughout the 
global health crisis.

diversity and inclusion
at vestas, more than 100 nationalities work together to achieve the 
vision of becoming the global leader in sustainable energy solutions. 
the internal mix of various identities is a major competitive advan-
tage for the company: it brings together multiple perspectives, levels 
of experience and educational backgrounds, which combine to help 
expand and deepen access to sustainable energy solutions worldwide. 
however, if the company is to adequately represent the societies in 
which it operates, vestas must be more ambitious. indeed, vestas 
wants to become the most inclusive company in the energy sector and 
the guarantor of all its employees being able to fulfil their full potential 
in their job roles all over the world. 
as a first step, vestas is focusing on increasing the share of women in lead-
ership positions to 25 percent by 2025, and to 30 percent by 2030, from 
the 2019 baseline of 19 percent. the percentage has been stable over a 
series of years and at the end of 2020, women still occupied only 19 per-
cent of vestas' leadership positions, suggesting that increased attention 
to both recruitment and retention of female leaders is necessary. in 2021 
a new values, inclusion and wellbeing team will be established to support 
and drive action on attracting, retaining and developing female talents.
during the year, vestas commissioned an external pay equity audit of 
seven major countries to identify potential areas of pay inequality. in 
conclusion, the audit found no overall structural issues, only identifying 
pay inequities relating to individual jobs across functions and geog-
raphies. vestas also conducted a review of the company’s recruitment 
processes, provided unconscious bias training for all recruiters, and 
invested in new technology to help identify biased language in job ads. 
further initiatives promoting diversity and inclusion across the com-
pany will be launched in the coming year. 
in relation to both diversity and governance, in 2017 vestas set an ambi-
tious target to reach an equal gender distribution in the board of direc-
tors of vestas wind systems (the board) by the end of 2021. in april 
2020, the general meeting elected six men and two women to the board. 
therefore, vestas’ board did not achieve an even gender distribution at 
the end of the year, as defined by the danish business authority.
as part of the agreement made in october 2020 with mitsubishi heavy 
industries, ltd. (mhi), the board proposes mr. kentaro hosomi, ceo, 
energy systems, mhi, as board member for election at vestas’ annual 
general meeting in april 2021. for this reason, it is unlikely that vestas 
will be able to reach its goal in 2021. the board has therefore decided 
that the goal of reaching equal gender distribution in the board will have 
to be postponed to no later than in 2022 for the purpose of strengthen-
ing vestas’ partnership with mhi. vestas finds it critical to achieve more 
diversity in its board and will work towards reaching this goal.
corporate social responsibility
in september 2020, vestas communicated its commitment to lead the 
way in social responsibility by adopting a cross-stakeholder approach 
to business-related human rights in the renewables industry. this 
commitment, entitled leading a responsible and inclusive energy 
transition, entails three aspects: respecting human rights in vestas’ 
operations, entering into strategic partnerships to create long-term 
value and local community engagement, and consolidating vestas’ 
human rights position in the future energy market. 
from 2020 onwards, vestas will be including csr performance indica-
tors in its sustainability key figures, further demonstrating its dedica-
tion to socially responsible operations at a global level. for more infor-
mation, see the vestas sustainability report 2020, pages 014-015. 
goal no. 4: leading the transition to a world 
powered by sustainable energy
vestas is committed to leading the global energy transition. the 
company also aims to take a leadership role in driving decarbonisation 
and electrification beyond the power sector, forming partnerships 
with other sustainability leaders to drive change, and supporting its 
partners on their journey to become more sustainable. 
in 2020, vestas formed a partnership with danish energy company 
ok a.m.b.a, piloting the deployment of a high power charging station 
by the highway outside of odense, denmark, that will charge electric 
vehicles (evs) through the grid. the station will exclusively use wind-
sourced electricity by way of a 900-kw battery that is digitally syn-
chronised to a vestas turbine. 
the system is the first of its kind, and it is hoped the experience and 
insight gained will pave the way for a wider rollout, further leveraging 
evs to help fight the climate crisis.
furthermore, during the year, vestas teamed up with several other sus-
tainability leaders to drive change across various industries, emphasis-
ing vestas’ conviction that substantial and lasting sustainable change 
can only be achieved through joint action. vestas is also actively working 
with partners such as dsv panalpina a/s and hempel a/s to decrease 
the carbon footprint of vestas’ value chain. going forward, vestas will 
work to leverage the full potential of these partnerships and proactively 
pursue new collaborative approaches to foster sustainable change.

energy transition in 2020, see the vestas sustainability report 2020,

consolidated 
for 2020, vestas’ consolidated numbers comprise vestas wind systems a/s and the sub-
sidiaries over which vestas exercises control. “vestas” covers the two business areas: power 
solutions and service. 
mhi vestas offshore wind a/s reported 
information on a stand-alone basis up 
until 14 december 2020. 
hereafter, the balance of the joint ven-
ture was fully consolidated into vestas’ 
financials.

mhi vestas offshore wind
activity levels in the onshore 
wind power market have been 
rapidly increasing, and vestas 
reached another record high 
revenue in its power solutions 
business in 2020 of eur 
12.8bn. this also resulted in 
17,055 mw produced and 
shipped and 17,212 mw 
delivered to the customers.  
order intake continued at a 
high level of 17,249 mw.

vestas closed the year with revenue in the high end of the guidance 
range of eur 14bn-15bn. compared to 2019, revenue included a neg-
ative impact of approximately eur 700m from foreign exchange rate

gross profit
gross profit in 2020 amounted to eur 1,538m, corresponding to 
a gross margin of 10.4 percent, a 4.1 percentage point decrease 
compared to 2019. the decrease was driven by increased cost levels 
derived from warranty provisions, as well as logistical challenges and 
supply-chain bottlenecks, amplified by the covid-19 situation. this 
was partly offset by improved service profitability. 
warranty provisions
warranty provisions in 2020 amounted to eur 693m, equivalent to 
a warranty ratio of 4.7 percent of revenue in the year, which was 2.3 
percentage points above the ratio in 2019. the increase was mainly 
caused by extraordinary warranty provisions of eur 175m in the sec-
ond quarter and a higher than expected level in the fourth quarter of 
2020.
the extraordinary provisions in the second quarter of 2020 were made 
to cover a specific repair and upgrade of a confined, albeit considerable 
number of blades that are already installed.
the higher than anticipated level in the fourth quarter of 2020 relates 
to a bonding failure on blade root inserts. the scope of the replacement 
costs has been clearly identified, and current and future production is 
not impacted.  
research and development costs
research and development costs recognised in the income statement 
amounted to eur 265m, slightly below the 2019 level of eur 268m. 
the total research and development expenditure prior to capitalisation 
and amortisation decreased from eur 372m in 2019 to eur 331m in 
2020, however, partly offset by higher amortisation costs as a result of 
bringing new technology to the market.
distribution costs
distribution costs amounted to eur 281m in 2020 (2019: eur 
222m). the increase was mainly due to additional depreciation in the 
supply chain area for transport equipment to handle new blade types 
and higher activity levels. 
administration costs 
administration costs amounted to eur 242m (2019: eur 267m) and 
constituted 1.6 percent of revenue in 2020, a decline of 0.6 percent-
age points compared to 2019. 
depreciation, amortisation, and impairment
depreciation, amortisation, and impairment amounted to eur 641m 
before special items in 2020 (2019: eur 546m). the increase was 
primarily a result of recent years’ higher capitalisation of costs related 
to the development and introduction of new technologies and product 
variants, including transport equipment. 
operating profit (ebit) 
ebit before special items amounted to eur 750m in 2020 (2019: 
eur 1,004m), equivalent to an ebit margin of 5.1 percent before spe-
cial items, which is within the guidance range of 5-7 percent. the ebit 
margin before special items decreased by 3.2 percentage points com-
pared to 2019 mainly driven by the lower gross profit margin as well as 
higher distribution costs.
ebit after special items amounted to eur 698m with costs in special 
items of eur 52m in 2020. special items were the outcome of the 
decision in the first quarter to optimise and simplify the product port-
folio for the coming years, resulting in cost of impairment of capitalised 
development costs and associated equipment, purchase commitments 
with suppliers, and lay-offs.

income from investments in joint ventures
income from investments in joint ventures amounted to a profit of eur 
331m in 2020 (2019: eur 3m). this relates mainly to a net impact 
of positive eur 383m in relation to vestas’ acquisition of mitsubishi 
heavy industries, ltd. (mhi)’s shares in the mhi vestas offshore wind 
joint venture driven by the remeasurement of the value of vestas’ exist-
ing 50 percent ownership. furthermore, a net loss of eur 46m derived 
from vestas’ share of the result in mhi vestas offshore wind a/s on a 
standalone basis until closing of the acquisition 14 december 2020, 
* the service order backlog includes offshore service orders as of 14 december 2020.

performance
driven by a change in the assessment of the need for warranty provi-
sions for offshore activities (2019: eur 3m profit). these effects were 
partly offset by elimination of profit related to co-development projects 
in the usa.
net financial items 
financial items for 2020 amounted to negative eur 95m (2019: 
negative eur 98m) and comprised interests, fees, and currency related 
items. 
income tax 
income tax amounted to eur 163m, equivalent to an effective tax rate 
of 17 percent (2019: 23 percent). the decrease in the effective tax 
rate compared to 2019 was primarily due to the non-taxable gain from 
vestas’ acquisition of mhi’s shares in the mhi vestas offshore wind 
joint venture and from reductions in provisions and valuation allow-
ances on tax assets offsetting a negative effect from generally higher 
statutory tax rates in the countries where vestas operates.
profit for the year 
profit for the year amounted to eur 771m in 2020 (2019: eur 
700m). the increase compared to the year before was mainly a result 
of higher income from investments in joint ventures.
profitability ratios 
earnings per share amounted to eur 3.90 in 2020, an increase of eur 
0.33 compared to 2019, benefitting from a gain in relation to vestas’ 
acquisition of mhi’s shares in mhi vestas offshore wind a/s. return 
on capital employed (roce) was 13.5 percent in 2020, a decline 
compared to 19.7 percent in 2019. the negative development can be 
attributed to an increase in total equity and financial debt, as well as 
lower ebit. return on equity was 21.4 percent in 2020 (2019: 22.1 
percent), a decrease of 0.7 percentage points, which can also be attrib-
uted to a higher equity balance relative to increased earnings. 
working capital and cash flow
net working capital
net working capital amounted to a net liability of eur 1.1bn as at 31 
december 2020, which was eur 0.5bn below net liability at the end of 
2019 of eur 1.6bn. during 2020, the level was negatively impacted 
by an increased level of inventories only partly offset by higher down- 
and milestone payments from customers and trade payables towards 
suppliers.
cash flow from operating activities
cash flow from operating activities was eur 743m in 2020, a 
decrease of 10 percent compared to last year. the decrease was mainly 
driven by the above-mentioned negative development in net working 
capital during 2020 and a higher consumption of warranty provisions. 
cash flow from investing activities before acquisitions
cash flow from investing activities amounted to a net outflow of eur 
659m compared to an outflow of eur 729m in 2019, a decrease 
driven mainly by the decision in the first quarter of 2020 to optimise 
and simplify the product portfolio for the coming years. this excludes 
acquisitions of subsidiaries, financial investments, and the acquisition 
of mhi’s shares in mhi vestas offshore wind.

investing in the 
future
from 2016 to 
2020, vestas has 
been increasing the 
investment level to 
stay ahead of the 
curve – developing the 
next generation wind 
turbines. 
free cash flow
free cash flow, excluding acquisitions of subsidiaries, financial invest-
ments, and the acquisition of mhi’s shares in mhi vestas offshore 
wind, amounted to positive eur 84m (2019: eur 94m). 
acquisition of strategic targets
on 29 of october, vestas announced that it would acquire mhi’s shares 
in the mhi vestas offshore wind joint venture, against mhi acquiring 
2.5 percent in vestas and being nominated to a seat in vestas wind 
systems a/s’ board. the transaction was approved by relevant author-
ities on 27 november 2020, with closing taking place 14 december 
2020, where mhi received a total of 5,049,337 shares in vestas fol-
lowing a capital increase. as of 14 december, the balance of the joint 
venture was fully consolidated into vestas’ financials. offshore reve-
nue in the period from the closing on 14 december to 31 december 
amounted to eur 100m, with insignificant impact to ebit. this impact 
has been fully consolidated in vestas’ income statement for 2020.
furthermore, in december 2020, vestas announced that it had entered 
into an agreement with the investment management company copen-
hagen infrastructure partners p/s (cip), whereby vestas will acquire a 
25 percent minority stake in cip’s parent companies. the stake will be 
acquired at a price of eur 500m, in the form of eur 180m as upfront 
payment, and eur 320m as an earn-out payment. the transaction was 
completed in the beginning of february 2021, and therefore has had 
no impact to vestas’ income statement and balance sheet for 2020.
capital structure and financing items
equity and solvency ratio
as at 31 december 2020, total equity amounted to eur 4,703m, an 
increase from the year before of eur 1,358m, which can be attributed 
to a positive net result of eur 771m and a eur 861m impact from the 
capital increase in relation to the agreement with mhi. these effects 
were also the main drivers of vestas’ solvency ratio at 31 december of 
25.9 percent compared to 23.3 percent the year before.
the strength of the balance sheet, combined with the results achieved 
in 2020, has led the board of directors to recommend a dividend of 
dkk 8.45 (eur 1.14) per share, equivalent to 30.0 percent of the net 
result for the year after tax. 
net interest-bearing position and cash position
as at 31 december 2020, vestas’ net interest-bearing position was 
positive of eur 1,920m, a decline of eur 532m compared to 2019. 
this development was primarily the result of the consolidation of the 
acquired offshore business and dividend payment in 2020. cash and 
cash equivalents amounted to eur 3,063m as of 31 december 2020 
(2019: eur 2,888m).
the ratio net interest-bearing debt/ebitda was (1.4) as at 31 decem-
ber 2020 compared to (1.6) end of 2019. this slightly negative 
development was driven by the decline in net interest-bearing position, 
partly offset by lower operating profit (ebitda). the ratio remains 
well below the capital structure target of a net interest-bearing debt/
ebitda ratio below 1x.

financial performance 
result for the period 
in 2020, revenue from power solutions amounted to eur 12,764m 
(2019: eur 10,276m), continuing the strong growth in past years. this 
was primarily driven by high activity levels in the americas, and particu-
larly the usa.
ebit before special items from power solutions amounted to eur 
397m, a 46 percent decrease compared to 2020. consequently, the 
ebit margin before special items was 3.1 percent (2019: 7.2 percent). 
this decrease was primarily attributable to increased cost levels 
derived from warranty provisions, as well as logistical challenges and 
supply-chain bottlenecks, amplified by the covid-19 situation. 
order intake
in 2020, onshore order intake amounted to 17,249 mw, slightly down 
from the record-high level in 2019 of 17,877 mw, but with demand for 
wind power and vestas’ wind power solutions globally continuing to be 
strong. the order intake in 2020 corresponded to eur 12.7bn (2019: 
eur 13.8bn) and resulted in an average selling price of eur 0.74m per 
mw.
europe, middle east, and africa accounted for 43 percent of the order 
intake, and the region continues to be important for vestas, with countries 
such as poland, uk, and the netherlands offsetting a declining order 
intake in finland. 
the americas region has as expected been negatively impacted by a 
lower level of orders in the usa, but partly offset by a higher order intake 
in brazil and colombia. americas accounted for 37 percent of the total 
vestas order intake. 
asia pacific has seen a growing order intake in 2020 and accounted for 
20 percent of total order intake. this has mainly been led by china, where 
2020 marked the last year in which customers could receive feed-in-tar-
iffs.  
 
order backlog 
at the end of the year, the total wind turbine order backlog amounted to 
24,630 mw, corresponding to eur 19bn. of this, 21,048 mw relates to 
onshore wind turbines, corresponding to 15bn. compared to last year, the 
onshore order backlog in mw increased by 17 percent. the average price 
per mw in the backlog of onshore turbines was eur 0.72m in 2020.

global trends in the onshore wind power market 
the global market for wind energy continued to experience strong 
demand going into 2020. consequently, the volume of annual installed 
onshore wind power capacity is expected to have increased to a record 
high of 71 gw during the year (2019: 56 gw).¹ this represents an 
increase of 27 percent compared to 2019 and is expected to be sup-
ported by all major regions, especially the americas and asia pacific. 
europe, middle east, and africa saw increased installation levels in 
scandinavia, germany, and eastern europe, primarily poland and 
ukraine. installations in the americas were driven mainly by the usa, 
where projects which previously qualified for the full production tax 
credit (ptc) created record activity levels nationally. installations in 
asia pacific were primarily driven by china, where the feed-in-tariff 
system has now been phased out and will, as in most major wind 
power markets globally, be replaced by an auction system from 2021 
onwards.
wind power as critical infrastructure
throughout 2020, as strong growth in demand for wind power 
coincided with the disruption of global value chains caused by the 
global pandemic, the major challenge facing the entire wind power 
industry was to secure business continuity. to this end, by delivering 
the strongest annual installation volumes in wind power’s history, 
keeping thousands of people employed and securing a stable energy 
supply, the industry confirmed its position as a provider of critical 
infrastructure.
consequently and due to renewable electricity generation being cost 
competitive, countries and corporations continued to raise the bar 
on sustainability, and renewable energy was made a vital component 
of economic reset programmes around the world. during the year, 
investments were increasingly canalised towards renewable energy, 
presenting a major opportunity for wind turbine manufacturers and 
their customers.  
developments in power solutions during the year
one of the priorities for vestas’ power solutions business during the 
year was to deliver on its customer commitments while keeping all 
vestas employees safe. in a challenging year, the power solutions busi-
ness achieved this goal, and successfully delivered the largest number 
of wind turbines to customers in the company’s history. 
these delivery volumes also meant that vestas continued to reach 
new levels of operational scale, with a close to 60 percent increase in 
deliveries to customers in just two years. the foundations are now in 
place to capture the future potential of the power solutions business, 
with wind power’s place in society and in the global energy mix firmly 
established. 
opportunities arising in new markets 
vestas has already established itself as the global leader in wind in 
most mature onshore markets. while these markets are expected to 
continue generating strong demand, vestas must also continue to grow 
its presence in areas where it has not traditionally operated. 
during 2020, vestas expanded the number of countries in which firm 
and unconditional orders have been secured. these included, among 
others, colombia, a country with great wind power resources. in fact, 
some relatively new countries ended up contributing significantly to 
the total order intake for the year. vietnam, for example, which up until 
late 2019 was an almost unexplored wind power market, generated 
more than 1.1 gw in firm order intake in 2020, representing 6 percent 
of vestas’ total order intake. 
winning in these new and developing markets presents a great oppor-
tunity and requires collaboration across all vestas’ functions. market 
specific strategies are defined for each country, driven by strong 
on-the-ground local teams with full support from global functions. the 
application of vestas’ social due diligence methodology then ensures 
local communities are engaged respectfully and inclusively, thereby 
securing the best possible project outcomes on multiple levels.
repowering
the market for repowering older assets within ageing wind turbine fleets 
offers a promising outlook due to the improved economics of onshore 
wind energy. furthermore, repowering such assets will be critical to sus-
taining renewable energy generation, and thereby also tremendously 
important for those countries with an already sizable installed fleet, ena-
bling them to meet their future sustainability targets. 
although still in its infancy, and primarily centred around europe and 
the usa, repowering is expected to be a significant driver of demand 
in the coming decade. in some core european markets, like denmark, 
austria, and the netherlands, repowering is expected to account for 
approximately 50 percent of new installed capacity by 2030, pointing 
to increased opportunities as other countries reach the same level of 
maturity.

2020.
during 2020, vestas received a number of orders in connection with 
the repowering of older wind farms. in the netherlands, for example, 
vestas developed a project in close collaboration with more than 200 
local farmers, residents, and entrepreneurs. the wind park currently 
consists of more than 200 wind turbines, which will be replaced by 
new vestas turbines. the project will generate almost three times more 
energy with less than half the number of turbines, demonstrating the 
significant value in replacing older wind power assets with new and 
more efficient variants. 
by utilising the newest technology available, repowering is vital to sus-
taining wind power’s growing share of the energy mix, and to securing 
future stability in the global energy system. 
transforming commercial capabilities 
as the energy industry evolves along with the proliferation of renew-
ables, the opportunity to capture more value across the value chain 
increases. an increasingly diverse customer landscape has created the 
need for more flexible offerings, including hybrid solutions and wind 
farm development.
during 2020, vestas continued to strengthen its capabilities in the 
development of wind power projects. while continuously increasing its 
own pipeline of development and co-development projects in 2020, 
vestas further established a dedicated development business unit to 
expand the spectrum of project opportunities for existing customers. 
vestas and copenhagen infrastructure partners p/s further agreed for 
vestas to acquire a 25 percent ownership stake in the investment man-
agement company to expand its presence in renewable project devel-
opment, and engage with areas of the renewables value chain that lie 
beyond its existing footprint. 
manufacturing and supply chain capabilities 
2020 was without doubt a very busy year for vestas’ manufacturing 
and supply chain. the clear priority to deliver on the promises made 
to customers, without jeopardising the health and safety of vestas’ 
employees, was the guiding star during this period. consequently, 
vestas managed to deliver a record-high 17,212 mw of wind turbines 
to customers, far exceeding previous years’ levels, across 40 countries 
and 6 continents. within this context, the unmatched global reach and 
scale of vestas’ manufacturing and supply chain footprint was, and 
continues to be, of the utmost importance.
scaling the supply chain to new levels
while the last couple of years have presented multiple challenges and 
increased complexities, including both trade restrictions and the global 
pandemic, vestas has managed to remain focused and ramp up its 
manufacturing and supply chain activities. in particular, during 2020 
vestas increased its capabilities in india, china, and brazil.
the annual capacity of produced and shipped wind turbines conse-
quently increased to 17.1 gw (2019: 12.6 gw). the majority of the 
produced and shipped turbines comprised upgraded variants of the 4 
mw platform (the v136-4.2 mw™ and the v150-4.2 mw™ turbine), 
highlighting the need to expand and accelerate new turbine production.
investing in the supply chain and future partnerships
to serve a truly global and growing marketplace for sustainable energy 
solutions, and to secure industry-leading profitability, vestas needs to 
leverage its size, scale, and volume. for this reason, vestas is always 
actively looking for strategic partners. in many parts of the value chain, 
these partnerships have been key to delivering strong growth in recent 
years, and will help to secure the scalability and flexibility of the vestas 
business model going forward. in recent years, this is exemplified by 
increased outsourcing of important components such as blades, for 
which vestas now has global partnerships with suppliers, while also 
continuing manufacturing in-house. 
another key element of the wind turbine supply chain is transportation. 
in january 2020, vestas entered into a strategic partnership with dsv 
panalpina a/s in an effort to develop more efficient transportation and 
logistics solutions. the partnership seeks to combine dsv panalpina’s 
global range of supply chain services with vestas’ volume and unpar-
alleled experience in special project transportation. each year, vestas 
receives around 500,000 inbound shipments and uses more than 900 
vessels. to mitigate the environmental impact of these shipments, the 
partnership also includes a mutual commitment to reduce and elimi-
nate co₂ emissions related to transport and logistics. 
partnerships serve as an import enabler for vestas to maintain its true 
global scale and comply with localisation requirements. it also presents 
an opportunity to partner with companies supporting the renewable 
transformation in order to accelerate the vision of being the global 
leader in sustainable energy solutions.  
focus on quality 
vestas continues to lead the industry, expanding its product portfolio 
and introducing modular technology to efficiently meet customer 
demand. recent years have seen an acceleration of new product devel-
opment and an increased focus on cost reduction. consequently, vestas 
has doubled the number of blade variants developed in the past three 
years, while at the same time significantly increasing activity levels. this 
has naturally resulted in challenges linked to production ramp-ups and 
delivery plans across the value chain, including increased rework and 
repairs, process immaturity, and general delays in new product launch 
and execution. in order to overcome these challenges and secure vestas’ 
long-term competitive edge in turbine technology, quality needs to be at 
core of the company’s priorities and operations at all times.
as a result, vestas is addressing existing and potential future chal-
lenges across the value chain and develops a plan for how to overcome 
these. by finding, analysing, and addressing the root causes and ensur-
ing focus on successful handovers in the value chain, vestas will be bet-
ter at getting things right the first time by adhering to processes and 
fast identify, correct, and learn from mistakes when they occur. finally, 
vestas will leverage successes from its journey in safety to create a cul-
ture where all employees proudly take ownership of quality.
modularising wind power technology
with the development and 2019 launch of the enventus™ wind turbine 
platform, vestas reached a milestone in its journey towards modular-
isation. compared to the 2 mw and 4 mw platforms, which share 20 
percent components, the enventus™ platform is fully modular, making 
the development of variants more efficient. the new modular approach 
represents a fundamental change in how wind power products are 
developed, sourced, manufactured, and serviced. indeed, modularity 
enables vestas to accelerate the delivery of affordable and reliable 
renewable energy solutions.  
in 2020, vestas took another significant step on its modularisation 
journey, introducing a new operating model within vestas’ technology 
division. the simplified organisational setup includes an increased 
focus on products, reduced organisational layers, and new ways of 
working. it also enables full value chain integration in design deci-
sions, as well as an improved flow of customer, market and value chain 
requirements for product and module response.   
also in 2020, vestas’ modularisation efforts delivered prototype 
installations of the enventus™ platform’s two first product variants, the 
v162-5.6 mw™ and the v150-5.6 mw™. in addition, vestas’ continued 
focus on innovation and product development allowed for the two vari-
ants to be upgraded to a 6.0 mw standard rating, delivering an increase 
in energy production of more than three percent. a strong focus on exe-
cution and long-term competitiveness also means that vestas needs 
to bring the right products to the market at the right time and cost. in 
2020, this led vestas to optimise parts of its product portfolio, includ-
ing the cancellation of certain technology projects as an assessment 
showed the return on investment would not be satisfactory.

safety first:  
business continuity 
during covid-19
while covid-19 has caused significant job losses and supply chain stagna-
tion across the world, global demand for a stable and reliable energy supply 
has remained consistent. through an agile pandemic response framework, 
vestas navigated rising infection rates throughout 2020 which presented 
a considerable risk to the safety of vestas’ employees, as well as local lock-
down measures, which threatened to compromise our operations.  
f
aced with these unprecedented 
circumstances, we appointed a 
global crisis management team to 
develop a globally applicable 
safety protocol to guide our organisation 
through unexpected disruption. thanks to sev-
eral local governments acknowledging the crit-
ical role we play in supporting global energy 
infrastructure, we were able to protect both the 
safety and livelihoods of our employees 
around the world, while continuing to deliver 
on our commitments to support the countries 
that rely on us.
safeguarding health, employment and 
continuity in highly affected regions  
when an unexpected governor’s decree in 
march halted production operations in our 
assembly factory in ceará, brazil, our local 
teams were able to respond quickly. lever-
aging a globally aligned pandemic response 
plan, already successfully implemented across 
europe, we secured official confirmation within 
just a few days. our production management 
team in ceará then worked to ensure the nec-
essary safety measures were in place, aligning 
with both local guidelines and vestas’ global 
recommendations.
“since lockdown measures were introduced 
in mid-march,” says sandro leite, production 
manager in brazil, “our primary focus was to 
keep business running as close to normal as 
possible.” as sandro explains, the team divided 
operations into smaller sub-sections to ensure 
employees could maintain physical distance as 
they worked. “we appointed process instruc-
tors to carry out safety communications. we 
learned that effective communication is key to 
maintaining morale and preventing misinfor-
mation. of course, this was an adjustment, but 
thankfully we were able to adapt quickly with 
the support of the vestas pandemic response 
framework and global decision trees.”
in india, fluctuating infection rates led to strin-
gent restrictions in the state of gujarat, where 
vestas operates a factory in ahmedabad. for 
production management staff, this created 
an increased need to maintain a steady flow 
of communication between team members, 
despite physical distancing measures. these 
efforts helped to ensure that new information 
was shared effectively, and the concerns of all 
employees were addressed quickly.
“across the factory, we operated a safety-first, 
work-next approach,” says kundariya ayushi m,  
 “ we learned that effective 
communication is key to 
maintaining morale and 
preventing misinformation.”
sandro leite
production manager, brazil
eam planner in india. “we introduced several 
measures to promote physical distancing, from 
additional transport to motel accommodation 
for critical employees. but the main innovation 
was communication; to keep my team feeling 
reassured, i introduced several new channels 
of communication, from whatsapp groups to 
digital conferences, to help compensate for the 
physical distance.”
looking ahead 
the key to vestas’ safety and continuity 
approach throughout the pandemic was to 
ensure that new processes were scalable and 
that governance structures remained agile. 
with circumstances constantly evolving, it 
was crucial to create processes that supported 
quick adaptation. going forward, vestas will 
build on this foundation to ensure that renewa-
ble energy continues to play an influential role 
within the global energy system. as our foot-
print across brazil and india increases, we aim 
to continue driving job creation, higher green 
energy penetration, and overall resilience for 
these regions in the future.
the pandemic has forced a new normal on 
modern life and modern business. at vestas, 
our vision is to maximise safety and support to 
ensure we continue to thrive in this new reality, 
maintaining strong communications, protect-
ing the health of our employees, and salvaging 
business continuity to the fullest extent possi-
ble. this work can be further supported by the 
prioritisation of renewable energy in economic 
recovery measures. the achievement of global 
climate goals will require ongoing production 
and service operations across the renewable 
industry’s value chain, enabling the sector to 
scale to meet a larger share of global energy 
demand. ▪
while the enventus™ platform architecture continues to lay the foun-
dation for future vestas turbine development, and while the modular 
architecture approach creates synergies across platforms, vestas’ 2 
mw and 4 mw variants remain highly competitive. 2020 also saw the 
launch of the v155-3.3 mw™ turbine for the 4 mw platform, specifi-
cally designed with a large rotor-to-rating ratio to improve partial load 
production in low-wind conditions, such as those found in the usa and 
india. these innovations highlight vestas’ increased focus on delivering 
product variants to specific market segments. 
enventus™ variants are vestas’ first modular offering and have gained 
a strong foothold in the market. however, more solutions are underway, 
and modular product development is shaping the future of wind energy. 
at the forefront of these developments, vestas strengthened its position 
as industry leader during 2020, and took further steps towards realising 
its vision of becoming the global leader in sustainable energy solutions. 
rethinking recycling
one of the four pillars of the vestas sustainability strategy is circularity. 
the development and manufacturing of wind turbines in vestas’ power 
solutions plays a vital role in the company’s drive to produce zero-
waste turbines by 2040. today, vestas turbines are approximately 
85 percent recyclable, with the blades presenting the main barrier to 
achieving full circularity. in 2020, vestas engaged in various projects 
to address this issue. 
one such project is decomblades, a cross-industrial and interdiscipli-
nary project which will run for three years, with the aim of increasing 
the value of recycled materials and thereby set economic incentives for 
recycling wind turbine blades.

modularisation 
combining standard modules into new products increases product variety. 
unlike the more conventional way of developing turbine solutions, the mod-
ular product design approach allows for synergies across platforms and var-
iants. besides a consistent and comprehensive value chain and product life 
cycle focus, one of the main enablers for achieving modularity benefits is the 
principle that the different variants share configuration modules. this reduces 
costs across the value chain and throughout the product life cycle, ena-
bling vestas to increase its product offerings and bring new product variants 
to market quicker. modularity is a fundamental new structural architecture; it 
provides multiple benefits in terms of developing, sourcing, manufacturing, 
servicing, and upgrading power solutions.

financial performance 
result for the period
in 2020, the onshore service business generated revenue of eur 
2,055m, which equals a year-on-year growth rate of 10 percent. the 
organic growth rate excluding translation exchange rate impact was 
13 percent in 2020. the revenue in the service business continues to 
be positively impacted by the growing fleet of installed wind turbines, 
which has seen a strong increase over the last five years.
profitability in the service business continues to be at a high level, and 
in 2020, the ebit margin increased to 27.6 percent (2019: 25.8 per-
cent). this development was primarily driven by reliable performance of 
wind turbines under service contracts as well as efficient cost manage-
ment and vestas’ industry-leading global scale.

vestas has increased 
its service revenue 
by 57 percent since 
2016 – with increasing 
profitability.
order backlog
at the end of 2020, vestas had service agreements in the order back-
log with expected contractual revenue of eur 23.9bn, which is an 
increase of eur 6.1bn compared to 2019. this provides the service 
business with strong visibility and the ability to continue the reduction 
of the cost of maintenance for wind turbines.
going forward, all offshore service activities will be integrated into 
vestas’ service business. of the eur 23.9bn service order backlog, 
eur 3.4bn is a reflection of vestas acquiring full control of mhi vestas 
offshore wind. 
global trends in the onshore wind power service market
the strong growth witnessed in onshore wind power installations in 
recent years continues to fuel growth in the global wind power service 
market. in 2020, it is estimated that cumulative installed capacity 
grew 12 percent to 660 gw.²
this growth offers both opportunities and challenges as the market 
becomes more mature. it also means greater stability and predictabil-
ity will be required for wind power as an energy source, as it penetrates 
a larger portion of the overall energy mix. within this context, wind 
power service solutions play a crucial role, and scale will continue to be 
critical for service providers. as the focus on life cycle costs increases, 
vestas continues to improve its service capabilities to deliver maxi-
mum value to customers.
becoming part of the critical infrastructure 
together with other renewables, wind power is on track to become the 
foundation of the global energy system. the service of wind turbines is 
consequently playing an increasingly central role in ensuring a sustain-
able, cost-competitive, and reliable energy supply – now, and for years 
to come. in 2020, the global pandemic highlighted the importance of 
wind power and, in turn, service solutions, with wind constituting an 
even greater part of the electricity mix and securing generation during 
lockdown. 
however, as installed wind power capacity increases, digital trans-
formation also needs to continue to improve. having the right digital 
platform, one that allows operators to efficiently scale their turbine 
fleets, has never been more important to the delivery of predictable 
and cost-efficient energy solutions.
developments in service during the year
a major milestone 
during 2020, vestas reached the milestone of 100 gw of wind 
turbines under service, leading the industry’s efforts to replace fos-
sil-based energy sources and drive the transition to a sustainable 
energy future. this achievement is both a testament to vestas’ leading 
position within wind power service solutions, and the speed with which 
the installed capacity of wind energy and renewables is growing within 
the global energy system.
reaching this milestone provides scale and maturity, enabling vestas’ 
service business to increase its value-add to customers, while making 
operations more efficient. in particular, it raises the bar for the continu-
ous digitalisation of the operations and maintenance offerings. 
continuously investing in digital transformation
vestas continues to invest in this transformation, leveraging simpli-
fied processes, automatic tools, and improved planning to increase 
workforce efficiency in the field and enhance employee and customer 
satisfaction. 
to draw the full advantages of vestas’ digitalisation journey and to 
optimise efficiency, quality, and safety, in 2020, vestas rolled out 
apple technology and custom apps in many parts of the organisation, 
including its more than 10,000 service employees. information and 
processes for technicians, for example, have been consolidated and 
streamlined in user-friendly applications, improving employee satisfac-
tion and increasing the ability to perform work tasks efficiently. techni-
cians now use phone or tablet applications for activities including work 
orders, troubleshooting, reporting, and time registration. this saves a 
significant amount of time each year, translating directly to reduced 
cost. as part of this roll-out, custom apps have been developed for spe-
cialised tasks in different parts of the service operations.
the digital transformation is end-to-end, improving the processes 
and systems from sales teams to the technician in the wind turbine. 
for example, new customer relationship management tools are being 
rolled out as part of this transformation, enabling improved care for 
customers and information for sales teams. operationally, for example, 
digitalisation increases the ability to do more remote troubleshoot-
ing, improve planning, and provide better technical support. these 
efforts will improve customer satisfaction, employee motivation, and 
strengthen vestas’ position as the leading service provider. 
 “ we want to be the best partner for our 
customers and provide the best service across 
the renewables industry by leveraging our 
leading scale and introducing tomorrow’s way 
of working.”

vestas offers its customers a range of service solutions covering main-
tenance partnering; parts & repair; fleet optimisation solutions; and 
digital solutions to help customers optimise the output of wind power 
projects.
the company’s four-leg service portfolio drives performance and lowers 
the cost of energy for customers’ wind power plants, positioning vestas 
as the one-stop shop for lifetime plant maintenance. vestas works 
closely with its customers to tailor service packages to meet site-spe-
cific wind power plant requirements. responding to vestas customers’ 
evolving demands, vestas offers a new generation of flexible fleet opti-
misation capabilities, such as advanced plant and data management, 
diagnostics, and forecasting.
maintenance partnering
maintenance partnering, based on the active output management® 
(aom) service concept, is the core of the vestas portfolio. with ample 
opportunities to further increase efficiency in the service of onshore 
wind turbines, full-scope service offerings remain critical in order for 
the customers to realise the lowest possible cost of onshore wind 
energy.
comprehensive service contracts are the most popular form of main-
tenance partnering. these service contracts are signed with a duration 
of up to 30 years. this results in an average remaining duration on 
close to 10 years in the backlog. combining longer tenures with the 
most comprehensive service packages is a great way for customers to 
maximise certainty on investment. it also enables vestas to utilise the 
scale benefits of its entire fleet under service, and improve wind turbine 
performance efficiency.

parts & repair 
vestas offers an extensive range of parts & repair services for vestas 
turbines and multibrand turbine platforms, while continuing to invest in 
digitalising the transactional business area, for example via shop.ves-
tas.com. the repair services team provides customers with a fleetwide 
one-stop shop for value added services, ranging from advanced inspec-
tions and asset management programmes, to up-tower and down-
tower repair and the exchange of major components and blades. 
during the year, vestas saw an increasing level of activities in its parts & 
repair services, mainly as a result of expanded capabilities and offerings. 
fleet optimisation 
improvements in the production efficiency of a wind power plant can 
be achieved through various measures. these include site-specific 
optimisation of operational parameters, implementation of intelligent 
software algorithms, and enhanced aerodynamic add-ons. such meas-
ures are designed to increase the production of installed wind turbines, 
while vestas powerplus® can boost energy production by up to 5 
percent annually. at the end of 2020, the number of wind turbines suc-
cessfully upgraded with powerplus® products totalled can boost energy 
production by up to 5 percent annually. 
in 2020, vestas signed a number of new fleet optimisation deals. 
this process included the renewal of an existing contract across four 
projects in finland, including a new power mode, power performance 
optimisation, and a lifetime extension up to 30 years. 
digital solutions
vestas offers customers digital solutions to deliver greater predictability, 
increased renewable energy production, more efficient operations, and 
better integration with energy grids. as the global energy sector under-
goes transformation, energy systems and power plant owners must 
improve forecasting accuracy for renewable production. they also need 
to optimise output from each individual generation asset, and orches-
trate a portfolio of resources across multiple sites and equipment types. 
together with utopus insights inc., vestas offers customers a suite 
of best-in-class analytics applications across energy sources that 
supports the digitalisation of renewable energy assets and energy 
systems. through this partnership, vestas also addresses well-known 
challenges such as predictive maintenance, forecasting and power 
plant optimisation. the platform for these applications is known as 
schipher™.
inaccurate supply forecasts, along with unreached output targets by 
renewable generators, can result in power system instability and higher 
operating costs. during 2020, the actual benefit of these forecasting 
tools was demonstrated in australia, where vestas, together with 
its customer, applied hyperlocal forecasting tools across two wind 
farms totalling 198 mw. through vestas’s intervention, it was shown 
that some of the operating costs related to inaccurate forecasts and 
unreached output targets declined more than 25 percent, making the 
advanced forecasting tools worth the investment.  
multibrand
vestas has the world’s broadest and deepest range of multibrand wind 
turbine service offerings, and continues to develop its operations and 
maintenance capabilities. as new brands are added to the list, vestas 
develops its inhouse knowledge and capacity to service an expanding 
portfolio of wind turbines, in accordance with global quality standards 
and safety requirements. this process encompasses the training of 
technicians, documentation, service manuals, scada solutions and 
technical support, all of which is implemented throughout vestas’ 
global service organisation and made available 24/7 across different 
wind turbine brands. 
2020 was characterised by continued investments in the expansion of 
technical capabilities, resulting in five new market entries,  increased 
service scope and longer-term contracts. 
as part of vestas’ continued focus on broadening multibrand capabil-
ities, operations also commenced on a long-term, full-scope contract 
on 410 mw of wind turbines in brazil, adding a new turbine platform, 
alstom eco 122, to the list of technologies for which vestas can pro-
vide service solutions.
furthermore, vestas significantly increased its portfolio of senvion 
turbines, which now extends to almost 800 mw under service across 
eight countries and 20 wind farms, two of which have a contract dura-
tion of 20 years.
in total, more than 3 gw of wind turbines were added to vestas’ multi-
brand operations in 2020, comprising projects in 18 countries from 
seven different oems.
reducing carbon footprint and maximising environmental 
value
vestas’ service business continues to ensure a constant flow of sus-
tainable energy to electricity grids globally. however, it is critical to 
ensure that wind turbine operations are in themselves sustainable. to 
this end, vestas’ service organisation is making great efforts to reduce 
its environmental footprint by transitioning its fleet vehicles from fossil 
fuel sources to sustainably powered electric vehicles. 2020 marked 
the start of this journey, with 127 new vehicles added to the fleet. this 
replacement programme will continue into 2021 and beyond.

financial performance 
mhi vestas offshore wind a/s was founded in 2014 as a 50:50 joint 
venture between mhi and vestas wind systems a/s. vestas acquired 
mhi’s 50 percent share in the joint venture with effect from 14 decem-
ber 2020 (consolidation in the last 17 days of the year). this also 
means that from 2021, vestas’ offshore activities in the new entity 
vestas offshore wind a/s will be fully consolidated into vestas’ finan-
cials.
result for the period
compared to 2019, the joint venture’s stand-alone revenue in 2020 
was eur 1,379m, on par with 2019. the revenue in 2020 was driven 
by deliveries to the northwester 2 project in belgium and two offshore 
wind farms in the netherlands during the year – borssele iii/iv and 
borssele v.
ebit developed negatively from a profit of eur 45m in 2019 to a loss 
of eur 82m in 2020, corresponding to an ebit margin of negative 
5.9 percent. as a consequence, net loss in the joint venture amounted 
to eur 92m (2019: eur 6m profit). this development was primarily 
driven by a change in the assessment regarding the need for warranty 
provisions. excluding this change, the ebit margin of mhi vestas 
offshore wind would have been 4 percent, while net profit would have 
amounted to eur 45m. 
order intake
mhi vestas offshore wind signed four firm orders during 2020, high-
lighting the global expansion of its portfolio: 
 · 95 mw changfang phase 1 project in taiwan
 · 494 mw changfang phase 2 and xidao projects in taiwan
 · 139 mw akita noshiro project in japan
 · 1,075 mw seagreen project in the uk
order backlog
at the end of the year, the order backlog amounted to 3,721 mw, corre-
sponding to eur 4.0bn (included in vestas’ consolidated backlog). 
accounting
from 1 january 2020 to 14 december 2020, the joint venture is 
accounted for using the equity method, and vestas’ share of mhi 
vestas offshore wind’s overall net result for the period is recog-
nised in the income statement as “income from investments in joint 
ventures and associates”, see note 3.5 in the consolidated financial 
statements, page 085.
the recognition of vestas’ share of mhi vestas offshore wind’s 
net result amounted to a negative contribution of eur 46m from 
1 january 2020 to 14 december 2020 (2019: eur 3m positive 
contribution). 
for further information about the investment in mhi vestas off-
shore wind, see note 3.5 to the consolidated financial statements, 
page 085.
global trends in the offshore wind power market
at the end of 2020, the global installed base for offshore wind energy,  
amounted to 25 gw (excluding china) after a record annual growth of 
20 percent in the year.³
over the next five years, the annual installation growth is expected 
to average 25 percent.³  as the industry looks ahead to 2030 and 
beyond, key segments, such as floating offshore wind and renewa-
ble-based hydrogen, look set to provide significant additional volume 
of offshore wind power.
one of the hallmarks of the sector’s maturity is the emergence of major 
oil and gas companies as they seek to expand their renewable portfo-
lios. strategic alliances in the development of offshore wind farms have 
already been formed, and more are anticipated as the industry moves 
beyond the north sea into asia pacific and the americas. as new tech-
nologies such as floating offshore wind and renewable-based hydro-
gen mature towards commercial-scale projects, the infrastructure and 
logistics experience of oil and gas companies is likely to be a key driver 
in both mid- and long-term development.
developments in mhi vestas offshore wind during 
the year
operational resilience and safety
the covid-19 pandemic substantially impacted global supply chains 
in 2020. during the year, mhi vestas offshore wind managed to adapt 
business operations, maintaining a high level of resilience while keep-
ing employees safe.
the company’s operations proved successful, with the installation of 
the 219 mw northwester 2 project in belgium, the world’s first off-
shore wind farm to feature 9.5 mw turbines. mhi vestas offshore wind 
also completed the installation of two offshore wind farms in the neth-
erlands during the year – borssele iii/iv and borssele v. in total, the two 
dutch projects will provide 751 mw of clean power from 79 v164-9.5 
mwtm  offshore wind turbines. 
mhi vestas offshore wind also completed the installation of wind-
float atlantic, a landmark demonstration project 20 km off the coast 
of portugal, and the first floating wind project in continental europe. 
the project features three v164-8.4 mwtm turbines, the largest wind 
turbines ever installed on a floating platform. and in a preview of things 
to come in 2021, the company began installing the five-turbine kincar-
dine floating demonstration project in scotland.
total installation activity in 2020, all of which featured the v164 tur-
bine platform, amounted to 960 mw, bringing the total installed base 
for the v164 platform to 377 turbines and 3,200 mw at year end. 
throughout its operations, mhi vestas offshore wind has been com-
mitted to continuous improvement in occupational health and safety, 
and in providing employees with the training and information they need 
to manage risks in their own work areas. despite continuous installa-
tion activity and covid-19 restrictions, mhi vestas offshore wind has 
kept the rate of lost time injuries at 1.06. 
regional expansion
even as mhi vestas offshore wind saw its global efforts accelerate, 
particularly in asia pacific, the company remained focused on its core 
markets in europe and the uk. these efforts were punctuated by the 
successful installations of northwester 2, borssele iii/iv and v, and 
windfloat atlantic, as well as the firm order signing of seagreen, the

performance
in 2020, vestas installed 
continental europe’s first 
floating offshore wind 
farm, windfloat atlantic, 
off the coast of portugal.
company’s largest project to date. the 1,140 mw project in scotland 
will feature 114 v164-10 mwtm turbines, with installation due to 
begin in late 2021.
several european countries also clarified their ambition in the offshore 
sector, including newcomer poland. despite the fact that poland has 
not yet built an offshore wind farm, the polish government aims to 
have 3.8 gw installed by 2030, with 10 gw of new capacity awarded 
through contract-for-difference auctions by that time. poland also 
aims to reach 28 gw by 2050, which would make poland the largest 
operator of offshore wind power in the baltic sea.
mhi vestas offshore wind saw its plans in asia pacific accelerate 
substantially during the year. with a flurry of local supply chain part-
nerships announced in taiwan, the expansion of the regional office in 
tokyo, and commercial activity ahead of japan’s first offshore wind 
auction, the company established firm roots in the region.
looking to the americas, mhi vestas offshore wind expanded its oper-
ation in boston, as it continued to develop its local supply chain and 
undertook commercial engagements. with increasing volume ambition 
along the east coast of the usa, led by new york, new jersey, and mas-
sachusetts, the company is well positioned for success as it looks to 
bring its product portfolio to the us market.
capturing global opportunities
with worldwide applicability of the v174 turbine, and the introduction 
of new technology, the offshore business begins the new year as an 
integrated part of vestas with a strong technology baseline. synergies 
with onshore wind power to pursue emerging technologies provide an 
array of possibilities, as mhi vestas offshore wind seeks to capture a 
sizable share of growing sector volume.
one of the drivers of the offshore wind power industry in 2020 was the 
growing appetite for locally manufactured products, as governments 
around the world sought to integrate offshore wind technology into 
their energy mix. increased localisation requirements in emerging mar-
kets is both a challenge and an opportunity, requiring a global footprint 
and scale. during the year, mhi vestas offshore wind worked tirelessly 
to develop the industry’s most comprehensive local supply chain in 
taiwan. 
mhi vestas offshore wind also continued to explore synergies wher-
ever possible in manufacturing, logistics, and tools reuse. greater 
industrial efficiency will be essential to achieving the infrastructure 
necessary to deliver on the sector’s exponential volume growth and 
has been one of the driving factors when it comes to integrating the 
offshore business into vestas’ organisation.
continued focus on service capabilities
throughout the year, mhi vestas offshore wind took several steps 
towards creating an adaptable service portfolio that will meet an 
increasing variety of business needs in the next decade. as the 
installed base expands outside northern europe, having an established 
service presence globally will be key to providing efficient operations 
and maintenance solutions for customers. 
with promising new business frontiers such as floating offshore wind, 
renewable hydrogen, and the regional expansion of fixed foundation 
projects, the company’s service offerings look set to make an increased 
contribution to the company’s financial performance in the months and 
years ahead.
sustainability
as mhi vestas offshore wind to a large extent has conducted its own 
sustainability agenda, it has, so far, not been contributing to vestas’ 
overall sustainability strategy. however, sustainability sits quite natu-
rally at the very core of the business. without doubt, the offshore wind 
power industry is an important part of the renewable energy transition, 
and will play an even greater role in the future as the market expands 
globally. 
achieving leadership in offshore wind therefore supports vestas’ vision 
of being the global leader in sustainable energy solutions, and vestas’ 
acquisition at the end of 2020 of mhi’s share in mhi vestas offshore 
wind marks an important step towards the fulfilment of this vision.

leadership, employees, and values
vestas’ purpose is shaped by a passion to make the world a better 
place and to contribute to a sustainable future. the company’s more 
than 29,000 passionate employees are its most important asset and 
the foundation upon which its achievements are built. it is therefore 
essential to constantly develop and sustain a culture that allows every-
one to thrive and reach their full potential.
values and leadership behaviour 
vestas’ four corporate values describe the principles and standards 
of behaviour that shape how employees interact with each other, how 
decisions are made, and how to conduct the day-to-day work. vestas’ 
vision is to become the global leader in sustainable energy solutions. 
to successfully realise this vision, the right type of organisational val-
ues and leadership behaviour are needed. it is vestas’ ambition that 
its values reflect a deeper level of relevance throughout the company, 
that they become embodied by all our employees, and ultimately have 
a sustainable impact on the company culture. to this end, the values 
need to be translated into real and actionable ideals that engage on a 
professional, emotional, and intellectual level. 
the four values are accountability, simplicity, collaboration, and pas-
sion, and they are embedded in all people & culture (hr) processes. 
for example, 50 percent of the performance score in the employee 
review process is linked to an individual’s success in embodying the 
vestas values in their day-to-day work.
employee engagement
vestas constantly monitors employee engagement and satisfaction, 
both annually, in november, via a global employee engagement survey, 
and quarterly in pulse surveys for selected groups and with specific 
focus areas. in 2020, 95 percent of the employees participated in the 
annual engagement survey, and the overall satisfaction and motivation 
score was 73, an improvement of 2 index points compared to 2019. 
the employee net promoter score (enps), measuring how vestas’ 
employees perceive vestas as an employer was 26. 
employee life cycle
vestas uses a holistic life cycle approach to employment, focusing on 
the different phases of the vestas employee journey. from recruitment, 
onboarding, and development through to final departure, vestas pro-
vides opportunities to ensure employees are engaged, respected, and 
recognised at all times.
in 2020, vestas implemented a new people & culture strategy and 
organisational structure to support the different aspects of the 
employee life cycle in the best way. the restructuring reflects the 
ambition to have an organisation that embodies the corporate value of 
simplicity and limits vertical layers, an ambition that runs through all 
parts of the company and could also be seen in 2020 by several organ-
isational restructurings as well as in the current activities of integrating 
the offshore segment into the business.
in the strategy process, three key focus areas were identified for 
2020: unlocking vestas’ employee value proposition, increasing 
the number of women in leadership positions, and building a strong 
succession pipeline. employees are essential to the realisation of the 
company’s mid-term priority and vision. vestas therefore works hard 
to ensure it builds the right teams of people and competes for talent 
in all areas. to this end, investments in workforce diversity and the 
vestas employer brand are vital to future success. vestas also needs 
to develop a strong internal talent pipeline to be able to fill senior and 
key positions going forward. 
unlocking vestas’ employee value proposition
vestas aims to be the employer of choice, and to attract, develop, and 
retain the best people, in order to become the global leader in sustain-
able energy solutions. by unlocking the full potential of the vestas pur-
pose and brand via an employee value proposition, the company can 
become a true talent leader and driving force in the energy transition. 
nurturing excellence, focus, and collaboration internally will be key to 
achieving these goals.
in 2020, vestas initiated the process of defining the company’s 
employee value proposition by collecting and comparing data from 
interviews with managers, employees, candidates, and competitors, 
followed by dedicated focus groups and workshops. this led to the 
creation of new initiatives that will be implemented in 2021, and the 
identification of target groups for future branding campaigns.
women in leadership positions
to leverage the benefits of diverse leadership, in 2020 vestas focused 
on increasing the representation of women in senior positions. under 
the new vestas sustainability strategy, sustainability in everything we 
do, which was initiated in 2020, the company has set specific targets 
for women in leadership, aiming to reach 25 percent representation by 
2025 and 30 percent by 2030. 
during the year, vestas focused on specific recruitment areas with a 
view to increasing gender diversity and breaking the curve of historical 
challenges in attracting and hiring women. the company also invested 
in software to eliminate bias in job postings, while recruitment teams 
received training in unconscious bias and worked to increase the share 
of female applicants being presented to hiring managers. in addition, 
women were selected as a specific subgroup within the employee value 
proposition development programme. 
to ensure the retention of female employees, vestas enhanced the 
standardised exit process globally, with a key focus on minorities gen-
erally and women specifically. efforts will continue in future years to 
identify barriers to career progression at vestas for women and other 
minority groups. read more about vestas’ initiatives to promote diver-
sity and inclusion in the vestas sustainability report, pages 026-029. 
succession pipeline
vestas recognises that a high internal fill rate for leadership and 
key technical positions will lead to better business performance. 
therefore, in 2020 the company initiated efforts to ensure a strong 
succession pipeline to futureproof the business and expected growth. 
vestas enhanced planning globally to improve the understanding 
of its current talent landscape, and initiated a self-led development 
concept among employees. with increased available data, vestas can 
now analyse areas of need and plan specific actions to address iden-
tified talent gaps. 
 “ vestas’ employees are the most important 
building block of the company and therefore it 
is essential to constantly develop and sustain a 
culture that allows everyone to thrive and reach 
their full potential.”

driving the energy transition 
through diversity and inclusion
at vestas, we believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is vital for accelerating the green 
energy transition globally. we know our differences make us stronger, more innovative, and 
better equipped to address the challenges of the future. in 2020, we continued our efforts 
to create an environment that actively embraces diversity and inclusion in all areas.
i
nclusion means everyone feels 
valued and heard, and only 
through an inclusive culture will 
our people thrive and perform at 
their best. 
as anne engemann rasmussen, head of 
global reward in denmark, explains: “we 
prioritise diversity & inclusion (d&i) because 
in addition to being the right thing to do, it 
is a prerequisite for remaining competitive 
and successful. we know that collaboration 
between individuals with diverse skills and 
backgrounds will ensure the most innovative, 
highest-quality solutions. in vestas, we believe 
that a diverse and inclusive workforce is vital 
for accelerating the green energy transition 
globally. we know that our differences make us 
stronger, more innovative, and better equipped 
to address the challenges of the future.”
improving gender parity in leadership
d&i is a vital component of our strategic 
efforts to achieve sustainability in everything 
we do. as part of the launch of the new vestas 
sustainability strategy in early 2020, we 
committed to targets for female representa-
tion in leadership positions, aiming to reach 
25 percent representation by 2025 and 30 
percent by 2030. as first steps on this journey, 
we worked hard during the year to ensure more 
diverse candidates by removing bias from 
 “ leading people much older than me and having much 
younger colleagues on the same team has been hugely 
valuable, especially in terms of exchanging knowledge  
and life experiences.”

always looking for the best person for a posi-
tion. my last hired leader, for example, was a 
woman with a part-time working contract. she 
is doing a great job and working as efficiently 
as many other leaders in fulltime positions.”
while gender diversity is a fair and measur-
able indicator of diversity generally, our d&i 
strategy also prioritises parameters beyond 
gender. therefore, we also measure progress 
on nationality and age as we strive to increase 
our focus on diversity.
“i am a female leader with an economics back-
ground in a predominantly male area,” says 
else bylling møller, sr. director service opera-
tions & business, northern & central europe. 
“the fact that i am not the traditional profile for 
my job drives me to encourage diversity within 
my team. when compiling my leadership team, 
i don’t just look for great engineers, i look for 
people who can drive change, think differently, 
and maintain a high customer focus. i generally 
spend a lot of time on recruitment, paying 
careful attention to what is already present in 
the team, and which personality or profile is 
missing.”
according to breno comenalli diogo, production 
shift team lead, assembly & towers produc-
tion, brazil, diverse age ranges help to enrich 
and enhance team dynamics. “leading people 
much older than me and having much younger 
colleagues on the same team has been hugely 
valuable, especially in terms of exchanging 
knowledge and life experiences,” says breno. 
“this has made me a more curious professional, 
more open to different points of view, and more 
willing to listen. the female presence on our fac-
tory floor inspires many colleagues to overcome 
the challenges they face. the women working 
here are dedicated and careful, they bring 
lightness to the environment, while pushing 
colleagues to excel by following their example 
of continuous dedication.” 
we are also proud to represent more than 100 
nationalities across vestas, working collabo-
ratively to achieve our vision of becoming the 
global leader in sustainable energy solutions. 
“having worked in this cultural-diversified 
environment for 10 years, i have witnessed 
and enjoyed how new opportunities can be 
created to improve our company day by day.” 
hao li, lead specialist, regional procurement, 
china. 
“we are proud to be part of the lake turkana 
service team at vestas eastern africa”, says 
team member benson lkumsika leakono, 
“vestas allows us to play a small part in our 
country going green, which will make kenya a 
good place for future generations.”
empowering the energy industry
raising standards in d&i beyond vestas 
to the wider industry is also a high priority 
within our strategy. our colleagues in vestas 
america, for example, have been working 
closely with women of renewable indus-
tries and sustainable energy (wrise), and 
recently sponsored industry-wide develop-
ment opportunities on diversity, equality, 
and inclusion. 
“the energy industry is at a pivotal point,” says 
karen carlson, team lead, projects and plan-
ning, p&c americas. “we achieve sustainability 
not only through our products, but through our 
people. energy touches the lives of everyone 
and because of that, we need to work to ensure 
that energy companies represent the commu-
nities they serve. i’m extremely proud to work 
in an industry that has the capacity to impact 
the energy transition and support communi-
ties across the globe.”
our journey on diversity and inclusion has 
only just begun. together, we will keep mov-
ing forward and become truly sustainable in 
everything we do. ▪
the recruitment process. we also conducted 
an external pay audit in an effort to improve 
pay equity, acknowledging this is a key part of 
ensuring equal opportunities.
“representing my gender has been an exciting 
journey throughout my 17 years at vestas,” 
says monika tobisiak, sr. service director for 
poland, benelux, south africa & kenya. “being 
a female leader among mostly male peers 
made me increasingly aware of the female 
perspectives within my teams, and their con-
tribution to increased efficiency and creativity. 
i’m also driven to support female employees 
on their journey to become great leaders. i’m 
very happy to observe how the whole business 
is changing and evolving to welcome more 
women into managerial positions.” 
nurturing diversity and inclusion 
across the employee life cycle 
vestas is committed to supporting diversity 
and inclusion throughout the whole employee 
life cycle. inclusive leadership training and 
unconscious bias training will be a mandatory 
part of all leadership development by 2021. 
anne lenders, senior service manager in 
germany north-west, reflects this progres-
sive ethos in her approach to new hires: “i am 
 “ we prioritise diversity & inclu-
sion because in addi tion to 
being the right thing to do, it 
is a prerequisite for remaining 
competitive and successful.”

vestas’ vision is to become the global leader in sustainable energy 
solutions. as part of this vision, the company’s goal is to lead the tran-
sition to a world powered by sustainable energy. this goal commits 
vestas to taking a leading role in driving electrification and decarbon-
isation beyond the power sector. it also involves teaming up with sus-
tainability leaders to drive change and support vestas’ partners in their 
journey to becoming more sustainable.
to achieve these ambitions, it is essential for the company to build 
strong foundations through its organisational values. vestas therefore 
places increasing emphasis on leadership and good corporate gov-
ernance to anchor and embed these values, which are: accountability, 
collaboration, simplicity, and passion. underpinning the efforts the 
company needs to make, and guiding the actions its management and 
employees need to take, these values are integral to vestas’ overall 
delivery and performance.
in striving to achieve its vision, vestas benefits its customers, share-
holders, and the planet.
corporate governance principles 
to the board, corporate governance is an ongoing process which 
supports value creation and accountable management, thereby con-
tributing to the company’s long-term success. the board believes that 
having an open and transparent corporate governance structure sup-
ports the company in being managed and monitored in a responsible 
manner, with a high focus on value creation. in addition, having clear 
governance structures in place enables the provision and publication of 
timely, reliable, accurate, and up-to-date information. this in turn builds 
confidence among investors, business partners, financial markets, cus-
tomers, employees, and the public in general. 
vestas operates in a market where renewables generally, and wind 
power specifically, have been designated critical infrastructure. within 
this market, which is characterised by high demand, changing mecha-
nisms, and ongoing consolidation, clear and well-considered manage-
ment is especially important. 
in 2020, vestas undertook an evaluation of its governance guidelines 
and processes. the evaluation included a review of the company’s busi-
ness model, strategy, goals, organisation, capital position, stakeholder 
relations, internal controls, and risks. for more information on financial 
reporting risks and control activities, see vestas’ statutory report on 
corporate governance 2020, page 007. 
sustainability governance 
solid governance structures are the backbone of vestas’ sustainability 
programmes and activities, and are highlighted in the company’s new 
sustainability strategy, sustainability in everything we do.
vestas’ sustainability governance structures include the sustainability 
strategy office, a dedicated sustainability committee, executive manage-
ment, and the board. the sustainability committee prioritises, oversees, 
and coordinates cross-functional sustainability initiatives across the entire 
organisation. it also ensures that the company conforms with and lives up 
to its responsibilities as a signatory to the un global compact. 
demonstrating its commitment to the highest standards of health, 
safety and the environment, vestas’ operations are also built on the 
global certificates iso 9001 for quality, iso 14001 for environment, 
and ohsas 18001 for health and safety.
vestas’ commitments are reflected in vestas’ code of conduct and 
supporting policies, guidelines, and procedures. they are also rooted, 
along with governance structures and actions, in vestas’ organisa-
tional values. these values are essential to retaining customers’ trust 
and delivering solutions and services without compromising ethical 
judgement. 
for more information, see the vestas sustainability report 2020, 
pages 042-043.
business ethics and human rights 
vestas remains committed to the principles of responsible business 
conduct and has been a signatory to the un global compact since 
2009. as a global company, vestas aligns its strategies and operations 
with universal principles on human rights, labour, the environment, and 
anti-corruption.
vestas is dedicated to the ten principles of the un global compact, 
which are an integral part of its sustainability agenda and the vestas 
management system. the latest update on how vestas implements 
the ten principles into practice is available in the vestas sustaina-
bility report 2020, with an overview document on vestas’ corporate 
website. 
human rights approach 
vestas is committed to respecting human rights throughout its organ-
isation and operations. for the past decade, vestas has worked to 
develop and promote a unique approach to respecting human rights, 
anchored in its due diligence framework. the approach focuses on 
working closely with all stakeholders involved in any given wind project, 
identifying risks at an early stage to ensure the project can earn and 
maintain a social license to operate.
in september 2020, vestas took its approach to corporate social respon-
sibility (csr) and human rights to a new level. the company launched a 
new and strengthened csr approach, offering a blueprint for navigating 
business-related human rights in connection with the development of 
wind energy projects. the approach places a special emphasis on essen-
tial collaboration with suppliers, customers, local communities, and 
other stakeholders. 
ethicsline, whistle-blower mechanism 
ethicsline is vestas’ whistle-blower mechanism. it facilitates the 
reporting of violations of the vestas code of conduct, applicable laws, 
and vestas’ policies and procedures. since 2007, ethicsline has 
helped to ensure that such violations are always brought forward and 
dealt with appropriately.

tax governance
at vestas, tax governance means having clear controls and processes 
within the corporate governance framework to support tax decision 
making. the purpose of the vestas group tax policy is to outline the 
company’s general approach to tax issues, including governance, struc-
turing, and risk management. the policy applies to all decisions that 
directly or indirectly affect the reporting and/or payment of taxes, not-
withstanding the nature of the tax, as long as it falls or could fall under 
the liability of any vestas company. 
vestas’ tax practice is governed by a global headquarter function. this 
function outlines the overall tax policy and strategy, together with 
global controlling functions and subject matter experts providing sup-
port to local management. local tax compliance and tax filing is the 
responsibility of local management, who seek guidance from the global 
policy and available guidelines. 
in support of the company’s approach to tax, the vestas code of conduct 
helps to ensure integrity and compliance in all corporate decisions. 
vestas’ tax policy was updated in 2020, and makes a clear link with 
sustainable development and responsible tax practices. the policy is 
available at the corporate website, while additional information can be 
found in the vestas sustainability report 2020.
governance structure
a fundamental element of vestas wind systems a/s’ corporate gov-
ernance system is its two-tier management structure. this structure 
provides a clear, transparent, and effective separation between the 
responsibilities of the board and executive management, and between 
approach to the sdgs
vestas is committed to supporting the un 
sustainable development goals (sdgs). the 
sdgs are integrated into vestas’ sustaina-
bility approach, which allows it to identify 
the goals where vestas can add most value. 
out of the 17 sdgs, vestas has identified 
six which support development for vestas, 
its stakeholders, and the many communities 
where vestas plays a role. for more informa-
tion, see the vestas sustainability report 
2020, pages 046-047.
human rights journey
 “ the board is continuously vigilant of the 
guidelines and processes that are in place 
for the running of vestas. this ensures that 
– at any given time – management has the 
necessary framework to be able to conduct 
business in the spirit of vestas’ values: 
accountability, collaboration, simplicity, and 
passion.”

governance
their tasks in connection with the management of the company’s affairs. 
documents relating to policies, regulations, and governing principles, to 
which vestas adheres, are available at the corporate website. 
shareholders 
vestas’ shareholders have ultimate authority over the company. 
they exercise their rights of co-administration and supervision 
at general meetings, which usually take place within the first four 
months of the business year. all shareholders are, with a few formal 
requirements, entitled to submit proposals, attend, vote, and speak 
at general meetings.
in 2020, the annual general meeting took place in april. the minutes 
of the meeting and an overview of the votes cast are available at the 
corporate website. 
shareholder rights 
the right of a shareholder to attend a general meeting is determined 
by the holding of shares at the record date. shareholders who wish to 
attend a general meeting must notify vestas no later than three days 
before the meeting in question. 
vestas has a single class of shares, and no shares carry any special rights. 
each share carries one vote. proposals put to the vote are adopted by a 
simple majority of votes, unless the danish companies act or articles of 
association prescribe special rules regarding the adoption. amendments 
to the articles of association, dissolution, demerger, and merger, which 
under danish law must be passed by the general meeting, can only be 
passed by a majority of no less than two-thirds of all votes cast, and no 
less than two-thirds of the voting capital represented at the general meet-
ing, unless otherwise prescribed by the danish companies act. 
the company’s auditor
each year, vestas’ annual report is audited by an independent external 
audit firm appointed annually by the shareholders at the annual gen-
eral meeting. retiring auditors are eligible for re-election. the auditor is 
obligated to act in the interest of the shareholders, as well as the pub-
lic. the board maintains a regular dialogue with the auditor. however, it 
is the responsibility of the audit committee to make arrangements for 
the necessary exchange of information.
in 2020, the external auditor participated in one meeting with the 
board and in four meetings with the audit committee. for the inde-
pendent auditor’s report and the independent assurance report on the 
sustainability key figures 2020, see page 129 and 132, respectively.
in april 2020, the annual general meeting re-elected pricewater-
housecoopers as vestas’ external auditor for the financial year 2020. 
policy for audit and non-audit services 
the independence of the company’s auditor is a key focus area within 
corporate governance. vestas’ auditor may be used, within certain 
parameters, for certain non-audit services, and may often be the pref-
erable choice due to business knowledge, confidentiality, and cost 
considerations.
vestas has a policy for non-audit services, ensuring that the additional 
services do not impair the auditor’s independence or objectivity. the 
audit committee is responsible for the development and maintenance 
of this policy. 
during 2020, audit and non-audit services provided by vestas’ auditor 
globally totalled eur 4m. for more details about the audit fee, see note 
6.1 in the consolidated financial statements on page 108. once a year, the 
audit committee assesses the need for an internal audit function; in 2020, 
the committee found it was not necessary to establish such a function.
board of directors
the board is responsible for the overall and strategic management 
of the company’s affairs, and must ensure proper organisation of the 
company’s business in accordance with the articles of association and 
applicable law.
the board’s most important duties are, among others: appointing the 
executive management; laying down guidelines for and exercising 
control of the work performed by executive management; ensuring 
responsible organisation of the company’s business; defining the com-
pany’s business concept and strategy; ensuring satisfactory financial 
organisation and reporting; ensuring the necessary procedures for risk 
management and internal controls; and ensuring that an adequate cap-
ital contingency programme is in place at all times. 
in cooperation with executive management, the board establishes 
and approves overall policies, procedures, and controls in key areas, 
not least in relation to financial reporting. this requires a well-defined 
organisational structure, unambiguous reporting lines, authorisation 
and certification procedures, and adequate segregation of duties. 
nomination and diversity 
board members elected by the general meeting may be recommended 
for election by the shareholders or by the board. they serve for a 
one-year term and may be re-elected. the board members elected by 
employees serve for a four-year term. 
when proposing candidates for board membership, the board seeks to 
ensure that it is possible for the general meeting to elect a board that 
has the right attitude, competences, and experience. the board should:
 · be able to act independently of special interests;
 · represent a balance between continuity and renewal;
 · match the company's situation; 
 · demonstrate knowledge of the industry and the business and 
financial competencies necessary to ensure that the board can 
perform its duties in the best way possible; and
 · reflect the competencies and experience required in order to manage 
a company with shares registered for trade on a stock exchange and 
fulfil its obligations as a listed company.  
the board continuously works to increase board membership diversity. 
when proposing new candidates, it pursues the goal of diversity in gen-
der, nationality, and age. however, this goal must not compromise the 
other recruitment criteria. for vestas’ reporting on underrepresented 
gender, see the vestas sustainability report 2020, page 026.
in april 2020, the annual general meeting re-elected bert nordberg, 
bruce grant, carsten bjerg, eva berneke, helle thorning-schmidt, 
and lars josefsson as members of the board. furthermore, the board 
recommended the election of anders runevad to deepen the board’s 
knowledge of the renewable energy industry, and karl-henrik sund-
ström to strengthen its expertise in financial accounting and financial 
issues. given his experience in finance, karl-henrik sundström was also 
eligible to be appointed chairman of the audit committee. the two can-
didates were duly elected as new members. 
after the annual general meeting, the board held a statutory board 
meeting. at the meeting, bert nordberg was re-elected as chairman of 
the board, and lars josefsson was re-elected as deputy chairman of 
the board. on 30 april 2020, employee representative peter lindholst 
stepped down from the board. he was replaced by pia kirk jensen, who 
had up until then served as an alternate.
board committees 
the board has established three committees: an audit committee, a tech-
nology & manufacturing committee, and a nomination & compensation 
committee. all members of these committees are elected by the board 
from among its members. information about the committees’ members 
and terms of reference (charter), as well as an overview of the committees’ 
most important activities, are available at the corporate website. 
the purpose of these board committees is to prepare decisions 
and recommendations for consideration and approval by the entire 
board. the committees are not authorised to make independent 
decisions; instead, they report and make recommendations to the 
board. 
for an overview of board members, meetings, independence, and par-
ticipation in 2020, see the table below. 
assessment of the work performed by the board 
once a year, the board evaluates its working methods, the results of 
its work, and the skills of its members, including whether each board 
member participates actively in board discussions and contributes with 
independent judgement. 
in october and november 2020, the three board committees eval-
uated their performance for 2020. the evaluations were conducted 
as an open dialogue among committee members and facilitated

the board also conducted a self-assessment in november 2020, 
following the same procedure. the self-assessment revealed a good 
collaboration in the board and between the board and executive 
management as well as satisfaction with the conduction of the 
meetings, meeting materials, and the engagement from the board 
members. the results of the assessments are used by the nomina-
tion & compensation committee when they nominate members to 
the board and its committees. 
executive management
executive management is responsible for overall day-to-day manage-
ment of the company, observing the guidelines and recommendations 
issued by the board, and ensuring timely reporting and provision 
of information to the board and the company’s shareholders and 
stakeholders. furthermore, executive management is responsible for 
presenting proposals for the company’s overall objectives, strategies, 
and action plans. it also makes proposals for the overall operating, 
investment, financing, and liquidity budgets to the board, and monitors 
compliance with relevant legislation and other financial reporting regu-
lations and provisions. 
executive management strives to be visible globally to all vestas’ 
stakeholders – customers, shareholders, partners and suppliers, lead-
ers, and colleagues – demonstrating the company’s values and con-
veying its vision and strategy. executive management gathers at least 
once a month and often more frequently.
composition of executive management
the executive management of vestas wind systems a/s is appointed 
by the board. the board also appoints a chief executive officer who 
manages the day-to-day work of executive management. moreover, the 
board allocates roles and responsibilities among the members of exec-
utive management and determines their remuneration.
as of 10 january 2020, kerstin knapp entered the new position 
as executive vice president of people & culture (chief people & 
culture officer) and member of executive management, reem-
phasising the importance of vestas employees as the company’s 
strongest asset.
on 12 may 2020, anders nielsen was appointed executive vice pres-
ident of power solutions (chief technology officer) and member of 
executive management. his remit will be to implement and accelerate 
modularisation and modular product development across the entire 
vestas value chain. anders nielsen came with more than 30 years of 
industrial experience from the automotive industry, including executive 
roles, and has a proven track record within innovation, modularisation, 
technology partnerships, and collaboration. he took over from anders 
vedel, who continued as chief scientific advisor, serving as executive 
advisor to the group president & ceo. he also advises the boards of 
both vestas wind systems a/s and vestas offshore wind a/s, lever-
aging his unique experience in technology, science, and renewables.  
at the same time, tommy rahbek nielsen, who had served as interim 
executive vice president of manufacturing and global procurement 
(chief operating officer) since 1 january 2020, was announced as the 
permanent executive vice president of manufacturing & global pro-
curement. together, they will take vestas’ technology and manufactur-
ing to a higher level, and leverage vestas’ industry-leading technology 
investments beyond past performance.
as of 31 december 2020, executive management consisted of seven 
members, of which the ceo and cfo are registered as executives with 
the danish business authority.

vestas’ operating model
ducting an annual evaluation of the contributions and performance 
of executive management, as individual members and as a collective 
body. they also evaluate the cooperation between the board and exec-
utive management. the assessment conducted in 2020 revealed good 
collaboration between the board and executive management. 
vestas’ operating model 
vestas’ organisation is structured around six functional areas, repre-
senting all key disciplines of the company and all employees, as follows:
 · finance, headed by marika fredriksson (cfo)
 · technology, headed by anders nielsen (cto) 
 · manufacturing & global procurement, headed by tommy rahbek 
nielsen (coo)
 · sales, headed by juan araluce (cso sales)
 · service, headed by christian venderby (cso service)
 · people & culture, headed by kerstin knapp (cpco)
these functional areas are headed by members of executive manage-
ment, who ensure vestas’ all-round operational and organisational per-
formance. as a structurally lean organisation, vestas has offices in more 
than 30 countries, and five strong regional sales business units: north-
ern & central europe, americas, mediterranean, asia pacific, and china. 
the operating model has two dimensions: 
 · applying a regional focus to implementing and living vestas’ strategy 
 · securing global alignment and best practices to be shared and 
implemented, with a view to achieving ‘one enterprise’ thinking across 
the global functions.
transactions with related parties 
a related party transaction is defined as any transaction, direct or 
indirect, between vestas or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates 
and a related party. according to vestas’ policy for transactions with 
related parties, a related party transaction having a value of more 
than the lowest of 10 percent of vestas’ total assets, and 25 percent 
of vestas operating profit/loss, shall be published at the corporate 
website. 
for 2020, the threshold corresponds to a value of eur 250m. during 
the year, there were no significant transactions between vestas and 
members of the board or executive management, their close family 
members, or companies in which these persons have significant influ-
ence. in 2020, vestas had no significant transactions with its associ-
ates or joint ventures.
members of executive management from left: anders nielsen (cto), juan araluce (cso, sales), kerstin knapp (cpco), henrik andersen (ceo), marika fredriksson (cfo), tommy

risk management
risk management at vestas provides a transparent portfolio view on 
vestas’ strategic and operational risk position and direction, with the 
aim of assessing and adjusting the company’s risk exposure. 
being a multinational company and global leader in wind power, vestas 
is exposed to a variety of risks in its daily business. in order for vestas to 
protect and create shareholder value and achieve its strategic objectives, 
it needs to manage the broad spectrum of risks its faces, which include 
operational risks relating to the design and manufacture of wind turbines, 
execution risks linked to the transportation, installation, and servicing of 
wind turbines, and risks of a macroeconomic and regulatory nature. vestas 
strives to ensure that such risks are understood, monitored, and managed, 
with a view to minimising any negative impact on the realisation of the 
company’s strategic and financial ambitions. 
risk management is an integral part of the decision-making process at 
vestas, and is supported by the corporate enterprise risk management 
(erm) framework. the erm framework is a holistic, consistent, and 
continuous approach to managing vestas’ risk exposure, covering risks 
across the entire organisation. 
it is important to note that erm is not only about identifying, evaluat-
ing, and managing individual risks, but is also about communication 
and establishing the necessary foundation for business decisions. 
governance 
at vestas, risk management is the responsibility of everyone. all parts 
of the organisation engage with risk management on a daily opera-
tional basis. vestas works systematically with risks and follows a plan 
for the year, which is known as ‘the erm annual wheel’. according to this 
plan, each region, corporate function and selected support functions 
identify, assess, prioritise, and report on relevant risks on a quarterly 
basis in line with the erm framework. 
the assessment of risks is carried out using vestas’ group risk criteria 
based on probability and impact as illustrated in the risk matrix on page 
061. the potential impact can be either financial and/or non-financial 
parameters – i.e. reputational, environmental, regulatory or safety. con-
ceptually, risks may be considered enterprise risks if mapped in upper 
areas of the risk matrix and the vestas’ group risk criteria is thereby 
determining prioritisation of key enterprise risks. 
the identified risks are mapped as either being short-term, medi-
um-term, or of a strategic nature, as follows:
 · short-term risks typically have financial impact within the current year 
and are therefore often related to execution and single events.
 · medium-term risks have a time horizon of one-to-three years, and are 
often characterised as emerging risks.
 · strategic risks are linked to the execution of vestas’ strategy and are 
defined as future uncertainties – internal as well as external – that 
have the potential to significantly impact vestas’ ability to achieve its 
long-term vision. 
all risks are consolidated by global risk management and signed off 
by relevant risk owners throughout the organisation. each quarter, key 
risks are presented and discussed by the risk committee, including 
the status and exposure of those risks, in order to support decisions 
on mitigating actions. the risk committee currently consists of all 
members of executive management, with the exception of the group 
president & ceo, and is chaired by the executive vice president & cfo. 
twice a year, the risks are reported to the audit committee as well as 
the board of directors (the board). 
the illustration above of the erm annual wheel shows the frequency of the 
risk committee meetings and higher-level reporting on erm at vestas. the 
sequence of the annual wheel is repeated throughout the organisation.
in accordance with the annual wheel, vestas conducted a strategic risk 
review in the third quarter of 2020, engaging all parts of the organisa-
tion. the strategic risk review serves several purposes, including manag-
ing strategic risks through identification, assessment, and consolidation. 
it also supports mitigation through integration into the strategy process, 
and promotes awareness among executive management and the board.
climate-related risks and opportunities are addressed as an integral 
part of the daily business as they are directly linked to the company’s 
business model and strategy. vestas has not defined any climate-related 
risks among its principal risks, however such risks are continuously mon-
itored and evaluated by the risk committee, the audit committee, and 
the board. the most significant sustainability risks, including climate-re-
lated risks, are addressed in the vestas sustainability report 2020. 
financial risks, including risks related to currency, interest rates, tax, 
credit, and commodity exposures, are addressed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, see an overview on page 064.

operating in complex markets 
description
several of the markets, in which vestas is 
operating and exploring business opportuni-
ties, have complex characteristics differing 
from the more mature markets in europe and 
the usa. some of the main risk areas to be 
understood and addressed are:
 · security in relation to employees and 
subcontractors
 · impacts on local communities near 
construction sites
 · corruption in the country or sector
 · sanctions and export control according to 
international law
 · protection of intellectual property rights
impact
the adverse impacts relating to risks in 
complex markets are many and different. 
adverse reputational impacts or legal impli-
cations may occur if risks are not mitigated.
risks relating to intellectual property 
rights may impact competitiveness, lead to 
adverse claims, or limit freedom to operate.
mitigation
to prevent and mitigate potential risks 
within these areas, vestas uses a stage 
gate-based process to systematically 
evaluate and adapt the product and project 
offering during contracting, construction, 
and servicing. there is an increased focus on 
identifying risks of a non-technical nature 
in complex markets, with mitigations iden-
tified and managed via vestas’ social due 
diligence process. for more information, 
see the vestas sustainability report 2020, 
page 040.
trade barriers
description
local content requirements and other trade 
protectionist measures, such as the impo-
sition of tariffs and duties on traded goods 
and commodities, continued to be barriers 
to trade on a global level in 2020. this situ-
ation is expected to continue in the coming 
years. vestas has a global supply chain and 
is naturally not immune to the increase in 
trade barriers and trade defence instru-
ments in its largest markets.
impact
excessively strict local content require-
ments and rules, together with the increas-
ing imposition of tariffs and duties, lead 
to cost increases on sourced material and 
components, which impacts final product 
price. these circumstances also decrease 
flexibility in the supply chain and bring more 
uncertainty to supply chain planning. this 
can result in higher costs for wind turbine 
manufacturing, and could lead to higher cost 
of energy for societies.
mitigation
vestas continuously monitors and works to 
minimise the impact of existing and potential 
local content rules and trade tariffs and duties. 
it does this by leveraging its global footprint, 
buying power and procurement options, as 
well as ensuring flexibility in the value chain. 
success in this area has been achieved 
through close collaboration with suppliers, and 
vestas will continue its efforts to find and opti-
mise various avenues to mitigate the impact of 
trade restrictions going forward.
execution of high volumes
description
vestas manufactures, delivers, and installs signif-
icant volumes of wind turbines. a significant pro-
portion of deliveries are typically concentrated in 
the second half of the year. some of the main risks 
here are linked to the ramp-up of manufacturing 
internally at vestas, as well as with vestas’ vendors. 
these risks relate to constraints on the sourcing 
of materials, components, and transportation, as 
well as on installation equipment and personnel. in 
the fourth quarter in particular, weather conditions 
in the northern hemisphere can impact vestas’ 
ability to execute commitments on time.
impact
financial impact expressed as costs related 
to liquidated damages and budget overrun 
is an evident potential impact. utilisation 
of vestas’ manufacturing footprint and the 
flexibility it provides may expose vestas 
to exchange rate fluctuations. maintaining 
quality levels in a high-volume scenario is a 
challenge and poses a risk to the company.
mitigation
in the contracting phase, vestas works to 
ensure a certain flexibility in delivery sched-
ules to mitigate delay impacts on its revenue 
stream. vestas has a continuous high inter-
nal focus on execution in every part of the 
organisation and value chain.
main risks
the five key risks for vestas identified in 2020,  
based on their potential impact and probability, are:
 · operating in complex markets,
 · trade barriers, 
 · execution of high volumes,
 · cyber risks, and
 · increased complexity leading to faster product cycles 
and challenged quality.
 
all five risks are identified as placed in the upper, right 
corner of the risk matrix. a description of each risk, its 
impact, and the current mitigation actions follows below.

cyber risks
description
vestas’ dependence on its commercial, 
technical, and operational it infrastructure is 
significant and hence, vestas is exposed to 
potential loss or harm relating to this.
impact
risks include inability to meet contractual 
obligations, brand damage and theft of 
intellectual property or personal data. these 
risks could result in monetary losses in the 
form of lost business opportunities, con-
tractual fines or penalties from authorities. 
losses can also be caused by malicious 
hacking activities, unintentional human 
error, and system failures.
mitigation
with a focus on heightening and strength-
ening the cyber security position at vestas, 
a cross-organisational cyber security pro-
gramme has been designed. elements of the 
programme include developing systematic 
methods to address exposure, and contin-
uously improving the technical ability to 
protect against, detect, and respond to any 
attempts to penetrate vestas’ commercial, 
technical, or operational it infrastructure.
these objectives are well under way, and 
with the hiring in 2020 of a chief infor-
mation security officer to lead the cyber 
security programme, vestas has taken 
appropriate steps to further strengthen its 
performance in this area.
increased complexity leading to faster product cycles and challenged quality
description
the competitive landscape has in the past 
years driven wind turbine manufacturers 
towards the fast-paced development of 
new technology. oems are now offering 
new technologies at an earlier stage in the 
design and market phases, and this puts 
new demands on the organisation through-
out the value chain. the rapid pace of inno-
vation has allowed a rapid reduction in the 
levelised cost of electricity (lcoe) for wind 
power, but has forced oems to take more 
technical risk on the products being brought 
to market. as a result, products are being 
installed and commissioned with a lower 
level of maturity than in the past, which has 
led to increased rework and repairs as the 
quality on vestas’ turbines has not lived up 
to usual standards.
impact
this creates financial and reputational risk 
for vestas in the form of a less mature cost 
position during production ramp-up, leading 
to reduced contribution margins and likely 
reduced quality in the effort to achieve full 
production rate. this in turn results in pro-
visions relating to the cost of poor quality. 
delays in product certification can also occur 
as a result of a shorter product development 
cycle, and this can lead to liquidated dam-
ages (lds) when impacting the customer 
commercial operations date (cod).
mitigation
vestas is addressing existing and potential 
future chal lenges across the value chain and 
develops a plan for how to overcome these. 
by finding, analysing, and addressing the 
root causes and ensur ing focus on successful 
handovers in the value chain, vestas will be 
bet ter at getting things right the first time 
by adhering to processes and fast identify, 
correct, and learn from mistakes when they 
occur. it has been vestas’ strategy to achieve 
shorter design and product introduction 
cycles through the modular wind turbine 
platform, enventus™. this platform enables 
a large variety of product configurations 
while re-using as many components as 
possible. it requires the adoption of robust 
design principles and virtual testing tools.
as modularisation evolves, vestas expects 
to expand its product application range 
while reducing the number of active parts.
covid-19
the outbreak of covid-19 left its mark on the vestas risk manage-
ment landscape in 2020. presenting additional challenges and risks to 
vestas’ operations and revenue streams, the pandemic and its conse-
quences are expected to continue in 2021.
from the beginning of 2020 and throughout the year, vestas took 
specific measures to ensure the health and safety of its employees 
globally. such measures were the primary focus of vestas’ corporate 
crisis management team.
the rapid spread of the virus put an increasing pressure on the whole 
value chain. however, through the continuous guidance and leadership 
provided by the corporate crisis management team, as well as local 
crisis management teams, vestas achieved a high level of resilience. as 
a result, the vestas supply chain remained operational at a high level, 
ensuring a constant flow of production and delivery in some of the 
world’s worst affected regions.

1.1 segment information
reportable segments
vestas operates in the two business segments, power solutions and service within both the onshore and the offshore market .
segments
power solutions
service
primary activity
the power solutions segment contains sale of wind 
power plants, wind turbines, development sites, etc. 
the service segment contains sale of service 
contracts, spare parts and related activities.
vestas accounting policies
the reportable segments are determined based on vestas’ management 
structures and the consequent reporting to the chief operating decision 
maker (codm), which is defined as the executive management. following 
the acquisition of mhi vestas offshore wind a/s on 14 december 2020, a 
new offshore operating segment has been established. vestas’ reportable 
segment ‘power solutions’ includes respectively onshore and offshore 
operating segments. the onshore and offshore activities are combined in one 
reportable segment, as the nature of the businesses and the financial impact 
from the activities are similar in respect of product categories, production, 
distribution and customers. in addition, the long-term ebit margins and 
investment requirements relatively to revenue are expected at the same level.
the total external revenue is derived from the two reportable segments and 
comprise sale of wind turbines and associated service activities, respectively 
power solutions and service. certain income and costs relating to vestas 
functions, investing activities, tax, etc. are managed on vestas level. these 
items are not included in the reportable segments, and therefore, presented 
as ‘not allocated’.
the measure of revenue, costs and ebit included in the segment reporting 
are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements. no 
segment information is provided to codm on a regular basis for assets and 
liabilities and the measures below ebit.
income and costs included in profit for the year are allocated to the extent 
that they can be directly or indirectly attributed to the segments on a reliable 
basis. costs allocated as either directly or indirectly attributable comprise 
production costs, r&d costs, distribution costs, and administration costs.
the income and costs allocated, including depreciation and amortisation, as 
indirectly attributable to the segments, are allocated by means of allocation 
keys determined on the basis of the utilisation of key resources in the 
segment.

1.2 revenue
vestas accounting policies 
revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a 
customer. vestas recognises revenue when it transfers control over a product 
or service to a customer. 
revenue recognition 
revenue comprises sale of wind turbines and wind power plants, after-sales 
service, and sale of spare parts. the following is a description of the principal 
activities from which vestas generates its revenue.
supply-only projects
revenue from the sale of individual wind turbines based on standard 
solutions is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with 
a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. vestas 
recognises revenue at a point in time, when control is transferred to the 
customer, and the consideration agreed is expected to be received. control 
is generally deemed to be transferred upon delivery of the components in 
accordance with the agreed delivery plan. 
supply-and-installation projects (point in time)
revenue from sale of wind power plants based on standard solutions with 
alternative use is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
vestas recognises revenue when control of the fully operational turbine is 
transferred to the customer, and the consideration agreed is expected to be 
received. control is deemed to be transferred at the point in time when the 
turbine is fully operational.
supply-and-installation projects (over time)
revenue from sale of wind power plants based on non-standard solutions 
to the customer, where there is no alternative use for the wind power plant 
to be delivered and where we have an enforceable right to payment for the 
work completed is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion 
method. revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
epc / turnkey projects
revenue from contracts to deliver wind power plants with a high degree 
of customisation are recognised over time as the wind power plants are 
constructed based on the stage of completion of the individual contracts. 
where the profit from a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only 
recognised equalling the cost incurred to the extent that it is probable that 
the costs will be recovered.
service sales 
revenue from service sales, comprising services and maintenance 
agreements as well as extended warranties regarding wind turbines and 
wind power plants sold, are recognised over the term of the agreement as the 
services are provided. separate spare parts sales are recognised at a point 
in time when control has been transferred to the customer, and provided that 
consideration agreed is expected to be received.
transaction price
the transaction price for sale of wind turbines and wind power plants normally 
includes a fixed consideration. the transaction price for service contracts 
includes a fixed consideration and often a variable consideration. the 
estimated amount of variable consideration will be included in the transaction 
price only to the extent that a significant reversal in revenue recognised is 
highly unlikely to occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved. the transaction price recognised 
as revenue is furthermore reduced by penalties and payment of liquidated 
damages related to project and service contracts.
all wind turbines and wind power plant contracts include a standard warranty 
clause. for further details on warranty, ref. note 3.6 provisions.
key accounting estimates and judgements 
estimate regarding recognition of contract elements
management performs significant accounting estimates in connection with 
determining the appropriate income recognition of contract elements. in 
certain situations, supply-only projects contain elements that in nature 
are associated with a high degree of estimations regarding allocation of 
consideration under a contract to elements already delivered and elements 
to be delivered in the future. management has assessed that the project 
specific margin is a fair estimate of a reasonable margin used to allocate 
consideration under a contract to the contract elements. significant estimate 
is also involved in assessing whether project or service contracts contain 
multiple performance obligations which should be accounted for separately.
judgement regarding method for recognition of revenue from supply-and-
installation contracts
management applies judgement when determining whether revenue from 
supply-and-installations contracts shall be recognised at a point in time or 
over time. 
management has determined that supply-and-installation projects based on 
standard solutions have an alternative use. consequently, revenue of such 
contract is recognised at the point in time when the turbine is fully operational 
and control is transferred to the customer. 
for certain projects, vestas agrees to delivery of wind power plants based on 
non-standard solutions to the customer. management assesses whether such 
non-standard solutions have an alternative use. the judgements made takes 
into consideration technology used and the degree of customization including 
remoteness of the wind power plant. revenue from sale of non-standard 
solutions, which are judged to have no alternative use is recognised over time 
(percentage-of-completion).
estimates of stage of completion 
vestas applies the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for 
service contracts and certain wind power plants, in general projects with 
a high degree of customisation. the use of the percentage-of-completion 
method requires management to determine the stage of completion by 
reference to the contract costs incurred for work performed to date in 
proportion to the estimated total contract costs (cost-to-cost method). this 
method is considered to best show the progression of the projects. based on 
the estimated stage of completion, a respective portion of the consideration 
is recognised.

service contracts are normally recognised over 
time as the services are provided over the 
term of the agreement. spare parts sales are 
recognised at a point in time when control has 
been transferred to the customer.
deliveries
deliveries for the power solutions segment are 
included as deliveries, and deducted from the 
wind turbine order backlog, when the related 
revenue is recognised.
service performance
sales from service agreements are deducted from 
service backlog simultaneously as revenue is 
recognised over the term of the agreement.

revenue is recognised at a point in time when 
control is transferred to the customer. this point 
in time occurs upon delivery of the components in 
accordance with the agreed delivery plan.
epc / turnkey projects
revenue is recognised over time as the wind 
power plant is constructed based on the stage of 
completion of the individual contracts.
supply-and-installation
revenue is recognised over time for non-
standard solutions with no alternative use as the 
turbine is installed based on the individual stage of 
completion.
revenue is recognised at a point in time, when 
control of the turbine is transferred to the customer. 
this point in time occurs when vestas has proven a

1.2 revenue (continued)
disaggregation of revenue
in the following section, revenue is disaggregated by sale of projects and sale of service, by primary geographical market, major contract types and timing of revenue 
recognition.
as disclosed in the annual report 2019, the increased demand for site-specific and remote wind power plants and customization of wind turbines have increased the 
supply-and-installation projects with no alternative use, and consequently the revenue recognised over time for supply-and-installation projects. for the financial 
year 2020, supply-and-installation projects recognised over time (percentage-of-completion) constituted 35 percent of the total supply-and-installation revenue 
compared to 9 percent in 2019. the projects are mainly located in brazil, but also include projects in other countries such as chile, russia and turkey.

all considerations from contracts with customers are included in the amounts 
presented above.
at the end of 2020, the average remaining duration in the service order 
backlog is approx. nine years (2019: eight years), with a range up to 30 years 
(2019: 30 years). for the power solutions segment, projects are normally to 
be delivered within 1-3 years (2019: 1-3 years).
it should be emphasised that vestas’ accounting policies only allow the 
recognition of revenue when the control has passed to the customer, either 
at a point in time or over time. disruptions in production and challenges in 
relation to shipment of wind turbines and installation hereof, for example bad 
weather, lack of grid connections, and similar matters, may thus cause delays 
that could affect the timing of the satisfaction of the future performance 
obligations within the backlog.
furthermore, it should be emphasised that the order backlog is forward-
looking in nature and a subset of vestas’ potential future revenue.
 
1.3 costs

1.5 government grants
vestas accounting policies
government grants comprise grants for investments, research and 
development projects, etc. grants are recognised when there is reasonable 
certainty that they will be received.
grants for investments and capitalised development projects are offset 
against the cost of the assets to which the grants relate. other grants are 
recognised in development or finance costs in the income statement so as to 
offset the cost for which they compensate.
vestas has received government grants of which eur 3m (2019: eur 6m) 
has been offset against direct cost and eur 4m (2019: eur 0m) against 
finance cost and eur 1m (2019: eur 1m) against non-current assets. 
 
1.6 special items
vestas accounting policies
special items comprise significant unusual and/or infrequently occurring 
items that are not attributable to vestas’ normal operations. special 
items comprise income and costs related to significant organisational 
restructuring and significant adjustments to production capacity and the 
product programme. the costs include the write-down of intangible and 
tangible assets as well as provisions for re-organisations and any reversal/
adjustments thereof.
key accounting judgement
classification
the use of special items entails management judgement in the separation 
from other items in the income statement. in connection with the use of 
special items, it is crucial that they are of a significantly unusual and/or 
infrequently occurring nature that are not attributable to vestas’ normal 
operations, as such classification highlights to users of financial statements 
the items to which the least attention should be given when understanding 
current and future performance.
optimising and simplifying the product portfolio
with reference to the press release dated 20 april 2020, vestas has decided 
to optimise and simplify the product portfolio for the coming years to ensure 
vestas’ long-term success and to ensure that it, despite the covid-19 
situation, exits 2020 in the position of strength with which it was entered. 
this event qualifies as special items in accordance with vestas’ accounting 
principles. in total, special items of eur 52m has been recognised. eur 43m 
as impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets, eur 6m recognised as 
provision for purchase commitments and eur 3m related to staff costs.
basis for impairment test
the decision to optimise and simplify the product portfolio includes the 
discontinuation of certain development projects including the v138-3.0 
mw™ turbine. this has led to the recognition of an impairment loss of eur 
43m in 2020. the impairment loss is allocated to the power solutions 
segment and is the result of the impairment loss of development projects in 
progress and other equipment.

2. working capital
 
2.1 change in net working capital
included in the change in net working capital (nwc) are non-cash adjustments and exchange rate adjustments with a total amount of eur (132)m (2019: eur 20m). 
consequently, the cash flow impact of change in nwc is eur (588)m (2019: eur (437)m).  
vestas is facilitating a supply chain financing program funded by credit institutions. use of this programme by suppliers takes place in the ordinary course of business 
and it fulfills the criteria as trade payables in the balance sheet with a total amount of eur 381m (2019: eur 293m).
 
2.2 inventories
vestas accounting policies
inventories are measured at the lower of cost, using the weighted average 
method, and net realisable value (nrv).
the cost of raw materials and service stock comprise purchase price of 
materials, consumables, duties, and transportation costs.
the cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises the cost of raw 
materials, consumables, direct labour, and indirect production costs. indirect 
production costs comprise materials and labour costs as well as maintenance 
and depreciation of the machinery, factory buildings, and equipment used in 
the manufacturing process together with costs of factory administration and 
management.
 
 
 
 
the nrv of inventories is measured at sales price less costs of completion 
and selling costs. nrv is determined taking into account marketability, 
obsolescence, and development in the expected selling price.
key accounting estimate
estimate of net realisable value
vestas estimates the net realisable value at the amount at which inventories 
are expected to be sold. inventories are written down to net realisable 
value when the cost of inventories is estimated to be non-recoverable 
due to obsolescence, damage or declining selling prices. estimates are 
used when accounting for or measuring inventory provisions, and these 
estimates depend upon subjective and complex judgements about certain 
circumstances, taking into account fluctuations in prices, excess quantities, 
condition of the inventory, nature of the inventory, and the estimated variable 
costs necessary to make the sale.

2.3 contract balances 
 
vestas accounting policies
contract assets/liabilities comprise agreements to deliver wind power plants 
based on  non-standard solutions (supply-and-installation projects over 
time) and wind power plants with a high degree of customisation (turnkey 
projects), as well as service and maintenances agreements. contract liabilities 
also comprise prepayments from customers for supply-only and supply-and-
installation projects ordered but not yet delivered. 
vestas receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule, as 
established in the contracts and generally represents vestas’ engagements. 
contract assets relates to vestas’ conditional right to consideration for 
vestas’ completed performance under the contract. accounts receivable are 
recognised when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. contract 
liability relates to payments received in advance of performance under the 
contract. contract liabilities are recognised as revenue as (or when) vestas 
performs under the contract.
contract assets/liabilities are measured at the selling price of the work 
performed based on the stage of completion less progress billing and 
expected losses.
the stage of completion is measured as the proportion at the costs on the 
contract incurred relatively to the estimated total costs on the contract. 
where it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenues from a 
contract, the expected loss is recognised immediately as a cost and a 
provision.
the value of self-constructed components is recognised as contract assets/
liabilities upon installation of the components to the specific wind power 
plant’s construction site.
if the selling price of the work performed exceeds progress billings and 
expected losses it is recognised as an asset. if interim billings and expected 
losses exceed the selling price it is recognised as a liability.
costs relating to sales work and the pursuing of contracts are recognised in 
the income statement as incurred, if the costs are not incremental.

key accounting judgement
estimate of allowance for doubtful vat receivables
management makes allowance for doubtful vat receivables in anticipation 
of estimated future receipt of payments. if certain circumstances result in 
lack of receipt of payments, an additional allowance could be required. when 
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful vat receivables, 
management analyses the nature of the individual vat receivables and takes 
into account any relevant historical information that is applicable to the 
specific circumstance.

3.1 intangible assets
vestas accounting policies
goodwill
goodwill is initially recognised in the balance sheet as described in business 
combinations, ref. note 6.4. subsequently, goodwill is measured at this value 
less accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not amortised.
the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to vestas’ operating 
segments. identification of operating segments is based on management 
structure and internal financial reporting. 
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, 
together with the other non-current assets of the operating segment to 
which goodwill has been allocated. if the recoverable amount is lower than 
the carrying amount of the operating segment, goodwill is written down to its 
lower recoverable amount in the income statement.
the recoverable amount is usually calculated as the net present value 
of expected future net cash flows from the operating segments to which 
the goodwill has been allocated. alternatively, the recoverable amount is 
calculated as fair value less costs to sell. impairment losses on goodwill are 
recognised in the income statement, either in production costs, research and 
development costs, distribution costs or administration costs.
impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
development projects
projects for the development and testing of new wind turbines are recognised 
as intangible assets when they are clearly defined, identifiable, and for 
which technical feasibility, sufficient resources and a potential future market 
or application in the enterprise can be demonstrated. in addition, it is the 
intention with these projects to manufacture, market or use the project for 
future commercial purposes. this applies if cost can be measured reliably 
and sufficient certainty exists that future earnings or the net selling price 
can cover production costs, distribution costs, and administration costs as 
well as research and development costs. at vestas this is underpinned by 
a gate process, where these judgements are made at specific gates. other 
development costs not qualifying for capitalization are recognised in the 
income statement as research and development costs.
capitalised development costs are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. development costs comprise salaries, 
amortisation and other costs attributable to vestas’ development activities.
following completion of the development work, development projects 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
the amortisation period is two to five years. the basis of amortisation is 
calculated net of any impairment losses. 
the carrying amount of development projects in progress is tested for 
impairment at least annually, and where the carrying amount exceeds the net 
present value of the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the 
development project, the project is written down to its recoverable amount 
in the income statement. finished development projects are tested for 
impairment if there is indication of impairment from the annual review.
patents and licences included in development projects are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. patents and licences 
are amortised over the patent period or term of agreement, the life of the 
development project or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. the 
basis of amortisation is calculated net of any impairment losses. 
software
acquired software licences and internally developed software is measured 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. cost includes 
both direct internal and external costs. software is amortised on a straight-
line basis over three to five years. the basis of amortisation is calculated net 
of any impairment losses.
other intangible assets
customer relationship, knowhow, and trademarks with a finite useful life 
acquired from third parties, either separately or as part of the business 
combination, are capitalised at cost and amortised over their remaining useful 
lives. other intangible assets that are not customer relationship, knowhow, or 
trademarks are measured at cost less amortisation and impairment losses.

3.2 property, plant and equipment
vestas accounting policies
land and buildings, plant and machinery as well as other fixtures and fittings, 
tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
cost comprises the cost of acquisition and costs directly related to the 
acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. in the case 
of construction of own assets, cost comprises direct and indirect costs 
for materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. estimated costs for 
dismantling and disposing of the asset and for re-establishment are added 
to cost to the extent that they are recognised as a provision. where individual 
components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, the cost of the item is decomposed into separate components which are 
depreciated separately.
subsequent costs, e.g. in connection with the replacement of components 
of an item of property, plant and equipment, are recognised in the  carrying 
amount of the asset in question when it is probable that the costs incurred 
will result in future economic benefits to vestas. the carrying amount of the 
replaced components is derecognised in the balance sheet and recognised 
as costs in the income statement. all other costs incurred for ordinary repairs 
and maintenance are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
 
installations capitalised as land and buildings which are related to leased 
assets are depreciated over the term of the related lease contract. such lease 
contracts range with a lease term from 10 to 20 years.
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 
lives of the assets, which are:
buildings (including installations) .................................................................10–40 years
plant and machinery ..................................................................................................3–10 years 
other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment .......................................3–5 years
right-of-use assets..................................................................................................... 2-20 years
land is not depreciated.
the basis of depreciation is calculated taking into account the residual value 
of the asset less any impairment losses. the residual value is determined at 
the time of acquisition and is reassessed annually. where the residual value 
exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, depreciation is discontinued.
the depreciation periods are determined based on estimates of the expected 
useful lives and future residual value of the assets. the estimates are based 
on historical experience. a reassessment is made once a year to ascertain 
that the depreciation basis reflects the expected life and future residual 
values of the assets.
if the depreciation period or the residual value has changed, the effect on 
depreciation is recognised prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.
depreciation is recognised in the income statement as either production 
costs, research and development costs, distribution costs or administration 
costs to the extent that depreciation is not included in the cost of assets of 
own construction.
the carrying amounts of non-current assets are reviewed on an annual 
basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. if so, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is calculated. the recoverable amount is the 
higher of the fair value of the asset less estimated costs to sell and value in 
use.
value in use is calculated as the net present value of expected future net cash 
flows from the asset or a group of assets.
an impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the 
assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation.
impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the new carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount of the asset after 
depreciation/amortisation had the asset not been impaired.

3.3 leases
vestas accounting policies
vestas as lessee
vestas assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the 
contract. vestas recognises right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities 
at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases and leases of low 
value. for these leases, vestas normally recognises the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
the right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial 
amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date, plus any initial costs incurred.
the right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. the right-of-use assets are from the 
commencement date depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. the estimated useful lives of right-of-use 
assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. 
in addition, the right-of-use assets are periodically reduced by impairment 
losses, if any, and adjusted in accordance with lease liabilities. 
the lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, 
vestas’ incremental borrowing rate. generally, vestas uses its incremental 
borrowing rate taking into account the specific countries.
lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities comprise 
the following:
 · fixed payments; 
 · variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured 
using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
 · the exercise price of a purchase option if vestas is reasonably certain to 
exercise the options; and
 · amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees.
the lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. it is remeasured when there is a change in future 
lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change 
in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value 
guarantee, or if vestas changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a 
purchase, extension or termination option.
when the lease liabilities are remeasured in this way, a corresponding 
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets, or is 
recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets has 
been reduced to zero.

vestas leases several assets including properties, vehicles and equipment. 
rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 1 to 10 years but may 
have extension options. lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and 
contain different terms and conditions including payment terms, terminations 
rights, index-regulations, maintenance, deposits and guarantees etc.
lease liabilities
lease liabilities are included in financial debts which amounted to eur 
446m as at 31 december 2020 (2019: 198m). the lease liabilities included 
in financial debts can be specified as follows:

some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to an 
index e.g. a consumer price index. overall the variable payments constitute 
less than 1 percent of vestas’ entire lease payments.
extension and termination options may be included in leases. these terms are 
used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts.

3.4 impairment
valuation of goodwill
as at 30 september 2020, management performed the annual impairment 
tests of the carrying amount of goodwill. no basis for impairment was found 
for 2020 (2019: eur 0m). in the impairment tests, the carrying amount of 
the assets are compared to the discounted value of future expected cash 
flows.
the annual tests of goodwill were performed on the two operating segments: 
power solutions and service, these being the lowest level of cash-generating 
units as defined by management. the annual impairment test, performed in 
september did not include the goodwill acquired as  part of the acquisition of 
mhi vestas offshore wind a/s, as the acquisition was completed just prior to 
year end.
the main part of the carrying amount of goodwill in vestas subject to 
impairment testing in 2020 arose in connection with the acquisition of neg 
micon a/s in 2004, and the goodwill is allocated to vestas’ two operating 
segments power solutions (eur 180m) and service (eur 35m). in relation 
to the acquisition of upwind solutions, inc. in 2015, vestas has recognised 
goodwill of eur 40m, which is allocated to the service segment. in relation to 
the acquisition of availon gmbh in 2016, vestas has recognised goodwill of 
eur 56m, which is allocated to the service segment. 
in 2018, vestas acquired utopus insights, inc. and recognised goodwill of 
eur 70m, which was allocated to the service segment. with the acquisition 
of sowitec group gmbh in 2019, vestas has recognised goodwill of eur 5m, 
which is allocated to the power solutions segment. 
as at 14 december 2020, vestas acquired the remaining 50 percent shares 
in mhi vestas offshore wind a/s, and recognised goodwill of eur 896m, ref. 
note 6.4. the goodwill arising from the acquisition will be allocated to a new, 
power solutions offshore cash-generating unit and the service unit in 2021. 
the acquired goodwill has been assessed as recoverable at 31 december 
2020, as no events occurred from acquisition until 31 december 2020, 
which impacts the fair value less costs to sell.
assumptions underpinning impairment test of goodwill
budgets and business plans for the next three years are based on  vestas’ 
investments in progress and contracted investments, and the risks relating 
to the key parameters have been assessed and incorporated in the expected 
future cash flows underpinning the impairment test of goodwill. in addition, 
the budgets and business plans are based on management’s expectations 
of the current market conditions and future growth expectations. projections 
for year four and onwards are based on general market expectations and 
risks. more specifically, the following main information is used in determining 
revenue, ebit and capital expenditure.

3.5 investments in joint ventures and associates
vestas accounting policies
associates is an entity over which vestas has significant influence, but not 
control. a joint venture is an arrangement in which vestas has joint control. 
joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.  
under the equity method, interests in joint ventures and associates are 
initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise vestas’ 
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other 
comprehensive income. when vestas’ share of losses in a joint venture and 
associate equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures and associates 
(which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of vestas’ 
net investment in the joint ventures and associates), the group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the joint ventures and associates.
timing in revenue recognition may be different between vestas and joint 
ventures and associates where vestas recognises revenue when control of the 
wind turbines have been transferred to joint ventures and associates but joint 
ventures and associates do not recognise revenue until they have transferred 
the risk of the same wind turbines to the end customer. such timing difference 
results in part of vestas’ profit from wind turbines delivered being eliminated 
in the net result from joint ventures and associates, until joint ventures and 
associates have recognised their revenue. this timing difference may vary 
between quarters and year end but will even out over time.
unrealised gains on transactions between vestas and its joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent of vestas’ interest in the joint ventures 
and associates. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. accounting 
policies of the joint ventures and associates have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by vestas.
the amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

3.6 provisions
vestas accounting policies
provisions are recognised when as a consequence of a past event vestas has 
a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that there will be an out-
flow of vestas’ financial resources to settle the obligation.
provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the costs required 
to settle the obligation. discounting is applied where relevant.
vestas accrues for the estimated cost of the warranty upon recognition of 
the sale of the product. the costs are estimated based on actual historical 
costs incurred and on estimated future costs related to current sales, and are 
updated periodically. actual warranty costs are charged against the provision 
for warranty.
restructuring costs are recognised as liabilities when a detailed, formal 
restructuring plan has been announced to those affected no later than the 
balance sheet date. 
a provision for loss-making contracts is made where the expected benefits 
to vestas from the contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting 
obligations under the contract. loss making construction contracts in
progress are, however, recognised in construction contracts in progress.
provision for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obli-
gation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is possible that there 
will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. in this case, 
vestas arrives at an estimate on the basis of an evaluation of the most likely 
outcome. disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed 
as contingent liabilities, ref. note 3.7.
key accounting estimates
provisions for warranties
the product warranties, which in the great majority of cases includes compo-
nent defects and functional errors and agreed financial losses suffered by the 
customer in connection with unplanned suspension of operations, are usually 
granted for a two-year period from legal transfer of the wind turbine. in certain 
cases, a warranty of up to five years is provided. for the customer, the specific 
warranty period and the specific warranty terms are part of the basis of the 
individual contract.
warranty provisions include only standard warranty, whereas services 
purchased in addition to the standard warranty are included in the service 
contracts. 
in addition to the above, provisions are made for upgrades of wind turbines 
sold due to defects, etc. such provisions will also include wind turbines sold 
in prior years, but where serial defects, etc. are identified later. moreover, it 
should be emphasised that the complexity of some of the serial defects, etc. 
identified may lead to adjustments of previous estimates, upwards as well 
as downwards, in light of factual information about population size, costs of 
repair and the timing of such repairs.
it is estimated that 35-40 percent of the warranty provisions made for the 
year relate to adjustments of previous years’ estimates of provisions for 
defects, etc. included in this, is the cost of upgrades of wind turbines sold in 
the previous year, commercial settlements and proactive upgrading as well as 
new information about the type faults in question.
total warranty provisions of eur 693m have been made in 2020 (2019: 
eur 291m), corresponding to 4.7 percent (2019: 2.4 percent) of vestas’ rev-
enue. warranty provision includes an extraordinary provision of eur 175m 
relating to a repair and upgrade of blades already installed. 
management assesses the likely outcome of pending and future negotiations 
with sub-suppliers for compensation. compensation from sub-suppliers may 
be recognised only when it is virtually certain that we will receive compensa-
tion from the sub-suppliers.
the carrying amount of warranty provisions was eur 1,189m as at 31 
december 2020 (2019: eur 619m), including addition of eur 203m from 
the acquisition of mhi vestas offshore wind.

plants is recognised.
product risks
vestas invest significant resources in improving products and increasing their reliability to mitigate major warranty provisions. this work comprises design, 
production, installation, and continuous maintenance. 
the goal of these initiatives is to reduce vestas’ warranty costs, to secure customer returns, and increase the competitiveness of the products.

3.7 contingent assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations
guarantees and indemnities
vestas provides indemnities and guarantees to third parties on behalf of non-
vestas entities and joint ventures with a notional amount of eur 52m (2019: 
eur 4,445m including eur 4,389m of indemnities on behalf of mvow).  no 
guarantees have been utilised during 2020 or in previous years and none of 
the indemnities are expected at the balance sheet date to be utilised.
contingent liabilities
vestas has entered into binding contracts concerning purchase of property, 
plant and equipment to be delivered in 2020 and future periods at a value 
of eur 105m (2019: eur 43m). in addition, the company has a contractual 
commitment to pay on average eur 3m annually until 2022 for the use of 
certain technology rights owned by a third party.
vestas is involved in a number of litigation proceedings. however, it is 
management’s opinion that settlement or continuation of these proceedings 
will not have a material effect on the financial position of the group.
ref. note. 5.2 concerning contingent liabilities on transfer pricing.
contingent assets
vestas has made supplier claims for faulty deliveries. however, it is 
management’s opinion that settlement of these are not virtually certain, 
and therefore not recognised in the financial position of vestas, except for 
supplier claims accounted for as other receivables, ref. note 2.5.

market risk, interest risk
fixed interest loans
market risk, commodity price
fixed price agreements with suppliers and financial commodity contracts
the financial risks are managed centrally and the overall objectives and 
policies for vestas’ financial risk management are outlined in the treasury 
policy. the treasury policy is approved by the board, and revised on a 
continuous basis to adapt to the changing financial risks and market 
situation. 
the treasury policy sets the limits for the various financial risks as well as 
vestas policy of only hedging commercial exposures and not entering into any 
speculative transactions.
for information on vestas’ financial and capital structure strategy, please ref. 
to page 018. 
liquidity risks 
vestas manages its liquidity risks according to the treasury policy and 
ensures to have sufficient financial resources to service its financial 
obligations. financial resources are managed through a combination of cash 
on bank account and money market deposits, committed credit facilities, and 
highly rated marketable securities. the liquidity is managed and optimised 
centrally by using cash pools and in-house bank solutions. 
vestas’ main credit facility, a eur 1,150m revolving credit facility, was 
refinanced in june 2017. the facility has a five-year duration with an option, 
at the lenders’ discretion, to extend the maturity one additional year at a time. 
the facility was extended in 2018 and 2019. it has a sublimit of eur 550m 
for cash drawings, while the total of eur 1,150m is available for guarantees. 
the revolving credit facility is subject to a change of control clause resulting in 
repayment of the credit facility in the event of change in control. the revolving 
credit facility is subject to covenants and no breaches have been encountered 
throughout the year. during 2020, vestas also entered into bilateral revolving 
credit facilities of in total eur 1,000m, all available for cash drawings. the 
facilities are subject to the same covenants and change of control clauses as 
the main facility and matures during 2021. on 14 december 2020 vestas 
completed the acquisition of mhi vestas offshore wind a/s, ref. note 6.4. as 
part of the acquisition vestas took over bilateral credit facilities in mhi vestas 
offshore wind a/s amounting to eur 350m of which 245 was utilised. this 
credit facility was terminated in january 2021.

equivalents, including money market deposits and money market funds, 
investments in marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and 
trade and other receivables. the treasury policy sets forth limits for the credit 
risk exposure based on the counterparty’s credit rating for financial institution 
counterparties and mitigating actions for other counterparties.
as at 31 december 2020, vestas considers the maximum credit risk to 
financial institution counterparties to be eur 3,299m (2019: eur 3,303m). 
the total credit risk is considered to be eur 6,035m (2019: eur 5,489m).
trade receivables and contract assets
trade receivables are mainly with counterparties within the energy sector. the 
credit risk is among other things dependent on the development within this 
sector and the country in which the individual customer operates. 
upon signing a contract for individual wind turbines and wind power plants 
with a customer, a prepayment is received. the remaining contract amounts 
are usually based on instalments during different stages of the project. 
payment terms for service contracts with customers are usually based on 
equal instalments over the duration of the contract. payments are typically 
due one month after issuance of the invoice.  contract assets are  by nature 
not overdue. vestas does not expect to have any contracts where the period 
between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and 
payment by the customer exceeds one year. therefore, vestas does not adjust 
any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.
trade receivables from customers are grouped based on loss patterns in
assessing expected credit losses. contract assets are grouped with trade 
receivables as these relate to unbilled work in progress with same credit
risk as trade receivables. an allowance matrix based on past due dates is 
used in measuring expected lifetime credit losses, where current and forward-
looking information including geographical risk, the level of security obtained 
and an individual assessment has been applied together with historical loss 
rates. 
the past due analysis and determined write-downs of vestas’ trade 
receivables and contracts assets are set out in the following tables.

as at 31 december 2020, vestas’ trade receivables and contract assets 
divided on geographical areas can be specified as follow: 35 percent in 
america, 52 percent in emea and 14 percent in asia pacific. 
no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of vestas’ total trade 
receivables as of 31 december 2020 (2019: 0). 
the commercial credit risk relating to the outstanding trade receivables 
balance as of 31 december was mitigated by eur 448m (2019: eur 254m) 
received as security, such as third party guarantees. historically, vestas has 
not incurred significant losses on trade receivables.
financial instruments and cash deposits
group treasury manages balances with financial institutions and the 
associated credit risk in accordance with vestas’ treasury policy assessing 
the individual counterparty’s credit rating. 
90 percent of vestas’ exposure towards financial institutions are with 
counterparties with a credit rating in the range of a to aaa. 
vestas has entered into isda agreements with all financial institution 
counterparties used for trading derivative financial instruments under which 
vestas has a right to set-off should certain credit events occur, which means 
that vestas’ actual credit risk is limited to the net assets per counterparty.

netting in case of certain credit events.

4.2 financial risk management (continued)
market risks 
vestas is exposed to various market risks with the main risks comprising 
foreign currency risks, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. all market 
risks are managed in accordance with the treasury policy. 
foreign currency risks
the international business activities of vestas involve foreign currency risks, 
meaning that vestas’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flows 
are exposed to foreign currency risks. the foreign currency exposures arise 
primarily from purchases of materials and sale of wind turbines and service 
agreements where these transactions are not made in the functional currency 
of the entity making the transaction.
vestas objective when managing foreign currency risks is to reduce 
the shorter fluctuations in the income statement and to increase the 
predictability of the financial results. the foreign currency risks are reduced 
by purchasing and producing in local markets and by hedging the exposure in 
each individual currency according to the treasury policy.
vestas hedge foreign currency exposures related to our firm wind turbine 
order backlog. it is vestas aim to hedge between 80 percent and 100 
percent of the consolidated committed exposure. for committed exposure 
with duration after 18 months, hedging is done with shorter maturity. vestas 
furthermore hedge foreign on balance currency exposure, where it is vestas’ 
aim to hedge between 90 percent and 100 percent of all exposures.
vestas distinguish between entities in restricted and un-restricted countries, 
when determining the level of exposure to be hedged. foreign currency risks 
related to long-term investments and our service business are not hedged 
based on an overall risk, liquidity and cost perspective. 
foreign currency exposures are primarily hedged through foreign currency 
forward contracts and foreign currency swaps. vestas hedge strategy is to 
centralise foreign currency exposure in vestas wind systems a/s through 
internal contracts and trade the net currency exposures in the market.
the majority of vestas’s sales are in usd and eur. the eur exchange rate 
risk is regarded as low in danish entities due to denmark’s fixed exchange 
rate policy towards eur. eur sales outside europe are limited. despite the 
significant sales in usd, vestas’ currency exposure in usd has decreased as a 
result of increased sourcing of materials and components in usd. as a result 
of vestas’ acquisition of mhi vestas offshore wind a/s as at 14 december 
2020, vestas’ currency exposure in gbp increased significantly compared to 
2019. the nature of the project business changes the foreign currency risk 
picture towards specific currencies from one year to another, depending on in 
which geographical areas vestas has activity.
the sensitivity analysis below shows the gain/(loss) on net profit for the 
year and other comprehensive income of a 10 percent increase in our most 
significant currencies towards eur. the analysis includes the impact from 
cash flow hedging instruments on equity before tax but does not comprise the 
impact from the hedged exposures such as future purchases or sales since 
these are not recognised in the balance sheet. if the hedged exposures were 
included the impact from hedge instruments would be offset in their entirety. 
the below analysis is based on the assumption that all other variables, 
interest rates in particular, remain constant.

interest rate risks 
vestas ensures that the interest rate risk is managed according to the 
treasury policy. interest rate risk relates to cash flows from interest-bearing 
short-term investments in cash and cash equivalents as well as from 
marketable securities with floating interest rate as well as outstanding 
interest-bearing debt with floating interest rates.
 
vestas has no significant outstanding interest-bearing debt with floating 
interest, why fluctuations in the market interest rates will not have a 
significant impact on vestas.
commodity price risks
commodity price risks in vestas mainly relate to global market fluctuations 
in prices of raw materials such as copper, which are used directly or indirectly 
in the production of wind turbines. the commodity price risk can be divided 
into a direct exposure and an indirect exposure, where the direct exposure 
is related to purchase of the raw material while the indirect exposure arises 
from the purchase of a component where the price is linked to raw material 
prices. the risk is managed in accordance with the treasury policy and mainly 
managed through the procurement process through fixed price agreements 
with suppliers. furthermore, vestas mitigates the commodity exposure by 
entering into forward contracts to a limited extent.

4.3 hedge accounting
risks which were managed by derivative financial instruments in 2020 
comprise foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.
hedging of risks with derivative financial instruments are made with a ratio 
of 1:1. any ineffectiveness arising from hedging of foreign currency risks 
and commodity risks are recognised in financial items. recognised sources 
of ineffectiveness are mainly derived from differences in the timing of the 
cash flows of the hedged items and hedging instruments and changes to the 
forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items. 
foreign currency risk
derivative financial instruments considered as cash flow hedges are 
designated hedges of forecasted sales and purchases. cash flow hedges are 
measured at fair value with changes in the effective part of any gain or loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income. any ineffective portions of the 
cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement as financial items. 
gains or losses on cash flow hedges are upon realisation of the hedged item 
transferred from the equity hedging reserve into the initial carrying amount of 
the hedged item.
firm commitments in foreign currency are designated as fair value hedges 
and measured with changes in fair value in the income statement as financial 
items.
in some sales agreements, a foreign currency element is incorporated. 
in cases where the sales currency is not closely related to the functional 
currency nor a commonly used currency in the country in which the sales 
takes place, the foreign currency element is treated as an embedded financial 
derivative. the embedded financial derivative is designated as a cash flow 
hedge and included as forward contracts in the tables below.
commodity price risk
as a part of the turbine production vestas directly or indirectly purchases 
raw materials such as copper on an ongoing basis. due to volatility in the 
commodity prices, vestas enters into commodity forward contracts for 
forecasted purchases.
vestas held at 31 december 2020 the following derivative financial 
instruments with the net contract notional amounts for each instrument 
comprising future purchases and (sales) of foreign currencies:

fair value hierarchy
financial instruments measured at fair value are categorised into the 
following levels of the fair value hierarchy:
level 1: observable market prices for identical instruments.
level 2:  valuation techniques primarily based on observable prices or traded 
prices for comparable instruments.
level 3: valuation techniques primarily based on unobservable prices.
the table below sets out the carrying amounts and fair values of vestas’ 
financial instruments in the different levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
financial instruments as trade receivables, trade payables and deposits 
where the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value are 
not disclosed.

1)  foreign currency contracts and embedded derivatives are measured as level 2, as the fair value can be established directly based on exchange rates published and interest rate curves 
and prices specified at the balance sheet date. 
2)  other investments on non-listed equity shares are measured at fair value based on level 3 input. in 2019 the investment based on level 2 as recent observable trades between      
independent parties had occurred. as no trades were executed in 2020 the fair value assessment is based on non-observable sales prices and supported by accepted valuation 
techniques. therefore, the investment has moved to level 3 in 2020 from level 2 in 2019. there has been no new financial investments or disposals in 2020. 
3)  vestas has a commitment in the us to purchase renewable energy certificates (recs) in 2022 and 10 years beyond based on production of mw in this period at a fixed price. it has 
been assessed that the contract qualifies as a financial instrument. the fair value measurement is based on level 3 input. the maximum nominal commitment under the contract is 
estimated at eur 42m as of december 2020 (2019: eur 45m). market prices depend on which market the recs are traded, ranging from an estimated average market price of usd 
5.32/mwh to usd 29.09/mwh  (2019: usd 25.46/mwh), hence the contract would have had an estimated value in the range of eur (18)m to eur 73m as at 31 december 2020 (31 
december 2019: eur 61m). given the uncertainties underpinning the future market for selling recs, management has determined that the best evidence of fair value for the recs is 
the transaction price. consequently, the net fair value of the contract has been measured at eur 0.
4)  financial debts comprise the green corporate eurobond with a fixed interest rate of 2.75 percent (eur 498), sowitec group bond with a fixed interest rate of 6.75 percent (eur 15m). 
both are valued based on observable market prices.
 
4.5 share capital
vestas accounting policies
treasury shares
treasury shares are deducted from the share capital upon cancellation at 
their nominal value of dkk 1.00 per share. differences between this amount 
and the amount paid to acquire or received for sale of treasury shares are 
deducted directly in equity.
dividend
a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the 
annual general meeting (declaration date). the proposed dividend for the 
year is included in retained earnings.
for the financial year 2020, the board of directors of vestas wind systems 
a/s (the board) proposes to distribute a dividend of dkk 8.45 (eur 1.14) 
per share, corresponding to total eur 230m. dividends of eur 207m, net of 
treasury shares, have been paid in 2020, relating to the financial year 2019.

5.1 income tax
vestas accounting policies
tax for the year consists of current tax and deferred tax for the year including 
adjustments to previous years and changes in provision for uncertain tax 
positions. the tax attributable to the profit for the year is recognised in the 
income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is 
recognised directly in equity. the tax expense relating to items recognised 
in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
following developments in ongoing tax disputes primarily related to transfer 
pricing cases, uncertain tax positions are assessed individually and presented 
as part of non-current tax receivables or non-current tax payables. the utps 
that materialize and become certain or virtually certain are classified as 
current tax. 
current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet at 
the amounts calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on 
taxable incomes for prior years and for taxes paid on account.
key accounting estimates
income taxes and uncertain tax position
the group continuously wants to be a compliant corporate tax citizen 
in collaboration with our operations and stakeholders and to support 
shareholder interest and our reputation. to ensure compliance, national and 
international tax laws as well as the oecd guidelines are acknowledged and 
followed throughout the world.
the group is subject to income taxes around the world and therefore recognise 
that significant estimates and judgements is required in determining the 
worldwide accrual for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
and provision for uncertain tax positions.
the global business implies that the group may be subject to disputes on 
allocation of profits between different jurisdictions. management judgement 
is applied to assess the expected outcome of such tax disputes which is 
provided for in provision for uncertain tax positions. management believes 
that provisions made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with local 
tax authorities at year end is adequate. however, the actual obligation may 
deviate and is dependent on the result of litigations and settlements with the 
relevant tax authorities.

5.2 deferred tax
vestas accounting policies
deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect 
of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base 
of assets and liabilities. deferred tax is, however, not recognised in respect 
of temporary differences on initial recognition of goodwill and other items, 
apart from business acquisitions, where temporary differences have arisen 
at the time of acquisition without affecting the profit for the year or the 
taxable income. in cases where the computation of the tax base may be 
made according to different tax rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis 
of management’s intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, 
respectively.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are 
recognised in other non-current assets at the value at which the asset is 
expected to be realised, either by elimination of tax on future earnings or by 
set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and 
jurisdiction.
deferred tax assets are reviewed on an annual basis and are only recognised 
when it is probable that they will be utilised in future periods.
adjustments are made to deferred tax to take account of the elimination of 
unrealised inter-company profits and losses.
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates of the 
respective countries that will be effective when the deferred tax is expected 
to crystallise as current tax based on the legislation at the balance sheet date. 
changes to deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the 
income statement except for items recognised directly in equity.
key accounting estimates
valuation of deferred tax assets
vestas recognises deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss 
carry-forwards, where management assesses that the tax assets may be 
utilised in the foreseeable future for set-off against positive taxable income. 
the assessment is made on an annual basis and is based on the budgets and 
business plans for future years, including planned business initiatives, and 
thus involves significant estimates. key parameters are expected revenue and 
ebit development considering expected allocation of future taxable income 
based on the transfer pricing policy in place. due to the uncertainties relating 
to allocation of profits management has limited the forecast period used to 
determine the utilisation to three years.
of the total tax loss carry-forwards, eur 14m (2019: eur 18m) is expected 
to be realised within 12 months, and eur 65m (2019: eur 23m) is expected 
to be realised later than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
the assessment in 2020 resulted in reversal of write-down of deferred tax 
assets by eur 7m (2019 eur 15m additional write-down) with the write 
down being primarily due to the fact that certain jurisdictions have more tax 
assets than what is expected to be utilised in the foreseeable future.
as at 31 december 2020, the value of recognised deferred tax assets 
amounted to eur 335m (2019: eur 324m), of which eur 34m (2019: 
eur 41m) relates to tax loss carry-forwards. the value of non-recognised 
tax assets totals eur 69m (2019: eur 76m), of which eur  69m (2019: 
eur 76m) relating to write-downs that are not expected to be utilised in the 
foreseeable future.

1)  other mainly relates to deferred revenue and share-based payment and hedges.
no provision is made for deferred tax regarding undistributed earnings in 
subsidiaries, as vestas controls the release of the obligation.
deferred tax recognised on tax losses is mainly in jurisdictions where there 
are expiry limits. out of total tax losses recognised eur 14m (2019: eur 
20m) are subject to expiry limits. following vestas’ transfer pricing policy, 
these losses are expected to be utilised within the foreseeable future.
of the total deferred tax relating to tax loss carry-forwards written down, eur 
0m (2019: eur 0m) relates to denmark. the recognised loss carry-forward 
relating to denmark amounts to eur 45m (2019: eur 0m).
as many other multinational businesses, vestas recognises the increased 
focus on the transfer pricing and the consequent allocation of profits to the 
relevant countries. even though the vestas’ subsidiaries pay corporate tax 
in the countries in which they operate, vestas is still part of a number of tax 
audits on different locations. some of these disputes concern significant 
amounts and uncertainties. vestas believes that the provisions made for 
uncertain tax positions not yet settled with the local tax authorities is 
adequate. however, the actual obligation may differ and is subject to the 
result of the litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.

6.2 management’s incentive programmes
vestas accounting policies
vestas operates a number of share-based compensation schemes (restricted 
share programmes) under which it awards vestas shares to members of the 
executive management and certain key employees in vestas wind systems 
a/s or its subsidiaries.
the value of the services received in exchange for the issuance of shares is 
measured at the fair value of the shares. 
restricted shares issued to employees are measured at fair value at the time 
of granting and are recognised in staff expenses in the income statement over 
the vesting period. the opposite entry is recognised directly in equity. 
on initial recognition of the restricted shares, the number of shares expected 
to vest is estimated. subsequently, the estimate is revised so that the total 
expense recognised is based on the actual number of shares vested. 
the fair value of restricted shares is determined based on vestas quoted 
share price at grant.
restricted performance share programme 
the purpose of the restricted performance shares is to ensure common goals 
for management, certain key employees, and shareholders.
the number of shares available for grant may be adjusted in the event of 
changes in vestas’ capital structure. further, in the event of a change of 
control, merger, winding-up or demerger of vestas, an accelerated grant may 
extraordinarily take place. in the event of certain transfers of activities or 
changes in ownership interests within vestas, adjustment, replacement of 
the programme and/or settlement in cash of the programme entirely or partly 
may also take place.
in may 2020, the board of directors of vestas wind systems a/s (the board) 
launched a new restricted performance share programme. the share-based 
incentive programme follows the structure of the previous programme 
from 2019 and will still be based on restricted performance shares. the 
programme has a performance period of three years and a performance 
measurement based on financial key performance indicators as well as 
vestas’ market share as defined by the board of directors. 50 percent of the 
programme has a vesting period of three years and remaining the 50 percent 
a vesting period of five years. 
the terms and conditions governing the restricted performance share 
programme are as follows:
 · only participants employed by vestas at the time of announcement of the

6.4 business combinations
vestas accounting policies
newly acquired or newly founded subsidiaries are recognised from the date 
of obtaining control. upon acquisition of subsidiaries, the acquisition method 
is applied.
cost is stated as the fair value of the assets transferred, obligations 
undertaken and shares issued. cost includes the fair value of any earn-outs.
expenses related to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they are incurred. identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities (net assets) relating to the entity acquired are 
recognised at the fair value at the date of acquisition calculated in accordance 
with vestas accounting policies.
in connection with every acquisition, goodwill and a non-controlling interest 
(minority) are recognised according to one of the following methods:
1)  goodwill relating to the entity acquired comprises a positive difference, if 
any, between the total fair value of the entity acquired and the fair value of 
the total net assets for accounting purposes. the non-controlling interest 
is recognised at the share of the total fair value of the entity acquired (full 
goodwill).
2)  goodwill relating to the entity acquired comprises a positive difference, 
if any, between the cost and the fair value of vestas’ share of the net 
assets for accounting purposes of the acquired enterprise at the 
date of acquisition. the non-controlling interest is recognised at the 
proportionate share of the net assets acquired (proportionate goodwill).
goodwill is recognised in intangible assets. it is not amortised, but reviewed 
for impairment once a year and also if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. if impairment is established, 
the goodwill is written down to its lower recoverable amount.
sold or liquidated entities are recognised up to the date of disposal. any gain 
or loss compared to the carrying amount at the date of disposal is recognised 
in the income statement to the extent the control of the subsidiary is also 
transferred.  
acquisition of mhi vestas offshore wind a/s
on 29 october 2020, vestas wind systems a/s (vestas), and mitsubishi 
heavy industries, ltd. (mhi), signed an agreement that vestas would 
acquire mhi’s 50 percent shares in mhi vestas offshore wind (mvow) 
joint venture, against mhi acquiring 2.5 percent shares in vestas, where 
after vestas has obtained 100 percent of the shares in mvow.  through 
this strengthened partnership, vestas made an emphatic long-term move in 
offshore wind energy to become a leading player in offshore wind by 2025 
and to expand the two companies’ overall leadership in sustainable energy. 
the transaction between vestas and mhi was subject to regulatory approvals 
by the competition authorities which were received on 27 november 2020. 
following the approval and finalisation of the transaction, vestas obtained 
control of mvow on 14 december 2020.  
consideration transferred
the consideration transferred for the shares in mvow has been made in vestas 
equity instruments by offering a total of 5,049,337 shares in vestas that were 
issued at closing of the transaction, corresponding to 2.5 percent of vestas 
nominal share capital after the capital increase. the transaction has a value of 
approx. eur 861m, based on the acquisition date share closing price of dkk 
1,268.50 (eur 170.5) quoted on nasdaq copenhagen. upon closing mvow 
effectively settled payable amounts of eur 59m towards vestas adjusted in net 
assets acquired and in consideration transferred, whereafter the consideration 
transferred amounted  to eur 920m. the cash impact from the transaction 
amount to eur 218m obtained as part of the net assets acquired. no cash has 
been transferred to mhi.
6.4 business combinations (continued)
strategic rationale and synergies
the goodwill of eur 896m arising from the acquisition is attributable to 
acceleration of mvows and vestas’ growth by integrating onshore and 
offshore platforms and leveraging vestas’ strengths in both segments. 
specifically, this entails a stronger integration between onshore and offshore 
technology and modular frameworks. a new offshore wind turbine platform 
is expected to be introduced to improve efficiency and drive the levelized 
cost of energy further down. furthermore, synergies are expected in sales, 
technology, manufacturing footprint and procurement. 
none of the goodwill acquired is expected to be deductible for income tax 
purposes.
transaction costs
acquisition-related costs of eur 1m have been charged to administration 
costs in the consolidated income statement for the year and less than a 
million have been recognised in equity in relation to issuance of shares to 
settle the acquisition.
earnings impact
since the closing on 14 december 2020, mvow has contributed with 
revenue of eur 100m but no significant profit. had the business been 
consolidated with vestas’ financial statements from 1 january 2020, vestas 
consolidated income statement would have been impacted with additional 
revenue of eur 1,279m and a loss after tax of additional eur 46m. mvows 
total loss after tax amounts to eur 92m in 2020.
remeasurement of shares held before the acquisition of 50 percent shares
the carrying value of the 50 percent equity interest in mvow as of 14th of december amounted to eur 53m and the fair value has been assessed to eur 461m. 
based on the remeasurement of the existing 50 percent interest to fair value at the closing date and including reclassification of the exchange rate and hedge 
reserve in equity related to mvow, a total gain of eur 383m has been recognised as part of profit and loss from investments in joint ventures and associates.
key accounting estimate
estimate regarding fair value of shares held
the fair value of the 50 percent shares held before the acquisition is remeasured as the net present value of expected future cash flows. the expected cash flows 
are based on forecasts for a foreseeable period related to expected orders including firm orders, conditional orders, orders from reoccurring customers and new bids. 
furthermore, cash flows from existing service contracts and service contracts from order backlog are forecasted in alignment with the contract terms in addition 
to projections for subsequent years based on assumptions on probability of the customers renewing the service contracts. the assumptions are based on sales 
and services coming from mvow’s current available technology, operating margin and expected future capital expenditures. the current available technology are 
expected to generate orders to be effectuated within the next five years and service contracts for a period of 30 years. the future cash flows are discounted using a 
weighted average cost of capital (“wacc”) of 8 percent, as a high degree of the cash flows are related to firm orders and existing service contracts. 
the fair value measurement of the 50 percent shares furthermore include a fair value assessment of lost cash flows related to a potential non-compete period, had a 
third party acquired vestas’ 50 percent shares in mvow. the valuation is based on an assessment of cash flows from orders potentially lost to a competitor in a likely 
non-compete period of two years in which it has been assessed that expected orders of 5,000 mw in the offshore market potentially will be contracted by vestas 
subject to the current market conditions. furthermore, the estimate is based on a high discount rate, as a potential competitor would have assessed the expected 
cash flow highly uncertain. for this reason the cash flow are discounted using a wacc of 10 percent.

key accounting estimate
estimate regarding fair value assessment of net assets acquired
material net assets acquired for which estimates have been applied in the 
fair value assessment, including most significantly intangible assets and 
warranty provisions, have been recognised using the following valuation 
techniques.
intangible assets
intangible assets include development assets, order backlog and service 
contracts acquired.
development assets
development assets are related to the development of offshore wind turbine 
platforms . the measurement of the assets is based on a cost replacement 
approach. i.e. the measurement is based on expected costs to develop similar 
assets. development assets of total eur 239m have been recognised as 
intangible assets in the opening balance.
order backlog and service contracts
order backlog and preferred supplier asset related to the wind turbine 
business have been measured using a multi-period excess earnings model 
(mpee) in which the present value of future expected cash flows from existing 
and expected contracts have been valued using a wacc of 7 percent. in total 
the order backlog together with the preferred supplier asset have been valued 
at eur 118m based on expected orders of total 4,619 mw in a period of 
five years. in addition, existing and expected service contracts from orders 
have been valued at eur 379m using a wacc of 7 percent and based on 
expected revenue from the service portfolio of eur 5,825m over a period of 
approximately 30 years.     
further main value drivers in the mpee model assessed include an 
assessment of the probability of contracting as well as the likelihood of 
renewal of service contracts. direct and fixed costs are estimated based on 
experience within the wind turbine and service business.
inventory
the inventory is measured at net realisable value less costs of disposal and a 
reasonable profit allowance. 
trade receivables
fair value of trade receivables has been measured at the contractual amount 
expected to be received. the collectability has been taken into consideration 
but no significant provision for bad debt has been recognised based on low 
historical loss rates. the gross receivables have not been discounted as 
maturity on the receivables is generally very short. 
warranty provisions
the warranty provision of eur 203m is measured as the amount expected 
to be paid to settle the obligation. the estimate is based on expectations in 
relation to both known and unknown warranty cases and include estimates 
on the costs related to work hours, hourly rate, raw materials as well as the 
likelihood of future warranty claims being raised. the estimates are based on 
historical experience from supply and installation of wind turbines.
lease liabilities and right of use assets
lease liabilities have been measured at the present value of the remaining 
lease payments  discounted using incremental borrowing rate estimated at 
the acquisition date. a corresponding amount has been recognised as right-
of-use assets.
tax
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the closing date. deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent taxable profits are expected to be 
available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. tax 
liabilities include provisions made for tax treatments potentially challenged 
by local tax authorities. the assessment is based on experience with disputes 
on allocation of profits between different jurisdictions.
acquisition of sowitec in 2019
in 2019, vestas gained control of sowitec. the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date were provisionally estimated and disclosed 
in the annual report for 2019. in 2020 the provisional values were finalised without any changes.

7. basis for preparation
 
7.1 general accounting policies
the annual report of vestas wind systems a/s comprises the consolidated 
financial statements of vestas wind systems a/s and its subsidiaries and sep-
arate financial statements of the parent company, vestas wind systems a/s.
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the 
eu and the additional danish disclosure requirements for listed companies, 
the danish statutory order on adoption of ifrs issued pursuant to the dan-
ish financial statements act. 
basis of preparation 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the histor-
ical cost method, except for the derivative financial instruments and market-
able securities, which are measured at fair value and non-current assets held 
for sale, which are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. 
the accounting policies remain unchanged for the consolidated financial 
statements compared to 2019.
the consolidated financial statements are presented in million euro. 
this note describes the general accounting policies. other accounting policies 
are described in the separate notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
materiality in the financial reporting 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, vestas dis-
closes the information required according to ifrs, unless such information is 
deemed immaterial or irrelevant. 
a judgement is made of whether more detailed specifications are necessary 
in the presentation of vestas’ assets, liabilities, financial position, and results. 
all judgements are made with due consideration of legislation and the consol-
idated financial statements as a whole presenting a true and fair view. 
consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements comprise vestas wind systems a/s 
(the parent company) and the subsidiaries over which vestas wind systems 
a/s exercises control. vestas wind systems a/s and its subsidiaries together 
are referred to as the group. 
joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures 
depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. vestas 
has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be 
joint ventures. 
an overview of vestas legal entities is provided on pages 114-115. 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared from the financial 
statements of the parent company and subsidiaries by combining account-
ing items of a uniform nature, with subsequent elimination of intercompany 
income and expenses, shareholdings, intercompany balances and dividends 
as well as unrealised profits and losses on transactions between consolidated 
entities. 
the consolidated financial statements are based on financial statements pre-
pared under the accounting policies of vestas. 
translation policies 
functional currency and presentation currency 
assets, liabilities and transactions of each of the reporting entities of vestas 
are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates (the functional currency). transactions in currencies other 
than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currencies. the func-
tional currency of the parent company is danish kroner (dkk); however, due 
to vestas’ international relations, the consolidated financial statements are 
presented in euro (eur).
translation into presentation currency 
the balance sheet is translated into the presentation currency at the euro rate 
at the balance sheet date. in the income statement the transaction date rates 
are based on average rates for the individual months to the extent that this 
does not materially distort the presentation of the underlying transactions. 
translation of transactions and amounts 
transactions in foreign currencies are initially translated into the functional cur-
rency at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. exchange adjustments 
arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at 
the dates of payment are recognised as financial income or financial costs in the 
income statement. receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign 
currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date. exchange adjustments arising due to differences 
between the rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction date rates are 
recognised as financial income or financial costs in the income statement. 
translation of vestas entities 
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of foreign entities 
with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency of 
vestas, income statements are translated at transaction date rates, and bal-
ance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date. the transaction date rates are based on average rates for the individual 
months to the extent that this does not materially distort the presentation of 
the underlying transaction. exchange adjustments arising on the translation 
of the opening equity of foreign entities at exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and on the translation of income statements from transaction date 
rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
exchange adjustments of balances with foreign entities that are treated as 
part of the total net investment in the entity in question are recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. 
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of investments 
accounted for using the equity method with functional currencies that differ 
from the presentation currency of vestas, the shares of results for the year are 
translated at average exchange rates. the shares of equity including goodwill 
are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. exchange 
adjustments arising on the translation of the share of the opening equity of 
foreign investments accounted for using the equity method at exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date and on the translation of the share of results for 
the year from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the balance sheet 
date are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
on full or partial disposal of foreign entities, resulting in a loss of control or 
on repayment of balances treated as part of the net investment, the share of 
the accumulated exchange adjustments recognised in other comprehensive 
income, is recognised in the income statement at the same time as any profit 
or loss on the disposal. 
income statement 
financial investments
financial investments consist of interest-bearing investments which do 
not meet the definition for cash and cash equivalents. on initial recognition 
financial investments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. subse-
quently assets held within the business model hold to collect are re-measured 
at amortised cost and assets hold to sell are remeasured at fair value through 
profit or loss. any changes in the fair values of financial investments remeas-
ured at fair value are recognised in the income statement as financial items.
equity 
translation reserve 
the translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements comprises 
exchange rate adjustments arising on the translation of the financial state-
ments of foreign entities from their functional currencies into the presenta-
tion currency of vestas (eur). 
upon full or part realisation of the net investment in foreign entities, exchange 
adjustments are recognised in the income statement.
cash flow hedging reserve 
the cash flow hedging reserve in the consolidated financial statements 
comprises gains and losses on fair value adjustments of forward exchange 
contracts concerning future transactions as well as hedging in connection 
with commodities. 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement shows vestas’ cash flows for the year, broken down 
by operating, investing and financing activities, changes for the year in cash 
and cash equivalents as well as vestas’ cash and cash equivalents at the 
beginning and end of the year. cash flows relating to acquired entities are rec-
ognised from the date of acquisition. cash flows relating to entities disposed 
of are recognised until the date of disposal. 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the net profit/loss for 
the year adjusted for non-cash operating items such as depreciation, amorti-
sation and impairment losses, provisions, changes in working capital, interest 
received and paid and income tax paid. working capital comprises current 
assets less short-term debt, which does not include current bank loans. 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows from business 
acquisitions and disposals and from acquisitions and disposals of intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment as well as other non-current assets. the 
cash flow effect of business acquisitions and sales is shown separately. the 
establishment of leases is treated as non-cash transactions. 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities comprise changes to the amount or com-
position of vestas’ share capital and related expenses as well as the raising 
of loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt, repayment of lease liabilities, 
acquisition and sale of treasury shares together with distribution of dividends 
to shareholders. 
reporting under the esef regulation
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the european 
single electronic format (esef regulation) has introduced a single electronic 
reporting format for the annual financial reports of issuers with securities 
listed on the eu regulated markets.
the esef regulation sets out the following main requirements: (1) issuers 
shall draw up and disclose their annual financial reports using the xhtml 
format; and (2) issuers that draw-up their primary consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with ifrs as endorsed by the eu shall tag those 
consolidated financial statements using inline extensible business reporting 
language (ixbrl) and with effect from the 2022 annual report block-tag the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the combination of the xhtml format with the ixbrl tags makes the annual 
financial reports both human-readable and machine-readable, thus enhancing 
accessibility, analysis and comparability of the information included in the 
annual financial reports.
ixbrl tags shall comply with the esef taxonomy, which is included in the 
esef regulation and developed based on the ifrs taxonomy published by 
the ifrs foundation.
as part of the tagging process financial statement line items are marked 
up to elements in the esef taxonomy. if a financial statement line item is 
not defined in the esef taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy is created. 
extensions have to be anchored to elements in the esef taxonomy, except for 
extensions which are subtotals.
the annual report submitted to the danish financial supervisory authority 
(the officially appointed mechanisms) consists of the xhtml document 
together with some technical files all included in a zip file named vws-2020-
12-31.zip.
key definitions
xhtml (extensible hypertext markup language) is a text-based markup 
language used to structure and mark up content such as text, images, and 
hyperlinks in documents that are displayed as web pages in an updated 
standard web browser like chrome and internet explorer.
ixbrl tags (or inline xbrl tags) are hidden meta-information embedded in the 
source code of an xhtml document in accordance with the inline xbrl 1.1 
specification, which enables the conversion of xhtml-formatted information 
into a machine-readable xbrl data record by appropriate software. 
the tagging process is a process where ixbrl tags are applied to financial 
statement line items, etc. 
taxonomy is an electronic dictionary of business reporting elements used to report 
business data. a taxonomy element is an element defined in a taxonomy that is 
used for the machine-readable labeling of information in an xbrl data record.

7.3 change in accounting policies
implementation of new accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations
the following accounting standards, amendments (ias and ifrs) and inter-
pretations have been implemented as at 1 january 2020: 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 “definition of material” 
• amendments to ifrs 3 “business combinations” 
• amendments to “references to the conceptual framework in ifrs stand-
ards” 
• interest rate benchmark reform (amendment to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7) 
the implementation has not had a significant impact on recognition, meas-
urement or disclosures in the annual report 2020 and is not expected to 
have significant impact on the financial reporting for future periods. 
new standards and interpretations, not yet adopted by eu
iasb has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations 
that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been imple-
mented in the consolidated financial statements for 2020. vestas will adopt 
the accounting standards and interpretations when they become mandatory. 
 
7.2 key accounting estimates and judgements
when preparing the consolidated financial statements of vestas, manage-
ment makes several accounting estimates and assumptions, which impacts 
the recognition and measurement of vestas’ financial statements. 
the key accounting estimates and judgements, which may have a significant 
impact on the financial statements are listed below. the nature of accounting 
impact of key accounting estimates and judgements is described in the rele-
vant notes.
the impact of key accounting estimates and judgements is divided into three 
categories from low to high. the rating is based on a combined assessment of 
materiality, complexity, subjectivity and estimation uncertainty and indicates 
the impact on amounts recognised and carrying values of assets or liabilities:
••• low 
••• medium 
••• high
key accounting estimates 
the key accounting estimates made are based on assumptions, that are sup-
ported by experience, historical trends and other factors that management 
assesses to be reasonable, but that by nature are associated with inherent 
uncertainty and unpredictability.
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
if necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised. management considers the key accounting estimates to be reasona-
ble and appropriate based on currently available information.
key accounting judgements
key accounting judgments are made when applying certain accounting poli-
cies. management considers the accounting judgements made are consistent 
and reflect the most fair and true view of vestas’ financial position and results 
of the group’s operations.

3.4 investments in subsidiaries and associates including  
joint venture
accounting policies
investments in subsidiaries and associates including joint venture are 
recognised and measured in the financial statements of the parent company 
under the equity method.
on acquisition of subsidiaries and associates including joint venture, the 
difference between cost of acquisition and net asset value of the entity 
acquired is determined at the date of acquisition after the individual assets 
and liabilities having been adjusted to fair value (the acquisition method) and 
allowing for the recognition of any restructuring provisions relating to the 
entity acquired. any remaining positive differences in connection with the 
acquisition of subsidiaries and associates including joint venture are included 
in the items ”investments in subsidiaries” and ”investments in associates 
including joint venture”. the items ”income/(loss) from investments in 
subsidiaries” and ”income/ (loss) from investments in associates including 
joint venture” in the income statement includes the proportionate share of the 
profit after tax less goodwill amortisation.
the items ”investments in subsidiaries” and ”investments in associates 
including joint venture” in the balance sheet includes the proportionate 
ownership share of the net asset value of the entities calculated under the 
accounting policies of the parent company with deduction or addition of 
unrealised intercompany profits or losses and with addition of any remaining 
value of the positive differences (goodwill).
subsidiaries and associates including joint venture with a negative net 
assets value are measured at eur 0, and any receivables from these are 
written down by the parent company’s share of the negative net asset value, 
if impaired. any legal or constructive obligation of the parent company to 
cover the negative balance of the subsidiaries and associates including joint 
venture is recognised as provisions.
the total net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associates 
including joint venture is transferred upon distribution of profit to ”reserve for 
net revaluation under the equity method” under equity.
gains and losses on disposals or winding up of subsidiaries and associates 
including joint venture are calculated as the difference between the sales 
value or cost of winding up and the carrying amount of the net assets at 
the date of acquisition including goodwill and expected loss of disposal or 
winding up. the gains or losses are included in the income statement.

management’s statement
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
revenue recognition
recognition of the group’s revenue is complex due to several 
types of customer contracts utilised, including sale of wind 
turbines and wind power plants (supply-only, supply-and-
installation and turnkey), service sales and sale of spare parts.
we focused on this area as recognition of revenue involves 
significant judgement and accounting estimates made by 
management including, whether contracts contain multiple 
performance obligations which should be accounted for 
separately and the most appropriate method for recognition 
of revenue for the identified performance obligations in the 
contracts. this includes assessing whether performance 
obligations in supply-and-installation contracts are satisfied 
at a point in time or over time. further, it comprises the point 
in time when transfer of control has occurred regarding sale 
of wind turbines and sale of spare parts, and assessing the 
degree of completion of project and service contracts, which 
are accounted for over time. the total consideration for 
service contracts is subject to estimates regarding variable 
elements and the degree of completion for project and service 
contracts is subject to estimates regarding the remaining 
costs to complete the contracts. furthermore, the reduction 
in revenue related to damages or penalties regarding project 
and service contracts is subject to estimates.
finally, significant estimates are involved in allocation of the 
consideration to the individual performance obligations in a 
contract.
refer to note 1.2, note 2.3 and note 2.4 in the consoli-
dated financial statements. 
we obtained an understanding of the group’ applied revenue recognition policies. we tested the 
relevant internal controls in this area implemented by management to ensure the completeness, 
accuracy and timing of recognised revenue, including controls over the degree of completion of 
relevant project and service contracts at year-end.
we reviewed a sample of both project and service contracts to assess whether the method 
for recognition of revenue was relevant and consistent with ifrs 15, and had been applied 
consistently. we focused on contract classification, allocation of fixed and variable consideration 
and cost to the individual performance obligations and timing of transfer of control. for supply-
and-installation projects with revenue recognition over time we reviewed management’s 
assessment of a sample of projects and challenged the judgement made by management in terms 
of no alternative use of the project. where a contract contained multiple elements, we considered 
management’s judgements as to whether they comprised performance obligations that should be 
accounted for separately, and, in such cases, challenged the significant assumptions used in the 
allocation of the consideration to each performance obligation. 
we evaluated and challenged the significant judgements and accounting estimates made 
by management in applying vestas’ accounting policy to a sample of specific contracts and 
separable performance obligations of contracts. as part of this we obtained evidence to support 
them, including inspecting signed contracts, delivery records, cash receipts and project plans and 
reconciled the revenue recognised to the underlying accounting records. we obtained a sample of 
management’s calculations of the degree of completion of project and service contracts, which are 
accounted for over time, and matched a sample of source data used in management’s calculation 
to supporting evidence, and evaluated the judgements and assumptions applied. we further 
challenged the estimated cost to complete for the sampled contracts. we also considered the 
historical outcome of accounting estimates used in prior periods.
we reviewed the disclosures included in the notes and sample tested additional disclosure 
information to accounting records.
to the shareholders of vestas wind systems a/s 
report on the audit of the financial statements
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the group’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and of 
the results of the group’s operations and cash flows for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in accordance with internatio-
nal financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and further 
requirements in the danish financial statements act.
moreover, in our opinion, the parent company financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the parent company’s financial position at 
31 december 2020 and of the results of the parent company’s opera-
tions for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in accord-
ance with the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report to the 
audit committee and the board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements of vestas wind systems a/s for the financial 
year 1 january to 31 december 2020 comprise income statement, 
balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies for the group as well as for 
the parent company, and statement of comprehensive income and 
statement of cash flows for the group. collectively referred to as the 
“financial statements”.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards 
on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements applicable in den-
mark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are 
further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report.  
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international 
ethics standards board for accountants’ code of ethics for profes-
sional accountants (iesba code) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled our other ethical respon-
sibilities in accordance with the iesba code.  
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not 
provided.
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of vestas wind systems a/s on 5 
may 1999 for the financial year 1999. we have been reappointed 
annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted 
engagement of 22 years including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judge-
ment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial state-
ments for 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opin-
ion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

how our audit addressed the key audit matter
warranty provisions
the group’s product warranties primarily cover 
expected costs to repair or replace components 
with defects or functional errors and financial losses 
suffered by the group’s customers in connection with 
unplanned suspension of operations. warranties are 
usually granted for a two-year period from legal 
transfer of the turbine, however, in certain cases, a 
warranty of up to five years is granted.
we focused on this area as the completeness and 
valuation of the expected outcome of warranty 
provisions requires significant  management judgement 
and the use of significant assumptions concerning 
expected failure rates and expected repair costs giving 
rise to inherent uncertainty in the accounting estimates 
recorded in the financial statements.  
refer to note 3.6 in the consolidated financial 
statements.
we tested the relevant internal controls regarding completeness of warranty provisions and how 
management assesses valuation of provisions.
we performed substantive audit procedures on the methodology, data, assumptions and model used 
by management to calculate the provision and through selection of a sample of specific provisions.
we challenged the significant assumptions underlying the valuation of provisions by checking and 
corroborating the inputs used to calculate the provisions, including interviewing project managers, 
cost controllers and management regarding individual cases. we assessed specific warranty 
provisions held for individual cases to evaluate whether the warranty provisions were sufficient to 
cover expected costs at year-end and whether the disclosures included in the notes appropriately 
reflected the risk.
further, we assessed the level of historical warranty claims to assess whether the total warranty 
provisions held at year-end were sufficient to cover expected costs in light of known and expected 
cases and standard warranty periods provided.
tax risks
the group operates in a complex multinational tax 
environment and the group is part in tax cases with 
domestic and foreign tax authorities.
the group has recognised provisions in respect of 
uncertain tax positions.
furthermore, the group has recognised write-downs 
on deferred tax assets related to the uncertainty about 
potential future utilisation of these tax assets.
we focused on this area as the amounts involved are 
material and as the valuation of the provision and 
deferred tax assets is associated with significant 
accounting estimates and judgements.
refer to note 5.1 and 5.2 in the consolidated finan-
cial statements.
we evaluated relevant internal controls regarding completeness of records of uncertain tax positions 
and management’s procedure for estimating the provision for uncertain tax provisions and write-down 
of deferred tax assets.
in understanding and evaluating management’s accounting estimates and judgements, we considered 
the status of recent tax authority audits and enquiries, the outcome of previous claims, judgmental 
positions taken in tax returns and estimates and developments in the tax environment.
we used pwc tax specialists to evaluate and challenge the adequacy of management’s significant 
assumptions and read correspondence with tax authorities to assess management’s accounting 
estimates.
we evaluated the group’s model for valuation of deferred tax assets, including the data used to 
estimate the expected future taxable income.
we reviewed the disclosures included in the notes and sample tested additional disclosure information 
to accounting records.
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review pages 003-062 
and pages 133-139.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s 
review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our respon-
sibility is to read management’s review and, in doing so, consider 
whether management’s review is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or other-
wise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s review includes the 
disclosures required by the danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s 
review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any material misstatement in 
management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the  
financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated finan-
cial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with inter-
national financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and fur-
ther requirements in the danish financial statements act and for the 
preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with the danish financial statements act, 
and for such internal control as management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going con-
cern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless manage-
ment either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assur-
ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional require-
ments applicable in denmark, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s internal 
control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause the group or the parent company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in inter-
nal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde-
pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse con-
sequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial statements we performed proce-
dures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of vestas 
wind systems a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 
2020 with the filename vws-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all mate-
rial respects, in compliance with the commission delegated regulation 
(eu) 2019/815 on the european single electronic format (esef reg-
ulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the 
annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the consoli-
dated financial statements.
management is responsible for the preparation of an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility includes:
· the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format;
·  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags including 
extensions and the anchoring thereof for all financial information 
required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;
·  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the 
consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable 
format; and
·  for such internal control as management determines necessary to 
enable the preparation of annual reports that are compliant with 
the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the 
annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with 
the esef regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to 
issue a report that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent 
of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material departures from the require-
ments set out in the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error. the 
procedures include:
·  testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format;
·  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging process 
and of internal control over the tagging process; 
· evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements;
·  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl 
elements selected from the esef taxonomy and the creation of 
extension elements where no suitable element in the esef taxonomy 
has been identified;
·  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in 
the esef taxonomy; and
·  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consolidated 
financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of vestas wind systems a/s for the 
financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file name 
vws-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compli-
ance with the esef regulation.

statements
to the stakeholders of vestas wind systems a/s
vestas wind systems a/s engaged us to provide limited assurance on 
the sustainability key figures stated in the annual report for the period 
1 january to 31 december 2020.
our conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, 
nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the 
sustainability key figures as stated on page 7 in the vestas wind sys-
tems a/s annual report 2020 are free of material misstatements and 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting 
policies (notes to sustainability key figures) as stated on page 134-
135 of the annual report 2020.
this conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the 
remainder of our report.
what we are assuring 
the scope of our work was limited to assurance over the sustainability 
key figures in vestas wind systems a/s’ annual report 2020.
professional standards applied and level of assurance
we performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with 
international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (revised) 
‘assurance engagements other than audits and reviews of historical 
financial information’, and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, 
in accordance with international standard on assurance engagements 
3410 “assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements”. green-
house gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors 
and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases. 
a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assess-
ment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and 
the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; conse-
quently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engage-
ment is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been 
obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control
we have complied with the code of ethics for professional accountants 
issued by the international ethics standards board for accountants, 
which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded 
on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional compe-
tence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. the firm 
applies international standard on quality control 1 and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including doc-
umented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regula-
tory requirements. our work was carried out by an independent multidis-
ciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
understanding reporting and measurement 
methodologies
data and information in the sustainability key figures need to be read 
and understood together with the accounting policies, which manage-
ment is solely responsible for selecting and applying. the absence of 
a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate 
and measure non-financial information allows for different, but accept-
able, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between 
entities and over time. 
work performed
we are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the 
risk of material misstatement of the data. in doing so and based on our 
professional judgement, we:
 · obtained an understanding of vestas wind systems a/s’ control 
environment and information systems relevant to quantification and 
reporting of social and environmental data, through inquiries;
 · conducted site visits in china and conducted conference calls with 
sites in denmark and usa to assess the completeness of social and 
environmental data sources, data collection methods, source data 
and relevant assumptions applicable to the sites;
 · on a sample test basis agreed and reconciled reported data to 
underlying documentation for sites in india, new zealand and uk. the 
sites selected for testing were chosen taking into consideration their 
size and whether selected in prior periods;
 · conducted interviews and show-me meetings with group functions 
to assess consolidation processes, use of company-wide systems 
and controls performed at group level as well as test of social and 
environmental data prepared at group level to underlying documentation; 
 · conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations 
submitted by all reporting entities for consolidation at group level; and
 · evaluated the obtained evidence.
management’s responsibilities
management of vestas wind systems a/s is responsible for:
 · designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over 
information relevant to the preparation of the sustainability key 
figures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; 
 · establishing objective accounting policies for preparing data; and
 · measuring and reporting the sustainability key figures based on the 
accounting policies.
our responsibility
we are responsible for:
 · planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited 
assurance about whether the sustainability key figures are free from 
material misstatement, and are prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the accounting policies;
 · forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we 
have performed and the evidence obtained; and
 · reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of vestas wind systems a/s.

notes to sustainability key figures
basis for preparation of the statement
general reporting standards
the below description of accounting policies refers to the environmen-
tal, social, and governance indicators presented on page 007.
all vestas’ wholly owned companies are covered by the report. newly 
established companies are included from the time of production start, 
and companies are excluded from the reporting from the time when 
they leave vestas’ control. 
acquired companies are included from the time when coming under 
vestas’ control. for the offshore business in the joint venture, mhi 
vestas offshore wind, however, of which vestas took full ownership on 
14 december 2020, data was not included in the 2020 reporting, as 
the impact was insignificant. 
from 2021 and onwards, data from the offshore business will be 
included in the sustainability key figures. the existing sustainability 
strategy targets will be maintained and include offshore performance, 
with the adjustment that the baseline for scope 3 carbon emissions will 
have to be recalculated.
defining materiality
vestas bases its materiality assessment on an analysis of significant 
economic, environmental, and social impacts of the company’s activi-
ties. the analysis is based on internal priorities as well as experience 
from dialogue with and direct involvement of customers, investors, 
policy makers, employees, and media. the result of the analysis is 
incorporated in the vestas sustainability report, which is published on 
an annual basis.
change in accounting policies
the “sustainability key figures” have been revised after the materi-
ality assessment conducted in 2020. indicators for environmental 
accidents, breaches of internal inspection conditions, and absence 
due to illness are no longer considered material as numbers are low 
and performance is good. indicators for the environmental part of the 
sustainability strategy are included in the form of recyclability rate 
of hub and blade, and indirect emissions of co₂e from the value chain 
(scope 3, absolute value as well as relative to mwh generated). with 
vestas’ commitment to lead the way in social responsibility in the 
renewables industry, as communicated in september 2020, indicators 
for human rights issues have been included in the form of community 
grievances, community beneficiaries, and social due diligence on 
projects in scope. to document the impact of vestas’ products, annual 
co₂e avoided by the installed fleet is included. the status of the key 
figures is monitored closely and for relevant key indicators, specific 
targets have been defined. strategic kpis and targets can be found on 
page 023.
environmental 
energy consumption, water withdrawal, waste generation, and carbon 
emissions are reported for the accounting period on the basis of sig-
nificance. all production facilities are included as well as larger offices, 
warehouses, and other facilities, ensuring a comprehensive and suffi-
cient statement of these environmental aspects. all data are registered 
in vestas’ hse system.
utilisation of resources
electricity, gas, and district heating are measured on the basis of quan-
tities consumed according to direct meter readings per site including 
related administration. consumption of electricity comprises electricity 
purchased externally. oil for heating is stated on the basis of external 
purchases and meter readings at the end of the reporting period. fuel 
for internal transportation, including for cars owned by the company or 
fuel for employees’ benefit cars for which the company pays the fuel per 
credit card as well as fuel used for internal transport on project sites 
and production such as forklifts, has been recognised on the basis of 
supplier statements. electricity from renewable energy sources is cal-
culated on the basis of supplier statements. only 100 percent renewa-
ble electricity is counted as renewable electricity. 
renewable energy is energy generated from natural resources, which 
are all naturally replenished – such as wind, sunlight, water, biomass, 
and geothermal heat. nuclear power is not considered to be renewable 
energy. 
the withdrawal of water is stated as measured withdrawal of fresh 
water on the basis of supplier statements and meter readings. 
waste
volume of waste is stated on the basis of weight slips received from 
the waste recipients for deliveries, apart from a few types of waste 
and non-significant volumes which are estimated on the basis of sub-
scription arrangement and load. waste disposal method is based on 
supplier statements.
recyclability rate of hub and blade is calculated as the recyclable share 
of the total rotor (i.e. hub and blade) mass. the measure is based upon 
the material composition of all turbine types that were produced and 
shipped in the reporting year.  recyclability rates of different materials 
and component types are quantified and estimated based upon infor-
mation from life cycle assessment (lca) reports of each type of turbine 
shipped in the year, which can be found at the corporate website. 
carbon emissions
carbon emissions are measured using the carbon dioxide equivalent 
(co₂e) to include relevant greenhouse gasses according to the green-
house gas protocol. a distinction is made between scope 1, 2, and 3 
emissions, as also defined by the greenhouse gas protocol. 
scope 1: direct emissions of co₂e are calculated on the basis of deter-
mined amounts of fuel for own transport and the direct consumption 
of oil and gas, with the usage of standard factors published by the uk 
department for environment, food & rural affairs (2020). 
scope 2: scope 2 covers emissions released in connection with the 
consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, of which 
steam and cooling are not used by vestas. indirect emissions of co₂e 
from consumption of electricity outside europe are calculated using 
national grid emission factors published by the international energy 
agency (2020).  indirect co₂e emissions from consumption of electric-
ity in europe are calculated with residual mix emission factors from the 
association of issuing bodies (2018). indirect co₂e emissions from 
district heating are calculated using the emission factor from the uk 
department for environment, food & rural affairs (2020). 
scope 3: indirect emissions of co₂e from the value chain are reported 
based on the greenhouse gas protocol which divides the scope 3 
inventory into 15 subcategories. the largest part of the emissions is 
in the category ‘purchased goods and services’, where co₂e emissions 
from materials going into products are calculated based on lcas 
following iso 14040 & 14044, publicly available at vestas.com. the 
measure is based upon the material composition of all turbine types 
that were produced and shipped in the reporting year. co₂e emission 
data of different materials and component types are quantified and 
estimated based upon information from lca reports on each type of 
wind turbine shipped in the year. similarly, the co₂e emissions of all 
produced and shipped turbines in the reporting year are derived from 
the lca reports, accounting for specific material quantities purchased. 
lca reports can be found at the corporate website. other purchased 
goods and services as well as capital goods and waste generated in 
operations are estimated based on spend using defra factors for indi-
rect emissions from the supply chain (2011). fuel- and energy-related 
activities are calculated using defra factors for emissions related to 
the production of fuel and energy. co₂ emissions from upstream trans-
portation are estimated for global transportation based on the lca 
reports for weight and distance of components transported and defra 
carbon emissions factors. business travel emissions are provided by 
the travel agency. employee commuting is estimated based on average 
number of employees with the usage of standard factors published by 
the uk department for environment, food & rural affairs (2020). end-
of-life treatment of sold products is estimated based upon material 
composition of all produced and shipped wind turbines in the reporting 
year and defra emission factors for waste treatment. vestas’ 50 per-
cent share of the scope 1 & 2 emissions in the joint venture mitsubishi 
vestas offshore wind has been included in vestas’ scope 3 emissions. 
the subcategories c8-11 and c13-c14 are not relevant for vestas, as 
there are no greenhouse gas emissions within these categories.
in relation to the target to reduce carbon emissions in the value chain, 
indirect emissions of co₂e from the value chain per mwh generated 
include 70 percent of the scope 3 emissions. the amount of mwh 
generated is based on the number and type of wind turbines produced 
and shipped in the financial year along with contracted values for wind 
turbine capacity factor and lifetime.
products
co₂e avoided is to be understood as the volume of emissions, which is 
avoided by using the wind turbines as source, compared the average 
level of co₂e impact involved in electricity generation. 
expected co₂e avoided over the lifetime of the mw  produced and 
shipped  during the period is calculated on the basis of the wind tur-
bines (mw) produced and shipped during the reporting period, a capac-
ity factor of 34 percent in 2020, an expected lifetime of 20 years, and 
the latest updated standard factor of global average carbon emissions 
for electricity from the international energy agency (2019), at present 
485 grams of co₂e per kwh.
annual co₂e avoided by the total aggregated installed fleet is calcu-
lated on the basis of the total annual installed vestas wind turbines 
(mw) and global average co₂e emissions avoided per year of opera-
tion. the total co₂e avoided is an aggregation of each year since 1981, 
accounting for decommissioned wind turbines, based on an estimate of 
the average lifetime of a wind turbine.
social 
safety
the occupational safety data in the sustainability key figures are 
reported for all activities in vestas. lost time injuries (ltis) of all 
employees are stated on the basis of registration in vestas’ incident 
management system of occupational incidents that have caused 
at least one workday of absence after the day of the injury, and the 
number includes fatalities. total recordable injuries (tri) include ltis, 
restricted work injuries, and medical treatment injuries. injuries and 
working hours for externally employed workers under vestas’ supervi-
sion are included in both measures. 
the incidence of injuries is defined as the number of injuries per one 
million working hours. the number of working hours is measured on the 
basis of daily timecards registered in the payroll system for hourly-paid 
employees, and prescribed working hours for salaried employees 
excluding e.g. holidays, absence due to illness and maternity leave. for 
externally employed workers under vestas’ supervision, the injuries 
are reported by vestas, and working hours are reported by the external 
suppliers. 
employees, diversity, and inclusion
the number of employees is calculated as the number of full-time 
equivalents (fte) with a direct contract with vestas registered in 
vestas’ hr system. 
employee indicators (the share of women in the board of directors, 
executive management, and leadership positions) are calculated based 
on headcounts at end of the reporting period. employee information is 
determined on the basis of extracts from the company’s ordinary regis-
tration systems with specification of gender and management level by 
career track (people leaders, specialists, project managers). 
human rights
vestas registers and handles community concerns or complaints 
caused by vestas or its contractors in the vestas incident management 
system (ims). the measure “community grievances” covers the total 
number of community complaints registered in ims in the reporting 
year in connection with a wind farm project and associated facilities, a 
vestas factory, or a r&d centre. 
“community beneficiaries” are individuals that have benefitted directly,  
financially or by way of upgraded skills, from vestas’ community devel-
opment initiatives implemented during the reporting period in connec-
tion to a wind farm project and associated facilities, a vestas factory, 
or a r&d centre. where a household is a beneficiary, vestas calculates 
the household size based on the country average defined by the un 
department of economic and social affairs (un 2017). community 
development initiatives are identified in collaboration with local stake-
holders, including community members, and centred around the un 
sdgs with special focus on the six primary sdgs selected by vestas.
the measure “due diligence on projects in scope” reflects the share of 
wind power projects in scope, which have materialised as firm orders 
during the reporting period, and on which the social due diligence 
(sdd) process has been applied. the wind farm projects in scope for 
vestas’ sdd are 1) all engineering, procurement and construction 
(epc) projects in emerging markets, 2) all supply-and-installation 
projects of 100 mw or above in emerging markets, and 3) projects in 
oecd countries with a risk rating of ‘extreme’ or ‘high’ according to the 
verisk maplecroft ‘indigenous people” risk index on risks related to  
indigenous people’s lands, territories or livelihoods under threat (via a 
risk mapping performed each year in january). in this context, ‘emerg-
ing markets’ are non-oecd, high-income countries, as defined by oecd. 
governance
whistle-blower system
all reports made to the ethicsline whistle-blower hotline are investi-
gated thoroughly, with the purpose of identifying whether a violation 
of the code of conduct has taken place. upon the completion of the 
investigation, cases are classified as either substantiated or unsub-
stantiated. at the end of the reporting year, the total number of whis-
tle-blower cases are calculated.
