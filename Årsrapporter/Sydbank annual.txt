sydbank ended 2020 with a satisfactory profit. in 
2021 profit is expected to be higher than in 2020.
sydbank’s 2020 financial statements show a profit before tax of dkk 1,021m compared to dkk 
1,081m in 2019. the decrease of dkk 60m is primarily attributable to impairment charges for 
loans and advances which represent an expense of dkk 47m compared to an income of dkk 
97m in 2019. profit before tax equals a return of 8.6% p.a. on average equity. 
profit for the year after tax represents dkk 799m against dkk 853m in 2019, equal to a return 
on average equity of 6.6%. at the beginning of 2020 profit after tax was projected to be in the 
range of dkk 700-1,000m.
ceo karen frøsig comments on the year’s results:
- it is good news that after a challenging year affected by covid-19 we can deliver a profit at the 
very top of the most recently announced range of dkk 700-800m and also achieve our objective 
of a top 3 ranking among the largest banks measured in terms of return on equity.
- as a result of the acquisition of alm. brand bank, total credit intermediation has risen sharply 
by more than dkk 20bn. the acquisition shows that sydbank wishes to acquire and merge with 
banks with sydbank as the continuing bank. it also shows that we are interested in visionary 
partnerships that create value for customers and partners.
karen frøsig comments on banking in covid-19 times:
- covid-19 has turned the world upside down. our employees have been extremely flexible and 
have succeeded in providing advice to customers during a difficult time. it is particularly gratifying 
to see that our customers acknowledge that sydbank has been excellent at setting up online 
meetings and ensuring their quality.
- i am pleased that so far sydbank’s customers have handled the coronavirus crisis well. for 
reasons of prudence the management estimate related to covid-19 was raised by dkk 100m in 
q4 2020 and now totals dkk 325m. despite this increase impairment charges only represented 
an expense of dkk 1m in q4 2020.
board chairman lars mikkelgaard-jensen comments:
- after a year when the dividend was cancelled and the share buyback programme was termi-
nated prematurely, it is positive that we can distribute dividend to our shareholders again, which 
represents 30% of profit for the year. at the same time the acquisition of alm. brank bank creates 
long-term value for shareholders as profit before tax in 2022 is projected to increase by around 
dkk 200m. after the acquisition of alm. brand bank and a dividend distribution of dkk 238m the 
bank will continue to be well capitalised.
outlook for 2021
• growth is projected in the danish economy in 2021 despite expectations of negative growth 
influenced by covid-19 in the first 6 months.
• total income is expected to rise sharply as a result of the acquisition of alm. brand bank and 
measures implemented as regards deposits and fees.
• costs (core earnings) are projected to increase as a result of the acquisition of alm. brand bank.
• impairment charges for 2021 are forecast to be at a low level. in addition most of the amounts 
owed to the group by the mink industry are expected to be repaid in full, which could result in a 
reversal of impairment charges of up to dkk 150m.
• non-recurring costs are expected to be in the range of dkk 150-175m. the item consists of 
costs related to “a stronger bank”, costs to establish a bank/insurance partnership as well  
 
as costs related to the integration of alm. brand bank.
• profit after tax is expected to be in the range of dkk 850-1,150m.
• in light of the covid-19 crisis the outlook for 2021 is subject to greater uncertainty than usual.

tax of dkk 1,021m compared to dkk 1,081m in 2019. the

a return of 8.6% p.a. on average equity. 
profit for the year represents dkk 799m compared to dkk 
853m in 2019, equal to a return on average equity of 6.6% after

strategy – a stronger bank
at a time when the banking environment in denmark continues 
to be affected by macroeconomic factors such as negative inter-
est rates, low interest margins, subdued demand for loans and 
covid-19, it is necessary to show resilience and strength to make 
the necessary adjustments to operations. 
the strategy is a refinement strategy where sydbank’s com-
petitive strength will be boosted through an increase in quality 
in what we do. we will build a stronger bank with the purpose 
of enhancing sydbank’s market position. we will build on the 
foundation created during previous strategy periods and we 
will allocate and give priority to resources to improve our core 
business – banking! 
sydbank must deliver greater value to shareholders and custom-
ers. it must be easier to be an employee and sydbank must be 
more distinct. 
during 2020 we implemented a number of initiatives to help 
create a stronger bank, including the following:
• we have strengthened retail banking activities by acquiring 
alm. brand bank.
• we have increased future earnings by changing the terms and 
conditions of deposit products. 
• we have strengthened our proximity to customers by extend- 
ing our decentralised organisation. the number of danish 
regions has been increased from 9 to 12 and at the same time 
the regions have been boosted by relocating young customers 
and adding to the number of experts in each region. 
• we will increase our market area by opening new branches in 
2021, initially in frederikshavn and nyborg.
• we have strengthened our position – denmark’s corporate 
bank. this is thanks to a high level of customer satisfaction 
and a rising market share in the segment of companies with 
between 50 and 500 employees – the backbone of denmark’s 
corporate sector. 
• we have built a strong foundation for process automation in 
operations that will benefit customers as well as employees. 
we have adjusted the organisational structure of operations so 
it functions according to agile principles and methods. auto-
mation results in faster case processing, fewer errors and time 
savings.
the plan for the 3-year period 2019-2021 “a stronger bank” 
aims to ensure that the bank continues to consolidate its position.
we are building a stronger bank focusing on 3 themes:
• customer first
• more sydbank
• digitization.
customer first ensures that our stronger customer focus is 
maintained. the direct link between highly satisfied customers 
and a positive trend in the top line is the driving force behind the 
priority of this theme.  
more sydbank seeks to strengthen sydbank’s profile and visibil-
ity internally as well as externally. we will make “banking” more 
attractive to customers, employees and shareholders. we will 
create a more distinct identity and communicate our fundamen-
tal values more clearly.  
digitization is an investment in using the new technology 
that works to improve the customer’s digital relationship with 
sydbank and in our employees having even simpler and more 
efficient processes enabling them to spend their time on the 
customer. digitization is an investment in ensuring that sydbank 
remains a financially sound and well-run business. 
the strategic focus represents the values from the underlying 
philosophy and the bank’s core story with 3 promises – to its 
customers, to its employees and to its shareholders. you will 
know us for the value we create for our customers. you will know 
us for our belief that excellent and committed employees are our 
most important asset. and you will know us for always having a 
level of profitability that will enable us to remain an independent 
and resourceful bank. 
sydbank – what can we do for you. 
a strong capital position and good credit quality enable sydbank to distribute dividend equivalent to 
30% of profit for the year. at the same time the acquisition of alm. brank bank creates long-term value 
for shareholders as profit before tax is projected to increase by around dkk 200m as from 2022

summary
the strategic focus covers these areas:
• customer satisfaction
• employee engagement
• return on equity.
customer satisfaction
sydbank’s objective is to gain a top 3 ranking among the 6 larg-
est danish banks measured in terms of customer satisfaction in 
the corporate segment and the retail segment. in 2020 sydbank 
achieved this objective in both segments according to the sur-
veys conducted by aalund and epsi respectively.
employee engagement
sydbank considers excellent and committed employees to be its 
most important asset and aims to retain the present high level. 
this is monitored closely through internal employee engagement 
surveys. 
sydbank’s objective is to be best in class among financial insti-
tutions in denmark in surveys conducted by ennova. sydbank 
carries out one comprehensive survey every other year and more 
condensed surveys during the period leading up to the next ma-
jor survey. sydbank was best in class in all parameters in 2020. 
return on equity
sydbank’s objective is to achieve a top 3 ranking among the 6 
largest danish banks measured in terms of return on equity. in 
2020 sydbank received a number 3 ranking among the 6 largest 
banks.
sydbank’s rules to live by
sydbank’s 10 rules to live by bind its core story and strategy 
together. these rules clarify what we stand for and show the way 
forward for the bank in the short and long term. the 10 rules are 
described in more detail on page 32.
denmark’s corporate bank
sydbank is the bank for the backbone of the danish corporate 
sector. with a market share of more than 10% among small and 
medium-sized enterprises, sydbank is denmark’s 3rd largest 
corporate bank.  
as one of the best business partners, we will help to increase 
competitive strength and create value for our customers. com-
mon for all of them is their need for professional advice, good 
old-fashioned attentiveness, new technology and using what 
works – “banking”.
sydbank is a bank for most people but not the same bank for 
everyone. 
 
results for 2020
the negative interest rate environment combined with subdued 
demand for loans and fierce competition for bank loans and ad-
vances continue to squeeze the group’s net interest income. net 
interest income has fallen by dkk 7m to dkk 1,476m. income 
has been affected by a lower demand for loans by corporate 
clients which has been affected for instance by the government’s 
relief packages, which include deferral of vat and tax payments. 
as a result of uncertainty in connection with covid-19 corporate 
clients have wished to increase their cash resources, which the 
group has accommodated. 
other core income has risen by dkk 22m compared to 2019. 
total core income has gone up by dkk 15m to dkk 3,670m 
compared to 2019.
trading income has risen by dkk 54m to dkk 278m compared 
to 2019.

pared to 2019. 
costs (core earnings) have declined by dkk 9m to dkk 2,774m 
compared to 2019. 
impairment charges for loans and advances constitute an ex-
pense of dkk 47m. in 2019 impairment charges represented an 
income of dkk 97m.
core earnings for 2020 represent dkk 1,127m – a decline of 
dkk 66m compared to 2019.
together the group’s position-taking and liquidity handling 
generated negative earnings of dkk 31m in 2020 compared to 
negative earnings of dkk 61m in 2019.
profit before tax constitutes dkk 1,021m compared to dkk 
1,081m in 2019. tax has been calculated at dkk 222m. profit 
for the year amounts to dkk 799m compared to dkk 853m in 
2019.
bank loans and advances decreased by dkk 0.4bn in 2020.
total credit intermediation represented dkk 165.6bn at year-
end 2020 and rose by dkk 20.5bn in 2020.
return on shareholders’ equity before and after tax constitutes 
8.6% and 6.6% respectively against 9.7% and 7.5% in 2019.

earnings per share stands at dkk 12.8 compared to dkk 13.4 in 
2019.
 
during the year shareholders’ equity went up by dkk 746m to 
dkk 11,712m. the change comprises additions from profit for 
the year of dkk 754m, net purchases of own shares of dkk 3m 
as well as other equity adjustments of minus dkk 5m.
less the proposed dividend, the cet1 ratio and the capital ratio 
stood at 18.8% and 24.0% respectively at year-end 2020 com-
pared to 17.8% and 22.9% respectively at year-end 2019.
at 31 december 2020 the individual solvency need represented 
10.8% (2019: 10.8%).
sifi
sydbank has been designated as a sifi (systemically important 
financial institution) in denmark and there is an additional buffer 
requirement of 1.0% as regards cet1 capital. the intention is to 
bring danish sifi capital requirements on a par with the require-
ments in other comparable european countries. 
capital targets
the group’s capital targets are a cet1 ratio of around 14.5% and 
a capital ratio of around 18.5%. 
proposed dividend for 2020
the board of directors proposes – in compliance with the bank’s 
dividend policy – that a dividend of dkk 4.00 per share, equal to 
30% of the group’s profit after tax, be distributed and that dkk 
10m be donated to the sponsorship fund sydbank fonden. 
the group will continue to be highly capitalised after the pro-
posed dividend distribution. 
outlook for 2021
growth is projected in the danish economy in 2021 despite 
expectations of negative growth influenced by covid-19 in the 
first 6 months.
total income is expected to rise sharply as a result of the acqui-
sition of alm. brand bank and measures implemented as regards 
deposits and fees.
costs (core earnings) are projected to increase as a result of the 
acquisition of alm. brand bank.
impairment charges for 2021 are forecast to be at a low level. in 
addition most of the amounts owed to the group by the mink 
industry are expected to be repaid in full, which could result in a 
reversal of impairment charges of up to dkk 150m.
 
non-recurring costs are expected to be in the range of dkk  
150-175m. the item consists of costs related to “a stronger 
bank”, costs to establish a bank/insurance partnership as well   
as costs related to the integration of alm. brand bank.
profit after tax is expected to be in the range of dkk  
850-1,150m.
in light of the covid-19 crisis the outlook for 2021 is subject to 
greater uncertainty than usual. 
long-term performance impact of acquisition
of alm. brand bank
when the acquisition of alm. brand bank was announced, syd-
bank’s annual results were expected to improve by around dkk 
100m as a result of the acquisition as from 2022.
in 2021 profit before non-recurring items in the region of dkk 
150m is projected.  non-recurring items in relation to the acqui-
sition and the estalishment of the partnership with alm. brand 
bank are expected to represent around dkk 130m. consequent-
ly profit before tax of the activity acquired is forecast to be in the 
region of dkk 20m in 2021. 
in 2022 profit before tax of the activity acquired is projected to 
represent around dkk 200m.

to ensure a simple and cost effective group structure the banking 
activities of alm. brand bank were transferred to sydbank a/s 
as of 30 december 2020. the related subsidiaries alm. brand 
leasing a/s and ejendomsselskabet ab aps were transferred to 
sydbank a/s on the same date.
the purchase price of the alm. brand bank group represented 
dkk 1,897m, which has been paid in cash, covering the value of 
equity as of the acquisition date less intellectual property rights 
plus dkk 25m, equal to 96% of book equity.
the transaction comprises around 55,000 nemkonto (easy 
account) customers, dkk 4.2bn in bank loans and advances and 
dkk 16.9bn in arranged mortgage loans from totalkredit.

the negative interest rate environment combined with subdued 
demand for loans and fierce competition for bank loans and ad-
vances continue to squeeze the group’s net interest income. net 
interest income has fallen by dkk 7m to dkk 1,476m. income 
has been affected by a lower demand for loans by corporate 
clients which has been affected for instance by the government’s 
relief packages, which include deferral of vat and tax payments. 
as a result of uncertainty in connection with covid-19 corporate 
clients have wished to increase their cash resources, which the 
group has accommodated. 
net income from the cooperation with totalkredit represents 
dkk 480m (2019: dkk 486m) after a set-off of loss of dkk 13m 
(2019: dkk 17m). the cooperation with dlr kredit has gener-
ated an income of dkk 126m (2019: dkk 131m). compared to 
2019 total mortgage credit income has fallen by dkk 13m to 
dkk 607m – a decline of 2%. income remains high due to contin-
ued high remortgaging activity in 2020. 
income from payment services has dropped by dkk 28m to dkk 
152m – as a result of lower activity due to covid-19.
commission and brokerage income has risen by dkk 53m to 
dkk 372m – an increase of 17% compared to 2019.
income from commission etc concerning investment funds and

equivalent) compared to 2,030 in 2019. the increase is attrib-
utable to the acquisition of alm. brand bank, which employed a 
staff of 317 at year-end 2020.
the number of branches has gone down by 4 compared to 2019 
and at year-end 2020 there were 56 branches in denmark and  
3 in germany. 
core earnings before impairment of loans and advances
core earnings before impairment charges for loans and advances 
represent dkk 1,174m – an increase of dkk 78m compared to 
2019.
impairment of loans and advances etc
impairment charges for loans and advances represent an expense 
of dkk 47m as a result of covid-19. in 2019 impairment charges 
constituted an income of dkk 97m.
the group’s impairment charges for loans and advances include a 
management estimate of dkk 325m to cover the consequences 
of the covid-19 outbreak on the group’s lending portfolio. the 
estimate may change in the coming quarters. 
 
at 31 december 2020 the group’s unsecured loans and advanc-
es in the weakest rating categories 7-9 and default (excluding 
2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t  /  s y d b a n k
15
agriculture but including mink farming) amounted to dkk 580m. 
these loans and advances are not subject to objective evidence 
of credit impairment but in the short term they are the most crit-
ical in terms of credit impairment due to covid-19. the impair-
ment charges include a management estimate of dkk 125m to 
hedge the risk of these loans and advances, equal to 22%. 
furthermore impairment charges include a management esti-
mate of dkk 200m to cover unforeseen events as regards the 
remaining part of the lending portfolio in rating classes 1-6, the 
credit risk of which is satisfactory or normal. 
consequently management estimates as a result of covid-19 
total dkk 325m (end-q3 2020: dkk 225m).
the group’s total lending to the entertainment industry, retailers 
and small businesses constitutes dkk 2.7bn, equal to 4.4% of 
total loans and advances of dkk 60.2bn. 
reference is made to the separate publication credit risk 2020,

at year-end 2020 the impairment ratio for the year represented 
0.08% relative to bank loans and advances and 0.06% relative 
to bank loans and advances and guarantees. at 31 december 
2020 accumulated impairment and provisions amounted to dkk 
2,229m (2019: dkk 2,244m).
in 2020 reported losses amounted to dkk 428m (2019: dkk 
598m). of the reported losses dkk 239m has previously been 
written down.
impairment charges are made for expected credit losses as 
regards all financial assets measured at amortised cost and 
similar provisions are made for expected credit losses as regards 
undrawn credit commitments and financial guarantees. 
impairment charges for expected credit losses depend on wheth-
er the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition and follow a 3-stage model. the portfolio 
in stage 3 acquired from alm. brand bank is recognised under 
“credit impaired at initial recognition”:  
stage 1 – facilities with no significant increase in credit risk. the 
asset is written down by an amount equal to the expected credit 
loss as a result of the probability of default over the coming 12 
months.
stage 2 – facilities with a significant increase in credit risk. the 
asset is transferred to stage 2 and is written down by an amount 
equal to the expected credit loss over the life of the asset. 
stage 3 – facilities where the financial asset is in default or is 
otherwise credit impaired. 
credit impaired at initial recognition – facilities which were credit 
impaired at the time of acquisition of alm. brand bank. they are 
recognised on acquisition at the fair value of the debt acquired.
the group’s loans and advances and impairment charges at   
31 december 2020 allocated to these stages are shown below. 
credit impaired bank loans and advances – stage 3 – represent 
3.1% (2019: 3.5%) of total bank loans and advances before 
impairment charges and 1.6% (2019: 1.7%) of total bank loans 
and advances after impairment charges.

and advances to corporate clients have dropped by dkk 2.1bn, 
primarily due to lower drawings under existing credit facilities.
as a result of the uncertainty in connection with covid-19 and 
despite a decline in drawings under credit facilities, many corpo-
rate clients have increased their cash resources, which the group 
has accommodated in the form of increased credit commitments.

advanced irb – corporate exposures
today sydbank applies the advanced irb approach to calculate 
the capital requirement as regards retail exposures and the 
foundation irb approach to calculate the capital requirement as 
regards corporate exposures.
sydbank is working on a project with the purpose of gaining ap-
proval to use the advanced irb approach to calculate the capital 
requirement as regards corporate exposures. the objective is to 
gain approval at the end of 2021. 
capital policy
the group’s capital policy consistently supports the group’s strat-
egy and at the same time takes into account sydbank’s status as 
a sifi as well as full implementation of capital regulations. the 
group’s capital targets are a cet1 ratio of around 14.5% and 
a capital ratio of around 18.5%. the capital targets have been set 
to ensure that the group complies with all capital requirements, 
including buffer requirements.

dividend policy
the group’s dividend policy must contribute to creating long-
term shareholder value. the objective is to distribute 30-50% of 
profit for the year after tax while taking into account growth plans 
and capital policy. 
mrel
once a year the danish fsa sets the minimum requirement for 
own funds and eligible liabilities (mrel) for danish institutions, 
including sydbank, which as sifis are under an obligation to meet 
the minimum requirement.
the methodology to determine the mrel was changed as from 
1 january 2020 and the group’s mrel is based on the risk 
exposure amount using a factor which has been set at the sum 
of twice the solvency need and once the combined capital buffer 
requirement.
this requirement is lower than at 31 december 2019 when the 
combined capital buffer requirement was included twice. in return 
the combined capital buffer requirement is deducted from the 
calculated cover.
in december 2020 the danish fsa set the mrel for sydbank at 
10.3% of total liabilities and total capital, equivalent to 25.1% of 
the risk exposure amount. the mrel at 31 december 2020 is as 
follows:

at 31 december 2020 the sydbank group met the mrel with

to an increase in the solvency need of 6.5 percentage points or 
an increase in the risk exposure amount of dkk 28,100m.
one of the group’s nps issues of eur 500m will have a maturity 
of less than 1 year in february 2021 and can subsequently not 
be included as excess cover.

interest rate risk etc
the group’s interest rate risk represented dkk 171m at 31 
december 2020 (2019: dkk 169m). as a result the group would 
suffer a loss if interest rates rose. 
the group’s exchange rate risk continues to be very low and its 
equity risk modest as regards its trading portfolio. 
funding and liquidity
the guidelines for calculating the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) 
specify a run-off of exposures while taking into account coun-
terparties, funding size, hedging and maturity. consequently the 
most stable deposits are favoured relative to large deposits, in 
particular large deposits from businesses and financial counter-
parties. 
the group’s lcr constituted 210% at 31 december 2020 
(2019: 174%).

accounting estimates
estimates in relation to the measurement of assets and liabilities 
are based on assumptions considered reasonable by management 
but which by their nature are uncertain. they may prove to be 
incomplete or inaccurate as a result of developments differing 
from projections in the external environment in which the group 
operates or in other respects relating to customers or business 
relations. for further details reference is made to note 2.

shareholders
in 2020 the sydbank share yielded a return of minus 4% (2019: 
minus 10%) as a result of the decline in the share price during the 
year. for reasons of prudence the board of directors decided to 
terminate the initiated share buyback programme and withdraw 
the proposal to pay dividends at the general meeting on the basis 
of the 2019 results. consequently the total return represented 
minus 4% in 2020. 
the board of directors will propose to the agm that 30% of the 
group’s profit after tax, equal to a dividend of dkk 4.00 per share, 
be distributed and that dkk 10m be donated to the sponsorship 
fund sydbank fonden. 
supervisory diamond
the supervisory diamond sets up a number of benchmarks to 
indicate banking activities that initially should be regarded as 
involving a higher risk. any breach of the supervisory diamond is 
subject to reactions by the danish fsa. 
the calculations at year-end are shown below:

at 31 december 2020 the group as well as the parent comply 
with all the benchmarks of the supervisory diamond. 
leverage ratio
the crr/crd iv rules require credit institutions to calculate, 
report, monitor and disclose their leverage ratio, which is defined 
as t1 capital as a percentage of total exposure. the european 
commission’s proposal for a revision of crr includes a proposal 
to introduce a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3%. 
the group’s leverage ratio constituted 6.1% at 31 december 
2020 (2019: 6.5%) taking into account the transitional rules. 
assuming fully loaded t1 capital under crr/crd iv without any 
refinancing of non-eligible at1 capital, the leverage ratio would 
be 6.1% (2019: 6.4%). 
the introduction of a minimum leverage ratio requirement is not 
expected to be of significance to the group. 
sifi
sydbank has been designated as a sifi in denmark and in 2020 
there was an additional buffer requirement of 1% as regards 
cet1 capital. the intention is to bring danish sifi capital re-
quirements on a par with the requirements in other comparable 
european countries. 
ifrs 9 – transitional effect
to counter an unintended impact on regulatory capital and hence 
banks’ possibilities of supporting lending, a transitional arrange-
ment has been adopted so that any adverse impact from the new 
impairment model will be phased in over a period. as a result 
of covid-19 the arrangement has been prolonged until 2024. 
sydbank applies the transitional rules.

bank recovery and resolution directive 
the directive, including the bail-in provisions, was implemented 
in danish law on 1 june 2015. according to legislation each credit 
institution must meet a minimum requirement for own funds
and eligible liabilities (mrel). in december 2020 the danish fsa 
set the mrel for sydbank at 11.0% of total liabilities and total 
capital, equivalent to 25.5% of the risk exposure amount made 
up at 31 december 2020. 
the general resolution principle for sifis is that it should be 
possible to restructure them and send them back to the market 
with adequate capitalisation to ensure market confidence. from 
1 january 2020 the calculation of the group’s mrel is based 
on the risk exposure amount using a factor which has been set 
at the sum of twice the solvency need and once the combined 
capital buffer requirement.
the establishment of a resolution fund is underway. credit 
institutions must make contributions to the fund according to 
their relative size and risk in denmark. the resolution fund must 
be established and have assets at its disposal equal to at least 
1% of the covered deposits of all danish credit institutions by 31 
december 2024. 
the group’s contribution to the resolution fund for 2020 repre-
sents dkk 22m. 
basel iv
on 7 december 2017 the basel committee on banking super-
vision (bcbs) published its recommendations for a number of 
changes to the calculation of the capital requirements for credit 
institutions. these recommendations, also known as basel iv, 
propose among other things to constrain the use of internal mod-
els and introduce a permanent floor for the risk exposure amount. 
the recommendations are expected to have a limited impact on 
the group’s capital. 
the recommendations must be implemented in the eu before 
they apply to danish institutions. the group is following develop-
ments closely. at present the extent of changes in relation to the 
basel committee’s recommendations when implemented into eu 
regulation is unknown. the effective date is expected to be 1 jan-
uary 2023 on which date the floor requirement is also expected 
to be implemented, starting at 50% and gradually increasing until 
finally reaching 72.5% on 1 january 2028. 
new definition of default
at the beginning of 2021 new rules regarding the definition 
of default entered into force which involve a broadening of the 
concept – and consequently more defaults.
the group is developing new models for retail clients and cor-
porate clients and will incorporate the new definition of default 
in these models. as a result a significant consequential effect of 
the new default definition – lower lgd – will be introduced at the 
same time.
in the interim period the group’s risk exposure amount will be 
considerably higher as the group applies the foundation irb 
approach as regards corporate exposures and only uses its own 
estimates of default. 
the danish fsa has approved sydbank’s use of the new defini-
tion of default from 1 january 2021.
the group expects a temporary increase in the risk exposure 
amount of around dkk 5bn. the effect has been included in 
conducted stress tests and in the group’s capital plans. assuming 
use of the group’s future advanced risk models, the long-term 
effect on the risk exposure amount is expected to be significantly 
smaller. 
exposures affected by covid-19
the following exposures are considered to be the most affected 
by covid-19: 
• severely impacted industries 
• weak corporate clients
• small corporate clients. 
severely impacted industries
mainly businesses within the following industries are considered 
to be severely impacted by covid-19: 
• specialised retailers, exclusive of cars 
• sea and air transport 
• hotels, restaurants and entertainment. 
loans and advances to these industries represented dkk 1.7bn 
at 31 december 2020, equivalent to 2.8% of total loans and 
advances of dkk 60.2bn.

performance in 2020
weak corporate clients
customers who were already weak before the covid-19 crisis 
(rating categories 7-9 and default) will be even more challenged 
during times of crisis. 
impairment charges are recorded on a regular basis on all cus-
tomers subject to objective evidence of credit impairment and 
these customers are given individual focus. 
loans and advances to weak corporate clients without objective 
evidence of credit impairment (excluding agriculture but including 
mink farming) total dkk 0.8bn. after deduction of collateral 
received of dkk 0.2bn, unsecured loans and advances represent 
dkk 0.6bn. 
small corporate clients
by experience the smallest businesses are often less robust. 
loans and advances to the smallest businesses – with a balance 
sheet total of less than dkk 5m – represented dkk 1.0bn at 31 
december 2020, equivalent to 1.7% of total loans and advances 
of dkk 60.2bn. 
reporting events occurring after the balance sheet date 
sydbank a/s has sold 100% of the share capital in the subsidiary 
alm. brand leasing a/s to opendo a/s effective from 1 march 
2021. in addition sydbank a/s will acquire 10.4% of the share 
capital in opendo a/s, thereby becoming a co-owner of the 
company together with 13 other financial institutions and an 
insurance undertaking.
the reason for the sale is that the current leasing set-up of 
sydbank a/s is based on finance leasing while the primary focus 
of alm. brand leasing a/s is operating leasing. with opendo a/s 
as the new owner, the owners will continue to focus on operating 
leasing. moreover approx 30 jobs are guaranteed.
the sale has been effected at book value at 31 december 2020 
after deduction of dividends.
outlook for 2021
growth is projected in the danish economy in 2021 despite 
expectations of negative growth influenced by covid-19 in the 
first 6 months.
total income is expected to rise sharply as a result of the acqui-
sition of alm. brand bank and measures implemented as regards 
deposits and fees.
costs (core earnings) are projected to increase as a result of the 
acquisition of alm. brand bank.
impairment charges for 2021 are forecast to be at a low level. in 
addition most of the amounts owed to the group by the mink 
industry are expected to be repaid in full, which could result in a 
reversal of impairment charges of up to dkk 150m.
 
non-recurring costs are expected to be in the range of dkk  
150-175m. the item consists of costs related to “a stronger 
bank”, costs to establish a bank/insurance partnership as well   
as costs related to the integration of alm. brand bank.
profit after tax is expected to be in the range of dkk  
850-1,150m.
in light of the covid-19 crisis the outlook for 2021 is subject to 
greater uncertainty than usual.

capital management
the group’s capital management ensures efficient deployment of 
capital relative to the group’s overall capital targets. the group’s 
risk profile is determined on the basis of the capital targets, which 
ensure first and foremost that there is adequate capital to meet 
the group’s growth expectations and cover fluctuations in the 
risks assumed by the group.
the group applies internal ratings based approaches to manage 
the credit risk of the group’s corporate and retail client portfolios. 
the group applies the advanced irb approach as regards retail 
clients and the foundation irb approach as regards corporate 
clients to determine the group’s capital requirements. the group 
expects to seek approval to use the advanced irb approach as 
regards corporate clients in 2021.
the group applies the standardised approach to credit risk in re-
lation to exposures to governments and credit institutions as well 
as to exposures acquired from alm. brand bank, which primarily 
consist of retail clients.
further details, also concerning the risk exposure amount (rea), 
capital information and capital ratios, are found in note 3.
the group’s capital management focuses on 4 capital elements: 
minimum capital, adequate total capital, capital requirements 
including buffers and total capital.
minimum capital represents the necessary capital in compliance 
with crr and adequate total capital is the group’s determination 
of the capital sufficient to protect depositors against loss under 
the prevailing economic conditions. the solvency need is defined 
as adequate total capital in percentage terms of rea.
the capital requirement including buffers is based on the solven-
cy need to which a combined buffer requirement is added. the 
combined buffer requirement constituted 3.5% at 31 december 
2020.

* the total capital requirement consists of an individual solvency need 
and a combined buffer requirement. the countercyclical capital buffer is 
determined by the danish ministry of industry, business and financial 
affairs and may not exceed 2.5%. at present the rate has been fixed at 
0.0%.  
the committees in the group’s risk organisation report directly 
to the group executive management. the committees identify, 
monitor and assess risks within the individual risk areas and en-
sure that models and principles are formulated to calculate risks. 
the committees ensure that the bank’s business units proactively 
carry out their operations and address identified risks. each com-
mittee reviews a risk assessment for its own area annually. the 
group’s chief risk officer is a member of all committees, see risk 
management on page 124.
the adequate total capital is determined on the basis of the 
danish fsa approach (8+). a proposal for the determination of the 
adequate total capital is prepared by risk and is reviewed by the 
capital committee. the board of directors discusses and deter-
mines the adequate total capital on the basis of this proposal.
the proposal is based on the capital adequacy rules (pillar 1) with 
add-ons for any risks deemed not to be sufficiently covered under 
pillar 1. at year-end 2020 add-ons were allocated in relation to 
credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
the approaches and methods used to calculate the pillar 1 capital 
requirement are described in more detail in note 3.

stress testing is another important element when determining 
the adequate total capital.
the object of stress testing is to assess the impact of adverse 
events on capital needed and income. stress test calculations 
show the impact for the coming 3 years under given economic 
scenarios.
at 31 december 2020 the group has based its stress test calcu-
lations on the following macroeconomic scenarios:
base case scenario which reflects the group’s forecast of devel-
opments in the economy. 
global crisis which reflects that the danish economy will expand 
in 2021 but will be hit by a new recession in 2022, eg new coro-
navirus mutations in 2022 or a diminishing effect of the vaccines 
in 2022. the scenario resembles a slowdown in 2021 and sub-
sequently a very deep recession. a relatively significant drop in 
household deposits is projected, predominantly as a consequence 
of a rise in unemployment and the decline in property prices. 
in terms of gdp the recession is on a par with the recession in 
2008-2009.
global crisis - frontloaded which reflects that the danish econ-
omy will be hit by a deep recession in 2021 and that the crisis 
will then become a more protracted crisis involving several years 
of negative economic growth. this development may be due 
to ineffective vaccines which will stop the economic recovery in 
denmark and globally. the hard landing in 2021 will cause a 60% 
drop in share prices in 2021. 
interest rate increase which reflects that all interest rates will 
go up by 200bp in q1 2021 after which they will remain at this 
heightened level until the end of 2023. it is assumed that interest 
rates will rise significantly and quickly as a result of a faster than 
expected normalisation of monetary policy in usa and the euro 
area. denmark will lose its status as a safe haven and therefore 
the global increases in interest rates will have a full impact in 
denmark. the rise in interest rates will have a negative effect on 
private demand in denmark and abroad.
the scenarios and their relevance are subject to ongoing 
assessment and the scenarios are approved by management 
as the basis for further stress test calculations. the impacts of 
the scenarios are included in the assessment of the adequate 
total capital. the stress tests conducted show that the group is 
adequately capitalised.
throughout 2020 the group fully complied with external as well 
as internal capital requirements.

capital management
on the basis of the risk reporting at 31 december 2020, includ-
ing the group’s icaap and ilaap, the board of directors reviews 
an overall risk assessment for the purpose of making the group’s 
individual risks and overall risk visible.
the risk assessment contains a description and assessment of 
the types of risk to which the group is exposed, including an 
assessment of the business model’s impact on risks and risk level, 
as well as the activities to which the individual risks are related.
the most important types of risk and risk assessments are:
• credit risk, which is described in more detail in “notes – risk 
management” and in credit risk 2020, which is available on the 
bank’s website - sydbank.com 
• market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk, which are de-
scribed in more detail in “notes – risk management” 
• stress tests, including in particular consequences as regards 
capital and income, see above 
• the group’s risk organisation, which is described in more detail 
above and in “notes – risk management”
• the group’s overall control environment, including compli-
ance, anti-money laundering, gdpr and it security, which are 
described in more detail in “mission statement and business 
goals” and “organisation and corporate governance” 
• the group’s capital and its composition, see above
• employee resources, including an assessment of competences 
and number 
• communication, including the group’s ability to communicate 
internally in a fast, efficient and targeted manner, the group’s 
ability to communicate externally in a manner that meets legis-
lative expectations and expectations of external stakeholders, 
as well as communication via social media.
the risk assessment provides the basis for an assessment of 
whether policies and guidelines are appropriate in relation to 
business-related activities, organisation and resources as well as 
market conditions.

dividend policy
sydbank’s overall financial goal is to provide its shareholders with 
a competitive return by way of price increases and dividends.
the dividend policy must contribute to creating long-term 
shareholder value. the objective is to distribute 30-50% of profit 
for the year after tax while taking into account growth plans and 
capital policy.
in 2020 the bank had planned to pay a dividend of 40%, cf the 
bank’s dividend policy, equal to dkk 5.76 per share. as a conse-
quence of the general situation in society as regards covid-19, 
the board of directors resolved not to recommend dividend 
distribution at the agm in 2020.
the bank announced a share buyback programme of dkk 250m 
on 26 february 2020. the share buyback programme was 
scheduled to end on or before 30 september 2020.
the share buyback programme was terminated on 17 march 
2020 as the bank’s board of directors, for reasons of prudence, 
did not wish to continue the programme as the economic effects 
of covid-19 were uncertain. under the programme 279,000 own 
shares were repurchased at a transaction value of dkk 31m.
the group’s targets are a cet1 ratio of around 14.5% and a 
capital ratio of around 18.5%.
the board of directors will propose to the agm that 30% of the 
group’s profit after tax, equal to a dividend of dkk 4.00 per share, 
be distributed and that dkk 10m be donated to the sponsorship 
fund sydbank fonden.

sydbank’s core story
banking
sydbank’s mission is to be a bank that is close to its customers. 
we find solutions where they are – quickly and efficiently. we 
build on relationships between people. and we focus on what is 
important – banking and sound business. 
banking – pure and simple.
our bank
rooted in southern jutland, sydbank is a strong and indepen-
dent nationwide bank operating on its own terms. for the back-
bone of the danish corporate sector and for retail clients who 
value professional advice we are a bank for most people but not 
the same bank for everyone. good old-fashioned attentiveness, 
new technology – we use what works. we know our customers 
and we are close to them providing advice tailored to their indivi-
dual needs. backed by the best business partners our competiti-
ve strength is increased.
our bank – excellence and relationships create value.
sydbank
our bank makes 3 promises – to our customers, to our emplo-
yees and to our shareholders. you will know us for the value we 
create for our customers. you will know us for our belief that 
excellent and committed employees are our most important 
asset. and you will know us for always having a level of profitabi-
lity that will enable us to remain an independent and resourceful 
bank. 
sydbank – what can we do for you.
confidence in banks is low
that’s why we put ethics before profit and 
have a responsible approach to lending.
and we do not recommend problematic 
products to our customers.
we will remain an independent bank 
that’s why we strive to attract shareholders 
seeking long-term value creation. 
and not them looking for a quick profit. 
in the current market revenue from  
banking business will decline
that’s why we build long-term relationships  
with new and existing customers and evolve  
in line with their requirements.
and we do not compromise on our risk  
profile or business-related standards.
we will continuously strengthen  
our brand and reputation vis-à-vis  
all stakeholders
that’s why we are consistent in our 
communication about our goals, strategy 
and policies internally and externally.
and our communication does not change 
before our goals or strategy change.
we believe there will also be a demand 
for banking services in the future
that’s why we invest in achieving  
the best position and the best  
reputation in the long term.
and we do not react to short- 
term fluctuations in share markets.
in the competitive danish banking sector 
sydbank enjoys a unique position where  
it can benefit from economies of scale  
and be close to its customers
that’s why we continue to have a  
centralised risk and cost management  
set-up and a decentralised geographical  
structure focusing on close relationships.
and we do not attempt to limit the human 
contact with our customers.
we have acquired expertise and built 
relationships by providing advice to 
medium-sized and large businesses,  
retail clients and private banking clients
that’s why we continue to expand our 
offerings to these customers. 
and we do not favour customer groups  
we have no experience of.
in the current market we must balance  
investment and profitability
that’s why we strive to have a return on  
equity that covers the cost of capital.
and we do not seek the highest possible  
earnings in the short term at the expense of 
investments in competences and services.
we must continuously reduce operating  
costs while improving our customer  
service and complying with tighter  
regulatory requirements
that’s why we invest in lowering 
operating costs on an ongoing basis.
and we refrain from making our talented 
employees redundant due to cyclical fluctuations.
we must constantly be innovative
that’s why we invest in documented 
value adding technology – as a fast 
follower. 
but not as a pioneer in the area.

mission statement and business goals

s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
sydbank’s business model
the classic business model for banks is fundamentally concerned 
with optimising risk management when short-term deposits are 
converted to long-term loans.
this remains the cornerstone of sydbank’s – as well as other 
banks’ – business model. and banks have an exclusive licence   
to accept deposits and arrange loans.
in addition to deposit and loan products produced in-house, 
sydbank’s business model comprises activities within payment 
services, securities trading and asset management as well as 
arranging mortgage credit products, investment management 
products and insurance products via business partners and is 
similar to the rings of an onion.

equity
the centre of the business model is the bank’s equity. 
it gives the bank its competitive strength. at 
 
sydbank we promise to ensure attractive  
profitability to the benefit of shareholders  
 
and that is why we strive to have  
 
 
a return on equity that covers   
 
 
the cost of capital.
commodities
the next layer shows the bank’s  
 
 
commodities: the bank’s liquidity, which   
 
is used to produce in-house lending products.  
 
it is mainly made up of deposits but it also comprises
liquidity generated via the money market or bond is-
sues. being able to procure competitively priced liquidity 
is decisive for the bank’s competitive strength and 
therefore the bank strives to be strongly capitalised and 
to have a healthy lending portfolio.
production
the second layer holds the bank’s production, classic and sound 
banking, involving credit evaluation of customers based on 
credit analyses and ratings. credit evaluation of customers 
is key to the bank’s capital consumption, ie its com-
modities, and consequently also decisive to the 
bank’s charges. in addition to classic and 
sound banking, compliance  with legislation
and regulation forms  a  substantial
part of production  activities, 
including prevention of  money
laundering. a significant  share
of the bank’s costs is tied  to 
its production and as a  result
ongoing efficiency improvements
are crucial in order to  lower
its operating costs. 
value propositions
the outer layer is where the bank’s value 
propositions to customers are generated via value- 
creating advisory services, the creation of long-term 
relationships and offerings of relevant products and services 
at competitive prices. sydbank seeks to offer its products 
and services at prices ensuring that customers are profitable, 
ie that prices exceed capital costs and production costs.

during 2020 funds under management rose from approx dkk 
94bn at the beginning of the year to approx dkk 109bn at the 
end of the year, of which approx dkk 9bn is attributable to the 
acquisition of alm. brand bank. the remaining part of the in-
crease reflects a combination of net sales of investment products 
to the bank’s customers as well as moderately rising share and 
bond prices in 2020 as a whole. in other words 2020 was char-
acterised by signifcant price drops in shares and corporate bonds 
during spring as a result of the first wave of the coronavirus crisis. 
however the subsequent very sharp fiscal and monetary stimuli 
have contribted to lifting the prices of virtually all financial assets 
and therefore most asset classes generated positive returns for 
the year. as a consequence of a decline in demand the manage-
ment product pengeplan® was terminated at the end of 2020.

the total custody account volume rose by approx dkk 45bn in 
2020 to a total of dkk 232bn at year-end. the increase is gener-
ally attributable to a combination of sydbank’s acquisition of alm. 
brand bank and the moderate increase in share and bond prices. 
however the increases in danish share prices averaging approx 
30% in 2020 have significantly driven up custody account values 
as many retail clients have a substantial holding of individual 
danish shares in their custody accounts.

expectations in this area and those of society at large.

internal procedure for risk identification and the correlation 
with risk reporting and the calculation of the group’s solvency 
need. the risk committee is regularly informed of models and

remuneration committee
the remuneration committee reports to the board of directors 
and convenes as a minimum once a year.
the remuneration committee formulates the bank’s remunera-
tion policy and decides which of the bank’s functions are covered 
by the concept of “material risk takers”. following approval by the 
board of directors the remuneration policy is submitted to the 
general meeting which will make the final decision. the remuner-
ation committee ensures that the remuneration policy in force is 
complied with.
legislation requires that the remuneration committee review 
information about remuneration issues presented to the general 
meeting, perform assessments and controls of the bank’s 
remuneration processes and ensure that the use of variable 
remuneration complies with the rules of the remuneration policy 
and legislation.

ment and must also identify and describe the competences 
required to serve on the bank’s board of directors and assess 
whether they are present. the committee lends support to the 
board of directors with regard to the recruitment of new board 
members and in this connection it is charged with formulating 
a diversity policy describing the qualifications and competences 
which the board of directors must possess. in addition the com-
mittee sets target figures for the underrepresented gender on the 
board of directors.
the nomination committee convened 5 times in 2020.

policy and targets for the underrepresented gender
sydbank complies with the recommendation of the committee 
on corporate governance that once a year the board of directors 
discusses activities to ensure diversity.
the aim of the board of directors is that women will represent at 
least 30% of the board members. at year-end 2020 sydbank’s 
board of directors consisted of 8 shareholder-elected board 
members and 4 members elected by the employees. of the 12 
board members, 3 are female and 9 are male. as regards share-
holder-elected board members, 3 are female and 5 are male. the 
defined target has therefore been met as regards shareholder-
elected members.
sydbank has a policy to increase the percentage of the underrep-
resented gender in the other management levels of the business. 
it is sydbank’s overall goal to have an equal gender balance 
among managers in the bank’s business units and support 
functions. the bank has set a goal that women will account for 
at least 35% of all managers at the bank in 2025. this goal will 
be achieved in connection with the recruitment of new employ-
ees as well as by supporting more broadly the development of 
existing employees. the introduction of a quota regarding the 
management talent programme “talent for ledelse” will hopefully 
help us to move forward in a positive direction. from 2020 there 
must be an equal gender balance among participants.
group executive management
sydbank’s group executive management consists of 4 members. 
the group executive management is appointed by the board of 
directors and consists of karen frøsig, ceo; bjarne larsen, depu-
ty group chief executive; jørn adam møller, deputy group chief 
executive; and henning dam, deputy group chief executive.
the group executive management constitutes the top day-to-
day management of the bank in accordance with the guidelines 
and instructions issued by the board of directors. the distribution 
of duties between the board of directors and the group exec-
utive management is laid down in the rules of procedure of the 
board of directors.
the group executive management attends the meetings of the 
shareholders’ committee and the board of directors without any 
voting rights.
further information is available at 
sydbank.dk/omsydbank/organisation (in danish only).
management’s remuneration
the bank’s remuneration policy is determined by the bank’s 
board of directors and describes sydbank’s positions on remu-
neration and the use of variable remuneration components. 
the board of directors is responsible for making any necessary 
adjustments to the remuneration policy and for submitting the 
revised remuneration policy to the general meeting for adoption.
the remuneration policy must ensure an appropriate framework 
in order to attract, motivate and retain the bank’s management 
and employees. furthermore it must contribute in the long term 
to supporting the bank’s business strategy, including the bank’s 
short-term and long-term interests, create value for the bank, 
its employees, its management and its shareholders and it must

organisation and corporate governance
align the interests of the bank’s different stakeholders, including 
the interests of the board of directors and the group executive 
management, with the interests of the bank’s shareholders and 
other stakeholders.
in addition the remuneration policy must at all times be con-
sistent with and promote sound and effective risk management 
which does not encourage excessive risk taking.
the remuneration policy contains a description of the bank’s re-
muneration of the board of directors, the group executive man-
agement, material risk takers, staff engaged in control functions 
and other employees as well as supports the bank’s objective to 
be a good and motivational workplace.
members of the board of directors receive a fixed fee. board 
members are not covered by any type of bonus scheme.
the remuneration of the group executive management is 
reviewed once a year. the remuneration of the group executive 
management is determined on the basis of a wish to attract 
and retain the best qualified members so that the bank’s group 
executive management is at all times composed of the necessary 
and correct professional and personal qualifications. the assess-
ment is carried out on the basis of the current market level for 
remuneration of group executive management members in com-
parable banks, the bank’s overall results, customer satisfaction, 
the individual contribution and areas of responsibility of group 
executive management members as well as overall performance 
over a long period at the bank. in addition the remuneration of 
the group executive management is adjusted according to the 
adjustment in the collective agreement concluded by the danish 
employers’ association for the financial sector and the financial 
services union in denmark.
within the limits of the remuneration policy the board of direc-
tors fixes the total remuneration of the group executive manage-
ment, including any severance terms.
the remuneration policy applies to the sydbank group. 
the remuneration of the board of directors and the group execu-
tive management appears from the notes to the annual report.
further information is available at
sydbank.dk/omsydbank/undersider/loenpolitik (in danish only).
significant internal controls and risk management systems
sydbank’s risk management and internal controls relating to 
financial reporting are designed for the purpose of preparing:
• management accounts which make it possible to measure and 
follow up on the group’s performance
•  financial statements which give a true and fair view without 
material misstatement and which are in accordance with inter-
national financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the 
eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for annual 
reports of listed financial companies.
the group executive management is responsible for maintain- 
ing effective internal controls and a risk management system  
in connection with financial reporting. the group executive 
management has designed and implemented controls considered 
necessary and effective to counter identified risks relating to 
financial reporting. the group’s internal controls and risk manage-
ment systems are updated on an ongoing basis and are designed 
with a view to identifying and eliminating errors and omissions in 
the financial statements.
risk assessment
the board of directors and the group executive management 
regularly assess the risks relating to the group, including those 
affecting financial reporting. a description of the most significant 
identified risks is given in the annual report under “accounting 
estimates and judgements” (note 2) and “notes – risk manage-
ment”.
procedures have been put into place to ensure that sydbank at 
all times complies with relevant legislation and other regulations 
in connection with financial reporting. the audit committee is 
regularly informed of significant changes in legislation.
monitoring
analyses and control activities are conducted in connection with 
the preparation of the annual report to ensure that financial re-
porting is in compliance with ifrs as described under “accounting 
policies” (note 1).
risk organisation
sydbank has a formal risk organisation comprising a number  
of risk committees and a chief risk officer (cro) reporting direct-
ly to the group executive management. the cro oversees that 
risk management within the group is prudent and complies with 
the requirements of the danish executive order on management 
and control of banks etc. the risk committees are headed by a 
member of the bank’s group executive management and the 
cro is a permanent member.
44
s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
the risk committees identify, monitor and assess risks within 
the individual risk areas and ensure that models and principles 
are formulated to calculate risk. the committees ensure that the 
bank’s business units address identified risks.
further information is available in “notes – risk management” on 
page 124.
compliance
compliance is an independent division reporting directly to the 
bank’s group executive management. the division also compris-
es the bank’s data protection officer (dpo), whose responsibili-
ties are described in further detail below.
compliance supervises and assesses whether the bank’s busi-
ness units have efficient procedures to comply with legislation 
and internal rules. the objective is to minimise the bank’s compli-
ance risks, for example the risk of financial loss, the loss of good 
standing or administrative sanctions as a result of non-compli-
ance with rules.
the work is organised so that all the bank’s activities are 
assessed using a risk-based approach. for each control and 
assessment carried out by compliance the conclusion is reported 
to the relevant business unit managers who are responsible for 
correcting any errors or omissions identified, including adjusting 
inadequate systems and procedures. compliance follows up on 
the implementation of appropriate measures and also follows up 
on the controls and assessments carried out. the time horizon 
for this work depends on the risk identified.
in addition compliance is responsible for the assessment of new 
products and services in terms of risk. this assessment is made in 
cooperation with the relevant business units in the bank as well 
as the bank’s risk function. the assessment is taken into account 
by the group executive management in its deliberations on how 
to launch new products.
the bank has established a compliance committee. the chair-
man is the bank’s risk executive (group executive management 
member). the committee also consists of relevant group execu-
tive vice presidents or their representatives as well as the bank’s 
dpo. the committee meets at least once every quarter to discuss 
current compliance risks as well as future legislative measures.
compliance submits quarterly reports of its most significant 
activities to the bank’s group executive management and the 
board of directors.
data protection officer
sydbank complies with the general data protection regulation, 
which has replaced previous data protection legislation and 
imposed stricter requirements regarding the manner in which 
businesses store and process personal data.
one of the requirements is that some businesses which store 
and process personal data of a certain extent must have a data 
protection officer (dpo). in line with compliance, the tasks of the 
dpo are to monitor and assess whether the bank complies with 
the rules regarding personal data. the dpo must also report to 
the bank’s management.
sydbank’s dpo reports to the bank’s board of directors and 
group executive management quarterly. the reports and the 
current risk scenario as regards the general data protection reg-
ulation are discussed by the bank’s compliance committee.
anti-money laundering 
compliance with anti-money laundering legislation is an impor-
tant factor in terms of successfully managing the social task and 
social responsibility of preventing money laundering and terrorist 
financing. to strengthen its efforts to combat money laundering 
and terrorist financing, sydbank has established a strong corpo-
rate governance structure in this area. sydbank has appointed an 
aml executive (group executive management member), estab-
lished an aml risk management department within the legal 
department, which assesses on an ongoing basis the bank’s risks 
in this area, and set up an aml committee, where relevant group 
executive vice presidents meet once every quarter to discuss 
and assess sydbank’s efforts to combat money laundering and 
terrorist financing. aml risk management reports to the aml 
committee, the group executive management and the board of 
directors on a quarterly basis on the measures taken to combat 
money laundering and terrorist financing and on developments in 
the overall risks in this area.
the danish anti-money laundering act places great emphasis 
on the financial sector having a risk-based approach to combat 
money laundering and terrorist financing. every year sydbank 
prepares a risk assessment in which relevant risks relating to 
money laundering and terrorist financing are identified and as-
sessed so that the bank has a complete overview of the areas in 
which the bank may be used for money laundering and terrorist 
financing. on the basis of the conclusions of the risk assessment 
the board of directors has adopted a policy for prevention of 
money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions breaches 
and an appendix regarding the bank’s risk tolerance in this area. 
 2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t  /  s y d b a n k
45
the policy sets out the overall framework for the procedures, 
routines, job descriptions and controls to minimise the bank’s risk 
of being used for money laundering and terrorist financing. the 
policy is available on the bank’s website so that it is accessible for 
customers and other interested parties.
to strengthen its ongoing efforts in terms of combating money 
laundering and terrorist financing, the bank has gathered all de-
partments involved in combating crime in customer & transac-
tion monitoring, including the quality assurance department. the 
quality assurance department is tasked with ensuring ongoing 
implementation of all necessary measures in this respect in the 
entire bank and among all the bank’s employees. the quality 
assurance department ensures that sufficient measures are 
implemented to address the risks identified and assessed by the 
risk management department. in addition the quality assurance 
department ensures that all relevant employees receive training 
in anti-money laundering rules.
in its efforts to prevent the bank from being used for money laun-
dering and terrorist financing, sydbank has established transa-
ction monitoring of all transactions as well as daily screening of 
foreign transactions against existing eu, un and ofac sanctions 
lists. when the bank becomes aware of or suspects money laun-
dering or terrorist financing the necessary reports are filed with 
the relevant authorities. sydbank works continuously to optimise 
transaction monitoring and therefore the bank’s fraud depart-
ment is now also part of customer & transaction monitoring to 
ensure the necessary experience sharing between the 2 areas.
furthermore sydbank works constructively with all stakeholders 
and authorities with a view to combating money laundering and 
terrorist financing. the bank takes part in relevant collaboration 
forums within the financial sector and on a regulatory level in or-
der to gain knowledge about suspicious transactions and financial 
crime. in 2019 sydbank also participated in finance denmark’s 
anti-money laundering taskforce, which submitted a number of 
recommendations in late 2019 on how the financial sector can 
contribute to a greater degree to combat money laundering and 
terrorist financing. in 2020 sydbank worked to implement these 
recommendations, including setting up a dedicated webpage 
where sydbank can provide information on a continuing basis 
about its efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist 
financing.
internal audit
to gain an objective and independent assessment of the ade-
quacy, effectiveness and quality of the group’s internal controls, 
sydbank has established an internal audit function reporting to 
the bank’s board of directors.
internal audit performs audits focusing, among other factors, 
on the most significant areas of the bank’s compliance and risk 
management.
in addition internal audit oversees that:
• the group has good administrative and accounting practices
• there are business procedures and internal controls for all im-
portant areas of activity
• management’s instructions on security and controls are incor-
porated into business procedures and are observed
• there are prudent control and security measures within it.

social responsibility efforts and sustainability efforts. the csr 
report meets the current requirements pursuant to section 135b 
of the danish executive order on financial reporting of credit insti-
tutions and brokerage firms etc and is available at sydbank.com.
dialogue with stakeholders
sydbank’s growth and existence depend on dialogue and 
interaction with our stakeholders in our own organisation, in the 
marketplace and in society at large.
common regulation of the banking sector is necessary to ensure 
security, transparency and stability. it is important for sydbank 
that regulation is developed through a dialogue between the 
authorities, legislators and the banking sector. in this way it can 
be ensured that regulations and legislation can be implemented 
and managed in practice.
4 strategic focus areas
for sydbank sustainability is about doing something because it is 
the right thing to do and because it can be integrated naturally in 
the bank’s business and consequently have an impact in the long 
term. in other words we must focus on the challenges in society 
that are closest to our core business and primary areas of impact. 
as a result we have decided to focus on 4 areas where we believe 
we can make a significant difference: responsible finance, respon-
sible investment, responsible employer and responsible climate 
footprint.
organisation and management
sydbank’s csr forum evaluates and decides upon concrete csr 
and sustainable initiatives. the members of the forum include 
sydbank’s ceo and relevant group executive vice presidents. 
in line with sydbank’s elevated ambitions we implemented an or-
ganisational change in 2020 aimed at bringing our sustainability 
efforts closer to the group executive management and strategic 
decisions so that sustainability may be further embedded in the 
business.
it is still the overall responsibility of sydbank’s csr forum to indi-
cate the bank’s strategic direction as regards sustainability and 
social responsibility and the day-to-day activities concerning sus-
tainability are undertaken by secretariat, digitization & strategy.
sustainable endorsements and levers
to strengthen sydbank’s sustainability efforts and its csr efforts 
the bank complies with a series of international and national 
initiatives, principles and guidelines.

sdg 5 – gender equality
sydbank contributes to gender equality by 
continuously measuring gender diversity and 
by making sure that target figures as regards 
the underrepresented gender are set. for in-
stance in 2020 the board of directors adopted 
a new target for the underrepresented gender 
on sydbank’s board of directors and the target 
has increased from 25% to 30%. 
sdg 7 – affordable and clean energy
sydbank contributes to the scaling up of 
sustainable energy by using sustainable energy 
and by investing in sustainable wind energy. for 
instance in 2020 we installed a solar cell system 
at the head office.
sdg 8 – decent work and economic growth
sydbank contributes to growth in society by 
guaranteeing a financial infrastructure and by 
making financing available. in addition in our 
code of conduct we demand that our suppliers 
and business partners do not contribute to 
forced labour.
sdg 9 – industry, innovation  
and infrastructure
sydbank contributes through finance to our 
innovative corporate clients via the eu-backed 
growth programme innovfin.
sdg 11 – sustainable cities and
communities
sydbank contributes via our locally embedded 
sponsorships, our investment and our finance. 
sdg 13 – climate action
sydbank contributes to the climate initiatives 
by complying with national and international 
climate control efforts. through our products, 
competences and business partners we can ad-
vise our customers about sustainable initiatives, 
for instance energy-saving renovations. 
sdg 16 – peace, justice and strong
institutions
sydbank contributes by supporting and follow-
ing institutions that work for peace and justice. 
we have a tax governance collaboration with 
the danish tax agency, we have risk manage-
ment to combat money laundering and terrorist 
financing and we eliminate countries from our 
investment universe of government bonds if 
for instance they are subject to international 
sanctions or are unable to sufficiently support 
security and welfare for their citizens.
sydbank greatly respects the un’s efforts to establish a global 
partnership to work for a sustainable future. we work continu-
ously to improve and implement measures contributing to sup-
porting the sdgs. sydbank’s sustainability efforts are related to 7 
sdgs where our activities can make a difference and we consider 
on a regular basis whether our activities can make a difference in 
relation to additional sdgs. 
sydbank joined the un global compact in 2020. the un global 
compact is a voluntary initiative where we as a company under-
take to adhere to 10 principles based on international conven-
tions and agreements. as a signatory sydbank has the possibility 
to boost its csr efforts and its sustainability efforts while at the 
same time send a clear message to the surrounding world that 
we take sustainability and social responsibility seriously.
sydbank signed the un principles for responsible banking at the 
end of 2020. this step will have a great impact on sydbank as 
the incorporation of the principles will define new strategic and 
targeted efforts to integrate sustainability into the bank’s core 
business to a still greater extent. 
in addition to the new endorsements in 2020, sydbank continues 
to follow and support the un principles for responsible invest-
ment, the paris agreement, the oecd guidelines for multination-
al enterprises and ilo conventions on dignity of workers.  
proper data processing – sydbank’s data ethics policy
financial undertakings are not yet required by law to have a data 
ethics policy but it is essential for sydbank that our customers 
and the surrounding world have confidence in our processing and 
storage of their data. consequently we have set out our position 
on data ethics in a policy. 
sydbank’s data ethics policy concerns the bank’s work with data 
ethics, including ethical deliberations in connection with the use 
of new technologies and increased volumes of data. we have 
a responsibility that data processing is ethical, responsible and 
transparent. therefore we regularly make sure that we improve 
our data processing and push developments in the data area and 
in addition we work in collaboration with relevant authorities in 
this area.

sydbank’s corporate social responsibility
esg in core business – finance and investment
responsible finance and responsible investment constitute 2 of 
our 4 strategic focus areas – the pivotal point of our sustainability 
efforts. 
sydbank seeks to integrate environmental, social and governance 
risks (esg risks) into the bank’s risk management and capital 
planning and our aim is to be able to report the co2 footprint of 
our loans in the long term. we took the first steps in 2020 and 
we will maintain our focus in 2021. sydbank’s credit policy was 
updated in 2020 and the policy now emphasises that sydbank 
should be cautious in its approach to customers whose future 
earnings and viability are particularly exposed to esg risks. 
in 2010 sydbank signed the un principles for responsible in-
vestment and as a result we are obligated to incorporate esg fac-
tors into our investment analysis and decision-making process. 
we would prefer that all businesses complied with internationally 
recognised norms and conventions but unfortunately it is not 
uncommon for cases to arise. where the violations of norms are 
very serious or significant sydbank’s business partner sustain-
alytics will engage with the company. this process is usually in 
collaboration with other major investors as in this way there is 
considerable weight behind our constructive criticism and call for 
change.
combating discrimination
sydbank acknowledges the principles of the un global compact, 
including to respect and observe international human rights and 
to combat discrimination in all its forms. 
therefore, when recruiting new employees, we ensure that there 
is always an open and unbiased selection process without any 
form of discrimination and that the organisation aptly reflects the 
labour market’s composition in terms of diversity. our internal 
policies must ensure that discrimination and harassment does not 
occur and if discrimination or harassment should occur the poli-
cies must ensure that these situations are handled appropriately.
indeed our employee engagement survey for 2020 shows that 
at sydbank focus is on anti-discrimination and openness. the 
survey included a question as to whether sydbank treats employ-
ees equally and fairly regardless of gender, gender identity, age, 
ethnic background, sexual orientation, religion, disability etc. the 
employees gave sydbank a score of 94 out of 100.
in 2020 sydbank participated in a report by the employers’ asso-
ciation for the financial sector and the financial services union in 
denmark examining women’s path to management positions in 
the financial sector. sydbank is a success story – and we are happy 
about that. the report shows that in sydbank’s culture male as 
well as female employees feel included. this observation coin-
cides well with the results of the employee engagement survey 
in which the diversity and inclusion score totalled 92 out of 100. 
sydbank’s employees aspire to management and both women 
and men at sydbank indicate overall that anyone – regardless of 
background – has an equal opportunity for promotion. 
however at present there are far more women than men in 
administrative positions whereas there is a preponderance 
of men in sydbank’s management. we would welcome more 
women in sydbank’s management and the report published 
by the employers’ association for the financial sector and the 
financial services union in denmark does in fact point out that 
sydbank may very well be one of the first financial undertakings 
to achieve gender balance at management level. the introduction 
of a quota regarding the management talent programme “talent 
for ledelse” will hopefully help us to move forward in a positive 
direction. from 2020 there must be an equal gender balance 
among participants.
sexism has no place in sydbank
sydbank builds on relationships between people – human decen-
cy and mutual respect reflect the way we act, both internally and 
externally. therefore sexism and offensive acts have no place in 
sydbank. employees must feel safe going to work. 
we focus on preventing offensive actions. offensive actions are 
dealt with in accordance with the bank’s booklet on this topic and 
the relevant section in the staff manual. all matters concerning 
offensive acts will always be dealt with seriously and appropri-
ately by the group executive vice president, human resources, 
and the employee in question will be afforded the necessary 
protection.
responsible suppliers and business partners
sydbank strives to be a responsible financial services provider. 
if we are to ensure that our way of banking is responsible it is 
necessary that our suppliers and business partners also assume 
responsibility and make sure that their way of doing business is 
responsible. as a result in 2019 we set a target for 2020 regard-
ing the formulation of a code of conduct for our suppliers and 
business partners.
sydbank’s code of conduct was updated in 2020 and it now 
includes a section on responsible business activities particularly 
aimed at our suppliers and business partners.

focus on energy consumption
sydbank will be respectful of the environment in all aspects of its 
business and make a positive difference in order to reach its own, 
national and global climate targets. we optimise energy efficien-
cy on an ongoing basis to reduce the bank’s energy consumption 
and transparent reporting as regards consumption is a priority for 
sydbank.
in 2021 and in future, co2 emissions will be in focus. we are 
mindful of this at sydbank and therefore we continued our col-
laboration with engineering consultancy company niras in 2020 
as regards the preparation of co2 accounts. our co2 accounts are 
based on the greenhouse gas (ghg) protocol and are consistent 
with the method of calculation recommended by fsr – danish 
auditors, nasdaq copenhagen and cfa society denmark in their 
guidance on esg key figures.
sydbank has its own energy management, which ensures that 
energy efficiency is always a consideration in connection with rel-
evant activities and we work on a daily basis to reduce the bank’s 
energy consumption. energy consumption as regards 90% of 
the bank’s building stock is monitored on an hourly basis via the 
system app.keepfocus, which gives us an overview of energy 
used and sends a warning if there are variations in readings.
in 2019 we defined a goal to set up a solar cell system at the 
head office – and this was achieved in 2020. it is our ambition 
that the solar cell system will cover our standby electricity at the 
head office and we project that the system will produce a total of 
370,000-400,000 kwh of electricity per year.
despite ongoing energy optimisation and focus on the use of re-
newable energy sources we continue to need electricity generat-
ed by conventional energy. at sydbank we will take responsibility 
by carbon offsetting our use of conventional energy. consequent-
ly we decided that from 1 november 2020 we would buy elec-
tricity generated by danish wind turbines to offset the unavoid-
able co2 emissions. we buy renewable wind energy containing 
individual declarations as proof that the electricity purchased is 
generated by danish wind turbines and offsets sydbank’s co2 
emissions as regards electricity. however climate compensation is 
not our first choice or a carte blanche for co2 emissions. first and 
foremost we strive to reduce our emissions as much as possible 
by means of measures such as purchasing electric cars and ener-
gy renovation. consequently carbon offsetting is not a long-term 
solution but a current alternative tool.
esg key figures
the bank’s esg data for 2018-2020 is shown below. the data 
disclosed is calculated on the basis of the recommendations of 
the guidance on esg key figures by cfa society denmark, fsr – 
danish auditors and nasdaq copenhagen.
sydbank has decided to follow the guidance on esg key figures 
because it is consistent with the bank’s ambition to operate a 
responsible and transparent business.

* reserves according to the articles of association equal the undistributable savings bank reserve in accordance with article 4 of the articles of association.
** at1 capital has no maturity date. payment of interest and repayment of principal are voluntary. therefore at1 capital is accounted for as equity. in may 
2018 sydbank issued eur 100m with optional redemption on 28 august 2025. the issue carries interest at the mid-swap rate + a margin of 4.62%, a 
total of 5.25%. under the issue the loan will be written down if the cet1 ratio of sydbank a/s or the sydbank group drops below 7%.

note 1 accounting policies
basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements of sydbank are prepared 
in compliance with international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as adopted by the eu. the financial statements of the 
parent, sydbank a/s, are prepared in compliance with the danish 
financial business act, including the danish executive order on 
financial reporting of credit institutions and brokerage firms etc, 
which is in compliance with the provisions on recognition and 
measurement according to ifrs.
furthermore the annual report is prepared in compliance with 
additional danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of 
listed financial companies.
on 2 march 2021 the board of directors and the group exec-
utive management reviewed and approved the 2020 annual 
report of sydbank a/s. the annual report will be submitted for 
adoption by the agm on 25 march 2021.
new accounting policies
the following amended ifrs standards have been implemented 
effective from 1 january 2020: 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 regarding the definition  
 
of material
• amendments to ifrs 3 regarding the definition of  
business combinations
• amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7 regarding the  
ibor reform.
the changes have not had any effect on recognition and meas-
urement in the consolidated financial statements and the financial 
statements and consequently they have had no impact on eps 
basic. 
apart from the above the accounting policies applied are consist-
ent with those adopted in the previous year.
 
recognition and measurement
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the group and the value 
of the asset can be measured reliably. liabilities are recognised in 
the balance sheet when they are probable and can be measured 
reliably.
income is recognised in the income statement as earned. costs 
incurred to earn the year’s income are recognised in the income 
statement. value adjustments of financial assets, financial liabili-
ties and derivatives are recognised in the income statement apart 
from value adjustments of derivatives used to provide foreign 
currency hedging of net investments in foreign subsidiaries and 
associates. the latter value adjustments are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
purchase and sale of financial instruments are recognised on the 
settlement date.
significant recognition and measurement principles
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements include the parent,
sydbank a/s, as well as subsidiaries in which sydbank a/s 
exercises control over financial and operating policies. “group 
holdings and enterprises” (note 44) lists the consolidated entities.
the consolidated financial statements combine the items of the 
parent and the individual subsidiaries in accordance with the 
group’s accounting policies, in which intra-group income, costs, 
shareholdings, balances and dividends as well as realised and un-
realised gains on intra-group transactions have been eliminated.
acquisitions
entities acquired are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements from the acquisition date. comparative figures are 
not restated for entities acquired.
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed of entities acquired are measured at the acquisition 
date at fair value in accordance with the acquisition method. 
identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they are separable 
or arise from a contractual right. deferred tax on revaluations is 
recognised.
the acquisition date is the date on which the group obtains 
control over the entity acquired.
where the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net 
assets of the entity acquired, the difference is recognised as 
goodwill. goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment 
at least once a year. on acquisition goodwill is allocated to the 
cash-generating units which subsequently form the basis of 
impairment tests.
costs incurred in connection with acquisitions are included in 
administrative costs in the year when incurred.

notes
where at the date of acquisition there is uncertainty as regards 
the identification or measurement of assets acquired, liabilities 
or contingent liabilities assumed or the determination of the 
cost of acquisition, initial recognition is based on provisional 
values. where the identification or measurement of the cost of 
acquisition or of assets acquired, liabilities or contingent liabilities 
assumed subsequently proves to have been incorrect on initial 
recognition, the determination will be adjusted retroactively, 
including goodwill, until 12 months after the acquisition and com-
parative figures are restated. after such time the pre-acquisition 
balance sheet will not be adjusted. changes in estimates of con-
tingent costs of acquisition are recognised in profit for the year.
entities disposed of are consolidated until the transfer date.
foreign currency translation
the consolidated financial statements are presented in dkk, 
the functional currency of the parent. transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of 
transaction. balances in foreign currencies are translated at the 
closing rate.
offsetting
the group sets off assets and liabilities only when the group has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and 
intends to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
income criteria
income and expenses, including interest income and interest 
expense, are accrued over the periods to which they relate and 
are recognised in profit or loss at the amounts relevant to the ac-
counting period. guarantee commission is recognised as income 
over the life of the guarantees. income for implementing a given 
transaction, including securities fees and payment service fees, 
is recognised as income when the transaction has been imple-
mented.
the group’s fees are divided into the following categories:
1. fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate
2. fees obtained when a service has been supplied
3. fees obtained on performance of a specific act.
fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate are 
recognised as income over the expected life of the loans and are 
included under interest income, see note 7. 
fees covered by 2 and 3 above are recognised as income when 
the service has been supplied and when the act has been per-
formed respectively. the fees are specified in note 10.
loan fees, which appear from note 10, primarily concern ar-
ranged mortgage loans. 
financial assets and liabilities
general provisions concerning recognition and measurement
financial assets are classified on the basis of the group’s busi-
ness model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
individual financial assets. with this as a basis, measurement is 
according to one of the following principles:
• amortised cost (amc)
• fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci) 
• fair value through profit or loss (fvpl).  
except for certain strategic shareholdings that are measured at 
fvoci, the group only has financial assets that are measured at 
amc or fvpl.
the group’s financial assets are measured at amc if they are held 
for a commercial purpose in order to collect the contractual cash 
flows of the assets (“hold to collect”) and if such contractual cash 
flows of the financial assets consist solely of payments of princi-
pal and interest on the amount outstanding. 
with the exception of certain strategic shareholdings the group’s 
other financial assets are measured at fvpl, including financial 
assets which are held for a different commercial purpose, eg 
financial assets which are managed on a fair value basis or form 
part of the trading portfolio, and financial assets for which the 
contractual cash flows of the financial assets do not solely consist 
of payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. 
some of the group’s strategic shareholdings are measured at 
fvoci. dividends on such shareholdings are recognised in the 
income statement whereas unrealised and realised market value 
adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
therefore do not have an impact on the income statement.
assessment of business model 
the group’s operating segments include banking, which has a 
“hold to collect” business model. financial assets consist primarily 
of loans and advances. sydbank markets’ business model is 
neither based on “hold to collect” or “hold to collect and sell” 
and consequently financial assets must be recognised at fair 
note 1 accounting policies – continued
60
s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
value through profit or loss. assets comprise bonds, shares, repo 
transactions and loans and advances. certain of these financial 
assets form part of portfolios with a trading pattern meeting 
the definition of “held for trading” whereas other portfolios are 
managed on a fair value basis. 
assessment of contractual cash flow characteristics (solely pay-
ments of principal and interest on amount outstanding) 
the classification of financial assets which form part of portfo-
lios that are either “hold to collect” or “hold to collect and sell” 
is assessed based on whether the contractual cash flows of the 
financial asset consist solely of payments of principal and interest 
on the amount outstanding. the principal reflects the fair value 
at initial recognition and subsequent changes, eg as a result of 
repayment. interest payments should only reflect consideration 
for the time value of money, for the credit risk and for other basic 
lending risks as well as a margin consistent with the basic lending 
arrangement. 
guarantee scheme
contributions to the guarantee fund and the resolution fund, 
for instance to cover losses related to the resolution or bankrupt-
cy of banks, are recognised under “other operating expenses”.
repo and reverse transactions
securities sold under agreements to repurchase the same remain 
on the balance sheet. consideration received is recognised as a 
debt and the difference between selling and buying prices is rec-
ognised over the life as interest in the income statement. gains or 
losses on securities are recognised in the income statement.
securities bought under agreements to resell the same are not 
recognised in the balance sheet and gains or losses on securities 
are not recognised in the income statement. consideration paid 
is recognised as a receivable and the difference between buying 
and selling prices is recognised over the life as interest in the 
income statement.
repo and reverse transactions are recognised and measured at 
fair value as they are regarded as an integral part of the trading 
portfolio and form part of ongoing risk management and deter-
mination of gains thereon.
transfer of loans
the group transfers certain loans secured on real property to a 
mortgage credit institution under the joint funding provisions 
of the danish financial business act. as of the transfer date 
the loans are no longer recognised in the group’s balance sheet 
because the group has transferred control and a certain share of 
the risks and benefits associated with the loans to the mortgage 
credit institution. the group provides a guarantee for part of the 
risk associated with the loans for which it receives guarantee 
commission. moreover the group receives fee income from the 
mortgage credit institution for ongoing servicing of the loans 
transferred.
amounts owed and loans and advances
initial recognition of amounts owed by credit institutions and 
central banks as well as loans and advances is at fair value plus 
transaction costs and less origination fees received.
subsequent measurement of amounts owed by credit institutions 
etc and loans and advances that are not reverse transactions is at 
amortised cost less impairment charges for expected losses. 
amounts owed by credit institutions etc and loans and advances 
at amortised cost are all assessed to determine whether evidence 
of credit impairment exists. 
ecl impairment model 
impairment charges are recorded for expected credit losses 
as regards all financial assets measured at amortised cost and 
similar provisions are made for expected credit losses as regards 
loan commitments and financial guarantees. as regards financial 
assets recognised at amortised cost, impairment charges for 
expected credit losses are recognised in the income statement 
and deducted from the value of the asset in the balance sheet. 
provisions for loan commitments and financial guarantees are 
recognised as a liability. 
according to the impairment model impairment charges are 
recorded for all exposures on the basis of an expected loss model. 
at the date of initial recognition an exposure is written down by 
an amount equal to the expected credit loss within 12 months 
(stage 1). impairment charges for expected credit losses sub-
sequently depend on whether the credit risk of a financial asset 
(facility) has increased significantly since initial recognition and 
follow a 3-stage model:
• stage 1 – facilities with no significant increase in credit risk.  
the asset is written down by an amount equal to the expected 
credit loss as a result of the probability of default over the  
coming 12 months
• stage 2 – facilities with a significant increase in credit risk. 
the asset is transferred to stage 2 and is written down by an 
amount equal to the expected credit loss over the life of the 
asset

notes
• stage 3 – facilities where the financial asset is in default or  
is otherwise credit impaired. as opposed to stages 1 and 2 
interest income is recognised solely on the basis of the  
impaired value of the asset. 
the staging assessment and the calculation of expected credit 
loss are based on the group’s rating models and credit manage-
ment. 
expected losses regarding exposures in stages 1 and 2 are calcu-
lated on the basis of models while the calculation for exposures in 
stage 3 and weak stage 2 is based on an individual assessment.
model calculation is based on the group’s rating model, which 
has been instrumental in connection with credit management 
for many years, and is supplemented by macroeconomic factors 
adjusting the calculated pd values. 
the retail client model is based primarily on account behaviour 
(overdue payments and overdrafts). on the basis of this data  
and inherent statistical correlations, clients are rated according to 
their probability of default vis-à-vis the group within the next   
12 months.
in addition to account behaviour the corporate client model is 
based on accounting data, financial conduct as well as appraisals 
by the credit officer and/or the account manager of the client’s 
current strength profile and an industry analysis.
the assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly 
since initial recognition is made by assessing changes in the risk 
of default over the remaining life of the financial asset rather than 
assessing the increase in the expected credit loss. a facility is 
transferred from stage 1 to stage 2 when the following increase 
in pd is observed:
• facilities with a pd below 1% on establishment: an increase 
in the 12-month pd of the facility of at least 0.5 percentage 
points and a doubling of the lifetime pd of the facility since   
its establishment
• facilities with a pd above 1% on establishment: an increase   
in the 12-month pd of the facility of at least 2 percentage 
points or a doubling of the lifetime pd of the facility. 
facilities more than 30 days past due are transferred to stage 2 
(or stage 3). forborne loans and advances are also transferred to 
stage 2 if losses are not expected in the most likely scenario or 
the client is in a 2-year waiting period for loans on special terms.
exposures belonging to clients whose ability to pay shows signif-
icant signs of weakness are classified in weak stage 2.  by means 
of analyses and random sampling, risk follow-up monitors 
the credit quality, registrations, impairment calculations of the 
exposures as well as the compliance with policies and business 
procedures in general. risk follow-up evaluates on the basis of a 
credit expert assessment whether the group’s rating models rank 
exposures correctly.
the group does not transfer exposures back to stage 1 regard-
less of whether the contractual cash flows are renegotiated to a 
level reflecting client risk.
in connection with renegotiations an exposure is regarded as a 
new exposure and consequently renegotiation will not result in 
recognition of gains or losses.
the expected credit loss is calculated for each individual facility 
on the basis of ead (exposure at default) multiplied by pd (prob-
ability of default) and lgd (loss given default).
exposures in default, see the definition below, or as regards which 
the exposure has been transferred to the central department for 
non-performing exposures or whose probability of loss is higher 
than 50%, are credit impaired and are classified as stage 3.
the expected credit loss over the life of the financial asset covers 
the expected remaining life of the facility. for most facilities the 
expected life is limited to the remaining contractual term. for 
facilities consisting of a loan as well as an undrawn loan commit-
ment and for which a contractual right to demand early repay-
ment and cancellation of the undrawn loan commitment exists, 
the group’s exposure to credit losses is not limited to the con-
tractual notice period. in this case the expected life is assumed to 
equal the period during which the group expects to be exposed 
to credit losses. the expected life is determined on the basis of 
the historical life of the instruments in question. facilities for 
which the expected life is longer than the remaining contractual 
term comprise for instance credit cards, overdraft facilities and 
certain revolving credit facilities. 
the calculation of the expected loss reflects management’s 
current expectations. scenarios are prepared: baseline, upturn 
and downturn, including an assessment of the likelihood of each 
scenario. management’s review of the scenarios may imply that 
changes are made to the scenarios or the probability weighting. 
note 1 accounting policies – continued
62
s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
in addition to the calculated impairment charges to cover expect-
ed credit losses at exposure level, management makes a number 
of estimates of factors which are expected to affect future losses 
on the exposures existing on the balance sheet date, including 
for instance expectations of macroeconomic conditions, industry 
developments or particularly risky portfolios. on the basis thereof 
adjustments of calculated impairment charges are recognised.
default
the definition of default used to measure expected credit losses 
and assess whether an asset must be transferred to another 
stage corresponds to the definition applied for internal risk man-
agement purposes and is adapted to the capital requirements 
regulation (crr). consequently exposures which for regulatory 
purposes are considered to be in default are always classified 
as stage 3, both as regards the number of days past due (90 
days) and the assessment of factors which will probably lead to 
non-payment and hence default according to the regulatory rules. 
according to the group’s rating system, a client is in default if at 
least one of the following events has occurred:
• a write-off has been recorded as regards the client
• the client has at least one non-accrual credit facility
• an impairment charge/provision has been registered in connec-
tion with the client and a loss must be regarded as unavoidable
• the exposure has been transferred to the group’s central  
department for non-performing exposures. 
write-off policy
the group’s practice is that a debt is written off for account-
ing purposes if the legal claim is forfeited or the likelihood of 
collection is very remote. the fundamental principles as regards 
write-offs are as follows:
• for retail clients a debt is written off in part or in full if the  
management of the customer relationship is transferred to   
the group’s collection department
• for corporate clients a debt is written off in part or in full in  
connection with a forthcoming bankruptcy, restructuring or 
initiated realisation of collateral.
debt which has been written off for accounting purposes but 
where a legal claim has been upheld is specified in the notes.
leases (lessor)
lease assets in connection with finance leases in which the group 
is the lessor are recognised under loans and advances at the net 
investment in the leases less amortisation (repayment) which is 
computed according to the annuity method over the lease term. 
income from the lease assets is recognised on the basis of the 
agreed effective interest rate of the leases and is recognised in 
profit or loss under “interest income”. sales proceeds from lease 
assets are recognised under “other operating income”.
leases (lessee)
lease assets and lease liabilities are recognised in the balance 
sheet when the group, under the terms of a lease agreement 
concerning a specifically identified asset, is given possession of 
the lease asset during the lease term and when the group ob-
tains the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from 
the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of 
the identified asset during the lease term.
lease liabilities are measured initially at the present value of 
future lease payments discounted using an alternative borrowing 
rate. the following lease payments are recognised as part of the 
lease liability:
• fixed payments
• variable payments depending on changes in an index or an 
interest rate
• payments due under residual value guarantees
• the exercise price of a purchase option if the group is  
reasonably certain to exercise the option
• payments comprised by an option to extend a lease if the  
group is reasonably certain to exercise the option
• penalties relating to an option to terminate a lease unless  
 
the group is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.
a lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effec-
tive interest method. the lease liability is reassessed if there are 
changes in the underlying contractual cash flows as a result of 
changes in an index or an interest rate, if there are changes in 
the group’s estimate of a residual value guarantee or if the group 
changes its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exer-
cise a purchase option or an option to extend or terminate a lease.
a lease asset is initially measured at cost, which corresponds 
to the value of the lease liability less any prepayments of lease 
payments plus any directly related costs and estimated costs for 
dismantling, restoration or similar and less any discounts or other 
types of incentive payments from the lessor.
the lease asset is subsequently measured at cost less accumu-
lated depreciation and impairment charges. the lease asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life 
of the lease asset. depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a 
straight-line basis.

notes
the lease asset is adjusted for changes in the lease liability as 
a result of changes in the terms and conditions of the lease or 
changes in the contractual cash flows depending on changes in 
an index or an interest rate.
lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
expected lease term of 4-13 years.
the group presents lease assets and lease liabilities separately in 
the balance sheet.
the group has elected not to recognise lease assets of a low 
value and short-term leases in the balance sheet. instead lease 
payments concerning these leases are recognised in profit or loss 
on a straight-line basis.
bonds and shares etc
bonds and shares etc are recognised and measured at fair value. 
similarly for shares outside the trading portfolio the fair value op-
tion is used and changes in value are recognised in profit or loss 
apart from certain strategic shareholdings which are measured at 
fvoci. 
fair value is the amount for which a financial asset can be 
exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties. in an active 
market, fair value is expressed by quoted prices. alternatively it 
is expressed by a model value, based on recognised models and 
observable market data, which corresponds to fair value. the fair 
value of unlisted shares and other holdings is calculated on the 
basis of available information on trades and taking into account 
any shareholders’ agreements etc. alternatively it is calculated on 
the basis of a discounted value of expected cash flows. 
purchase and sale of securities are recognised on the settlement 
date.
holdings in associates
associates are entities in which the group has holdings and 
significant influence but not control. holdings in associates are 
recognised and measured according to the equity method. the 
proportionate share of the profit or loss after tax of the entities 
is recognised under “profit/(loss) on holdings in associates and 
subsidiaries”.
derivatives and hedge accounting 
derivatives are recognised and measured at fair value. positive 
market values are recognised under “other assets”. negative 
market values are recognised under “other liabilities”.
market value adjustment of derivatives hedging the interest 
rate risk of fixed-rate loans and advances generates immediate 
asymmetry in the financial statements as fixed-rate loans and 
advances are measured at amortised cost. this asymmetry is 
eliminated by using the macro hedging rules of ias 39 (fair value 
hedging) as dynamic hedging with daily updating. the calculated 
change in the fair value of the loans and advances effectively 
hedged is recognised in the balance sheet under “other assets” 
or under “other liabilities” and is recognised in the income state-
ment under “market value adjustments”.
pooled plans
all pooled assets and deposits are recognised in separate 
balance sheet items. return on pooled assets and distribution 
to holders of pooled assets are recognised under “market value 
adjustments”. the assets in which holders’ savings are placed are 
measured at fair value.
the portfolio of shares and bonds issued by the group has been 
reduced in equity and bonds issued respectively. consequently 
“deposits in pooled plans” exceeds “assets related to pooled 
plans”.
intangible assets
intangible assets concern the value of customer relationships 
acquired in connection with acquisitions as well as goodwill.
the value of customer relationships acquired is measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. the 
value of customer relationships acquired is amortised over the 
expected useful life of 5-15 years.
initial recognition of goodwill is at cost in the balance sheet. 
subsequent measurement of goodwill is at cost less accumulated 
impairment charges. goodwill is not amortised. goodwill is tested 
for impairment annually and is written down to its recoverable 
amount through profit or loss if the carrying amount is higher. 
the recoverable amount is determined as the present value of 
the future net cash flows expected to be derived from the activity 
to which goodwill is related. the determination of cash-generat-
ing units follows the management structure and management 
control. management assesses the lowest level of cash-gen-
erating units to which the carrying amount of goodwill may be 
allocated.
impairment charges for goodwill are not reversed.

owner-occupied property
owner-occupied property is property mainly used by the group 
to operate its banking business.
owner-occupied property is recognised on acquisition at cost and 
subsequently carried at a revalued amount corresponding to the 
fair value at the date of revaluation less depreciation and impair-
ment charges. revaluations are made with sufficient regularity to 
ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from 
that which would be determined using fair value at the balance 
sheet date.
any decrease in the carrying amount as a result of the revalua-
tion of owner-occupied property is charged to the income state-
ment except where the decrease reverses previously recognised 
increases. any increase as a result of the revaluation of owner- 
occupied property is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and transferred to revaluation reserves under equity except 
where an increase reverses previously recognised impairment 
charges as regards the property in question. owner-occupied 
property is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful life of 50 years taking into account the expected residual 
value at the expiry of the useful life.
as regards ongoing measurement of land and buildings, the value 
of the individual property is measured on the basis of the return 
method. the underlying assumptions, return and rate of return 
are assessed by external valuers.
depreciation and impairment charges are recognised in the in-
come statement under “depreciation and impairment of property, 
plant and equipment”.
other property, plant and equipment
other property, plant and equipment consists primarily of it 
equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
and is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment 
charges. depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful life, typically 3-5 years. leasehold improvements 
are depreciated over the term of the lease. depreciation and im-
pairment charges are recognised in the income statement under 
“depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment”.
other assets
this item includes assets not recognised under other asset items, 
eg positive market values of spot transactions and derivatives, 
cash collateral provided in connection with csa agreements as 
well as interest receivable.
dividend
proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the date of adop-
tion by the agm. proposed dividend for the year is recognised as 
a separate item in equity until adoption.
at1 capital
at1 capital which has no maturity and with voluntary payment 
of interest and voluntary repayment of principal is recognised 
in equity. similarly the interest expense related to the issue is 
recognised as dividend. interest is deducted from equity at the 
time of payment.
own shares
consideration paid or received in connection with the group’s 
purchase and sale of sydbank shares is recognised directly in 
equity.
other liabilities
this item includes negative market values of spot transactions 
and derivatives, cash collateral received in connection with csa 
agreements, negative portfolios in connection with reverse 
transactions, interest payable as well as provisions for employee 
benefits.
negative portfolios in connection with reverse transactions arise 
when the group resells assets received as collateral in connection 
with reverse transactions. the assets received are not recog-
nised in the balance sheet and any resale will therefore result in a 
negative portfolio.
wages and salaries, payroll tax, social security contributions as 
well as paid absences are recognised in the financial year in which 
the related service has been rendered by the group’s employees. 
costs relating to the group’s long-term employee benefits are 
accrued and follow the service rendered by the employees in 
question. pension contributions are paid into the employees’ pen-
sion plans on a continuing basis and are charged to the income 
statement.
employee shares
when the group’s employees are given an option to subscribe 
for shares at a price below the market price, the bonus element 
is recognised from the grant date as a cost under staff costs. the 
set-off is recognised directly in equity as an owner’s transaction. 
the bonus element is expensed successively during the vesting 
period as the difference between the fair value and the subscrip-
tion price of the shares subscribed or the subscription rights.

notes
provisions
provisions include provisions for guarantees, provisions for 
onerous contracts as well as legal actions etc. initial recognition 
of financial guarantees is at fair value, which is often equal to 
the guarantee premium received. subsequent measurement of 
guarantees is at the higher of the guarantee premium received 
amortised over the guarantee period and any provision for 
expected losses.
a provision for a guarantee or an onerous contract is recognised if 
claims for payment under the guarantee or contract are probable 
and the size of the liability can be measured reliably. provisions 
are based on management’s best estimates of the size of the 
liabilities. measurement of provisions includes discounting when 
significant.
financial liabilities
deposits, bonds issued, subordinated capital and amounts owed 
to credit institutions etc are recognised initially at fair value less 
transaction costs incurred.
subsequent measurement of deposits, bonds issued, subordinat-
ed capital and amounts owed to credit institutions etc that are 
not repo transactions is at amortised cost using the effective in-
terest rate method whereby the difference between net proceeds 
and nominal value is recognised in the income statement under 
“interest expense” over the loan period.
other liabilities are measured at net realisable value.
assets in temporary possession
assets in temporary possession include property, plant and 
equipment and disposal groups held for sale, including assets or 
entities taken over in connection with non-performing exposures. 
assets are classified as being in temporary possession when 
their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction within 12 months in accordance with a formal plan. 
assets or disposal groups in temporary possession are measured 
at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell. assets are not depreciated or amortised from the time when 
they are classified as being in temporary possession.
impairment losses arising at initial classification as assets being 
in temporary possession and gains or losses at subsequent 
measurement at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell are recognised in the income statement under 
the items they concern.
tax
the bank is jointly taxed with its danish consolidated entities. 
the group has not opted for international joint taxation.
sydbank a/s has been appointed the management company of 
the joint taxation entity. corporation tax on income subject to 
joint taxation is fully distributed on payment of joint taxation con-
tributions between the danish consolidated entities. tax for the 
year includes tax on taxable income for the year, adjustment of 
deferred tax, adjustment of prior year tax charges and tax on in-
terest paid to holders of at1 capital. tax for the year is recognised 
in the income statement as regards the elements attributable to 
profit for the year, in other comprehensive income as regards the 
elements attributable thereto and directly in equity as regards 
the elements attributable to items recognised directly in equity.
current tax liabilities and current tax assets are recognised in the 
balance sheet as calculated tax on taxable income for the year 
adjusted for tax on prior year taxable income as well as for tax 
paid on account.
deferred tax is recognised on the basis of all temporary differ-
ences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of the 
balance sheets of each consolidated entity as well as tax loss carry 
forwards that are expected to be used. deferred tax is measured 
on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that, according to the 
rules in force at the balance sheet date, are applicable at the time 
the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax.
fair value measurement
the group uses the concept of fair value in connection with 
certain disclosure requirements as well as for recognition and 
measurement of financial instruments. fair value is defined as the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific 
measurement. the entity uses the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability under 
current market conditions, including assumptions about risk. as a 
result the entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle a liability 
is not considered when measuring fair value.
fair value measurement is based on the principal market. if there 
is no principal market the most advantageous market is used as 
a basis, ie the market achieving the highest price for the asset or 
liability less transaction costs.
note 1 accounting policies – continued
66
s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
fair value measurement is based to the widest extent possible on 
market values in active markets or alternatively on values derived 
from observable market data.
in so far as such observations are not available or cannot be 
used without significant modifications, acknowledged valuation 
techniques and reasonable estimates are used as the basis of fair 
values.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement presents the cash flows from operat-
ing, investing and financing activities as well as cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. the cash flow 
statement is presented using the indirect method based on profit 
before tax.
the cash flow effect of the acquisition and disposal of entities is 
reported separately under cash flows from investing activities. 
the cash flow statement recognises cash flows concerning enti-
ties acquired from the acquisition date and cash flows concerning 
entities disposed of until the transfer date.
cash flows from operating activities are determined as profit be-
fore tax for the year adjusted for non-cash operating items, taxes 
paid as well as changes in working capital.
cash flows from investing activities include purchase and sale 
of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets as well as 
holdings in associates.
cash flows from financing activities include dividends paid as well 
as changes in equity, subordinated capital and bonds issued.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and balances on 
demand at central banks, fully secured cash and cash equivalent 
balances on demand with credit institutions and insurance com-
panies as well as unencumbered certificates of deposit.
segment reporting
the group consists of a number of business units and central 
functions. the segments are based on product and service char-
acteristics and comprise banking, asset management, sydbank 
markets, treasury and other. further details of the business units 
are provided in note 5. the correlation between the income state-
ment according to ifrs and the group’s performance measures is 
shown in note 6.
segment reporting as regards the business units complies with 
the group’s accounting policies as regards recognition and meas-
urement. inter-segment transactions are settled on an arm’s 
length basis. centrally incurred costs are allocated to the business 
units in accordance with their estimated proportionate share of 
overall activities.
the following performance measures are used in connection 
with the group’s management control, see segment information 
stated in note 5.
core income
core income comprises income from clients served by the group’s 
branch network, including interest, commission, investment fund 
commission, custody account fees and asset management fees.
trading income
trading income only comprises income from clients affiliated 
with sydbank markets as well as income from flows and market 
making as regards securities and other financial instruments as 
well as related position-taking.
core earnings before impairment
core earnings before impairment charges for loans and advances 
etc represent core income and trading income less costs relating 
to these activities.
impairment of loans and advances etc
impairment of loans and advances etc represents impairment 
charges for bank loans and advances, provisions for guarantees 
as well as credit valuation adjustment of derivatives.
core earnings
core earnings represent core income and trading income less 
costs and impairment charges for loans and advances etc relating 
to these activities.
investment portfolio earnings
investment portfolio earnings represent the return on the 
portfolios of shares, bonds, derivatives and holdings managed 
by treasury, which is part of the business unit sydbank markets. 
investment portfolio earnings are less funding charges and 
administrative costs.

forthcoming standards and interpretations
the international accounting standards board (iasb) has issued 
the following new international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) and interpretations (ifric), which are not mandatory for 
the group in connection with the preparation of the 2020 finan-
cial statements. these include ifrs 17 as well as amendments to 
ifrs 3, ifrs 16, ias 1, ias 16 and ias 37 and ibor reform phase 
2 (ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 7, ifrs 4 and ifrs 16).
the group does not plan to implement the new standards and 
interpretations until they become mandatory. new/amended 
standards and interpretations are not expected to have any 
significant impact on the group’s financial reporting.
accounting policies of the parent
the financial statements of the parent are prepared in accordance 
with the danish financial business act and the danish fsa’s 
executive order on financial reporting of credit institutions. the 
financial statements of the parent are prepared according to the 
same accounting policies as the consolidated financial statements 
except for:
• strategic shareholdings where value adjustment is through 
profit or loss in the financial statements of the parent and 
through other comprehensive income in the consolidated 
financial statements. this difference is due to incompatibility 
between the danish fsa’s executive order on financial reporting 
of credit institutions and ifrs in this regard. the balance sheet 
and equity are not affected. for the impact on profit for the year, 
reference is made to note 46.
• the leasing of property from subsidiaries by the parent, which in 
accordance with the danish fsa’s executive order on financial 
reporting of credit institutions is not treated according to the 
principles of ifrs 16 but continues to be treated according 
to the principles of ias 17. this is due to the fact that the 
properties are fully financed by the parent and therefore the 
application of ifrs 16 would result in double recognition of the 
properties in the balance sheet of the parent.
subsidiaries are entities in which the parent has control. holdings 
in subsidiaries are recognised and measured according to the 
equity method. the proportionate share of profit or loss after tax 
of the entities is recognised under “profit/(loss) on holdings in 
associates and subsidiaries”.

management’s estimates and judgements are based on assump-
tions considered reasonable by management but which by their 
nature are uncertain and unpredictable. these assumptions may 
be incomplete or inaccurate and unexpected future events or 
circumstances may occur. consequently it is by nature difficult to 
make estimates and judgements and since they also involve cus-
tomer relationships and other counterparties they will be subject 
to uncertainty. it may be necessary to change previous estimates 
as a result of changes in the basis of previous estimates or be-
cause of new knowledge or subsequent events.
the areas where critical estimates and judgements have the 
most significant effect on the financial statements are:
• measurement of loans and advances and guarantees etc, 
including in particular management estimates concerning 
covid-19
• fair value of financial instruments
• acquisitions.
measurement of loans and advances and guarantees etc
impairment of loans and advances and provisions for guarantees 
and undrawn credit commitments are made to take into account 
the expected losses on conclusion as well as any credit impair-
ment after initial recognition. the determination of impairment 
charges for expected losses is subject to a number of estimates, 
including which loans and advances or portfolios of loans and 
advances are subject to credit impairment as well as calculation 
of expected losses.
assessing the degree of credit impairment of exposures involves 
a number of estimates which may be subject to uncertainty. 
to a large extent the determination of expected losses at 
exposure level is based on risk registrations, models and past 
experience but it also involves a number of estimates of risks and 
expected developments in the individual exposure, including the 
future ability to pay and the value of collateral which in particular 
comprises mortgages on property. during periods of uncertain 
economic trends or significant demographic or structural changes 
uncertainty is greater. this is reflected in the need for manage-
ment adjustments that by their nature are subject to uncertainty.
the group’s models to calculate impairment of exposures in 
stages 1 and 2 include expectations as to economic develop-
ments. the outlook is based on estimates of the probability of 
different outcomes of economic growth. the outlook results in a 
determination of the probability of the scenarios baseline, upturn 
and downturn. at 31 december 2020 the probability of the 
downturn scenario was fixed at 95%. at 31 december 2019 the 
probability of a downturn scenario was estimated at 50%. the 
increase in the probability of a downturn scenario from 50% to 
95% has increased the calculated impairment charges as regards 
exposures in stages 1 and 2 by approx dkk 37m.
impairment of exposures in stage 3 and the weak part of stage 2 
is based on individual assessments which include expectations of 
future changes in collateral value etc.
in addition to the calculated impairment charges, management 
estimates whether there is a need for special impairment charges 
as regards exposed industries, customer segments or other 
elements that are estimated as having not yet been reflected in 
the bank’s registrations. 
at 31 december 2019 collective impairment charges that can 
be attributed to stage 2 totalled dkk 225m, of which dkk 100m 
concerned management estimates to cover uncertainties related 
to agriculture. 
at 31 december 2020 collective impairment charges included 
an impairment charge to cover losses as a result of the economic 
consequences of covid-19. the impairment charge represents 
dkk 325m and is described in more detail below.
at 31 december 2020 the group’s unsecured loans and advan-
ces in the weakest rating categories 7-9 and default (excluding 
agriculture but including mink farming) amounted to dkk 580m. 
these loans and advances are not subject to objective evidence 
of credit impairment but in the short term they are the most criti-
cal in terms of credit impairment due to covid-19. the impair-
ment charges include a management estimate of dkk 125m to 
hedge the risk of these loans and advances, equal to 22%.
furthermore impairment charges include a management esti-
mate of dkk 200m to cover unforeseen events as regards the 
remaining part of the lending portfolio in rating classes 1-6, the 
credit risk of which is satisfactory or normal. 
reference is made to the notes on risk management for a more 
detailed description of impairment charges for loans and advanc-
es. loans and advances constitute 47% of the group’s assets at 
year-end 2020.
provisions for guarantees and undrawn credit commitments 
issued in connection with client exposures are made according to 
the same principles as those applying to the impairment of loans 
and advances and involve the same elements of uncertainty.

consequences of covid-19
as part of the group’s risk management the potential economic 
consequences of covid-19 are assessed as regards the group’s 
different areas of activity. the group’s risks concern mainly lend-
ing to businesses in exposed industries, weak corporate clients 
and small corporate clients. the group’s loans and advances to 
industries considered to be particularly exposed (sea and air 
transport, specialised retailers as well as hotels, restaurants and 
entertainment) totalled dkk 1.7bn at 31 december 2020, equiv-
alent to 2.8% of total loans and advances of dkk 60.2bn.
corporate clients that were weak (rating categories 7, 8, 9 
and default) already before the coronavirus crisis will be even 
more challenged during times of crisis. impairment charges are 
recorded on a regular basis on all clients subject to objective 
evidence of credit impairment and as a result these clients are 
given significant managerial focus. loans and advances to weak 
corporate clients without objective evidence of credit impairment 
(excluding agriculture, but including mink farming) represent  
dkk 0.8bn before deduction of collateral received.
by experience the smallest businesses are often less robust in 
situations of economic downturn. loans and advances to the 
smallest businesses – with a balance sheet total of less than dkk 
5m – represented dkk 1.0bn at 31 december 2020, equivalent 
to 1.7% of total loans and advances of dkk 60.2bn.
fair value of financial instruments
the group measures a number of financial instruments at fair 
value, including all derivatives as well as shares and bonds.
judgements are made in connection with the determination of 
the fair value of financial instruments in the following areas: 
• choice of valuation technique
• determination of when available quoted prices do not represent 
fair value
• calculation of fair value adjustments to take into account rele-
vant risk factors such as credit risk, model risk and liquidity risk
• assessment of which market parameters must be observed
• estimate of future cash flows and required rates of return as 
regards unlisted shares.
management estimates are based on an assessment in accord-
ance with the group’s accounting policies and generally accepted 
valuation techniques.
as part of its operations the group has acquired strategic hold-
ings. strategic holdings are measured at fair value on the basis of 
available information on trades in the relevant entity’s holdings 
or alternatively a valuation model based on recognised methods 
and current market data, including a judgement of projected 
future earnings and cash flows. valution will also be influenced by 
co-ownership, trade and shareholders’ agreements etc.
as regards financial instruments where measurement is only to 
a limited extent based on observable market data, measurement 
is affected by estimates. this is the case as regards for instance 
unlisted shares and certain bonds for which there is no active 
market. measurement of illiquid bonds is affected by the assump-
tion of the relevant credit spread.
reference is made to “accounting policies” (note 1) and to “fair 
value disclosure” (note 39) for a more detailed description. finan-
cial instruments measured on the basis of unobservable inputs 
represent dkk 2,092m, equivalent to 1.3% of the group’s assets 
at year-end 2020.
acquisitions
in connection with the acquisition of alm. brand bank the fair 
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been 
assessed in accordance with the rules. 
the value of the customer relationships acquired (intangible 
asset) as well as loans and advances, loan commitments and 
guarantees are substantially based on estimates and calculations 
as there are no market prices for these assets.
as a result of the determination of fair values, the value of 
customer relationships as well as additional impairment charges 
for loans and advances etc have been recognised relative to the 
carrying amount of loans and advances with alm. brand bank at 
the acquisition date. 
reference is made to note 47 for a specification of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed as well as additional information 
about the acquisition.
apart from the usual uncertainty surrounding estimates the 
determination of fair values at the acquisition date has not pre-
sented any particular difficulties.

charges include deposit accounts and financial assets in the form of bonds and shares. the group ensures that the items charged
are separate from clients’ right of disposal and that the charge is of legal validity. valuation is ensured via the requirements of the
financial collateral comprehensive method according to eu regulation 575/2013 and directive 2013/36/eu on requirements for 
credit institutions and investment firms (crr/crd iv) which reduces the value of collateral on the basis of issuer, maturity and liquidity.
the group has concluded netting agreements with all significant counterparties.

note 5 segment reporting
operating segments
the group’s segment statements are divided into the following business units: banking, asset management, sydbank markets,
treasury and other.
banking serves all types of retail and corporate clients.
asset management primarily comprises the bank’s advisory-related income from clients and investment funds.
sydbank markets comprises trading income as well as a share of the income from clients with decentral affiliation calculated on
the basis of the market price thereof. the share represents the payment by banking for sydbank markets’ facilities, including advisory
services and administration.
treasury comprises the group’s return on positions handled by treasury, including liquidity allocation.
other includes non-recurring items, costs to the group executive management etc as well as return on strategic shareholdings
that are not allocated to banking or sydbank markets.
inter-segment transactions are settled on an arm’s length basis. centrally incurred costs are allocated to the business units in
accordance with their estimated proportionate share of overall activities.
excess liquidity is settled primarily at short-term money market rates whereas other balances are settled on an arm’s length basis.

income from external clients is broken down by organisational affiliation within the sydbank group. assets, comprising only intangible
assets, land and buildings, other property, plant and equipment as well as holdings in associates, are broken down by location.
the geographical breakdown of the group’s income and assets is disclosed in compliance with ifrs and does not reflect the group’s
management structure. management is of the opinion that operating segmentation provides a more informative description of the
group’s activities.

the group’s cash resources are primarily placed in danish mortgage bonds. the interest rate risk concerning these positions has been reduced 
via derivatives. as a result the group’s external income statement is affected in terms of interest income and the market value adjustment 
of bonds and derivatives. the same applies to the group’s position-taking as regards bonds as well as shares. the breakdown by income 
statement item does not disclose income independently and consequently these items must be regarded as one as they are in “segment 
reporting” (note 5) as well as in the group’s financial review, which also takes funding of the positions into account.

in the event that the group uses collateral that is not immediately convertible into liquid holdings, it is the group’s policy to dispose of such assets as quickly 
as possible. real property is handed over to an estate agent. repossessed leased equipment is sold as quickly as possible. in 2020 repossessed equipment 
in connection with non-performing exposures amounted to dkk 21m (2019: dkk 24m). lease assets are assessed and depreciated on an ongoing basis. 
as a result the calculated collateral as regards the group’s leasing activities will decline during periods of lower lease asset prices. as regards acquired entities 
reference is made to note 47.

* provision for guarantees as regards the portfolio acquired from alm. brand bank, which is recognised as credit impaired at initial
   recognition, totals dkk 36m.
the group’s models to calculate ecl as regards stages 1 and 2 include expectations as to economic developments. the outlook is 
based on estimates of the probability of different outcomes of economic growth. see note 2 “accounting estimates and judgements” 
pp 65-66 for a more detailed description.
in addition to individually calculated impairment charges, a management estimate of dkk 325m was recognised at year-end 2020 
(2019: dkk 225m) to cover the consequences of the covid-19 outbreak on the group’s lending portfolio, of which dkk 125m has 
been provided for to cover exposures in rating categories 7-9. the remaining dkk 200m has been reserved to cover unforeseen 
events as regards the remaining part of the lending portfolio, the credit risk of which is satisfactory or normal.

intangible assets
the group’s intangible assets comprise the value of customer relationships as well as goodwill acquired in connection with acquisitions.
activities acquired are allocated to the operating segments banking, asset management and sydbank markets. goodwill represents
dkk 170m at year-end 2020 (2019: dkk 170m) and primarily concerns banking. goodwill is tested for impairment annually. the 
impairment test carried out in 2020 did not result in impairment of goodwill.
the value of customer relationships represents dkk 275m at year-end 2020 (2019: dkk 69m). additions in connection with acquisi-
tion of entity in 2020 represent dkk 225m. customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected economic 
life of 5-15 years 
impairment test
the group’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually and where there is any indication of impairment.
the impairment test compares the carrying amount and the estimated present value of expected future cash flows. as a consequence
of the special capital structure of financial groups, the calculation of the present value of future cash flows is based on an equity model/
dividend discount model.
future cash flows are determined on the basis of approved strategies and earnings estimates for the budget period. earnings for
the budget period are based on the budget for 2021 as approved by management which involves a steady development
in the bank’s profit. earnings at the end of the budget period are subsequently projected on the basis of expected long-term
growth. annualised growth in the terminal period is assumed to represent 1.5%.
 
expected future cash flows are discounted at the group’s risk-adjusted required rates of return which constitute 9.7% before tax
and 7.6% after tax at year-end 2020 (2019: 9.5% before tax and 7.5% after tax). the required rate of return and consequently
the discount rate are based on current market data and external benchmarks.
the impairment test conducted does not indicate any impairment at 31 december 2020.
an increase in the group’s risk-adjusted required rate of return from 7.6% to for instance 9.0% would not result in goodwill
impairment. correspondingly a decline in estimated growth in the terminal period of 1 percentage point would not result in impairment.
in addition a decrease in earnings of 15% during the terminal period would not result in impairment.

note 35 contingent liabilities and other obligating agreements – continued
totalkredit loans arranged for by sydbank are comprised by an agreed right of set-off against future current commission which
totalkredit may invoke in the event of losses on the loans arranged.
sydbank does not expect that this set-off will have a significant effect on sydbank’s financial position.
as a result of the bank’s membership of bankdata, the bank will be obligated to pay an exit charge in the event of exit.
 
as a result of the statutory participation in the deposit guarantee scheme, the industry paid an annual contribution of 2.5‰ of covered 
net deposits until the banking department’s capital exceeded 1% of total covered net deposits, which was reached at year-end 2015. 
the banking department will cover the direct losses in connection with the winding-up of distressed financial institutions under bank 
package iii and bank package iv which are attributable to covered net deposits. any losses as a result of the final winding-up will be 
covered by the guarantee fund via the winding-up and restructuring department as regards which sydbank is currently liable for
7.1% of any losses. 
as a result of the statutory participation in the resolution financing arrangement (the resolution fund), credit institutions pay an annual
contribution over a 10-year period to reach a target funding level totalling 1% of covered deposits. credit institutions must make con-
tributions to the fund according to their relative size and risk in denmark. sydbank expects that contributions will total approximately 
dkk 220m over a 10-year period.
 
the group is party to legal actions. these legal actions are under continuous review and the necessary provisions made are based on an 
assessment of the risk of loss. pending legal actions are not expected to have any significant effect on the financial position of the group.
sydbank is jointly taxed with its danish consolidated entities. the sydbank group has not opted for international joint taxation.
sydbank has been appointed the management company of the joint taxation entity. being the management company sydbank has 
unlimited and joint and several liability with its subsidiaries as regards the joint taxation concerning danish corporation tax.
note 36 fair value hedging of interest rate risks (macro hedge)
the overall risk of fixed-rate loans and advances consists of credit risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. similarly the overall 
risk of the hedging transactions – primarily interest rate swaps – consists of counterparty risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate 
risk. credit risk is managed separately in line with the credit risk of floating-rate loans and advances whereas the foreign exchange risk 
of loans and advances and the hedging transactions is subject to ongoing hedging. the counterparty risk of the hedging transactions 
is subject to ongoing hedging via csa agreements requiring exchange of collateral to hedge positive market values, see note “deriva-
tives”.
the remaining part of risk is attributable to the risk-free interest rate which the group manages by means of a cash flow model which 
delivers a synthetic cash flow divided into maturity zones expressing the group’s risk positions. the model is updated daily with all the 
group’s positions. these are allocated to portfolios according to responsibility and product.
one of these portfolios consists of the group’s positions in fixed-rate loans and advances, including leases, fixed-rate deposits and 
related hedging transactions. 
the group’s basis for concluding hedging transactions (rebalancing) is thus a synthetic net cash flow which is updated daily based on 
the actual cash flow of loans and advances, deposits and previously concluded hedging transactions in the relevant portfolio.  
the synthetic cash flows are placed in maturity zones (under 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-7 years, and over 7 years) for each currency. each 
zone is subject to an interest rate limit (typically dkk 1m) and a requirement that the interest rate risk of the hedging transaction must 
not exceed the hedged item. 
this ensures that the interest rate risk in this portfolio is kept at a minimum as the group wishes to place its interest rate risk in other 
portfolios containing bonds and other cash equivalent positions.
the group applies the rules on macro hedge which aim to ensure symmetry between income and expense in the financial statements.
symmetry is achieved by making a hedge adjustment of the hedged loans and advances and deposits corresponding to the part of the 
market value adjustment of derivatives which concerns future periods. this hedge adjustment is recorded under “other liabilities” and 
represents dkk 60m at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 63m under “other liabilities”).
during the year a net gain on hedging transactions of dkk 14m was recorded (2019: net gain of dkk 98m). the gain eliminates a 
corresponding net loss on hedged items.
the group’s interest rate risk management is described in more detail in “notes – risk management” on page 124.

the group’s fair value hedging of interest rate risks (macro hedge) is described in detail in note 39 on page 108.
note 37 collateral
at the end of 2020 the group had deposited as collateral securities and cash at a total value of dkk 260m with danish and foreign ex- 
changes and clearing centres etc in connection with margin calls and securities settlements etc. in addition the group has provided
cash collateral in connection with csa agreements of dkk 2,043m and deposited as collateral securities at a market value of dkk 21m. 
the correlation to market values of derivatives appears from “notes – derivatives”. 
in connection with repo transactions, which involve selling securities to be repurchased at a later date, the securities remain on the
balance sheet and consideration received is recognised as a debt. repo transaction securities are treated as assets provided as collateral
for liabilities. counterparties are entitled to sell the securities or deposit them as collateral for other loans. for the breakdown by 
amounts owed to credit institutions and deposits, see notes 28 and 29.
in connection with reverse transactions, which involve purchasing securities to be resold at a later date, the group is entitled to sell the 
securities or deposit them as collateral for other loans. the securities are not recognised in the balance sheet and consideration paid is 
recognised as a receivable.
assets received as collateral in connection with reverse transactions may be sold to a third party. in such cases a negative portfolio may 
arise as a result of the accounting rules. this is recognised under “other liabilities”.

financial instruments recognised at fair value
measurement of financial instruments is based on quoted prices from an active market, on generally accepted valuation models with
observable market data or on available data that only to a limited extent are observable market data.
measurement of financial instruments for which prices are quoted in an active market or which is based on generally accepted valuation 
models with observable market data is not subject to significant estimates.
as regards financial instruments where measurement is based on available data that only to a limited extent are observable market
data, measurement is subject to estimates. such financial instruments appear from the column unobservable inputs below and include 
primarily unlisted shares, including shares in dlr kredit a/s.
the fair value of unlisted shares and other holdings is calculated on the basis of available information on trades etc – including to a very sig-
nificant extent on shareholders agreements based on book value. to an insignificant extent fair value is calculated on the basis of expected 
cash flows.
a 10% change in the calculated market value of financial assets measured on the basis of unobservable inputs will affect profit before
tax by dkk 327m.

to take into account changes in credit risk concerning derivatives with positive fair value, an adjustment is made – cva. cva is a function
of the risk of counterparty default (pd), the expected positive exposure and the loss ratio in the event of default. pd is determined on the 
basis of the group’s credit models – default probability in 12 months. pd beyond 12 months is adjusted on the basis of market data of 
exposures with a similar pd level. at year-end 2020 cva constitutes dkk 19m compared to dkk 19m at year-end 2019.
client margins recognised in connection with derivatives are amortised over the life of the transaction. at year-end 2020 client margins
presently not recognised as income total dkk 21m compared to dkk 26m at year-end 2019. 
financial instruments recognised at amortised cost
the vast majority of the group’s amounts owed, loans and advances and deposits cannot be transferred without the prior consent of
clients and no active market exists for trading in such financial instruments. consequently fair value disclosures are solely based on
circumstances where market conditions have changed after initial recognition of the instrument, including in particular changes in
interest rates. fair value disclosures on financial instruments recognised at amortised cost are based on the assumptions below:
• as regards financial instruments for which a quoted price exists in the market, such a price is applied. this applies to bonds issued and 
subordinated capital. in the absence of a market price, the value is determined on the basis of estimates of the market’s existing required 
rate of return.
• as regards loans and advances, impairment charges are presumed to equal the fair value of the credit risk.
• as regards financial instruments with a maturity of less than 6 months, amortised cost is presumed to equal fair value.
• as a rule the interest rate risk of fixed-rate deposits and loans and advances with a maturity exceeding 6 months is hedged by derivatives, 
primarily interest rate swaps. the hedge is treated as a fair value hedge for accounting purposes. as a result of the application of these 
rules this portfolio, taken as a whole, is recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. the portfolio comprises loans and advances, deposits 
and swaps, see note 36.
based on the above it is the overall assessment that the fair value of loans and advances and deposits corresponds to the carrying amount 
at 31 december 2020 in all material respects.

note 43 reporting events occurring after the balance sheet date
sydbank a/s has sold 100% of the share capital in the subsidiary alm. brand leasing a/s to opendo a/s effective from 1 march 2021. 
in addition sydbank a/s will acquire 10.4% of the share capital in opendo a/s, thereby becoming a co-owner of the company together 
with 13 other financial institutions and an insurance undertaking.
the reason for the sale is that the current leasing set-up of sydbank a/s is based on finance leasing while the primary focus of alm. brand 
leasing a/s is operating leasing. with opendo a/s as the new owner, the owners will continue to focus on operating leasing. moreover 
approx 30 jobs are guaranteed.
the sale has been effected at book value at 31 december 2020 after deduction of dividends.
apart from the above no matters of significant impact on the financial position of the group have occurred after the expiry of the 
financial year.

note 47 acquisition of subsidiaries – continued
on 10 december 2020 sydbank requested the danish fsa to revoke alm. brank bank’s banking licence and consequently the permis-
sion to conduct banking business. the request was met on 30 december 2020 and alm. brand bank no longer conducts business 
requiring a banking licence in accordance with the danish financial business act.
the activities of alm. brand leasing a/s predominantly comprise operating leasing which is outside the strategic scope of the sydbank 
group and therefore the plan is to dispose of them. as a result assets and liabilities concerning alm. brand leasing a/s are presented in 
the balance sheet of the sydbank group as assets and liabilities in temporary possession and have therefore been disposed of at 1 
march 2021.
the activities acquired are included in the segment reporting of the sydbank group under banking. sydbank has concluded an agree-
ment with alm. brand forsikring as regards the handling of certain administrative tasks during a transitional period.
the purchase price of the alm. brand bank group represents dkk 1,897m, which has been paid in cash. 
the acquisition includes approx 55,000 nemkonto (easy account) customers, bank loans and advances totalling dkk 4.2bn and 
arranged totalkredit mortgage loans representing dkk 16.9bn.
moreover the agreement includes the establishment of a partnership to create attractive value propositions for bank customers and 
insurance customers. the partnership is expected to generate an increase in business volume and income for both parties. 
after recognition of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, goodwill in connection with the acquisition con-
stitutes dkk 0m. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed can be broken down as follows at the acquisition date:

s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
note 47 acquisition of subsidiaries – continued
calculation of fair values
in connection with the acquisition of alm. brand bank, sydbank has determined identifiable assets and liabilities which are recognised 
in the pre-acquisition balance sheet at fair value. 
the fair value of loans and advances is based on an assessment of the market value of the portfolio acquired. before the fair value 
adjustment, the net value of loans and advances represented dkk 4,405m at the acquisition date. the fair value adjustment of loans 
and advances totalled dkk 165m. total loans and advances after fair value adjustment represented dkk 4,239m.
the fair value of customer relationships has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method (meem). customer rela-
tionships are determined at the present value of the net cash flows generated through sale to customers after deducting a reasonable 
return on all other assets which contribute to generating the cash flows in question. the fair value of other intangible assets is based 
on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the ongoing use of the assets or from the sale of the assets.
the fair value of land and buildings is based on a combination of external valuers and the dcf model.
liabilities are valued at the present value of the amounts to be applied to settling the liabilities. the group’s lending rate before tax is 
used in connection with discounting. discounting is avoided as regards short-term liabilities when the effect is insignificant.
impact of the acquisition on the sydbank group’s income statement
the activities acquired form part of the sydbank group’s net interest and fee income at dkk 42m and profit for the year at dkk 3m for the 
period from the acquisition at 30 november 2020 to 31 december 2020.
the group’s net interest and fee income and profit for the year for 2020 made up pro forma as if alm. brand bank had been acquired as of 
1 january 2020 total dkk 555m and dkk 82m respectively. the pro forma figures are determined on the basis of the actual acquisition 
cost and the allocation of the purchase price as at the acquisition date. however depreciation/amortisation, loan costs etc are included in 
the pro forma figures as of 1 january 2020.
acquisitions in 2019
on 1 october 2019 the group acquired the shares in green team group a/s. sydbank was the main banker to the green team group 
and acquired it without consideration as a consequence of the company’s situation. green team is consolidated in accordance with the 
rules applying to “assets held for sale” as it is expected that the entities of the group will be disposed of as soon as possible when market 
conditions allow. the entity’s assets totalling dkk 351m and its liabilities totalling dkk 86m, excluding the facilities with sydbank, are 
recognised under “other assets” and “other liabilities” respectively.
the entity’s staff numbers approx 52. they are not included in the number of full-time employees in “group financial highlights” of the 
sydbank group on page 10.
the entity’s financial performance after the acquisition has not resulted in a change in the net realisable value which was recognised on 
acquisition.

notes – risk management
on the basis of the strategic objectives for the group, the board 
of directors has issued guidelines for the group executive man-
agement and has adopted policies as regards credit risk, liquidity 
risk, market risk, operational risk, insurance and it security.
the board of directors has set up a risk committee to address 
risk management in greater detail. the committee convenes as a 
minimum every quarter where ongoing reporting to the board of 
directors is reviewed and current issues are discussed. at subse-
quent board meetings the contents and conclusions of the risk 
committee meetings are presented to the full board of directors.
credits is responsible for the day-to-day handling of credit risk 
whereas sydbank markets is responsible for the day-to-day han-
dling of liquidity and market risks. the individual business units 
are each responsible for the day-to-day handling of operational 
risk. finance is responsible for handling the group’s insurances 
and it service & development is responsible for the group’s it 
security.
overall risk management, including ongoing reporting to the 
group executive management and the board of directors, is 
performed by risk. the group executive vice president of risk is 
the cro of the sydbank group.
risk management is supported by the group’s risk organisation, 
see the chart below.
the relevant business units are represented in the committees,
each headed by a group executive management member. the
cro is a member of all committees.
it is the responsibility of the committees, within their respective 
risk areas, to identify, assess and follow up on the group’s risks in-
cluding principles to determine risk, models applied, and to assess 
whether exposures and risks comply with the group’s intended 
profile and policy.
the committees convene as a minimum every quarter and pre-
pare once a year a risk analysis which is included as an important 
element in the annual risk assessment of the group.
the risk assessment at 31 december 2020 together with the 
group’s 2020 financial statements, credit risk 2020, the group’s 
internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ilaap) at 31 
december 2020 and the group’s internal capital adequacy as-
sessment process (icaap) at 31 december 2020 constitute the 
main elements of risk committee and audit committee meet-
ings as well as board meetings at the beginning of 2021. on the 
basis of the discussions at these meetings the board of directors 
will subsequently update the group’s policies and guidelines.

credit and client policy
the group’s overall credit risk is managed according to policies 
and limits determined and adopted by the board of directors.
the board of directors lays down the general framework for cred-
it granting and the largest exposures are submitted on a regular 
basis to the board of directors for approval or information. 
 
employees with a lending authority may grant approvals. such 
authority is adjusted to the employee’s position. the lending 
authority is risk-based, ie a higher risk means reduced lending 
authority.
retail clients
credit granting to retail clients is based on the client’s disposable 
amount, wealth and leverage (defined as total household debt 
divided by household personal income) as well as knowledge of 
the client.
the objective is that the majority of retail client exposures are 
approved by the client’s branch and that the remaining client 
exposures are approved by specially appointed heads of credit. 
consequently exposures where the client has negative assets of 
more than dkk 100,000 are approved by heads of credit. major 
exposures and exposures with an increased risk are reviewed 
centrally by credits.
corporate clients
as a rule corporate clients are served by the regional head office 
or by special corporate departments. the group’s largest and 
most complex exposures are handled by corporate & institutional 
banking. the objective is that all small corporate exposures with 
satisfactory credit quality are approved at regional level. medium- 
size and major exposures are approved centrally by credits, the 
group executive management or the board of directors.
the group’s credit-related decisions are based on a systematic 
and structured review of the client’s circumstances and indus-
try affiliation. the review is based on all accessible information, 
including industry analyses and financial analyses, and also 
comprises an assessment of the client’s forward-looking business 
plan and its risk and feasibility.
credit activities
credit activities are conducted partly in the retail and corporate 
departments and partly centrally in credits. as described below, 
the group has developed rating models to assess risks to retail 
clients, corporate clients and investment clients.
the group’s credit activities are an active element in the group’s 
efforts to increase its income by:
• maintaining and increasing the portfolio of profitable and  
promising retail, corporate and investment clients
• maintaining and increasing clients’ business volume with the 
group through a balanced composition of:
– loans and advances and guarantees
– deposits
– payment services transactions
– trading in securities etc
– financial instruments
• avoiding/reducing risk of loss by implementing action plans 
for weak exposures. these action plans involve reducing the 
group’s exposure as well as hedging risks by securing additional 
collateral.
risks in connection with lending must be precalculated on an 
informed and well-founded basis.
the group’s credit exposure is in particular to clients in denmark 
and northern germany.
particular focus is given to weak exposures. the objective is to 
ensure that the group’s action plans for these exposures are eval-
uated and adjusted on an ongoing basis to reduce the risk of loss.
moreover credits has a department which is assigned to expo-
sures with a significant risk of loss. these exposures are closely 
monitored and credits is actively involved in preparing solutions 
to mitigate the group’s credit risk. 
on the basis of a risk-based approach credit control ensures that 
procedures and lending authorities are complied with as well as 
checks the bank’s systems and business procedures in the credit 
area. moreover credit control, which is a separate department, 
follows up that any errors detected are corrected and reports to 
the bank’s management about its activities.
risk follow-up
risk follow-up is part of the division risk.
by means of analyses and random sampling risk follow-up
monitors the credit quality of exposures, registrations, impair-
ment charge calculations as well as the compliance with policies 
and business procedures in general.
this process involves research and analyses using information 
from the group’s database of all exposures.
moreover risk follow-up conducts regular credit quality analyses 
of the group’s new exposures as well as regular random sampling 
of the retail and corporate client portfolios.
finally risk follow-up evaluates on the basis of a credit expert 
assessment whether the group’s rating models rank clients 
correctly.

notes – risk management
collateral
the group aims to mitigate the risk on individual exposures by 
way of charges on assets, netting agreements and guarantees.
the most frequent types of charges include mortgages and 
charges on financial assets (shares, bonds and units).
the group receives different kinds of guarantees for exposures. 
many of these are provided by companies or individuals who 
have a group relationship with the debtor.
in the event that the group uses collateral that is not immediately 
convertible into liquid holdings, it is the group’s policy to dispose 
of such assets as quickly as possible. in 2020 repossessed equip-
ment in connection with non-performing exposures amounted 
to dkk 21m (2019: dkk 24m). lease assets are assessed and 
depreciated on an ongoing basis. as a result the calculated col-
lateral as regards the group’s leasing activities will decline during 
periods of lower lease asset prices.
collateral has increased by dkk 9,721m from dkk 56,179m 
in 2019 to dkk 65,900m in 2020. dkk 7,339m of the rise is 
attributable to the portfolio acquired from alm. brand bank, of 
which dkk 2,974m concerns particularly secured transactions.
the group assesses on an ongoing basis the value of collateral
provided. the value is determined as the expected net proceeds
on realisation.
the 2 tables below illustrate the breakdown of collateral by type
and rating category respectively.
mortgages on real property have gone up by dkk 2,520m from 
dkk 8,386m in 2019 to dkk 10,906m in 2020. the increase is 
primarily attributable to the rise in arranged mortgage loans (to-
talkredit) as well as the portfolio acquired from alm. brand bank.
financial collateral has increased by dkk 5,431m from dkk
17,776m in 2019 to dkk 23,207m in 2020, which is primarily 
attributable to the rise in loans and advances at fair value which 
have gone up by dkk 5,359m. loans and advances at fair value 
are repo loans and advances with financial collateral.

financial counterparties
trading in securities, currencies and derivatives, as well as pay-
ment services etc involve exposure to financial counterparties in 
the form of delivery risk or credit risk.
delivery risk is the risk that the group does not receive payments
or securities in connection with the settlement of securities or 
currency transactions equalling the securities or payments deliv-
ered by the group.
credits, the group executive management and the board of 
directors grant delivery risk lines and credit risk lines to financial 
counterparties. based on the risk profile of the individual counter- 
party, rating, earnings and capital position as well as size are as-
sessed. risks and lines to financial counterparties are monitored 
continuously.
tees. excess collateral is not included in the calculation of collater-
al. 67.5% (2019: 60.3%) of the group’s loans and advances and 
guarantees after impairment charges is covered via collateral. 
the group participates in an international foreign exchange 
settlement system, cls®, which aims to reduce delivery risk. in 
cls® payment is made on the net position for each currency and 
only one amount for each currency is paid or received. in addition 
this net exposure is only to one counterparty, who is the group’s 
partner in the system.
the group aims to mitigate credit risk to financial counterparties 
in many ways, eg by concluding netting agreements (isda and 
gmra agreements). moreover the group has entered into agree-
ments (csa agreements) with all significant counterparties to en-
sure credit risk mitigation of derivatives. exposures are calculated 
on a daily basis after which the parties settle collateral. conse-
quently exposures are reset in all material respects on a daily 
basis. the agreements are managed by transaction banking.

notes – risk management
market risk is the risk that the market value of the group’s assets 
and liabilities will be affected as a result of changes in market 
prices.
assuming market risk is considered a natural and integral part 
of all-round banking. assuming risk must be on a conscious and 
well-documented basis. to the extent possible, risk should be 
assumed in products which offer a possibility of eliminating or 
mitigating risk at short notice.
interest rate and foreign exchange risks deriving from deposits by 
and loans and advances to the group’s clients are hedged on an 
ongoing basis and are consequently not used for position-taking.
for further information reference is made to note 36.
the group operates with the following types of market risk:
• interest rate risk
• credit spread risk
• equity risk
• foreign exchange risk
• other market risks.
for security and control reasons, the board of directors empha-
sises that the group’s market risk is subject to central decision-
making and management. consequently the group’s most signifi-
cant interest rate, foreign exchange and equity risks must be
assumed by the parent.
the board of directors has determined the group’s risk tolerance
as follows: medium as regards interest rate risk and low as re-
gards the other types of market risk.
market risk is managed by sydbank markets according to policies
and limits determined and adopted by the bank’s board of
directors. the group executive management has passed on the
overall limits from the board of directors to sydbank markets and 
treasury. sydbank markets manages trading and market making 
as regards the group’s clients and financial counterparties. treas-
ury manages the group’s long-term interest rate positions and 
hedging, including the group’s primary liquidity positions as well 
as liquidity generation. the group’s returns in sydbank markets 
and treasury appear from “segment reporting” (note 5). treasury 
has primarily interest rate risks and credit spread risks.
middle office in transaction banking as well as risk continuously 
monitor the individual risk areas and provide management with 
extensive reporting on a regular basis.
interest rate risk
interest rate risk comprises the group’s total risk of loss resulting
from interest rate changes in financial markets.
the group uses a cash flow model to determine the interest rate
risk of fixed-rate positions. a duration model is used to calculate
the interest rate risk of danish callable mortgage bonds. interest
rate risk makes up the bulk of the group’s overall market risk.
in accordance with the danish fsa’s method of calculation,
interest rate risk is calculated as the change in market values at
a parallel shift in the interest rate level of plus 1 percentage
point in all currencies and at 31 december 2020 it represents
dkk 171m or 1.7% of the group’s cet1 capital.

the group’s interest rate risk is predominantly attributable to 
positions with a maturity of less than 1 year. the group has no 
significant interest rate risk apart from eur/dkk.
the group’s interest rate risk is – in line with 2019 – positive, ie 
the group’s profit will be adversely affected by an interest rate 
increase.
the danish fsa’s method of calculation allows full set-off
between different currencies, maturities and yield curves. the
group is aware of the risk of these assumptions and monitors
these risks separately on an ongoing basis.

credit spread risk
credit spread risk is the risk that the credit spreads of the bonds
in the bond portfolio change to the detriment of the group.
the group determines its credit spread risk on the basis of the
following credit spread changes:
• government bonds 25bp
• mortgage bonds 50bp
• other high-yield bonds 100bp.
the group’s credit spread risk makes up dkk 277m at 31 de-
cember 2020 and is included when determining the solvency
need.

(2019: dkk 2,199m).
in the event of a 10% change in share prices, profit before tax
will be affected by dkk 244m (2019: dkk 220m) as well as
other comprehensive income by dkk 15m (2019: dkk 16m).
equity investments represent dkk 226m (2019: dkk 204m) 
and dkk 15m (2019: dkk 16m) respectively.
foreign exchange risk
as in previous years the group’s foreign exchange risk was
insignificant in 2020 and consequently a 10% change in foreign
exchange rates against dkk at 31 december 2020 will not
affect profit before tax significantly.
other market risks
the group does not have any other significant market risks at
31 december 2020.

notes – risk management
liquidity risk is the risk that the group cannot meet its payment 
obligations as they mature or is only able to do so via dispropor-
tionately large funding costs.
the bank’s board of directors has adopted a liquidity risk policy 
which sets out the framework for the group’s liquidity manage-
ment, including operational targets for the group’s risk tolerance 
as well as requirements for the funding structure, liquidity buffer 
calculations and stress tests. moreover the liquidity risk policy 
sets out requirements for employee competences, contingency 
plans and reporting as well as determines the framework for 
asset encumbrance and allocation of the group’s liquidity costs.
 
targets and policies:
• consistently strong and stable deposit base which ensures sta-
bility in the long-term funding of the group’s lending activities.
• prudent funding of long-term loans and advances.
• maintenance of high ratings.
• active participation in international money markets as well as 
access to international capital markets through the application 
of loan programmes. coupled with a high rating this ensures 
that the group has uninterrupted access to a diversified and 
competitive funding basis.
• maintenance of a liquidity buffer which together with prudent 
management of the run-off profile of funding ensures that the 
group’s operating activities do not depend on capital market 
funding. in other words the liquidity buffer may counterbalance 
the effects of an adverse liquidity situation in the short and 
medium term.
the bank’s board of directors determines the group’s risk toler-
ance as regards liquidity risk. operational targets for the group’s
risk tolerance comprise:
• a minimum share of stable funding by way of deposits from 
non-financial counterparties and equity.
• a funding ratio (stable funding incl senior issues with maturities 
over 1 year relative to loans and advances).
• liquidity coverage ratio (lcr).
• a 3-month stress scenario (lcr3) calculated according to 
the excess liquidity coverage benchmark of the supervisory 
diamond.
• positive liquidity in 12 months in the group’s combined scenario.
• liquidity coverage ratio euro (lcr eur).
• requirements regarding funding of long-term loans and ad-
vances.
lcr, lcr3 and the group’s combined scenario are based on a 
regulatory cautiously determined liquidity buffer. the buffer must 
be sufficient to survive a 30-day stress scenario (lcr) accord-
ing to regulatory guidance, a stress scenario (lcr3) calculated 
according to the excess liquidity coverage benchmark, and an 
internal scenario (combined scenario) without market funding 
possibilities and with significant run-off of the funding of depos-
its. the lcr’s 30-day horizon specifies a run-off of the group’s 
exposures while taking into account counterparties, funding size, 
hedging and maturity. consequently the most stable deposits 
(small deposits covered by a guarantee scheme) are favoured rel-
ative to large deposits, in particular large deposits from business-
es and financial counterparties.

the maturity profiles of the group’s debt exposures appear
from note 40.
the board of directors’ requirements regarding the funding
structure are based on the following:
• the group’s funding must be diversified so as to minimise to the 
greatest extent possible reliance on individual sources.
• compliance with the lcr and the funding ratio target ensures 
a prudent funding profile and an adequate level of stable non-

• the lcr and the funding ratio ensure that the higher the level 
of stable deposits, the lower the necessary level of long-term 
senior funding. in contrast a falling level of stable deposits will 
increase the need for long-term senior funding. 
• short-term market funding and funding from financial 
counterparties must predominantly be used to fund short-
term placements and investments in securities which can 
be realised or which are eligible as collateral with danmarks 
nationalbank or the repo market.
the group’s risk policy states that:
• asset encumbrance may only occur as part of ordinary banking 
operations and includes securities provided as collateral with 
the central bank and in the repo market, collateral for clearing 
transactions as well as collateral under csa agreements
• asset encumbrance may be by way of deposits with credit 
institutions or securities
• moreover asset encumbrance may be by way of funding of 
mortgage-like loans via external counterparties.
the asset encumbrance appears from note 37.
on 18 september 2018 the group issued non-preferred senior
loans of eur 500m (dkk 3.7bn) with a maturity of 5 years and
on 4 february 2019 a further eur 500m (dkk 3.7bn) with a
maturity of 3 years was issued. on 25 november 2020 addition-
al issues were made: dkk 1,000m, nok 1,000m and sek 600m 
- all with a maturity of 4 years.
with these issues the group complies with the mrel require-
ment as determined by the danish fsa.

notes – risk management
operational risk
it security
operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems
or from external events, including legal risk.
the group collects data on all operational events and classifies
them in 4 main groups:
• operational events without loss
• operational events, it
• operational events, internal
• operational events, compensation.
management receives reporting on the basis of these data.
furthermore they form the basis for analyses and research for
the purpose of identifying systematics as well as improving on
an ongoing basis internal controls, business procedures and
routines to minimise the number of errors and the risk of loss.
moreover the system for collecting data on operational events
ensures compliance with the group’s business procedures for
approval, information, accounting and payment, if any.
the group reviews all business units annually with the aim of
identifying, describing and analysing the largest individual risks
where the group may incur significant losses as well as the 
relevant business procedures and routines for the purpose of 
minimising such risks.
a risk analysis of operational risks conducted in autumn 2020 
shows that the group has a number of scenarios in which the risk 
of loss exceeds dkk 5m. at the same time it must be expect-
ed that such scenarios – despite risk mitigation by way of for 
instance business procedures and control environment, require-
ments as regards access and authorisation as well as insurance 
cover – will occur within a foreseeable time horizon.
the group’s management has reviewed the extent of such loss
scenarios and related risks.
the group applies the standardised approach to calculate the
capital requirement in accordance with crr.
it supports a large part of the systems and tools used by the
bank’s customers and advisers. this function is strengthened
by the increased digitization in sydbank which customers experi-
ence by way of increased self-service and improved online services.
consequently it security is a significant aspect of the bank’s
operational risk.
the group regularly reviews this area – on a strategic level, on an
operational level and on a system level if the system is business- 
critical. as a result requirements have been specified as regards 
confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of the individual elements 
of it security. these requirements are adjusted on an ongoing 
basis to new statutory requirements and regulations. there is still 
considerable focus on the additional requirements resulting from 
the entry into force of the general data protection regulation in 
may 2018.
the board of directors specifies and formulates requirements as
regards it risk management in the it security policy and it 
contingency policy and these policies form the basis of the it 
security efforts. as part of the it security efforts a risk analysis is
prepared annually in which the objectives regarding the confi-
dentiality, accessibility and integrity of each system are assessed 
in terms of probability, maturity of preventive and corrective ad-
ministrative and technical measures as well as implications. as a 
result of this assessment a risk score is assigned to each system. 
the board of directors reviews, updates and approves the 2 
policies on the basis of the risk analysis.
in the policies the board of directors assesses the current risk
scenario and against this background specifies the requirements
for eg accessibility and reliability in terms of the different ele-
ments of it supply, including systems and data. as a result of
these requirements, a significant part of the group’s use of it has
been mirrored to minimise the risk of operational disruptions.
the it security policy as well as the it contingency policy apply to
all aspects of the bank’s use of it and consequently also where it 
or parts of it has been outsourced. as a result sydbank’s collabo-
ration with bankdata, including jn data, which is responsible for 
the day-to-day operations, is also comprised by this it security 
process.
contingency exercises are performed on a regular basis to
ensure that the bank is able to tackle any events that may arise.
in accordance with current anti-terrorism and anti-money laun-
dering rules the bank must ensure that it has proof of identity of 
its customers. moreover the bank performs routine testing
of transactions submitted through its systems. suspicious
transactions are reported.

notes – total capital
the bank is a licensed financial services provider and must there-
fore comply with the capital requirements determined by the eu.
the capital adequacy rules require a minimum capital level of
8.0% of the risk exposure amount plus any additional individual
capital needed. detailed rules regulate the calculation of capital 
as well as the risk exposure amount.
total capital is made up of t1 capital and t2 capital. t1 capital 
comprises equity and at1 capital.
the difference between shareholders’ equity and total capital is
shown in note 3.
the group’s subordinated capital, at1 capital and t2 capital may, 
subject to certain conditions, be included in total capital. the 
conditions are specified in crr. the group’s subordinated capital 
is shown in note 33.
the group has determined capital targets and considers a
cet1 ratio of 14.5% as well as a capital ratio of 18.5% as being 
satisfactory for the years ahead.
the international rating agency moody’s regularly assesses the
group’s ability to honour its payment obligations. the rating tar-
gets are an essential part of the group’s capital targets because
good ratings give the group access to the capital markets.
in 2020 the group met regulatory capital requirements as well
as internal capital targets.

auditors’ reports
to the shareholders of sydbank a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements of sydbank a/s for the 
financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020, which comprise 
an income statement, statement of comprehensive income, bal­
ance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies, for the group and 
the company, as well as a cash flow statement for the group. 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure require­
ments for listed financial institutions and the parent company 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
danish financial business act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the group’s and the company’s assets, liabilities and financial 
position at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the group’s 
and the company’s operations and the group’s cash flows for 
the financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020 in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for listed 
financial institutions in respect of the consolidated financial 
statements and in accordance with the danish financial busi­
ness act in respect of the parent company financial statements.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with the danish financial 
supervisory authority’s executive order on auditing financial 
undertakings etc. as well as financial groups and in accordance 
with international standards on auditing (isas) and the addi­
tional requirements applicable in denmark.
we planned and performed our audit to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes a reasonable assurance conclusion about 
whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. we have partici­
pated in the audit of all material and risky areas.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi­
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
statement on the management’s review
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements does not cover the 
management’s review, and we do not express any assurance 
conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial state­
ments and the parent company financial statements we have 
read the management’s review and, when doing so, considered 
whether the management’s review is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or the parent compa­
ny financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
based on the work we have performed, we concluded that the 
management’s review is in accordance with the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company financial state­
ments and has been prepared in accordance with the require­
ments in the danish financial business act. we did not identify 
any material misstatements of the management’s review.

accounting policies, for the group and the parent company, and 
a consolidated cash flow statement. the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared in accordance with international finan­
cial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional

flows for the financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional requirements of listed 
financial companies.
further, in our opinion the parent company financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent 
company at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the 
parent company’s operations for the financial year 1 january 
– 31 december 2020 in accordance with the danish financial 
business act.
our opinion is consistent with our long­form audit report to the 
audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international stand­
ards on auditing (isas) and additional requirements applicable 
in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and 
requirements are further described in the “auditor’s responsibil­
ities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements” (hereinafter collec­
tively referred to as “the financial statements”) section of our 
report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi­
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the 
international ethics standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and 
requirements.
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any prohib­
ited non­audit services as described in article 5(1) of regulation 
(eu) no. 537/2014.
appointment of auditor
we were initially appointed as auditor of sydbank a/s on 10 may 
1990 for the financial year 1990. we have been reappointed 
annually by resolution of the general meeting for a total consec­
utive period of 31 years up until and including the financial year 
2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements for the financial year 2020. these matters 
were addressed during our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. for each of the below 
matters, the description of how the matter was addressed in 
our audit is given in that context. 
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the “auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section, 
including in relation to the key audit matters below. our audit 
included the design and performance of procedures to respond 
to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements. the results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the matters 
below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole.
measurement of loans and guarantees
risk: a substantial amount of the company’s assets consist of 
loans to customers (36% of the consolidated assets) which are 
subject to impairment risks due to the customer’s lack of ability 
to pay. in addition, the company offers guarantees and other 
financial products that also imply risk of losses. 
independent auditors’ report
138
s y d b a n k  /  2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t
auditors’ reports
the bank’s measurement of impairment charges on loans and 
guarantees implies significant amounts and a high level of 
judgement applied by management. this concerns especially 
staging assessment and the assessment of indications of credit 
impairment, probability of default, collateral valuation and the 
customer’s ability to pay in case of default. 
large loans are evaluated individually while impairment of 
smaller loans and loans with low risk is based on models, where 
methods and assumptions used for estimation of expected 
credit loss are based on judgements made by management.
the bank recognises additional impairment provisions, based 
on management judgement, in situations where the model 
based and individually determined impairment provision not 
yet reflects that currently expected credit losses, e.g. the effect 
of covid­19. these management estimates are described in 
note 2.
audit approach: our audit comprised processes for monitoring 
of credit exposures, staging assessment and recording of indica­
tions of credit impairment. through analyses and sample tests 
and by review of the company’s procedures we have verified 
that the estimation of expected credit losses are recognized in 
accordance with the accounting policies.
the audit comprised the largest and most risky loans as well 
as any foreclosed exposures. for model based impairments we 
have evaluated the assumptions and methodology applied, as 
well as the judgements applied by management in addition to 
the individual and model based impairments, including in par­
ticular the additions to impairments made to cover the effects 
of covid­19. 
our audit of management’s estimates, which are made in 
addition to the model based and individual impairments, in­
cluded  an assessment of the bank’s basis for the methods and 
assumptions.
also we have reviewed and tested that the disclosures on loans, 
impairment charges and credit risk meet the relevant account­
ing rules (note 2, 14 and 18).
business combination
risk: on 30 november 2020 the bank acquired 100% of the 
share capital of alm. brand bank a/s, including the subsidiaries 
alm. brand leasing a/s and ejendomsselskabet ab aps. the 
acquired activities are included in the consolidated financial 
independent auditors’ report
statements of sydbank from the acquisition date based on the 
estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities.
the accounting treatment of the acquisition is a key audit  
matter as management exercises significant estimates in  
connection with:
• determination of the fair value of the acquired assets and  
liabilities, including particularly the acquired customer  
relationships, loans and other credit exposures.
• accounting treatment of acquired loans and other credit  
exposures, including staging and subsequent measurement.
• presentation of the acquisition in the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the relevant accounting rules.
reference is made to note 2, 18 and 47.
audit: we have audited the purchase accounts prepared by the 
bank as at 30 november 2020, including the measurement of 
fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. in this context we 
have assessed if the principles and methods applied are justified 
and in accordance the accounting rules. for acquired loans and 
other credit exposures we have reviewed the staging, fair value 
and subsequent measurement at 31 december 2020. further, 
we have verified that the presentation of the acquisition in the 
consolidated financial statements is in accordance with the ifrs 
requirements.
statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the management’s review. 
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
management’s review, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the management’s review and, in doing 
so, consider whether the management’s review is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the man­
agement’s review provides the information required under the 
danish financial business act. 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the 
management’s review is in accordance with the financial state­
ments and has been prepared in accordance with the require­
 2 0 2 0  a n n u a l  r e p o r t  /  s y d b a n k
139
independent auditors’ report
ments of the danish financial business act. we did not identify 
any material misstatement of the management’s review.
independent auditors’ report
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and additional requirements of listed financial companies 
and for the preparation of parent company financial statements 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with the danish 
financial business act. 
moreover, management is responsible for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to enable the prepara­
tion of financial statements that are free from material misstate­
ment, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the financial statements, management is respon­
sible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless 
management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent 
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to wheth­
er the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect a material misstate­
ment when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also:
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
inancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of 
internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent 
company’s internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of  
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the finan­
cial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our au­
ditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause 
the group and the parent company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of 
the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair 
view.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the fi­
nancial information of the entities or business activities within 
the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain solely respon­
sible for our audit opinion.

independent auditors’ report
from the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements of the current pe­
riod and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation pre­
cludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequenc­
es of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
