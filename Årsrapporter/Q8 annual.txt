letter from the ceo
i’ve been looking back over a year that was unlike any other. the pandemic has placed great demands on 
everyone in society – companies, employees and individuals alike. businesses have had to adapt quickly to a 
new normal, and okq8 scandinavia was no exception. as a vital societal function, we’ve worked hard to ensure 
access to fuel and allow members, customers, suppliers and employees to feel safe when visiting our service 
stations, stores and depots.
and in addition to adapting to new circumstances, we also held on to our convictions and stood by our sustai-
nability strategy – a strategy that makes sure okq8 scandinavia will continue to be the reliable, innovative and 
entrepreneurial company founded back in 1926. resources all around the world are focused on minimising 
climate impact, leading to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. we aim to lead the transition with 
sustainable alternatives and by investing wisely to meet new needs.
two major driving forces are leading the way ahead: sustainability and digitalisation. these forces are shaping 
the whole of society and developments are advancing rapidly, which while pleasing, also presents challenges. 
we have set clear goals for our business: okq8 must be climate neutral in its own operations by 2030, and 
throughout the value chain by 2045. this places great demands on the entire operation. resolution, innovation, 
investment and a clear focus are essential if we are to achieve our intended, indeed crucial, goals. you can read 
more in this report about how far we’ve come and the initiatives we envision ahead of us. 
i’m particularly proud of the partnerships with neste and swedish energy supplier skellefteå kraft we presented 
during the year. they make important contributions to climate neutrality. together with the world’s biggest 
producer of biofuels, we’ve so far enabled members and customers to fill up with fossil-free diesel at 170 
service stations around sweden. our collaboration with skellefteå kraft will result in sweden and denmark’s 
biggest, fastest charging network, with high availability and outputs of 150 kw. 
digitising the right parts of the business will benefit society and make it easier for members and customers to get their 
errands done, be it filling up fuel, banking or buying a cup of coffee. during the year, the company launched 
the okq8 app and contactless payments, and it carried out extensive work on the it infrastructure. despite the 
challenges, these demanding projects were successful, thanks to hard work and good project management.
helping members and customers convert to fossil independence is our highest priority. each of us will have to 
do it in our own way, and okq8 wants to be the operator that helps make it possible. we’re proud of our long 
history, but our focus is on the future and getting to grips with the task in hand, which although complex is 
feasible. we aim to do everything we can to be a sustainable facilitator for people on the move, while going as 
easy on the environment as possible.
the transition is already here and the goal is clear: together with members and customers, we will make the 
necessary changes to continue living in a well-functioning society. we will continue the transition to achieve a 
sustainable business and a strong okq8 scandinavia.
i wish you a rewarding, inspiring read!

important events during the year
financial perspective
the group result before financial net was 550 msek (528 msek). the parent company result before financial 
net was 271 msek (489 msek).
okq8's operations and employees are affected, just like the entire society, by the covid-19 pandemic and the 
change in behaviors, demand and production disruptions that it has caused to most of our customers and 
suppliers. the first months of the financial year were also marked by a sharp fall in prices in the market, which had a 
negative effect on earnings after changes in inventories, especially in the swedish operations. the volumes 
were clearly affected downwards during the spring and winter of 2020 as a consequence of the entire society's 
reactions to the pandemic through reduced travel. to create a basis for sustainable operations, as well as flexi-
bility going forward during this period of uncertainty, an action program that includes efficiency and savings 
has been implemented and investments have been re-prioritized. together, these measures have offset the 
effects that the decline in volumes generated on sales and earnings by reduced costs, both in the short term 
and structurally. in the danish market, price competition has been less volatile during the year compared with 
history, which has had a positive effect on earnings. cash flow has been strengthened due to reduced expenses 
and reprioritization of investments.
the us dollar has weakened against the swedish krona over the year having an exchange rate in february 
2021 which is approximately 15% lower than at the beginning of the financial year. platt’s price index and 
dollar exchange rate affect both purchase prices and sales prices of fuel. this means that in order to ensure 
financial stability for the company, okq8 works actively with optimization of inventory and pricing and adapts 
it to changes. this year, the initial negative consequences of purchases made to stock with prices before the 
fall in platt's price index and sales of these volumes at extremely low margins after the price fall could be offset 
by the fact that gross margins have subsequently stabilized as new purchases have been made.
how we have acted so far during the covid-19 pandemic
on march 10th 2020, okq8 went into high alert mode due to the spread of covid-19. a crisis group was set 
up, which met daily from 11 march until 30 march and thereafter weekly and as needed. remote working 
was mandated in denmark from 12 march and in sweden from 17 march. at the end of march, the swedish 
government introduced the possibility of short-term layoffs and this was introduced to varying degrees at both 
stations and offices.
a large number of measures were taken to ensure health and safety for employees, customers and suppliers at 
stations and depots. this included amongst others distance markings in our stations, plexiglass protection at the 
checkouts, alcohol hand sanitiser and disposable gloves available, as well as increased cleaning and disinfection.
volumes regarding neste my renewable diesel (hvo100) are included in diesel / light diesel in terms of sales of 
the product but also to the extent that hvo is blended into traditional diesel. for other supplementary information 
for the perspective of change over time regarding increased blending of biofuels into fossil fuels and its reduced c02 
footprint kindly refer to the sustainability report.

as part of facilitating commuting for healthcare professionals, okq8 supported the we fight covid initiative 
and made rental cars available free of charge. the church of sweden was also supported in the same way, in 
their work to deliver food and necessities to people at risk.
large joint meetings, which were previously held in physical form, were arranged digitally due to the pandemic. 
these include weekly meetings with all office employees in denmark and sweden, the retail operations' major 
supplier meetings, the annual sustainability seminar for customers and other stakeholders and okq8's large 
annual conference where employees from both sweden and denmark previously met physically.  
initiatives to achieve climate neutrality
okq8 has clear targets to become climate neutral in its own operations by 2030, and to be so in the entire 
value chain by 2045. this means that we will help members, customers and suppliers to reduce their carbon 
footprint to zero based on individual conditions. all our initiatives are implemented in order to take us further 
steps along the road to fossil freedom and are gathered under three focus areas: fight climate change and 
reduce co2 emissions, consuming and selling sustainable products and being an enabler for sustainable people 
and communities.
fight climate change and reduce co2 emissions
science based targets initiative 
as the first fuel company, okq8 joined the science based targets initiative to further strengthen sustainability 
work and clarify the journey towards climate neutrality. the science based targets initiative is a global standard 
for companies to set goals in line with what science says needs to be done to achieve the paris agreement to 
keep global warming below two degrees and in line with 1.5 degrees.  
okq8 at the top when young people list the most sustainable brands of the future
the most sustainable brands of the future 2020 provide a unique insight into how young people value different 
sustainability perspectives, what sustainability responsibility they attribute to different industries and a valuation of 
which brands they consider to be most sustainable. the purpose is to provide a clearer picture of which sustaina- 
bility issues are extra important for young people, but also how communication becomes an essential tool for 
creating brands that not only work in a sustainable way, but are also perceived to do so. 1,500 young adults 
(18-35 years) evaluated 273 companies in 20 different industries. okq8 was ranked highest in the fuel industry.
consuming and sell sustainable products
electrification and charging
okq8's electric car charging offer for private and corporate customers at home, at the station and at work has 
been successfully established and has been well received by the market. during the year, okq8's charging card 
for companies was launched. a card that makes it easy for customers to manage charging wherever they are; 
at home, at work or along the roads. the unique thing about the card is that it can be used to pay for both 
charging and liquid fuel and get everything collected on one and the same invoice.
establishment of charging infrastructure
in december, a collaboration between okq8 and skellefteå kraft was presented to establish sweden's and 
denmark's largest high power charging network. until 2026, 1,100 charging points at approximately 400 
stations along the roads in sweden and denmark will be installed, starting in 2021. the output on the chargers 
will be from 150 kw, which is significantly higher than the current most common high power charge of 50 kw. 
the collaboration is a key step in the work towards fossil-free mobility.
solar energy
in 2019, kraftpojkarna, sweden's leading distributor in solar energy, charging infrastructure and energy storage, was 
acquired. during the past year, the business model has been supplemented with many digital tools that facilitates the 
customers' everyday life and interaction with kraftpojkarna. several new dealers were added during the year, 
including Öresundskraft, which is a major player in sweden and this co-operation has already generated new 
business. the competence and know-how within kraftpojkarna are important parts of the journey towards our 
targets in sustainability and that together we create a unique circular solution for charging and electrification.
ok-q8 ab  i  annual report 20/21

clean energy
an important part of okq8's offering is within the framework of energy and charging. during the year, the 
clean energy business area was established. this is aimed to help customers in the real estate sector to convert  
their energy supply through solutions and services in solar energy, energy storage and optimization, and charging 
infrastructure.
liquid fuel – neste my
a partnership was initiated with neste, the world's largest producer of the fossil-free diesel hvo100. the colla-
boration means that okq8 sells neste's product neste my renewable diesel (hvo100) at the service stations. 
through the collaboration, additional opportunities are created for members and customers to refuel fossil-free 
and the steadily increasing demand can be met. at the end of the financial year, the number of stations with 
neste my renewable diesel (hvo100) amounted to 170 stations, which is the widest network in sweden.
in denmark, q8 hvo100 biodiesel was introduced during the year to corporate customers and to customers with 
a domestic tank. customers such as postnord and db schenker signed agreements that help them take further steps 
towards climate neutrality. in addition, the fuel is available to private individuals at the unmanned f24 facilities.
liquid fuel – lng
in december, a decision was made on the construction of denmark's first fueling stations with liquefied natural 
gas (lng) for trucks in padborg and hirtshals. padborg is one of europe's busiest transport centers with over 
7,000 passing trucks per day, which makes it a hub for transporting goods between scandinavia and the rest 
of europe. in the long run, 100% fossil-free liquid biogas will replace natural gas. the facility is expected to be 
completed by the end of 2021.
launch of car insurance
okq8 continued to strengthen its offering in the insurance area and launched okq8 bilförsäkring during the 
year. it is a complete insurance that can be signed as motor insurance, half or full insurance. complemented 
with okq8's supplementary insurance backup plus, the two products provide the market's most comprehensive 
car- and reduction of deductible insurance under the same brand. something that has been requested by 
many of the ok associations' over one and a half million members.
200 stations with starbucks good coffee
in 2019, work began on installing starbucks machines under the concept "starbucks on the go" at stations 
in sweden. the co-operation already existed in denmark. on december 4, the milestone of 200 stations was 
passed when okq8 on blå vägen in storuman was able to offer members and customers 131 types of drink of 
the highest quality. this makes okq8 one of sweden's largest café chains today, among many other things.
only the best is good enough. our coffee 
from starbucks is not only a pure plea- 
sure to drink, it also benefits the environ-
ment and people because it is 100% 
sustainably grown. and there are many 
good cups of coffee. we have had the 
pleasure of serving as many as six million 
cups of coffee in 2020.

enabler for sustainable people and societies
subscription for easy washing and reduced number of domestic washes
the acquisitions of the car wash facilities iwash in eskilstuna and norrköping during the previous financial year created 
conditions for the car wash of the future. starting in october, there are now, among other things, car-wash subscriptions at a 
number of stations in sweden. by offering members and customers an affordable and simple solution with the possibility 
to wash the car at a fixed monthly cost, the environmentally harmful domestic washes are assumed to be reduced.
green electricity at purchase price
during the year, okq8's electricity offering was supplemented with a “purchase price hour” which gives the customer a unique 
spot price per kilowatt hour based on when the electricity consumption has taken place. by consuming electricity in hours 
when the electricity price is low, the electricity price paid can be managed to be lower than a normal variable electricity price. 
the customer pays a fixed price every month in addition to kilowatts consumed.
new app for smarter electricity use and increased knowledge
with the new app "okq8 hemma" the customer can easily reduce both his/her environmental impact and costs. smart 
algorithms keep track of when the electricity price and environmental impact are at their lowest and the user can control 
his/her energy use at these times. coupled with smart home products, use becomes both simple and cost-effective.
low-flushing faucet
starting in july, low-flushing faucets were installed at the majority of stations in sweden. these work through a nozzle 
that ensures a higher water pressure and at the same time more finely divided water drops. the new water jet collector 
is a swedish invention that saves up to 60,000 liters / outlet, depending on the degree of utilization. when washing 
ones hands under this type of faucet, the hands become clean in a shorter time thanks to the higher pressure and the 
atomization of the drops. good for the climate, good for the economy.
car-wash facilities
reduced water and energy use in car washes is a priority area and special focus is aimed upon reducing the proportion of 
fresh-water usage when washing. thanks to biological treatment plants, our iwash facilities in norrköping and eskilstuna 
as well as our newly built okq8 facilities use only 30 liters of fresh water per wash, where the remaining 220 liters used 
are recycled and purified water. only nordic ecolabelled (“svanen”) chemicals, adapted to the nordic climate, are used. 
at our iwash facilities, the excess heat in the machine room is blown into the car-wash tunnel to recycle this as well. 
collection of grocery bags at okq8
during the year, a pilot project was carried out together with coop stores & supermarkets, which exhibited external 
"pick-up cabinets" at okq8 at glädjens trafikplats in upplands väsby, north of stockholm. at a time when more and 
more people choose to shop online, this enables smoother handling at and increased customer flow to the service 
station. a similar project was carried out during the year together with matkomfort, where pre-filled dinner bags can be 
picked up at the service-stations in nacka, brommaplan and haninge in stockholm. 
closure of loudden
according to a previous decision by the city of stockholm, okq8's depot operations and lubricant factory petrolia at 
loudden in stockholm have been closed down since 2019/2020. during the year, dismantling and decontamination 
work began. work essentially follows both schedule and budget. supply of products previously produced in the subsidiary 
petrolia now takes place from kuwait petroleum in antwerp, belgium.

future development
together with members and customers, we can make a big difference in the transition to sustainable motoring, 
infrastructure and mobility. it is therefore gratifying to see an ever faster pace of change in the industry we operate 
in, but also that okq8 can take a leading position in the industry. at the end of 2020, we were pleased to announce 
that we have entered into a cooperation agreement with skellefteå kraft to establish high power chargers for electric 
vehicles at 400 stations in sweden and denmark, with 100% electricity from renewable sources. it is another 
important step towards our goal to be our customers' and members' preferred enabler for sustainable motion.
we see a strong demand for our company cards, which provide access to over 1,000 charging stations in sweden and 
10,000 charging stations around europe. more companies also want their own solutions for sustainable charging of 
cars. through the establishment of the clean energy business area, we now offer complete energy solutions 
to our corporate customers - with everything from solar panels on the roof to charging points in the car park. the 
product and service offerings in this area will be steadily broadened and developed. also, within the framework 
of our own operations, solar panels are installed on the roofs on service-stations to produce our own electricity. 
during the year, 20 roofs were fitted with panels, which will be expanded at a steady pace in the coming years. 
by 2020/2021, the number of stations where biofuel is available has also been greatly increased. at the end 
of the financial year, the biodiesel neste my renewable diesel (hv0100) was available at 170 stations and 
the expansion continues. this means that okq8 has the largest number of stations with, and the widest range 
of, biofuels in the form of hvo100, biogas and ethanol. in the coming years, we will continue to develop the 
supply and availability of non-fossil fuels. 
another important driving force - and enabler - for change is digitization. in 2020, digital car wash subscriptions were 
launched, which will be available at more stations in the coming years. in the stockholm area, customers can also 
book a car wash online and have the service performed at home or work, with a technology that cleans the car with 
steam and washcloths, which consumes less than five liters of water per wash. digitization makes it easier for 
the customer at the same time as an even more efficient operation with less environmental impact, through, 
among other things, lower consumption of water, energy and chemicals.
okq8's future development depends on us succeeding in developing the business in terms of both sustainability 
and digitization. we therefore intend to continue to invest significant resources in these areas and at the same 
time develop the offer to meet the needs of members and customers − as we have always done.

research and development
ok-q8 ab does not conduct its own research and development, but rather assimilates the results of research 
within the kuwait petroleum international ownership group.
risks and uncertainties
ok-q8 ab’s earnings and financial standing are primarily affected by the listed prices for refined petroleum 
products and the development of the currency exchange rates for the dollar. the price trends on petroleum 
products have a large effect on the value of inventories.
ok-q8 ab and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risks. credit risks pertain to the risk that a debtor cannot 
fulfil his obligations to the company. in order to minimise the credit risk, a continuous monitoring of outstanding 
receivables and large individual customer exposures is done. age analyses are regularly performed on the 
customer stocks. the group has processes for the granting of credit, and effective demand and collection 
processes for outstanding transactions. the credit rating model applied is well-proven.
interest risks also affect the ok-q8 group’s business operation. interest risk is the risk of losses in the event 
of sudden fluctuations in interest rate levels. the ok-q8 group has variable interest rates that apply to both 
saving and lending in order to protect itself from this risk.
ok-q8 ab transfers a large portion of its accounts receivable to ok-q8 bank ab. in the factoring contract 
drawn up with the companies, there is a guarantee condition concerning the buy-back of accounts receivable 
in the event of any credit losses.
currency exposure
the ok-q8 group’s purchase of petroleum products is done largely in usd, but sales to end customers are 
made in sek or dkk. this gives rise to a transaction exposure that can affect business operations within the 
group. in order to mitigate the effects of the exposure, the group hedges part of the usd risk by buying cor-
responding forward foreign-exchange contracts. the group’s target is to pay the same exchange rate on its 
purchases of fuel that then forms the basis of the pricing toward the end customer.
sale prices to customers include an exchange-rate factor. in practice, ok-q8 ab hedges margins on sold pet-
roleum products through the purchase of currency instruments where the volume in the currency instruments 
corresponds to the forecasted sales volume per day.
sustainability
ok-q8 ab has prepared a sustainability report for the financial year 2019/2020 that applies to the company 
and its subsidiaries. the sustainability report is prepared in a separate document according to the swedish 
annual accounts act, chapter 6, section 11. 
 this is found at https://www.okq8.se/sustainability
effects on the environment
the ok-q8 group conducts a number of operations that are required to obtain permits and to submit appli-
cations according to the environmental code, and which for their operation are dependent on those facilities 
subject to the permit and application requirements. the facilities’ impact on the environment primarily occurs 
through emissions to the air and water. 
the eight depots where ok-q8 ab conducts operations have permits according to chapter 9 section 6 of the 
environmental code and the transitional provisions set out in sfs 1998:899 for the handling of petroleum 
products. moreover, the company also has a permit for a rock chamber facility intended for stockpiles. 
in accordance with chapter 9, section 6 of the environmental code and section 21 of the ordinance concer-
ning environmentally hazardous activities and the protection of public health (1998:899), all sales locations 
with a sales volume of at least 1,000 m3 or motor fuel per year and/or with the capacity to perform at least

proposed appropriation of the company's profits in sek
recommended appropriation of profits
the board's reasoned statement regarding the recommended dividend 
the recommended dividend to the shareholders reduces the company’s solidity ratio to 40,2 percent, and the 
group’s solidity ratio to 46,9 percent. the equity/assets ratio is seen against the background of the company's 
and the group's operation continuing to be run with satisfactory profitability. the liquidity in the company 
and the group is assessed as being able to be maintained at a similarly satisfactory level.
it is the opinion of the board that the recommended dividend does not prevent the company, and other com-
panies within the group, from fulfilling their obligations in either the short or long term, nor will it prevent the 
company from undertaking the necessary investments. the recommended dividend can thereby be justified with 
respect to that which is set out in chapter 17, section 3, paragraphs 2-3 of the swedish companies act (prudence 
rule). it is recommended that the board shall be authorised to establish a payment date for the dividends.
position and performance
profits from the parent company’s and group’s operations, as well as the financial position at the end of the

5,000 car washes per year must submit applications to the appropriate authorities. manned service stations 
are operated by the affiliated company, ok detaljhandel ab.
the occurrence of ground contamination has been generally mapped out in previous years at the company’s 
petrol stations and at all operating depots (eight in number). one of the depots is subleased to another 
business operator. contamination has been indicated at most of these depots. the contamination has a 
historical background, as oil products have been handled at these depots for many years at a previous level 
of safety that did not meet the current standards. contamination has also been indicated at some of the 
company’s petrol stations. okq8 group engages an external company each year to conduct soil surveys 
where ground contamination has been discovered or is suspected. based on the report that the external 
company submits, okq8 group makes a provision for future decontamination costs in the accounts. the 
costs for ground contamination discovered and resolved during the year (in addition to the yearly major 
examination) are recognised as they arise.

note 1. accounting principles and valuation principles
general information
ok-q8 abs annual report and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
annual accounts act and the swedish accounting standards board’s general guidelines bfnar 2012:1 annual 
reports and consolidated financial statements (k3). 
the accounting principles are unchanged in comparison with the previous year.
consolidated financial statements
ok-q8 ab prepares consolidated financial statements. companies where ok-q8 ab holds the majority of the votes 
at the general meeting, and companies where ok-q8 ab by agreement has a controlling influence are classified 
as subsidiaries and are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. information on group companies 
can be found in the note on financial assets. the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
as of the day when controlling influence is transferred to the group. they are excluded from the consolidated 
financial statements as of the date on which controlling influence ceases. controlling influence entails a right to 
formulate a company’s financial and operative strategies with the purpose of obtaining economic benefits.
the consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company and all subsidiaries and were prepared 
according to acquisition accounting. the acquisition date is the date on which controlling influence is obtained. 
identifiable assets and liabilities are initially valued at their fair values at the time of acquisition. the minority’s 
share of the acquired net assets is valued at fair value. goodwill consists of the difference between the acquired 
identifiable net assets at the acquisition date and cost including the value of the minority interest and is initially 
valued at cost.
dealings between group companies are eliminated in their entirety.
subsidiaries in other countries prepare their annual reports in foreign currencies. the translation of the items 
in these companies’ income statements and balance sheets is made at the closing day rate and the average 
rate, respectively. the translation differences that arise are recognised in the group’s equity.
foreign currency
receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies are valued at the closing day rate, whereby occurring exchange gains 
and losses are recognised in profit or loss. exchange rate differences of an operational nature are recognised 
gross under other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively. in those cases that currency 
hedging is carried out, e.g. forward cover contracts, the forward rate is used.
lines of business and geographic markets
the group has business operations in sweden and denmark as well as finland through kraftpojkarna.
revenues
the sale of goods is recognized upon the delivery of the product to the customer, in accordance with the terms 
of sales. sales of services involve the fair value of what has been obtained or will be obtained. sales are posted 
net after vat, discounts and exchange-rate differences upon sales in foreign currency. in the consolidated 
financial statements, sales within the group are eliminated.

other income earned is recognized as revenue according to the following:

income taxes
current taxes are calculated upon tax percentages and tax regulations that are valid on the balance sheet 
date. deferred taxes are calculated upon tax percentages and tax regulations that are confirmed by the 
balance sheet date.
deferred tax liabilities pertaining to temporary differences attributable to investments in subsidiaries are not 
presented in the consolidated statements, as the parent company in all cases can govern the moment for reversal 
of the temporary differences, and it is not deemed likely that a reversal will be made in the foreseeable future.
deferred tax assets regarding tax loss carry forwards or other future tax deductions are recognised to the extent 
that it is deemed likely that the deduction can be made against a surplus in future taxation.
current taxes are assessed based on the tax rates and tax regulations that apply on the closing date. deferred 
taxes are valued based on the tax rates and tax regulations determined prior to the closing date. 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised net only where there is a legal right to offset. current tax, 
like changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement unless the tax is attributable to an event 
or transaction that is recognised directly in equity. the tax effect of items that are recognised directly against 
equity is recognised against equity.
intangible assets
expenditures for the software development
expenditures, which are directly connected with identifiable and unique software that is controlled by the group 
and which has probable economic benefits which after a year exceed costs, are capitalised as intangible assets. 
direct expenses include personnel costs for program-development personnel and a reasonable share of relevant 
indirect costs. 
expenditures that increase performance or extend the lifespan of software in addition to its original level are 
recognised as improvement expenditures and increase the original cost. capitalised expenditures for software 
development are amortised straight-line over their useful economic life, however for a maximum of seven years.
goodwill
group goodwill is amortised straight-line over the estimated economic useful life. group goodwill is amortised 
over five or ten years. 
expenditures for own developed intangible assets
the company accounts for own developed intangible assets according to the activation method. this means 
that all expenditures that relates to the development of an internally created intangible asset is activated and 
depreciated throughout the entire useful life of the asset. this is if the prerequisites in bfnar 2012:1 are met.

tangible assets
tangible assets are recognised at cost less depreciation. cost includes expenditures directly attributable to 
the acquisition of the asset.  when a component in a non-current asset is replaced, any remaining part of the 
old component is disposed of and the cost of the new component are capitalised. incremental expenditures 
pertaining to assets that are not divided up into components are added to the cost if they are expected to give 
the company future economic advantages, to the extent that the asset’s performance increases in relation to 
the value of the asset at the time of acquisition. expenditures for ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed.
expenditures for building investments on other’s property
expenditures that pertain to building investments on other’s property in the group company q8 danmark a/s 
are capitalised as tangible assets in the group. capitalised expenditures on other’s property are depreciated 
straight-line over their useful economic life. investments on other’s property are depreciated over five years.
capital gains and capital losses upon disposal of a non-current asset are recognised as other operating inco-
me and other operating expenses, respectively.
tangible assets are depreciated systematically over the estimated economic useful life of the asset. when the 
assets’ depreciable amount is established, the assets’ residual value is taken into account, where appropriate. 
the company’s land has an indefinite economic useful life and is not depreciated. straight-line depreciation 
is used for other types of tangible assets. 
the following depreciation periods apply:
 »
industrial buildings used in the operation
 »
land improvements 
 »
construction equipment .
 »
cisterns 
 »
meters 
 »
machinery 
 »
equipment 
 
 
 
impairments of non-financial assets
when there is an indication that an asset’s value has decreased, a test is done for an impairment requirement. 
if the asset has a recoverable amount that is less than the book value, it is impaired down to the recoverable 
amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less selling expenses. in the 
calculation of the value in use, the present value is calculated of future cash flows that the asset is expected to 
yield in operating activities, as well as when it is disposed of or discarded. the discount rate used is before tax 
and it reflects the market assessments of the time value of money and the risk pertaining to the asset.  when 
assessing the impairment requirement, assets are grouped at the lowest levels where there are separate 
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). for assets, other than goodwill, that have previously been 
impaired, a test is conducted each balance sheet day as to whether a reversal should be done.

leases
leases, which mean that the economic risks and benefits of owning an asset are essentially transferred from 
the lessor to a company in the ok-q8 ab group, are classified as finance leases. finance leases mean that the 
rights and obligations are recognised as assets and liabilities, respectively, in the balance sheet. the asset and 
liability are valued at the lower value between the asset’s fair value and the present value of the minimum le-
asing fees. fees that can be directly attributed to the lease are added to the asset’s value. the leasing fees are 
divided between interest and amortisation according to the effective interest method. variable fees are ex-
pensed in the period in which they arise. the leased asset is depreciated straight-line over the leasing period.
leases in which the economic benefits and risks attributable to the leasing object essentially remain with the 
lessor are classified as operating leases. payments, including initial elevated rent, according to these leases are 
expensed straight-line over the leasing period. the accounting principles are unchanged in comparison with 
the previous year.
financial instruments
financial instruments are posted in accordance with the regulations set out in chapter 11 of k3, which means 
that valuation is based on cost. financial instruments that are recognised in the balance sheet include securities, 
accounts receivable and other receivables, short-term investments, accounts payable, and liabilities to credit institu-
tions and associated companies. the instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when the group becomes 
party to the instrument’s contractual terms.
financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the right to obtain cash flow from the instrument 
has expired or has been transferred and the group has largely transferred all the risks and benefits associated 
with ownership. financial liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligations set out in the 
contract are fulfilled or are in some other way absolved.
accounts receivable and other receivables
receivables are recognised as current assets with the exception of items that mature more than 12 months 
after the closing date, which are classified as non-current assets. receivables are taken up in the amounts 
that are expected to be collected after deductions for individually estimated bad debts. receivables that are 
interest-free or which are carried with interest at rates that deviate from the market rate and have a term 
exceeding 12 months are recognised at a discounted present value and the time-value change is posted as 
interest income in the income statement.
other securities held as non-current assets
this item consists primarily of a minor holding of interest-bearing assets in bonds and certificates. assets 
included in this item are initially recognised at cost. the interest-bearing assets are recognised in subsequent 
reports at amortised cost with the application of the effective-interest method, less any provision for impairment. 
borrowings and accounts payable
borrowings and accounts payable are initially recognised at cost less transaction expenses. if the carrying 
amount differs from the amount that is to be repaid on the maturity date, the difference is allocated as an 
interest expense over the duration of the loan using the effective interest rate of the instrument. thus, as of 
the maturity date, the carrying amount corresponds with the amount to be repaid.
derivative instruments
ok-q8 ab utilises derivative instruments in order to manage currency risks and raw material risks that arise 
upon the purchasing to the business in foreign currency. these contracts protect the group against fluctuations in 
exchange rates because the fixed terms in the agreement determines the exchange rate at which an asset or 
liability denominated in foreign currency shall be realised.
offset of financial assets and financial liabilities
a financial asset and a financial liability are offset and recognised in a net amount in the balance sheet only 
where there is a legal right of offset and when the settlement with a net amount is intended to be made or 
when a simultaneous disposal of the asset and a settlement of the liability are intended to be made.

impairment tests of financial assets
at each balance sheet date, the group assesses whether there is any indication of an impairment requirement  
in any of the financial assets. impairment is done if it is determined that there is a lasting decrease in value. 
impairment is posted as an income statement item profit from other securities and receivables that are 
non-current assets. the impairment requirement is test individually for shares and participations and other 
individual financial assets that are significant. 
inventories
inventories are valued according a moving average price methodology. for raw materials, all expenditures that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition of the goods are included in the cost. for goods in progress and finished 
goods, cost includes design costs, raw materials, direct wages, other direct expenses and attributable indirect 
expenses, as well as borrowing costs. 
provisions
provisions regarding environmental restoration activities are recognized when the group has a legal or informal 
obligation as a consequence of past events and it is more likely that an outflow of resources will be needed to 
settle the commitment than not, and the amount could be calculated in a reliable manner. business operations 
with fuel has been conducted for many years at all depots and service-stations. therefore it is expected that 
ground contamination exists.
employee benefits
short-term employee benefits
short-term employee benefits in the group consists of salaries, social security contributions, paid holidays, paid 
sick leave, health care and bonuses. short-term employee benefits are calculated without discounting and are 
expensed when the related services are received.
remuneration after the end of employment: 
in defined-contribution plans, the group-companies pays fixed fees to another company and has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay any further sums, even if the other company cannot fulfil its obligations. expenses 
are charged to the group’s profits as the employee’s services are rendered.
the group recognises defined-benefit pension plans in accordance with k3’s rules for simplification regarding 
pension plans in sweden that have been secured through a transfer of funds to konsumentkooperationens 
pensionsstiftelse. a provision is recognised if the fund’s assets valued at market value are currently less than the 
commitment. the pension commitments with a value that is dependent on the value of an endowment policy 
are recognised at the value of the endowment policy. if the fair value of the endowment policy is higher than the 
cost, the surplus amount is recognised as a contingent liability memorandum item.
remuneration upon termination
remuneration upon termination is paid when a company within the group decides to terminate an employment 
position prior to the normal time for the end of the employment, or when an employee accepts an offer for 
voluntary resignation in exchange for such remuneration. if the remuneration does not give the company any 
future economic benefit, a liability is recognised, and an expense is recognised when the company has a legal 
or constructive obligation to pay such remuneration. the remuneration is valued at the best estimate of the 
remuneration that would be required in order to settle the commitment on the balance sheet date.

cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is prepared according to the indirect method. the recognised cash flow only includes 
transactions entailing payments in or out. besides cash and bank balances, cash and cash equivalents include 
short-term financial investments, which are exposed only to a negligible risk of value fluctuations and:
− are traded on an open market at known amounts or
− have a remaining term of less than three months from the time of acquisition
contingent liabilities
a contingent liability is:
− a possible liability, which as a result events that occurred and whose occurrence will only be confirmed by 
one or more uncertain future events that are not fully within the company's control, occurs or fails to occur, or
− a current liability as a result of events occurring, which is not recognised as a liability or provision since it is 
not likely that an outflow of resources will be required in order to settle the liability or the size of the liability 
cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability.
contingent liabilities are a summary term for such guarantees, financial undertakings and any obligations 
that are not recognised in the balance sheet. 
parent company’s accounting and valuation principles
the same accounting and valuation principles are applied in the parent company as in the group, except in 
those cases stated below.
equity
in the parent company, equity is divided into restricted and non-restricted equity, in accordance with the 
annual accounts act.
untaxed reserves
untaxed reserves are recognised in gross amounts in the balance sheet, including the deferred tax liability 
attributable to the reserves.
appropriations
changes in untaxed reserves are recognised as appropriations in the income statement.
group contributions are recognised as appropriations.
shares and participations in subsidiaries 
shares and participations in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less any impairments. cost includes the pur-
chase sum that was paid for the shares, as well as acquisition costs. any capital contribution and group contri-
butions are added to cost as they arise. dividends from subsidiaries are recognised as revenue.
leases
all leases in which the company is the lessee are recognised as operating leases (rental agreements), regardless of  
whether the contracts are finance or operating leases. leasing fees are expensed straight-line over the leasing period. 
key performance indicator definitions
solidity
equity and untaxed reserves (less deferred tax) in relation to the balance sheet total.
return on equity

note 2. estimates and assessments
ok-q8 ab makes estimates and assessments about the future. the accounting estimates which result from 
this will, by definition, seldom correspond to the actual result. the estimates and assumptions which entail a 
considerable risk of substantial adjustments in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ensuing 
financial year are addressed in general below.
inventory obsolescence
the book value of ok-q8 ab’s fuel inventory is tested at regular intervals in accordance with the lower of cost 
or market principle. according to this principle, a current asset is valued at the lower of cost and fair value. 
in ok q8 ab’s case, the fair value of the products that are sold is the sales value less selling expenses. for 
those products in stock that are not sold separately, for example additives that are mixed with other products 
to change their properties, the fair value is assumed to be the replacement cost. the value by product type 
according to the accounts is compared with the fair value, and when the fair value is less than the book value, 
the value in the accounts is written down to the fair value. this impairment remains until a new lower of cost 
or market test shows that the impairment should be different or that no impairment is required.
calculations of taxes and times of outflows
deferred tax is calculated on the temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax values of 
assets and liabilities. assumptions and assessments affect the reported deferred tax, both in order to establish 
the carrying amounts of various assets and liabilities, and with regard to forecasts of future taxable profits, 
in the event that a future utilisation of deferred tax assets is dependent on this. essential assessments and 
ok-q8 ab  i  annual report 20/21
-35-
assumptions are also made with regard to the reporting of provisions and contingent liabilities with regard to 
tax risks and the possible effects of ongoing tax audits. the balance sheet comprises deferred tax assets, which 
are subject to assumptions and assessments. 
impairment testing for goodwill, other acquisition-related intangible assets and participations in 
subsidiaries and associated companies
when there are normally no listed prices that can be used to assess the asset’s net sales value, the value in 
use is normally the value used to compare with the book value. the calculation of the value in use is based on 
the assumptions and assessments, see note 1. the most significant assumptions pertain to the organic sales 
growth, the trends in the operating margins, in the utilisation of operating capital employed, and the relevant 
wacc, which is used to discount the future cash flows.
provisions regarding environmental obligations
provisions are made regarding obligations for known and planned restoration activities. potential closure of 
business activities in the group may lead to demands that restoration activities are carried out. this is expected to 
occur far away in time and the potential future expenses cannot be calculated in a reliable manner. such potential 
obligations are not included in the provisions of the group and neither recognized as contingent liabilities.

today it is obvious that you can have a sausage at the gas station. but when the sausage made 
its entrance at the classic petrol stations, it was a game changer and the petrol station 
went from being a petrol station to a place where you could enjoy a nice break.
today we have lots of different sausages to choose from, all carefully 
developed with a focus on quality and taste. it goes without saying 
that there are also vegetarian options.
and for those who do not want to have a sausage, 
we now have a wide range of tasty products. 
so that our customers can refuel with 
both fuel and energy with us.
the sausage - a real game changer, and constantly up to date

this continually.  the scope of any future expenditures cannot be estimated at present but is assessed not to 
be significant enough to jeopardise the survival of the company.
ok-q8 ab has a contract with nordea finans ab for financial lease of its fleet of rental-cars. last year a new 
operational lease agreement has been made with another financier and cars within the older agreement will 
be phased out. this will be completed during the fy 21/22. amounts disclosed refers to future lease payments 
for the current fleet in the agreement with nordea. 
ok-q8 ab has a contract with atria sverige ab for leasing so-called sausage modules (grilling equipment for 
sausages, etc. found at petrol stations). ok ekonomisk förening’s subsidiary, ok detaljhandel ab, pays for the 
leasing fees for the equipment, despite ok-q8 ab being a party to the contract with atria sverige ab. in the 
event that ok detaljhandel ab becomes insolvent, ok-q8 ab is obligated to take ok detaljhandel’s place and 
pay the leasing fees to atria sverige ab. last year, ownership of equipment within the agreement with atria, 
has to the greatest extent been transferred to the company. hence the obligation for ok-q8 to pay future 
leasing fees in the place of ok detaljhandel is below 1 msek.

report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts
opinions
we have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of ok-q8 ab for the financial year 
2020-03-01–2021-02-28. the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included 
on pages 6-53 in this document. 
in our opinion, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  have been prepared in accordance with 
the annual accounts act, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent 
company and the group as of 28 february 2021 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year 
then ended in accordance with the annual accounts act. the statutory administration report is consistent 
with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
we therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and 
balance sheet for the parent company and the group.
basis for opinions
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isa) and generally accepted 
auditing standards in sweden. our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities section. we are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with profes-
sional ethics for accountants in sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions.
other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
this document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found 
on pages 1-5. the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for this other information.
our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.
in connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the 
information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts. in this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained 
in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
if we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. we have nothing to report in this regard.
responsibilities of the board of directors and the managing director
the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the annual accounts 
act. the board of directors and the managing director are also responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts the board of directors and the managing di-
rector are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group's ability to continue as a going 
concern. they disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting. the going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the board of directors and the 
auditors report
to the general meeting of the shareholders of ok-q8 ab, corp. id 556027-3244
ok-q8 ab  i  annual report 20/21

managing director intend to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
the audit committee shall, without prejudice to the board of director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, 
among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process.
auditor’s responsibility
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinions. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with isas and generally accepted auditing standards in sweden will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
– identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
– obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control.
– evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the board of directors and the managing director.
– conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ and the managing director's, use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. we also draw a 
conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the group's ability to continue as a 
going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions 
may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern.
– evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, 
including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
– obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. we are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for our opinions.
we must inform the board of directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. 
we must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identified.

report on other legal and regulatory requirements
opinions
in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the 
administration of the board of directors and the managing director of ok-q8 ab for the financial year 2020-
03-01–2021-02-28 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.
we recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with 
the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the board of directors and the 
managing director be discharged from liability for the financial year.
basis for opinions
we conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in sweden. our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities section. we are independent of 
the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in sweden and 
have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
responsibilities of the board of directors and the managing director 
the board of directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. at 
the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the 
requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the 
parent company's and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.
the board of directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s 
affairs. this includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group's financial 
situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of 
assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. 
the managing director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the board of directors' guidelines 
and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting 
in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.
auditor’s responsibility
our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, 
is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the board 
of directors or the managing director in any material respect:
– has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or
– in any other way has acted in contravention of the companies act, the annual accounts act or the articles of 
association.
our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby 
our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance 
with the companies act.
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards in sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to 
liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance 
with the companies act.
as part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in sweden, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. the examination of the administration 
and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. 
additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and 
materiality. this means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material 
for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s 
ok-q8 ab  i  annual report 20/21

situation. we examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances 
that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. as a basis for our opinion on the board of 
directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the board of directors' reasoned 
statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in  
accordance with the companies act.
