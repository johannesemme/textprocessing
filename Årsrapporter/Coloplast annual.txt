a message from the chairman

dear shareholders, 
 
as i write this letter, the world continues 
to grapple with the covid-19 pandemic 
that has impacted us all, professionally 
and personally. at coloplast, our mission 
continues to guide us. we are here to 
make life easier for people with intimate 
healthcare needs – today and 
tomorrow. 
 
as the impact of the pandemic wanes 
across the world, we see a path to 
recovery and continue to focus on 
building the consumer healthcare 
company of the future. we launched a 
new corporate strategy last year, 
strive25, and despite the challenges 
presented by covid-19, i look back on 
a year in which the company delivered 
solid results and took market shares 
across all business areas. 
 
as a company, we continue to strive 
towards long-term value creation for all 
our stakeholders – consumers, 
healthcare professionals, employees, 
communities and shareholders. 
 
in my role, i continue to firmly believe 
that effective boardrooms are built on a 
foundation of collaboration, respect and 
trust. i also place great emphasis on the 
strong collaboration between the board 
and the executive leadership team. 
 
one of my key priorities since becoming 
chairman of the board has been to 
broaden the scope of the board’s 
strategic work. over the past year, the 
board has engaged extensively with 
management on navigating the impacts 
of covid-19 as well as key strategic 
topics, including innovation, 
digitalisation, sustainability, culture, 
m&a and successful execution in the us 
and china. let me highlight two key 
areas. 
 
first, our strategy must evolve as the 
marketplace changes. to name a few 
key developments, covid-19 has 
accelerated the digital transformation 
and introduced new ways of working 
that will have large ramifications in the 
years to come. covid-19 has also put 
pressure on input costs which will be a 
key topic going forward. 
 
second, sustainability is on top of the 
board agenda. i firmly believe that 
sustainability is key to corporate 
competitiveness and a company’s 
continued ability to operate. the board 
is committed to addressing these 
concerns and to providing the adequate 
disclosure and transparency necessary 
to assess our progress. at coloplast, we 
have always aspired to act responsibly. 
as part of strive25, sustainability has 
been elevated to an enterprise theme 
backed by large investments. 
 
the climate crisis is one of the most 
urgent issues of our time and we must 
act now. at coloplast, we have taken 
key steps to advance our environmental 
commitment. i strongly support the 
recommendations of the task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures 
and encourage other business leaders 
to join the effort. 
 
as outlined in our remuneration report, 
to underline our commitment to climate 
action and ensure solid progress, 
executive remuneration will be linked to 
climate-related non-financial metrics.

inclusion & diversity is another area 
that i feel passionate about. 
 
in 2020, i became chairman of the di 
(danish industry) committee on 
diversity. most recently, as part of the 
company's inclusion and diversity 
efforts, coloplast has signed the 
confederation of danish industry's 
gender diversity pledge, committing to 
a target of a 40/60 gender distribution 
in management and our board of 
directors by 2030. 
 
during the year, coloplast undertook an 
independent board evaluation to assess 
whether the board’s composition, 
dynamics, operations and structure are 
effective for the company and its 
business environment in the short and 
long term. the review identified future 
development areas and also highlighted 
areas of strength. 
 
at the annual general meeting in 
december, the board will propose the 
election of a new board member who 
has extensive commercial experience 
from the us market. 
 
today, i am pleased to present our 
annual report, which looks back on 
another challenging year due to covid-
19. despite a significant negative impact 
on growth in our chronic care business 
due to the pandemic, it is fair to 
conclude that this year once again 
confirmed the strength of coloplast’s 
business model to deliver solid 
performance and earnings growth even 
in tough times. most importantly, our 
products have continued to help make 
life easier for millions of people with 
intimate healthcare conditions. 
 
in conclusion, based on our company’s 
financial performance in 2020/21, the 
board of directors will propose a total 
dividend of dkk 19.00 per share at the 
annual general meeting in december 
2021. 
 
on behalf of the board of directors, i 
would like to thank coloplast’s 
executive leadership team for guiding 
the organisation through this difficult 
and fast-moving environment. 
 
once again, thank you to our 
employees for their dedication to the 
company and our mission. 2020/21 was 
not an easy year. the commitment, 
which has been shown by our 
approximately 12,500 employees 
worldwide, is truly humbling. i would 
also like to thank you, our shareholders, 
for your continued trust and support. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lars rasmussen 
chairman of the board of directors 
 
proposed dividend per 
share is dkk 14.00 on 
top of a half-year 
dividend of dkk 5.00. 
 
the board of directors recommends 
that the shareholders attending the 
general meeting approve a year-end 
dividend of dkk 14.00 per share. in 
addition to a dividend of dkk 5.00 per 
share paid out in connection with the 
half-year results in may 2021, which 
brings the total dividend paid for the 
year to dkk 19.00 per share, compared 
with dkk 18.00 per share last year.

our ceos view on the business 
6 
dear shareholders, 
 
at coloplast, we work to make life 
easier for people with intimate 
healthcare needs. by listening to the 
people who use our products – users as 
well as the nurses and specialists who 
care for them – we get a better 
understanding of their needs and 
challenges. that knowledge inspires our 
innovation. this approach has brought 
us close to our customers. it has allowed 
us to deliver pioneering products and 
made us one of the best performing 
medical device companies in the world. 
we’re very proud of that. but we have 
more work to do. 
 
this year year, i am proud to say that 
we helped more than 2 million chronic 
users. our key focus has been to keep 
our employees safe, continue to serve 
our customers and maintain business 
operations.  
 
as we enter a new financial year, the 
world is still experiencing disruptions as 
a result of the global pandemic and its 
long-term effects will continue to impact 
us. but i am confident that the 
pandemic will also have lasting positive 
implications. i am fundamentally 
optimistic about our future. coloplast is 
a long-term growth company. we 
operate in attractive underlying markets 
growing 4-5% driven by demographics, 
increasing health care standards in 
emerging markets and innovation. we 
continue to build the consumer 
healthcare company of the future with a 
strong commercial model based on 
category leadership through innovation, 
strong partnerships with clinicians and a 
large-scale direct-to-consumer setup. 
the pandemic has validated our model. 
 
covid-19 has accelerated digital 
trends 
what we have witnessed over the past 
year is an acceleration of the digital 
transformation and we will not run our 
company the same way again. 
triggered by the pandemic, healthcare 
professionals have been profoundly 
impacted by the shift to remote work, 
our employees found new ways of 
working and consumers became reliant 
on strong digital offerings. coloplast has 
responded in turn and invested in digital 
tools, data security and artificial 
intelligence that will help us excel in a 
more digitised environment. 
 
solid 2020/21 results 
despite covid-19, we delivered a 
strong set of numbers with 7% organic 
growth, 33% ebit margin before special 
items and 45% return on invested 
capital after tax (before special items). 
covid-19 had a large impact on our 
chronic care business, but on a positive 
note, the growth in new patients is 
recovering. our smaller business areas, 
interventional urology and wound & 
skin care, made a strong recovery this 
year as elective procedures and hospital 
activity resumed. across all business 
areas we once again gained market 
shares. the strong ebit margin was 
supported by the successful execution 
of our global operations plans. we 
continued to invest in innovation and 
commercial growth initiatives, in 
particular in the us and china, as well 
as digital initiatives. importantly, our 
employees remained engaged and our 
most recent employee engagement 
score was again above the benchmark. 
 
strive25 – sustainable growth 
leadership 
last year, we announced our new 
strategy, strive25, with a clear 
emphasis on growth and innovation, us 
and china. growth will be fuelled by 
incremental investments of up to 2% of 
revenues annually in innovation and 
commercial initiatives across all business 
areas. we will also actively pursue m&a 
opportunities to build growth options. 
a few highlights from the first year of 
strive25: 
 
first, innovation. we aim to set the 
standard of care in the categories we 
compete in. with user needs at the 
centre, we have made progress on our 
clinical performance programme in 
chronic care. the programme marks 
the start of an important transition to 
outcome-based innovation, which forces 
us to think differently and which will be 
key over the next decade as our 
healthcare ecosystem becomes 
increasingly value based. we need to 
demonstrate value to wider sets of 
stakeholders including consumers, 
clinicians and not least payers. clinical 
evidence, data and demonstrating value 
will be critical. 
 
in wound care, we have strengthened 
our product portfolio with the launch of 
biatain fiber. in interventional urology, 
we have taken steps to build new 
growth options into the pipeline through 
the acquisition of nine continents 
medical, an early-stage technology 
company within the overactive bladder 
market. 
 
second, growth. it has been a tough 
year for healthcare systems. despite 
challenging market conditions, we made 
key progress on our commercial growth 
agenda. in chronic care, we seek to 
continue to drive growth above the 
market with a strong contribution from 
our us and emerging market regions. in 
the us, we achieved a key milestone by 
our ceos view on the business  
 
i am fundamentally optimistic about our future. coloplast is a long-
term growth company.

securing access to the largest ostomy 
gpos. in china, we have initiated a large 
project with hundreds of ostomy nurses 
aimed at raising standards of care for 
ostomy users. in poland, reimbursement 
for hydrophilic catheters has been 
significantly improved for adults and 
children with neurogenic bladder and is 
now on par with the european standard 
of care. this important step forward will 
help thousands of people to lead more 
dignified lives. 
 
our new strategy is supported by key 
growth enablers, including efficiency, 
people and culture and sustainability. 
 
we continue to strive for unparalleled 
efficiency and industry leading margins. 
our ambitious 3-year global operations 
plan 5 is off to a solid start. our 
extensive automation programme is on 
track and our first volume factory in 
costa rica opened this year. our 
second volume factory in costa rica will 
open next year. by the end of strive25, 
costa rica is expected to produce 25-
30% of our global volumes, ensuring 
that we have a more diversified global 
production network. we also continue to 
see a positive scale effect in our 
business support organisation driven by 
the further utilisation of our coloplast 
business centre in poland. however, we 
also see headwinds from pressure on 
input costs, mainly from wage inflation 
in hungary and increasing raw materials 
costs. 
 
a purpose driven culture with the 
focus on sustainability 
at the heart of delivering on strive25 is 
our people and culture. the pandemic 
has been tough on all employees. as 
societies open again across the world, 
we are reconnecting with our 
colleagues. we are united around a 
strong purpose, but the pandemic has 
led to lasting changes in how we work. 
to succeed in this new environment, we 
are discovering new ways of organising 
and leading, along with new approaches 
to recruiting, developing and engaging 
employees. we have also set clear goals 
on diversity for all leaders in the 
company. we all need to make this a 
priority. 
 
i am very pleased to release this year’s 
sustainability report together with the 
annual report. last year, coloplast 
made sustainability an enterprise 
theme. we have set a number of 
ambitious targets to support the un 
sustainable development goals and to 
reduce emissions from scope 1, 2 and 3 
in line with the paris agreement to limit 
global temperature rise to 1.5°c. by 
submitting targets for validation to the 
science-based targets initiative, we 
have increased transparency across our 
entire value chain. our environmental 
sustainability initiatives are supported by 
investments of up to dkk 250 million 
over the strategy period. we are acting 
now. 
 
despite a challenging year, i remain 
optimistic about our future which holds 
many opportunities for growth. i want to 
say thank you to all the employees at 
coloplast for your continued 
commitment to build our company and 
deliver on our mission. i would also like 
to thank our customers and investors 
for your confidence.

cash flows from operating activities 
amounted to dkk 5,290 million, against

development in cash flows from 
operating activities was mainly due to 
an increase in operating profit (ebit), an 
improvement on financial items and 
positive changes in working capital. 
cash flow from operating activities was 
impacted by a one-off tax payment 
related to nine continents medical exit 
taxation in the us.

key assumptions 
revenue growth 
the impact of covid-19 and the spread 
of the delta variant are continuously 
monitored and evaluated on a short- 
and medium-term basis, and the 
financial guidance is subject to higher 
uncertainty. the ongoing covid-19 
pandemic has had a negative impact on 
the addressable market growth, and for 
2021/22 we expect market growth to 
be at the lower end of the 4-5% range. 
coloplast expects to grow above the 
market and gain market share. 
 
coloplast’s full year guidance assumes 
the following: 
a) continued resumption of hospital 
activity across business areas  
b) for the chronic care business, the 
assumptions by region include: 
 europe – continued improvement 
in growth, as a result of a norma-
lised growth in new patients in line 
with pre-covid levels 
 us – continued improvement in 
growth driven by a gradual 
normalisation of growth in new 
patients to pre-covid levels, 
especially in continence care 
 emerging markets – broad-based 
double-digit growth. china is 
expected to remain impacted by 
covid-19 and economic 
uncertainty. 
c) interventional urology and wound & 
skin care deliver in line with strive 25 
ambitions 
d) no current knowledge of significant 
health care reforms 
e) a stable supply and distribution of 
products across the company 
 
reported growth in dkk is expected to 
be around 8%. 
 
the financial guidance takes account of 
known reforms. the company’s 
expectations of long-term price 
pressure, of up to 1% annually is 
unchanged. the financial guidance 
further assumes a continuation of the 
successful roll-out of new products. 
 
ebit margin 
the ebit margin guidance reflects an 
increase in operating costs related to 
the resumption of business activity as 
the impact of covid-19 recedes. the 
guidance also reflects cost inflation 
including a low single-digit increase in 
raw material costs and double-digit 
wage inflation in hungary.  
 
the ebit margin guidance assumes 
leverage effect on fixed costs and 
continued efficiency improvements 
through the global operations plan 5. 
the guidance also reflects additional 
incremental investments of up to 2% of 
revenue for innovation as well as sales 
and marketing purposes. 
 
capex 
the capex guidance includes 
investments in automation initiatives at 
volume sites in hungary and china as 
part of gop5, establishment of the 
second volume site in costa rica, 
investments in new machines for 
existing and new products, it 
investments and sustainability 
investments.  
 
other assumptions 
the provision made to cover costs 
relating to transvaginal surgical mesh 
products remains subject to a degree of 
estimation.

2020/21 performance 
the ostomy business continued solid growth, largely recovered from 
 
14 
 
performance  
ostomy care generated 6% organic 
sales growth for the 2020/21 financial 
year, with reported revenue in dkk 
growing by 4% to dkk 7,841 million. 
 
the sensura® mio portfolio and the 
brava® range of supporting products 
continued to be the main drivers of 
revenue growth. at the product level, 
sensura mio convex was the main 
contributor to growth driven by 
germany, the uk and the us. sensura 
mio concave continued to contribute to 
growth driven by the uk and germany. 
the sensura and assura/alterna® 
portfolios also contributed to growth in 
the markets where they are being 
actively promoted, such as china and 
other emerging markets. sales of the 
brava range of supporting products 
continue to contribute to growth driven 
by china, the us, germany and the uk. 
 
from a geographical perspective, the 
emerging markets region was the main 
contributor to growth, led by china and 
latam. among the european markets, 
the uk and germany were the main 
growth contributors. the us also 
contributed to growth. 
 
during 2020/21, growth in ostomy 
care was negatively impacted by lower 
growth in new patients, as only the most 
acute ostomy surgeries took place due 
to the covid-19 pandemic. the impact 
was most pronounced in europe, in 
particular in the uk as well as the us.  
 
 
 
 
growth in new patients normalised 
during the second half of fy 2020/21, 
following the resumption of hospital 
activity. 
 
in march 2021, coloplast was awarded 
a contract for ostomy products with 
vizient, inc., the largest healthcare 
performance improvement company in 
the us. the agreement is multi-source 
and effective for three years beginning 
1 july 2021. the new agreement allows 
vizient members access to contracted 
pricing of coloplast’s full portfolio of 
ostomy products, including ostomy 
pouches and supporting products. 
 
vizient serves more than half of the 
healthcare organisations across the 
country – from large integrated delivery 
networks and academic medical centres 
to community hospitals, children’s 
hospitals and non-acute care providers.

market 
market description 
in 2020/21, the global market for 
ostomy care products was worth an 
estimated dkk 18-19 billion. around 
85% of the market is within the bags 
and plates category, the remaining 15% 
in the supporting products category.  
the market size is primarily impacted by 
the prevalence of colorectal and 
bladder cancer and inflammatory bowel 
diseases. another significant driver is the 
availability of reimbursement for ostomy 
products across different geographies. 
the ostomy market is a chronic market, 
with the majority of product usage 
happening in community, i.e. after users 
have been discharged from the hospital. 
 
market growth 
the annual market growth is estimated 
at 4–5%, excluding any short-term 
impact from covid-19. 
 
market volume growth is driven by the 
ageing western population and 
increasing access to healthcare in 
emerging markets. another volume 
growth driver is compliance and usage 
rates across markets. the incidence of 
temporary stomas, i.e. when ostomy 
products are only needed for a limited 
period of time, has increased due to 
medical advances. this trend has had a 
negative impact on volume growth over 
the past decade.  
 
price and mix also have an impact on 
market growth. as markets mature, 
there is an increased demand for more 
advanced product categories. 
historically, prices have seen negative 
pressure due to healthcare reforms. no 
significant healthcare reforms were 
implemented during 2020/21. 
the covid-19 pandemic has had a 
negative impact on the market growth. 
the number of new patients entering 
the market during 2020/21 was 
depressed, as screening and treatment 
were either cancelled or postponed. 
growth in new patients normalised 
towards pre-covid levels across most 
markets in the second half of 2020/21, 
as hospital activity resumed. 
 
the impact from covid-19 on the 
ostomy market is expected to be 
temporary. the underlying dynamics 
and growth drivers of the ostomy 
market are not expected to change 
beyond the pandemic. 
 
market shares 
coloplast is the global market leader in 
ostomy care, with a market share of 35-
40%. 
there are three larger global 
manufacturers in the ostomy market, 
including coloplast, and a few local 
manufacturers especially in the uk.

estimated at 6-8%, excluding any short-
term impact from covid-19.

2020/21 performance 
the continence business continued solid growth, not fully recovered from 
covid-19 
 
16 
 
performance 
continence care generated 5% organic 
sales growth for the 2020/21 financial 
year, with reported revenue in dkk 
growing by 3% to dkk 7,003 million. 
 
speedicath® intermittent catheters 
were the main drivers of revenue 
growth. the growth in sales of the 
speedicath portfolio was driven by 
compact catheters, standard catheters 
and flexible catheters, all of which are 
ready-to-use hydrophilic coated 
catheters. the growth in flexible 
catheters and compact catheters was 
mainly driven by the us, france, the uk 
and germany. speedicath navi, a 
hydrophilic catheter specifically 
designed for emerging markets and 
lower priced developed markets, also 
contributed to growth. 
 
the bowel management business also 
contributed to growth, driven by 
peristeen® in europe. growth in 
collecting devices was flat for the year, 
impacted by covid-19. 
 
 
from a geographical perspective, sales 
growth was mainly driven by europe, in 
particular the uk and france, and the 
us. 
 
during 2020/21, growth in continence 
care was negatively impacted by lower 
growth in new patients due to the 
covid-19 pandemic, as only the most 
acute patient groups, such as spinal 
cord injured received treatment, while 
other patient groups, such as multiple 
sclerosis (ms), benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (bph) and bowel 
management were deprioritised for 
treatment. the impact was most 
pronounced in europe, in particular in 
the uk, and the us. 
 
growth in new patients increased during 
the second half of fy 2020/21, 
following the resumption of hospital 
activity. in europe, it approached pre-
covid levels towards the end of the 
financial year. growth in new patients in 
the us is improving, but it is still below 
pre-covid levels.

market 
market description 
in 2020/21, the global market for 
continence care products was worth an 
estimated dkk 14–15 billion.  
around 80% of the continence market 
is within the intermittent catheters 
category, and the remaining 20% in the 
collecting devices category.  
 
the market size is primarily influenced 
by the number of people suffering from 
spinal cord injuries, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (bph), multiple sclerosis 
(ms) and people born with congenital 
spina bifida. another driver is the 
availability of reimbursement for 
continence care products across 
markets. the continence market is a 
chronic market, and the majority of 
product usage happens in the 
community, i.e. after users have been 
discharged from the hospital. 
 
market growth 
the annual market growth is estimated 
at 5–6% excluding any short-term 
impact from covid-19. 
 
the fastest growing segment of the 
market is intermittent catheters. growth 
in this segment is driven by the 
increasing use of intermittent catheters 
as an alternative to permanent or 
indwelling catheters. the underlying 
volume growth is driven by the number 
of spinal cord injured patients treated 
with intermittent catheterisation, the 
ageing western population and 
increasing access to healthcare in 
emerging markets. another volume 
growth driver is compliance and usage 
rates across developed markets. 
price and mix also have an impact on 
market growth. as markets mature, 
there continues to be an upgrade to 
more advanced product categories.  
 
historically, prices have been under 
negative pressure due to healthcare 
reforms. no significant healthcare 
reforms were implemented during 
2020/21. 
 
the covid-19 pandemic has had a 
negative impact on the market growth. 
the number of new patients entering 
the market during 2020/21 was 
depresssed, as treatment was either 
cancelled or postponed. growth in new 
patients started to increase across most 
markets in the second half of 2020/21, 
but it remained below pre-covid levels, 
as some of the candidates for 
intermittent catheterisation were not 
prioritised or were given alternative 
treatments. 
 
the impact of covid-19 on the 
continence care market is expected to 
be temporary. the underlying dynamics 
and growth drivers of the continence 
care market are not expected to 
change beyond the pandemic. 
 
market shares 
coloplast is the global market leader in 
continence care, with a market share of 
40–45%. the continence care market is 
characterised by four larger global 
manufacturers, including coloplast. 
there are also a number of local and 
low-priced manufacturers.

performance 
interventional urology generated 19% 
organic sales growth in the 2020/21 
financial year, with reported revenue in 
dkk growing by 14% to dkk 2,097 
million. 
 
during the year, elective procedures 
resumed across regions and business 
areas. men’s health and the disposable 
surgical products segment returned to 
pre-covid growth levels during the 
year. women’s health is recovering at a 
slower pace, but the trend was positive 
in the second half of the year.  
 
growth was primarily driven by the 
titan® penile implants in the us. sales 
of disposable surgical products in 
europe also contributed positively to 
growth as well as the women’s health 
business in the us. 
 
from a geographical perspective, the 
us market was the largest contributor 
to growth in interventional urology 
followed by france. 
 
coloplast is actively seeking long-term 
growth opportunities in adjacent 
segments in the interventional urology 
business through inorganic means, 
including early-stage equity 
investments. 
 
in november 2020, coloplast acquired 
nine continents medical, an early-stage 
company pioneering an implantable 
tibial nerve stimulation treatment for 
over-active bladder. the implantable 
tibial nerve stimulation treatment that 
nine continents has developed falls 
under the category of third line 
therapies for over-active bladder. 
 
today, the market for third line 
therapies is approx. usd 1 billion in size 
and growing mid-single digits. coloplast 
expects to begin a pivotal study in the 
us before the end of 2021, with the 
ambition to obtain pre-market approval 
for a class iii device in the us and eu 
market approvals in the 2024-2025 
time frame. 
 
during 2020/21, coloplast also 
participated in the series b equity 
financing of francis medical, an early-
stage company working on a water 
vapor treatment for prostate cancer. 
coloplast made its first investment in 
francis medical in 2020, when coloplast 
announced a minority equity investment 
in the company of usd 4 million (dkk 
25 million).

market 
market description 
in 2020/21, the global market for 
interventional urology products 
returned to growth as elective 
procedures resumed, increasing to an 
estimated dkk 12–13 billion from an 
estimated dkk 11–12 billion in the 
previous year. thus, the market size was 
back to its pre-covid level. 
 
the interventional urology market 
consists of implantable products within 
men’s health and women’s health, and 
single-use devices within endourology 
and bladder health and surgery. 
roughly half of the market is within the 
endourology segment, and the rest is 
almost equally divided between the 
other three areas. 
 
market growth 
the annual market growth is estimated 
at 3–5% excluding any short-term 
impact from covid-19. 
 
market growth in the interventional 
urology market is driven by the ageing 
population and lifestyle diseases as well 
as ongoing innovation leading to more 
cost-efficient surgical procedures. for 
implants, market growth drivers include 
a growing awareness of the treatment 
options available for men with severe 
impotence and women with urological 
disorders. 
 
covid-19 had a significant negative 
impact on the urology market. at the 
beginning of the pandemic, during the 
first half of 2019/20, many hospitals 
postponed or cancelled elective 
procedures, and this resulted in negative 
market growth during 2019/20. 
over the course of 2020/21, elective 
procedures across most markets 
resumed, and market growth started to 
recover. the market was back to 
positive growth in 2020/21.  
 
the impact of covid-19 on the 
interventional urology market is 
expected to be temporary. the 
underlying dynamics and growth drivers 
of the interventional urology market are 
not expected to change beyond the 
pandemic.

2020/21 performance 
wound and skin care business had a strong year partly due to covid-19

performance 
wound & skin care generated 8% 
organic sales growth for the 2020/21 
financial year, with reported revenue in 
dkk growing by 6% to dkk 2,485 
million. 
 
the wound care business in isolation 
delivered organic growth of 11% for the 
2020/21 financial year. 
 
the biatain® silicone portfolio was the 
main growth contributor, followed by 
the newly launched biatain fiber 
portfolio. biatain fiber, a gel-forming 
fibre dressing used for deeper wounds 
and wound cavities with exudate, has 
been launched in nine markets and 
continues to be well-received. 
 
 
from a geographical perspective, the 
european markets and china were the 
main contributors to growth. china 
posted solid growth for the financial 
year, positively impacted by a lower 
baseline in 2019/20 due to covid-19. 
the growth in the european wound 
care business was primarily driven by 
growth in the biatain silicone and 
biatain fiber portfolios in germany, 
france and spain. 
 
growth in the skin care business was flat 
for the year, driven by lower demand 
due to covid-19. the compeed 
contract manufacturing business made 
a modest positive contribution to 
growth as a result of strong growth in 
q4, which was driven by a low baseline 
and an improved demand situation.

market 
wound care 
market description 
the market is estimated to be worth 
dkk 22–24 billion and is defined as 
advanced wound care products 
excluding the negative pressure wound 
therapy segment. coloplast is focused 
on two of the fastest growing market 
segments within advanced wound care - 
silicone foams and gelling fibers, which 
account for roughly 45% of the market. 
compared to the chronic care business, 
the wound care market is more of a 
hospital market, in particular in the us 
and china. in europe, wounds are to a 
greater extent treated in the 
community. 
 
market growth 
the annual market growth is estimated 
at 2–4% excluding any short-term 
impact from covid-19. the silicone 
foams market, in which coloplast 
markets its biatain® silicone products, is 
growing faster, at 4–6% per year. 
 
underlying growth in the wound care 
market is driven by the ageing 
population, the growing diabetics 
population and a growing number of 
patients receiving preventive wound 
care treatment. increased competition 
between manufacturers and pricing 
pressure originating from lower public 
healthcare budgets and reimbursement 
reforms in europe have a negative 
impact on the market growth.  
 
growth in the part of the global wound 
care segment in which coloplast 
competes has been negatively impacted 
by the covid-19 pandemic. the 
underlying dynamics of the global 
wound care market are not expected to 
change beyond the pandemic. 
 
market shares 
coloplast’s global market share in 
advanced wound care is 5-10%, making 
the company the world’s fifth largest 
manufacturer of advanced wound care 
products. 
 
the market consists of a large number 
of direct competitors ranging from 
global manufacturers to small, local 
manufactures as well as various 
alternative treatment options, such as 
negative pressure wound therapy and 
traditional wound dressings.

skin care 
the market for skin care products, in 
which coloplast competes, is estimated 
at dkk 4–5 billion. skin care is a mainly 
a hospital business. patients are treated 
in hospital with a variety of skin care 
products.  
 
the annual market growth is estimated 
at 2–4% excluding any short-term 
impact from covid-19. the underlying 
dynamics of the skin care market are 
not expected to change beyond the 
pandemic. 
 
coloplast holds a market share of 10-
15% in the fragmented skin care 
segment, which is mainly a us-based 
business.

earnings 
revenue 
the full-year organic growth was 7%, 
adversely impacted by lower growth in 
new patients due to the covid-19 
pandemic. reported revenue in dkk 
was up by 5% to dkk 19,426 million. 
exchange rate developments decreased 
revenue by 2% mainly related to the 
depreciation of the usd and several 
emerging markets currencies against 
dkk in particular ars, brl and rub. 
 
gross profit 
gross profit was up by 6% to dkk 
13,313 million compared to dkk 12,612 
million last year and equivalent to a 
gross margin of 69%, against 68% last 
year. the gross margin included a 
negative impact from currencies, mainly 
related to the depreciation of usd, ars 
and brl against dkk, which was only 
partly offset by a positive impact from 
the depreciation of the huf against the 
dkk. around 80% of the company’s 
production volumes are in hungary. 
 
the gross profit was positively impacted 
by leverage on the production costs and 
efficiency gains from the global 
operations plan 4 and 5. this was partly 
offset by a negative impact from wage 
inflation and labour shortages in 
hungary. higher costs related to scaling 
up of activities in costa rica also 
impacted the gross profit negatively. 
the automation programme, which is a 
key component of the gop5 plan, is 
progressing according to plan and has 
contributed to maintaining a flat level of 
blue-collar workers, while ramping up 
the volume site in costa rica. increasing 
raw material prices had an immaterial 
impact on costs, but the impact 
increased during q4. 
costs 
distribution costs amounted to dkk 
5,485 million, a dkk 168 million 
increase (3%) from dkk 5,317 million 
last year. the increase was mainly due 
to commercial investments in asia, the 
us, interventional urology and 
consumer and digital initiatives. the 
investments were partly offset by lower 
travel and sales & marketing expenses 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. 
increasing freight rates had an 
immaterial impact on logistic costs but 
the impact increased during q4. 
distribution costs amounted to 28% of 
revenue compared to 29% last year. 
 
administrative expenses amounted to 
dkk 762 million, at the same absolute 
level as last year. administrative 
expenses accounted for 4% of revenue 
which was consistent with last year. 
the r&d costs were dkk 755 million, a 
dkk 47 million (7%) increase compared 
to last year due to an increased activity 
level. r&d costs amounted to 4% of 
revenue, on par with last year. 
 
other operating income and other 
operating expenses amounted to a net 
income of dkk 44 million, against dkk 
29 million last year. the increase was 
due to the sale of a property in 
denmark (dkk 16 million). 
 
special items 
coloplast made a further provision of 
dkk 200 million, in march 2021, to 
cover potential settlements and costs in 
connection with lawsuits in the us 
alleging injury resulting from the use of 
transvaginal surgical mesh products 
designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse 
and stress urinary incontinence. the

process to resolve outstanding cases is 
taking longer than previously 
anticipated, including delays due to 
covid-19, which led to an increase in 
legal advisory costs. further settlement 
progress has been made and it is now 
estimated that 98% of mdl cases have 
been settled.  
 
operating profit (ebit) 
ebit before special items amounted to 
dkk 6,355 million, a dkk 501 million 
(9%) increase from dkk 5,854 million 
last year. the ebit margin before 
special items was 33% compared to 
32% last year. the ebit margin includes 
a negative impact from currencies, 
mainly related to the depreciation of 
usd against dkk. 
 
ebit after special items was dkk 6,155 
million, including special items of dkk 
200 million related to the 
aforementioned lawsuits. the ebit 
margin after special items was 32%. 
 
ebit during 2020/21 was positively 
impacted by efficiency gains and lower 
travel and sales & marketing expenses 
following the covid-19 outbreak. the 
company continued to invest in 
innovation and commercial activities in 
markets where the covid-19 situation 
had normalised. 
 
financial items and tax 
financial items were a net income of 
dkk 78 million, compared to a net 
expense of dkk 388 million last year. 
the net income of dkk 78 million was 
mainly due to gains on balance sheet 
items denominated in several foreign 
currencies, including the british pound 
and the chinese yuan, of dkk 95 
million, and gains on currency hedges of 
dkk 19 million on mainly the us dollar. 
this was only partly offset, mainly by 
other financial expenses and fees of 
dkk 32 million. 
 
the tax rate was around 23% for the 
financial year, which was in line with last 
year. the tax rate this year was 
impacted by two separate matters – the 
nine continents acquisition and a 
temporary increase in the tax-
deductible value of r&d expenses in 
denmark. the tax expense amounted to 
dkk 1,408 million against dkk 1,269 
million last year.  
 
net profit 
net profit before special items was dkk 
4,981 million, a dkk 784 million 
increase from dkk 4,197 million last 
year. diluted earnings per share (eps) 
before special items increased by 19% 
from dkk 19.67 last year to dkk 23.36. 
 
net profit after special items was dkk 
4,825 million and diluted earnings per 
share (eps) after special items was dkk 
22.63. 
 
cash flows and 
investments 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities 
amounted to dkk 5,290 million, against 
dkk 4,759 million last year. the positive 
development in cash flows from 
operating activities was mainly due to an 
increase in operating profit (ebit), an 
improvement on financial items and 
positive changes in working capital. 
 
cash flow from operating activities was 
impacted by a one-off tax payment 
related to nine continents exit taxation in 
the us.

investments 
coloplast made investments of dkk 
1,966 million in 2020/21 compared with 
dkk 931 million last year. investments 
related to the acquisition of nine 
continents medical amounted to dkk 
950 million. excluding acquisitions, 
capex amounted to dkk 1,016 million 
or 5% of revenues on par with last year. 
 
the increase in investments was mainly 
linked to the new factory in costa rica 
and the automation programme within 
global operations. 
 
free cash flow  
as a result, the free cash flow was an 
inflow of dkk 3,279 million compared to 
an inflow of dkk 3,858 million last year. 
adjusted for the acquisition of nine 
continents medical, the free cash flow 
was dkk 4,547 million corresponding to 
an increase of 18%. 
 
capital resources 
at 30 september 2021, coloplast had 
net interest-bearing debt, including 
securities, of dkk 2,112 million, against 
dkk 1,162 million at 30 september 
2020. the increase in net interest-
bearing debt was mainly due to the 
acquisition of nine continents medical in 
november 2020.

balance sheet 
at 30 september 2021, total assets 
amounted to dkk 15,841 million, an 
increase of dkk 2,342 million compared

working capital 
working capital was 24% of revenue, 
compared to 23% at 30 september

dkk 50 million and tax on equity entries 
of dkk 32 million were only partly offset 
by the payment of dividends amounting

strategy and markets    sustainability and people    risk management 
25 
in september 2020, we announced our 
new strategy, strive25 – sustainable 
growth leadership. 
 
‘sustainable’ because it sends an 
important signal. sustainability is an 
important enterprise theme. 
 
'growth' because we want coloplast to 
continue to be an innovative growth 
company. 
 
 
 
1 constant currencies, based on fx rates as 
at 29 september 2020. 
'leadership' because we aspire to lead 
our categories but also because we aim 
to evolve the way we lead. 
 
our strategy has four enterprise wide 
themes: innovation, unparalleled 
efficiency, sustainability and talent, 
leadership & culture. these four 
themes are enablers of the revenue 
growth and value creation that our 
business areas will deliver. 
we will continue to focus on value 
creation and our ambition with the 
strive25 strategy is to continue to 
deliver 7-9% organic growth year-on-
year with an ebit margin above 30%.1 
 
in the strategy period, we will continue 
to invest up to 2% of annual revenue in 
incremental innovation and commercial 
activities to drive our growth and value 
creation agenda. 
 
our business 
strategy and markets  
sustainable growth leadership 
our business 
strategy and markets 
 
26 
we will pursue market leading growth 
across all our business areas with a 
common theme of innovation and a 
geographical emphasis on the us and 
china. the strategy will allow us to help 
millions more with intimate healthcare 
needs. 
 
innovation 
innovation is a core driver of organic 
growth, and we will continue to invest 
around 4% of sales in r&d across all 
business areas. 
 
the most important initiative in this 
strategy period is to deliver on the 
clinical performance programme in 
chronic care, and to launch clinically 
differentiated products backed by 
clinical evidence. 
 
we will also continue to deliver new 
products across all business areas within 
existing technologies. 
 
finally, we are looking to build more 
options into the pipeline through organic 
initiatives, business development and 
m&a. the aim is to create long-term 
growth options beyond the strategy 
period. 
 
unparalleled efficiency 
the first area of efficiency work is our 
global operations plan 5 (gop5). since 
2008, global operations has delivered 
significant value through global 
operations plans. gop5 will be different 
to the previous plans since opportunities 
for cost savings from offshoring 
manufacturing no longer exist. 
 
in addition, external factors like wage 
inflation and labour shortage in hungary 
put pressure on the overall financial 
performance. 
 
in order to deliver a strong platform for 
supporting sustainable growth, five 
strategic themes in gop5 have been 
selected. they are commercial focus, 
automation, seamless supply, network 
and footprint as well as simple and cost-
efficient culture. 
 
a key theme in gop5 is automation at 
our volume sites in china and hungary. 
the aim is to be headcount neutral at 
our manufacturing sites by the end of 
2022/23 financial year. 
 
we also expect to continue to see a 
positive scale effect in our business 
support organisation driven by further 
utilisation of our coloplast business 
centre and investments in it. 
 
sustainability 
at coloplast, we have always worked on 
our sustainability agenda. now, as part 
of strive25, we have integrated 
sustainability into our corporate 
strategy. we will support sustainable 
development with a strong emphasis on 
improving our environmental 
performance and we will invest up to 
dkk 250 million over the next five years 
to support this agenda. 
 
to do so, we have set two new priorities 
for sustainability: improving products 
and packaging and reducing emissions. 
 
as part of the sustainability agenda, we 
will also continue to work on a number 
of priorities within the theme 
‘responsible operations’. responsible 
operations covers a multitude of topics, 
such as employee satisfaction, safety 
and health, gender representation in 
management, inclusion and diversity, 
business ethics and product safety and 
quality. 
 
each of these areas are detailed on 
pages 32 to 37. 
 
talent, leadership and 
culture 
coloplast is a global employer with a 
strong purpose driven culture. we have 
a strong start on employee engagement 
and talent promotion that we strive to 
maintain. at the heart of delivering on 
strive25 is our people and culture. 
 
the people & culture agenda is centred 
on three themes: evolving how we lead, 
talent for future as well as inclusion and 
diversity. 
 
each of these areas are detailed on 
pages 36 to 37.

strive25: sustaining 
growth leadership 
our ambition for the chronic care 
business is to continue to deliver strong 
growth above the market. it all starts 
with innovation which is our first priority. 
 
as market leader, we are fully 
committed to drive and improve 
standards of care through better 
treatments, technologies, product 
categories and training. 
 
our second priority is to deliver strong, 
double-digit growth in the us. with 
significant investments in the lead20 
strategy, the ambition is to deliver 
consistent double-digit growth. 
 
our third priority is to build on our 
market leading position in china. at the 
core, we aim to sustain growth above 
the market in ostomy care which will  
constitute a significant share of our 
global ostomy care growth for the 
strategy period. 
 
we will continue to drive value upgrade 
in ostomy care, build our intermittent 
catheter business and expand the 
consumer business with china-specific 
digital solutions. 
beyond china, our stance on emerging 
markets is to focus on the large core 
markets, build on our e-commerce 
business and secure intermittent 
catheters reimbursement in new 
markets. market access is key in 
emerging markets to establish our 
categories in new markets and improve 
funding in existing markets. the 
ambition for emerging markets is to 
deliver double-digit growth. 
 
in europe, we aim to sustain our 
leadership position and continue to 
deliver above market growth. we will 
continue our current path of driving 
growth through our direct businesses 
and investing in market development 
initiatives to drive compliance and 
retention. we still see many pockets of 
growth in europe. 
 
across markets, we continue to 
leverage coloplast care, our direct 
businesses and digital solutions to get 
closer to users.

chronic care 
strategy and markets    sustainability and people    risk management 
29 
 
chronic care market  
the chronic care business 
the ostomy care and continence care businesses are referred to as chronic care because in most cases the products are used to 
manage chronic conditions. on average, people with a stoma use stoma pouches for about 10 years and users of intermittent 
catheters with a chronic condition use catheters for about 30 years. 
 
common to both segments is that more than 90% of product sales are reimbursed. less than 10% of product sales are made through 
a hospital or clinical setting, which leaves most of the sales in the community, after users have been discharged from a hospital or clinic.  
users tend to be very loyal to products, and in most cases continue using the same product they have been discharged on from the 
hospital or clinic. therefore, the choice of product and sales through a hospital or clinical setting is essential for coloplast. 
 
the chronic care user flow  
coloplast has over the past several years invested in building stronger ties with end users and embarked on a journey of becoming a 
consumer healthcare company, offering not only the most innovative products, but also supporting services to users through the 
coloplast care programme. the programme provides knowledge and support around living life with incontinence or a stoma. 
 
coloplast maintains a database of around two million users currently and offers direct support to end users in more than 30 countries. 
coloplast also sells products directly to end users in its top five markets; the us, the uk, france, germany and china, ensuring end 
users have access to the most innovative products in the market and providing a good service. 
 
ostomy care  
a stoma is created in an operation necessary in case of intestinal dysfunction due to a disease, an accident or a congenital disorder. 
part of the intestine is surgically redirected through an opening in the abdominal wall, enabling the patient to empty the colon 
(colostomy), small intestine (ileostomy) or urinary bladder (urostomy). 50-60% of stoma operations are performed as a consequence of 
cancer. 
 
ostomy bags consist either of an adhesive base plate bonded together with a bag (1-piece system) or of two separate parts in which 
the bag is replaced more often than the base plate (2-piece system). it is important for users to avoid leakage and skin irritation, so 
they can live as normal a life as possible. as a result, the adhesive must ensure a constant and secure seal, and it must be easy to 
remove without causing damage or irritation to the skin. to ensure a personalised fit, users also turn to supporting products. 
 
continence care 
this business area addresses two types of continence control issues: people unable to empty their bladder or bowel, and people 
suffering from urinary or faecal incontinence. people unable to empty their bladder can use an intermittent catheter, which is inserted 
through the urethra of the urinary tract to empty the bladder. the main group of users of intermittent catheters are people with a 
spinal cord injury that very often is the result of an accident. other user groups are people with multiple sclerosis and people with 
congenital spina bifida. coloplast's portfolio of intermittent catheters spans the full range from uncoated catheters to discreet, compact 
and ready to use, coated in a saline solution, catheters. 
 
urinary incontinence means that a person has lost the ability to hold urine, resulting in uncontrolled or involuntary release, which is also 
called stress urinary incontinence. incontinence affects older people more often than younger people because the sphincter muscle 
and the pelvic muscles gradually weaken as people grow older. coloplast has a wide range of urine bags and urisheaths for capturing 
and storing urine. this is a segment with many suppliers, including low-cost providers. 
 
people suffering from bowel or sphincter muscle dysfunction can use the peristeen® anal irrigation system for controlled emptying of 
the bowels. a typical peristeen user has a spinal cord injury and has therefore lost the ability to control bowel movements.

strive25: drive growth 
with 3dfit technology 
our view is that we have a stronger 
starting point for our wound & skin care 
business than we have ever had, and 
our aim is to deliver growth above the 
market and expand margins. 
we will continue to focus on the fast-
growing silicone category with our 
biatain® silicone portfolio with 3dfit 
technology, which is our point of 
differentiation. 
 
as with chronic care, two individual 
markets really matter – china and the 
us – and we will structure for success in 
these markets to deliver on the global 
ambition and strategy. 
 
in china, we will scale our business by 
strengthening our commercial 
foundation and building a stronger 
position in the silicone market. 
 
in the us, we will scale our business in 
the hospital channel with 3dfit 
technology and maximise the 
commercial potential of our skin care 
portfolio. 
 
in europe, we will build on the 
momentum we have created with 3dfit 
technology and aim to take market 
leadership positions. 
 
in emerging markets, we will accelerate 
growth in key markets by investing in 
selected markets. 
 
we must deliver innovations and strong 
life cycle management to the markets 
we want to grow in. 
key highlights 2020/21 
 
during the year, we drove solid market 
share gains in the two market segments 
we are focused on – silicone foams and 
gelling fibres, especially in europe. 
 
the biatain silicone portfolio posted 
solid growth above the market and 
 
 
biatain silicone 
coloplast is now the third largest player 
in the silicone foams market in europe. 
 
coloplast entered the gelling fibre 
market this year with the launch of 
biatain fiber, an absorbent fibre 
dressing used to reduce exudate pooling 
in exuding wounds. the portfolio has 
been launched in nine markets and has 
been well received, especially in 
germany and france. 
 
 
wound & skin care 
wound & skin care market 
in wound care, patients are treated for chronic wounds such as leg ulcers, which are 
typically caused by insufficient or impaired circulation in the veins of the leg, pressure 
ulcers caused by extended bed rest, or diabetic foot ulcers. most chronic wounds 
contain exudate, varying from small amounts to high levels. 
 
a good wound dressing should provide optimum conditions for wound healing, is easy 
for healthcare professionals to change, and should ensure that patients are not 
inconvenienced by exudate, liquid or odours. a moist wound environment provides 
the best conditions for wound healing for optimum exudate absorption.  
 
the coloplast product portfolio consists of advanced foam dressings sold under the 
biatain silicone with 3dfit technology and biatain brand and hydrocolloid dressings 
sold under the comfeel® brand. 
 
coloplast's skin care products consist of disinfectant liquids or creams used to protect 
and treat the skin and clean wounds. for the treatment and prevention of skin fold 
problems such as fungal infections, damaged skin or odour nuisance, coloplast sells 
interdry®, a textile placed in a skin fold to absorb moisture. coloplast mostly sells skin 
care products to hospitals and clinics in the us and canadian markets.

strive25: on the move 
for patients 
interventional urology represents an 
important growth opportunity for the 
group in line with the conclusions from 
our strategic review concluded in 2019. 
 
interventional urology transforms life 
for patients suffering from urological 
conditions by advancing interventional 
treatment solutions.  
 
the base case for the business is to 
deliver high single digit organic growth 
and sustain strong profitability. 
 
on the portfolio side, we will increase 
our investments into enhancing our core 
businesses by substantially increasing 
our investments in r&d. 
 
we will actively pursue m&a and 
distribution agreements in high-growth 
adjacent segments. 
 
we also see good organic opportunities 
in working with the existing portfolio in 
new geographies. 
 
in north america, we currently mainly 
sell implantable devices. during the 
strategy period, we will drive our global 
market share in endourology by 
launching the portfolio to the us. 
 
in europe, we will focus on driving 
growth in men’s health through patient 
education and endourology growth 
through portfolio expansion. 
 
finally, we will look into expanding our 
presence in emerging markets in a 
select number of high potential 
countries. 
key highlights 2020/21 
during the year, coloplast took the first 
steps towards expanding the 
endourology business in the us, through 
the launch of the product portfolio and 
investments into a specialised sales 
force. 
 
as part of the strategy to pursue m&a 
in adjacent segments, coloplast made 
two investments during 2020/21.  
 
in november 2020, coloplast acquired 
nine continents medical, an early-stage 
company pioneering an implantable 
tibial nerve stimulation treatment for 
over-active bladder. a pivotal study in 
the us is expected to be initiated before 
the end of 2021. 
 
in september 2021, coloplast 
participated in the series b financing of 
francis medical, an early-stage 
company working on a water vapor 
treatment for prostate cancer. 
coloplast’s stake in francis medical is 
around 13%.

our position on plastic 
as a manufacturer of medical products 
made of plastic, coloplast has a 
responsibility and has clear priorities; 
 
 
product safety and clinical 
performance cannot be 
compromised. 
 
single use products are the easiest 
and safest option for our users. 
 
sustainability should be easy for our 
users. 
 
we need to identify new materials 
and support the development of 
new technologies. 
 
partnerships across the industry are 
essential. 
 
read the full position on plastic on our 
website. 
 
our substance position 
in 2020/21, coloplast developed a 
position on substances to make its 
ambitions clear: 
 
 
all coloplast products are 
biocompatible and safe for the 
intended purpose. 
 
coloplast is mindful when selecting 
materials and substances used in its 
products and complies with 
international and local regulations 
and standards, including reach and 
the california proposition 65 list. 
 
coloplast monitors regulations, 
science and technology to identify 
opportunities and risks to proactively 
substitute substances if needed.

our website. 
business ambition for 
1.5°c 
in 2020/21, coloplast committed to the 
business ambition for 1.5°c, aligning 
with the paris agreement and have 
submitted our scope 1, 2 and 3 emission 
reduction ambitions to the science-
based targets initiative (sbti) for 
validation. our ambition is to become 
net-zero in scope 1 and 2 and use 
100% renewable energy by 2025 and 
by 2030, coloplast aims to reduce 50% 
scope 3 emissions per product. 
during 2020/21, coloplast performed 
an emission screening to map all value 
chain activities. in additionally, coloplast 
reached out to 50 of its raw material 
suppliers responsible for 70% of its 
scope 3 emissions from raw materials to 
improve data quality. 
 
our supplier ambitions 
during 2020/21, coloplast developed a 
new supplier sustainability programme 
to map its supply chain impact within 
direct and indirect suppliers. this 
includes an evaluation of suppliers’ 
sustainability practices. coloplast 
developed a materiality assessment to 
identify which suppliers are exposed to 
sustainability risks e.g. violating human 
rights, environmental laws, health and 
safety or ethical standards. 
 
next year, coloplast will initiate a pilot 
to verify the materiality assessment and 
evaluation process in order to develop 
and design the final programme. by 
2025, coloplast aims to address 100% 
of its direct and indirect suppliers in tier 
one through the supplier sustainability 
programme.

as a manufacturer of medical products 
made primarily of plastic, coloplast 
embraces the responsibility to 
contribute to solving the problems with 
plastic waste and wants to support the 
un sustainable development goal 
(sdg) 12 on responsible production and 
consumption. however, within 
healthcare there are distinct clinical and 
regulatory limitations to reducing plastic 
waste. 
 
coloplast users depend on coloplast 
products to live the life they want and 
are increasingly concerned about 
environmental impacts. 
 
coloplast incorporates environmental 
performance when developing new 
products, but we can do better in 
designing our products and packaging 
to be recyclable and made of renewable 
materials (such as recycled or biobased) 
with less environmental impact. 
 
renewable and 
recyclable packaging 
while there are strict limitations on our 
products, there are more possibilities 
when it comes to packaging. for our 
products currently on the market, we 
have initiated packaging projects with 
the ambition of providing our users with 
90% recyclable packaging and 80% 
packaging consisting of renewable 
materials by 2025. our secondary and 
tertiary packaging material, such as 
retail and shipper boxes, are already 
consisting of renewable materials and 
are recyclable. most of these come from 
sustainable forestry. 
 
 
in 2020/21, we have focused our efforts 
on primary packaging, which is part of 
the product. we have carried out 
internal investigations to find recyclable 
solutions for converting multilayer foil 
packaging which helps to hold the saline 
solution in intermittent catheters. we 
also launched a project to convert virgin 
pet plastic trays to recycled pet plastic 
trays used in ostomy protective seals 
and baseplates within our supporting 
product portfolio. 
 
applying sustainability 
in innovation 
the primary method used by coloplast 
to address environmental challenges is 
to incorporate eco-design principles 
when developing new products. 
 
waste recycling 
during 2020/21, a new pilot project in 
hungary led to a breakthrough in 
coloplast’s waste recycling resulting in 
58% of production waste being recycled 
– and exceeding our previously set 
ambition of 50% in 2025. 
 
the recycled waste is used by a local 
waste handling company in producing 
rubber flooring for sports fields, railway 
systems, riding halls, building insulation 
and kindergartens. 
 
as coloplast is committed to making 
further improvements, and as we have 
already achieved our previous 2025 
ambition, we have set a new ambition of 
increasing our recycling rate to 75% by 
2025.

using energy from 
renewable sources 
with the strive25 strategy, coloplast 
aims to use 100% renewable energy by 
2025. our plan is to procure electricity 
from renewable sources and phase out 
the use of natural gas. coloplast has 
committed to investing approximately 
dkk 100 million in capex to achieve 
this ambition. 
 
climate-related criteria in remuneration 
for executive management will be 
implemented from 2021/22 financial 
year. 
 
coloplast currently covers 100% of 
electricity use with renewable energy, 
effectively reducing our emissions with 
more than 29,000 tonnes co2e. 
coloplast will replace our renewable 
energy certificates covering electricity 
use with power-purchasing agreements 
(ppas) at all global sites that ensures 
additionality by establishing new 
renewable power sources on coloplast’s 
request. in 2020/21, we have been in 
dialogue with renewable energy 
suppliers globally and have initiated a 
project to install solar panels on the roof 
of our minneapolis site in the us. our 
new site in costa rica is already using 
100% renewable electricity from the 
grid. 
 
during 2020/21, we have investigated 
scenarios for phasing out natural gas at 
our global sites focusing on denmark, 
hungary and the us. we are currently 
working with engineering consultants to 
have the technical plans finalised and 
ready for implementation in 2021/22. 
 
 
electric company cars 
coloplast operates a car fleet consisting 
of around 2,000 cars, which emitted 
11,500 tonnes co2e in 2020/21. to 
reduce its impact, coloplast will shift to 
electric company cars with an ambition 
of 100% by 2030 and 50% by 2025. 
 
reducing scope 3 
emissions 
out of the total scope 3 emissions, 67% 
of coloplast’s scope 3 emissions are 
from raw materials. therefore, in 
2020/21, coloplast initiated an 
engagement with 50 of its raw material 
suppliers responsible for 70% of the raw 
material emissions to start a dialogue 
about identifying materials with a lower 
environmental footprint and to get more 
detailed emission data from the 
suppliers. 
 
we will continue to increase our 
engagement with direct and indirect 
suppliers across the value chain. in 
2020/21, coloplast reduced scope 3 
emissions by 10% per product. this was 
mainly due to using less air freight for 
the transportation of goods such as 
shipping items from our production site 
in hungary to china using rail transport. 
additionally, due to covid-19, our 
business travel was significantly 
reduced.

evolving how we lead 
during 2020/21 as a first priority, to 
enable strong execution of our strive25 
strategy, coloplast introduced our new 
leadership promise which builds on our 
existing strong purpose-driven company 
culture: we aim high, we simplify, we 
empower, and we are inclusive. this 
year, our focus has been on making our 
leadership promise come alive through 
our leaders. all our senior leaders (vp+) 
are going through an extensive leader-
ship journey. we also continue to run 
our business leadership programme for 
our director level leaders. 
 
to secure strong leadership focus, we 
track progress on two key metrics: 
employee engagement and voluntary 
employee turnover. 
 
employee engagement 
coloplast tracks employee engagement 
twice a year. despite the continued 
interference from covid-19, coloplast 
sees a highly engaged workforce. 
 
during 2020/21, the engagement score 
was 8.2 compared to 7.9 in 2019/20, 
with a response rate of 90%. the score 
is above the healthcare industry 
benchmark and places coloplast in the 
top 25th percentile. 
 
employee turnover 
voluntary turnover level in 2020/21 
reached 10.1%, compared to 8.2% in 
2019/20, which, however, is still below 
the pre-covid-19 level. coloplast has 
seen a positive effect on voluntary 
turnover rates during covid-19. 
flexible working and 
safety 
covid-19 has had far-reaching 
consequences for our daily lives and 
ways of working together. coloplast 
quickly adapted its ways of working, its 
processes, and digital platforms to 
support a home office set-up. coloplast 
has now launched an updated global 
position on flexible working to stay an 
attractive, inclusive and modern 
workplace. 
 
providing a safe and healthy work 
environment for our employees is a core 
value for coloplast. safety is 
everybody’s responsibility in coloplast - 
both managers and employees. 
 
this year, coloplast’s lost-time injury 
frequency was 2.2 ppm. coloplast has 
thereby achieved the ambition to 
reduce the lti frequency to 2.8 ppm by 
2021. the ambition is to be 2.0 ppm by 
2025. 
 
talent for future 
attracting and developing talent is a 
core element of ensuring coloplast has 
the best people for the future. we hire 
for careers, not just jobs, which means 
that we mobilise and develop talent to 
secure strong succession for critical 
managerial positions.  
 
this year, 59% of critical managerial 
positions were filled by internal 
candidates. this is below our 67% 
aspiration as we have taken in external 
talent in key leadership positions.

coloplast prohibits any kind of dis-
crimination or harassment of employees 
due to their gender identity, age, race, 
ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, 
religious belief, social and economic 
background, physical or mental ability 
etc. this is formalised in our inclusion & 
diversity policy, anti-harassment and 
anti-discrimination policy as well as the 
anti-retaliation policy which are 
available on our website. 
 
diverse teams 
we believe that diversity in teams leads 
to better innovation, performance and 
decisions. therefore, we have chosen to 
lead and drive diversity through teams 
and strive to ensure a healthy balance 
of gender, generation and nationality in 
each team. to increase the share of 
diverse teams, we track and monitor the 
mix of diversity in all teams from the 
director level and above. it is coloplast’s 
ambition to reach a share of 75% 
diverse teams before 2025 through 
natural turnover. in 2020/21, the share 
of diverse teams was 50%, compared to 
51% in 2019/20. over the past two 
years, vps and above have made five-
year action plans for how to create 
diverse teams within their area of 
responsibility. this year, our director 
level leaders will also create plans to 
meet our ambition. successful diverse 
teams only flourish if we lead inclusively 
– we, therefore offer unconscious bias 
e-learning to all and inclusive leadership 
training to our leaders. 
 
gender representation 
in management 
coloplast continues to track and 
monitor progress on gender 
representation at all levels. during 
2020/21, coloplast signed the 
confederation of danish industry’s 
gender diversity pledge, committing to 
a target of 40/60 gender distribution in 
management and our board of directors 
by 2030. in 2020/21, coloplast had 
46% female managers at or above 
manager level from 43% last year. 
however, looking at senior leadership* 
alone, there is an underrepresentation 
of females. this year, the share of 
female senior leaders is 24%, which is 
the same as last year. to ensure 
progress on gender representation, as 
well as diversity, coloplast has 
implemented different initiatives 
including monitoring the diversity in our 
succession pipelines and talent pools, a 
new global recruitment process that 
mitigates biases and ensures diversity in 
all our recruitments and engagement in 
multiple diversity related events, boards 
and partnerships globally.

risk reporting process 
and governance 
the management of the individual 
business units and group functions is 
responsible for identifying, assessing and 
managing risks in their specific parts of 
the organisation. the most significant 
risks to our business over a five-year 
horizon are reported quarterly to group 
risk management. the reporting 
process and supporting interviews form 
the basis of the quarterly risk update 
submitted to the executive leadership 
team and the board of directors.
the executive leadership team is 
responsible for defining coloplast’s 
overall risk profile, and for setting 
standards for risk taking and for aligning 
it with the overall strategies and policies. 
the executive leadership team is also 
responsible for launching and approving 
activities to address the most significant 
risks. 
 
the board of directors monitors the 
overall risk landscape and reviews, on a 
quarterly basis, the conclusions and 
recommendations submitted by the 
executive leadership team. 
in our risk reporting, we have identified 
a range of significant risks believed to 
have the potential to threaten and 
adversely impact the group’s business 
model, strategy, and future 
performance. 
 
those risks are categorised and 
described on the following pages, along 
with examples of action taken to 
mitigate them. each risk is linked to one 
or more of the themes of coloplast’s 
strategy strive25. 
 
coloplast’s most significant risk 
categories are largely unchanged as to 
impact and likelihood assessment 
compared to last year.

legal and compliance 
risk description 
coloplast operates in a heavily 
regulated industry that is subject to 
various laws and regulations across 
geographies and business areas. the 
different legal environments can be 
unpredictable and politically motivated, 
and as a market leader, coloplast could 
face legal risks at any given time. in 
addition, there is growing public 
awareness of business ethics, 
enforcement of anti-corruption laws and 
protection of personal data. it is at the 
heart of coloplast’s culture to act with 
respect and responsibility and to comply 
with the laws and regulations. despite 
these efforts, coloplast recognises that 
mistakes may happen when people are 
involved and, therefore, takes relevant 
action should a situation arise. 
 
risk examples 
violations of anti-corruption laws and 
non-compliance with coloplast’s own 
and the industry’s codes of conduct 
could damage coloplast’s reputation 
and involve a risk of monetary fines. 
 
lawsuits filed by competitors or 
customers or investigations by 
authorities into certain business 
practices could have a negative 
reputational and financial impact. 
 
risk response 
ensuring that all employees receive 
training in coloplast’s code of conduct 
(best) which also include training in the 
company’s it policies. currently 99% of 
all white collar are trained. 
 
ensuring that business partners are 
aware of coloplast’s ethical standards 
including our codes of conduct for 
distributors and suppliers and that they 
work with us to continuously maintain 
and develop compliance practices. 
 
we have established an independent 
and confidential ethics hotline for 
reporting of unethical situations, 
violations, and misconduct. 
climate related risks 
in 2020/21, coloplast committed to report step-by-step 
according to the task force on climate-related financial 
disclosures (tcfd) framework. coloplast signed the 
business ambition for 1.5°c, aligning with the paris 
agreement and submitted climate targets to the science-
based targets initiative (sbti) for validation. the aim is to 
become net zero in scope 1 and 2 by 2025 and reduce 
scope 3 emissions per product by 50% by 2030. 
 
based on a preliminary climate risk assessment, physical 
risks such as rising water levels at coloplast facilities and 
extreme weather patterns affecting supply chain were 
identified. transitional risks such as demand for more 
sustainable products and packaging and further legal 
requirements with focus on esg (environmental, social and 
governance) for supply chain were also identified. 
 
going forward, climate-related risks and opportunities will 
be aligned with the business, strategy, and financial 
planning based on scenario analysis for reporting. climate-
related criteria in remuneration for executive management 
will be implemented from 2021/22 financial year. 
cyber-related risks 
coloplast follow the iso 27001 to constantly drive 
improvement and validate performance of the information 
security management system through audits and risk 
management. coloplast received the initial iso 27001 
certification in october 2017 and added two manufacturing 
sites to our 2020 recertification. all certified sites are 
internally audited annually in addition to the external audits 
as required under the certification. 
 
there is a robust information security risk management 
process to identify, assess, report, and mitigate risks with a 
direct link to the quarterly group risk reporting process. 
confidence in our internal organisational and technical 
controls are enhanced by external security assessments. 
 
coloplast do annual test and review of iso 27001-certified 
it contingency plans, investments in it security and risk 
transfer solutions. 
 
coloplast ambition is to continuously raise our information 
security maturity in parallel to ensuring cyber resilient 
capabilities within it service and business continuity.

pricing and reimbursement 
description 
a large part of coloplast’s products is 
sold in markets that are subsidised and 
eligible for reimbursement from local 
health care authorities. as a result, the 
prices of coloplast’s products are 
influenced by the economic and political 
developments in national markets, 
budgetary constraints of governments 
and health care reforms, bargaining 
power of large wholesalers and 
distributors, as well as coloplast’s ability 
to convince buyers of the economic 
value of its products based on clinical 
evidence, costs, and patient outcomes. 
 
risk examples 
lower reimbursements and increasing 
price pressure due to healthcare and 
price reforms. no bigger healthcare 
reforms are currently expected for the 
next fiscal year 2021/22, and global 
price erosion remain up to 1% per year. 
 
lack of or inadequate clinical evidence 
to support reimbursement levels. 
 
global or local political and economic 
matters, such as interest rate or 
currency volatility. 
 
risk response 
monitoring economic and political 
developments, and changes to public 
sector guidelines and reimbursement 
schemes.  
 
interaction with health care authorities, 
patient associations and industry 
associations to try to prevent, postpone 
or minimise the impact.  
 
financial risk management, including 
hedging in accordance with coloplast’s 
financial mandate (see note 22 and 23 
to the financial statements). 
 
product quality and safety 
description 
coloplast is committed to ensuring the 
quality of its products and the safety of 
its users, including organising the 
security of personal data. all coloplast 
products must comply with the medical 
device directives and legislation imposed 
by local health care authorities, such as 
the us food and drug administration 
(fda) and the new eu medical device 
regulation (mdr). 
 
coloplast has successfully passed the 
first key milestone of may 2021, 
including received the first mdr 
certificate and are working towards 
having all products gradually certified in 
accordance with the transition period 
authorized by mdr. 
 
risk examples 
loss of licences to sell or manufacture 
due to non-compliance with new laws 
and regulations on medical devices in 
force from time to time. 
 
defects and omissions and critical 
product quality and safety issues in 
product design and manufacturing that 
could disrupt operations, sales, lead to 
product recalls, bodily injury, and 
product liability claims. 
 
non-compliance with data protection 
legislation or personal data leaks that 
could lead to monetary fines and 
damage coloplast’s reputation. 
 
risk response 
ensuring that coloplast continuously 
develops and improves its control 
processes and quality procedures, from 
the design phase to post-market 
surveillance. 
 
monitoring legislation and market 
standards to ensure that any 
amendments or changes are 
incorporated into internal procedures. 
 
certification of our quality management 
systems to the national and 
international standards and carrying out 
internal and external audits.

product innovation and development 
description 
it is essential that coloplast maintains a 
competitive and innovative product 
pipeline that meets the needs of the 
users. to achieve this, coloplast relies 
on its ability to interact with end users 
and health care professionals, to protect 
intellectual property against 
infringement from competitors and to 
understand the surgical and medical 
trends that may impact or limit sales. 
 
risk example 
medical and technological innovations 
disrupting coloplast’s core business. 
 
lack of innovation increasingly resulting 
in a commoditisation trend, allowing the 
entry of low-cost competitors, 
potentially increasing price pressures 
and diminishing clinical differentiation of 
the products on the market and 
resulting in a loss of market share. 
 
infringement of intellectual property 
rights may reduce coloplast’s 
competitive advantages and negatively 
impact sales. 
 
risk response 
investing in new innovative growth 
initiatives for the purpose of developing 
superior and clinically differentiated 
products, such as our clinical 
performance programme. 
 
patenting to prevent competitors from 
copying coloplast products or from 
producing technical equivalent 
alternatives. 
 
monitoring surgical and medical 
developments and disruptive 
technologies that may impact the 
various business areas. 
 
production and business continuity 
description 
coloplast operates facilities all over the 
world, the most recent addition being 
the establishment of manufacturing 
facilities in costa rica. most production 
takes place at central facilities and in 
some cases, coloplast purchases raw 
materials and components used in 
production from sole suppliers for 
reasons of availability, quality assurance 
and cost effectiveness. 
 
the pandemic, high demand in asia, and 
supply disruptions in europe and the us 
have led to a bullwhip effect on global 
demand that is impacting global raw 
material prices. coloplast already have 
risk responses in place (as described to 
the right). in addition, we have increased 
our focus on the timely communication 
of forecasts and orders and on 
execution of improvement projects in 
gop5. 
 
risk example 
major disruption at a manufacturing or 
distribution facility due to natural 
disasters or other emergencies, such as 
fire and pandemics, may disrupt 
coloplast’s ability to manufacture and 
distribute its products. 
 
a major disruption of the supply chain 
due to force majeure situations, change 
in market conditions, strikes or other 
events beyond coloplast’s control, 
which could result in, price increases, 
inability to source critical raw materials 
and the disruption of the supply to 
customers. 
 
risk response 
implemented emergency response and 
contingency plans, keeping critical 
processes and workflows physically 
separated and having all the relevant 
facilities certified to the ‘highly-
protected risk’ industry standards. 
 
identified high-risk suppliers and 
prepared contingency plans, including 
maintaining multiple inventories, dual 
supplier qualification for raw materials, 
and qualification of substitute materials 
where applicable. 
 
built up additional inventory as a 
contingency for potential fluctuations in 
demand or supply chain disruptions. 
governance & ownership 
corporate governance 
 
42 
 
governance structure 
coloplast has a two-tier management 
structure comprising the board of

the board of directors and the 
executive leadership team further 
assess the company’s business 
processes, the definition and 
implementation of the mission, the 
organisation, stakeholder relations, 
strategy, risks, business objectives and 
controls.

assessment of the work 
performed by the board 
of directors 
every year, the board of directors 
conducts a self-assessment. based on 
the result of this assessment, the 
organisation and efficiency of the board 
of directors' work are discussed at a 
board meeting. 
 
in 2021, the annual self-assessment of 
the board of directors was performed 
without external assistance as the 
board of directors has decided that the 
self-assessment will be carried out with 
external support every second year. the 
self-assessment consisted of 
conversations between the chairman of 
the board of directors and each board 
member as well as each member of the 
executive leadership team and a 
bespoke, online questionnaire in which 
board members as well as the executive 
leadership team participated 
anonymously. 
 
the self-assessment shows that there is 
an open and transparent dialogue 
between the board of directors and the 
executive leadership team, and the 
board committees serve as good 
vehicles for framing the discussions in 
the board of directors and ensure that 
key risks are addressed. 
 
furthermore, the self-assessment shows 
that the composition of the board of 
directors, including relevant 
competencies, to a large extent 
matches what the board of directors 
considers necessary to best perform its 
tasks, such as finance, digital 
transformation, customer experience, 
commercialisation, industry knowledge, 
general management, innovation, legal 
affairs and acquisitions. however, over 
time the board would like strengthen its 
competences within innovation in light 
of the new strategy. 
 
during the past year, the board of 
directors has spent a significant amount 
of time discussing and addressing 
challenges caused by covid-19. 
furthermore, the board of directors has 
monitored and discussed the progress 
made one year into coloplast’s strive25 
strategy which was announced to the 
market on 29 september 2020. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clear governance and diverse board profiles ensure that the board of 
directors can operate efficiently and support the company’s strategy.

share classes and 
authorisations 
coloplast’s share capital is dkk 216 
million divided into dkk 18 million a 
shares and dkk 198 million b shares. 
each a and b share has a nominal value 
of dkk 1. 
 
each a share entitles the holders to ten 
votes and each b share entitles the 
holders to one vote. the a shares are 
non-negotiable instruments. the b 
shares are negotiable instruments and 
were listed on the copenhagen stock 
exchange (nasdaq copenhagen) in 
1983. any change of ownership or 
pledging of a shares requires the consent 
of the board of directors, whereas b 
shares are freely negotiable. 
 
the board of directors may increase the 
company's share capital by a nominal 
value of up to dkk 15 million in one or 
more issues of b shares either with or 
without pre-emption rights for existing 
shareholders. the authorisation is valid 
until and including 4 december 2023. 
moreover, the board of directors has 
been authorised to acquire treasury 
shares of up to 10% of the company's 
share capital provided that the 
company’s total holding of treasury 
shares does not exceed 10% of the 
company’s share capital at any time. the 
highest and lowest amount to be paid for 
the shares by the company is the price 
applicable at the time of purchase +/- 
10%. this authorisation is valid until and 
including 4 december 2024. 
 
at general meetings, matters are decided 
by a simple majority of votes. resolutions 
to amend the company's articles of 
association require that not less than half 
of the share capital is represented and 
that the resolution is adopted by not less 
than two-thirds of the votes cast as well 
as of the voting share capital represented 
at the general meeting. the resolution 
lapses if the above-mentioned share 
capital is not represented, or if a 
resolution is not adopted by two-thirds of 
the votes cast. if a resolution is adopted 
by two-thirds of the votes cast but 
without at least half of the share capital 
being represented, the board of 
directors must convene a new 
extraordinary general meeting within two 
weeks. 
 
if, at this meeting, the resolution is 
adopted by not less than two-thirds of 
the votes cast and of the voting share 
capital represented, it will be passed 
irrespective of the amount of the share 
capital represented at the meeting. 
 
in the event of a change of control in the 
company resulting from a change of 
ownership, issued share options will be 
subject to accelerated vesting. no other 
important agreements are in place that 
would be affected in the event of a 
change of control of the company 
resulting from a takeover, and no special 
agreements have been made between 
the company, its management or 
employees if their positions are 
discontinued due to a change of 
ownership. there are no special 
provisions governing the election of 
members to coloplast's board of 
directors.

basis of preparation 
the consolidated financial statements for 2020/2021 have been prepared in accordance with the international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and additional disclosure requirements pursuant to the danish financial 
statements act for class d companies. 
 
general information 
the annual report has been prepared on the basis of the historical cost principle, modified in that certain financial assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value. subsequent to initial recognition, the assets and liabilities are measured as described below 
in respect of each individual item or in the relevant note. 
 
significant estimates and judgements 
in connection with the practical use of the accounting policies described, it may be necessary for management to make 
estimates in respect of the accounting items. the estimates and assumptions applied are based on historical experience and 
other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances, but which are inherently uncertain and 
unpredictable. such assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected events or circumstances may arise. in 
addition, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual outcomes to deviate from these estimates. 
 
it may be necessary to change previous estimates as a result of changes to the assumptions on which the estimates were based 
or due to new information or subsequent events. 
 
a further description of the principal accounting estimates and judgements is provided in the relevant notes.

changes in accounting policies 
effective from the 2020/21 financial year, the coloplast group has implemented all new, updated or amended international 
financial reporting standards and interpretations (ifrss) as issued by the iasb and ifrss adopted by the eu that are effective 
for the 2020/21 financial year. 
 
coloplast has adopted the amendments to ifrs 3. the amendments narrow and clarify the definition of a business and permit a 
simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a group of assets rather than a business 
(concentration test). the amendments are applied prospectively to all business combinations and asset acquisitions with an 
acquisition date on or after 1 october 2020. 
 
the implementation of new, updated or amended international financial reporting standards and interpretations (ifrss and 
ifrics) did not, in all material respects, affect the financial statements. 
 
new financial reporting standards to be adopted 
new and amended standards are implemented when taking effect. 
 
coloplast has made an initial assessment of the impact of the agenda decision in relation to cloud computing arrangement. 
based on the initial assessment, this decision is not expected to have a significant impact on the profit/loss statement or equity. 
a final assessment is expected to be conducted in q1 2021/22. 
 
reporting standards or interpretations which are not adopted by the eu have not been applied in this annual report.

general accounting policies 
this section provides a summary of significant accounting policies, and other general accounting policies. a detailed description 
of the accounting policies applied and the estimates made relative to each individual item is provided in relevant notes, such that 
all information about a specific accounting item can be found there. 
 
foreign currency 
the financial statement items of individual group entities are measured in the currency used in the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). the consolidated financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner (dkk), which is the functional and presentation currency of the parent company. other currencies are considered foreign 
currencies. 
 
translation of foreign currencies 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into an entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the transaction date. 
 
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
exchange adjustments arising as the difference between exchange rates at the balance sheet date and exchange rates at the 
transaction date of monetary items are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. 
 
on translation of entities with a functional currency other than dkk, balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates at 
the balance sheet date and income statement items are translated at the exchange rates at the transaction date. the resulting 
exchange adjustments are taken directly to other comprehensive income. 
 
the argentinian economy has been considered a hyperinflation economy effective from 1 july 2018. accordingly, the group’s 
argentinian subsidiary is recognised in accordance with ias 29. the subsidiary’s financial statements were inflation adjusted at a 
retail price index increase of 60.5% (source: bloomberg) prior to recognition in the consolidated financial statements. the 
income statement and the balance sheet of the inflation-adjusted financial statements are included in the consolidated financial 
statements at the exchange rate applying at the balance sheet date standing at 6.49. 
 
consolidation, business combinations and associates 
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of coloplast a/s (the parent company) and enterprises 
(subsidiaries) controlled by the parent company. the parent company is considered to exercise control when it has power over 
the relevant activities of the enterprise, is exposed or has rights to a variable return from the investment and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power. 
 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared by aggregating the financial statements of the parent company and the 
individual subsidiaries, all of which are prepared in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. intra-group transactions, 
balances, dividends and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. 
 
enterprises, which are not subsidiaries but in which the group holds at least 20% of the voting rights or otherwise exerts a 
significant influence, are regarded as associates. the group’s proportionate share of unrealised gains and losses on transactions 
between the coloplast group and associates is eliminated. 
 
enterprises recently acquired or divested are included in the consolidation in the period in which the coloplast group has control 
of the enterprise. comparative figures are not restated to reflect acquisitions. divested activities are shown separately as 
discontinued operations. 
 
consolidated financial statements

note 3, continued 
 
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method, according to which the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of enterprises acquired are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
 
goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries or associates is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration and the fair value of the group companies’ proportionate share of identifiable assets less liabilities and contingent 
liabilities at the date of acquisition. 
 
the consideration for an enterprise consists of the fair value of the agreed consideration for the acquired enterprise. if part of 
the consideration is contingent on future events, such part is recognised at its fair value at the date of acquisition. costs directly 
attributable to business combinations are recognised directly in the income statement as administrative expenses when 
incurred. 
 
in cases where the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities subsequently turns out to differ from 
the values calculated at the date of acquisition, the calculation, including goodwill is adjusted until up to 12 months after the 
date of acquisition. subsequently, goodwill is not adjusted. changes to the estimates of contingent consideration are generally 
recognised in the income statement. 
 
goodwill arising in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised in the balance sheet under intangible assets in the 
consolidated financial statements and tested annually for impairment. 
 
revenue 
revenue comprises income from the sale of goods after deduction of any price reductions, quantity discounts or cash discounts. 
sales transactions are recognised in the income statement at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the 
customer, and when the consideration is assessed to be collectible. revenues from sales transactions are measured at the 
amount of consideration to which coloplast expects to be entitled. 
 
within all segments, revenues are typically recognised when the customer takes possession of the goods. exceptions to this 
comprise urology care revenues, as revenues from certain surgical products are generated from consignment sales as well as 
the contract manufacturing business. certain surgical products within urology care are always available at our partner hospitals 
to ensure that all sizes and fits are always available. revenues from consignment sales are recognised as the goods are used (i.e. 
in surgery). revenues from contract manufacturing business is recognised when the products are available for delivery when 
this coincides with the transfer of control of the products. 
 
coloplast generates most of its sales through distributors that operate under various conditions and who for that reason require 
varying sales agreements. coloplast’s distributor agreements contain volume and product-specific rebates, which require data 
management and monitoring of sales to individual distributors at the product level. in addition, the sales agreements contain 
various right-of-product-return requirements. 
 
payment terms for trade receivables from customers depend on creditworthiness, customary business practices and contract 
negotiations. payment terms for some customers include a period of credit which commences when the products are shipped 
while other customers are requested to pay in advance or provide appropriate collateral for the payment. prepayments from 
customers are recognised as revenue in the following period upon satisfying the performance obligations. 
 
variable considerations include volume and product-specific rebates which, for some markets, are accumulated and paid 
annually or quarterly. accruals for variable considerations are constrained by uncertainty of future events, such as the expected 
volume of sales, and require significant judgement.

revenue is measured at the fair value of the agreed consideration. all discounts granted are recognised in revenue. an estimate 
of expected returns is also recognised in revenue. 
 
coloplast has chosen to adopt the practical expedient in ifrs 15, para 63 associated with the determination of whether a 
significant financing component exists for transactions where payment is expected in less than 12 months from the delivery of 
goods (transfer of control). 
 
marketable securities 
marketable securities are part of a portfolio which is managed and measured on a fair value basis as per transaction date. 
adjustments to fair value is recognised through profit or loss as financial items. 
 
bonds forming part of repo transactions, i.e. the sale of bonds that are bought back at a later date remain classified as financial 
assets in the balance sheet, while amounts received from repo transactions are recognised as repo debt. returns on such bonds 
are recognised under financials. 
 
cash flow statement  
the consolidated cash flow statement, which is presented according to the indirect method, shows the group’s cash flow from 
operating, investing and financing activities as well as the group’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt to credit 
institutions at the beginning and end of the year. cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and debt to credit institutions 
recognised under current assets and current liabilities, respectively. marketable securities include bonds with maturities of more 
than three months and are recognised under investing activities. 
 
reporting under the esef regulation 
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the european single electronic format (esef regulation) has 
introduced a single electronic reporting format for the annual financial reports of issuers with securities listed on the eu 
regulated markets. 
 
the esef regulation sets out the following main requirements: (1) issuers shall draw up and disclose their annual financial 
reports using the xhtml format; and (2) issuers that draw-up their primary consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with ifrs as endorsed by the eu shall tag those consolidated financial statements using inline extensible business reporting 
language (ixbrl) and with effect from the 2022 annual report block-tag the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
the combination of the xhtml format with the ixbrl tags makes the annual financial reports both human-readable and 
machine-readable, thus enhancing accessibility, analysis and comparability of the information included in the annual financial 
reports. 
 
ixbrl tags shall comply with the esef taxonomy, which is included in the esef regulation and developed based on the ifrs 
taxonomy published by the ifrs foundation. 
 
as part of the tagging process financial statement line items are marked up to elements in the esef taxonomy. if a financial 
statement line item is not defined in the esef taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy is created. extensions have to be 
anchored to elements in the esef taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals. 
 
the annual report submitted to the danish financial supervisory authority (the officially appointed mechanisms) consists of the 
xhtml document together with some technical files all included in a zip file named coloplast-2021-09-30-da.zip.

segment information 
 
 
segmentation of the income statement 
the operating segment chronic care covers the sale of ostomy care products and continence care products. the operating 
segment interventional urology covers the sale of urological products, including disposable products, as well as r&d activities. 
the operating segment wound & skin care covers the sale of wound & skin care products. the reporting segments are also 
chronic care, interventional urology and wound & skin care. the segmentation reflects the structure of reporting to the 
executive management. 
 
the shared/non-allocated comprises support functions (production units and staff) and eliminations, as these functions do not 
generate revenue. while the costs of r&d for interventional urology are included in the segment operating profit/loss for that 
segment, r&d activities for chronic care and wound & skin care are shared functions which are included in shared/non-
allocated. financial items and income tax are not allocated to the operating segments.

management reviews each operating segment separately, applying their market contributions to earnings and allocating 
resources on that basis. the market contribution is defined as external revenue less the sum of direct production costs, 
distribution, sales and marketing costs and administrative expenses. costs are allocated directly to segments. certain immaterial 
indirect costs are allocated systematically to the shared/non-allocated and the reporting segments. 
notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
the operating segments are defined on the basis of the monthly reporting to the executive management, which is considered the 
senior operational management, and the management structure. reporting to management is based on three operating segments: 
chronic care, interventional urology and wound & skin care. 
 
management does not receive reporting on assets and liabilities by reporting segments. accordingly, the reporting segments are not 
measured in this respect, nor do we allocate resources on this background.

coloplast a/s is jointly taxed with wholly owned danish subsidiaries. the jointly taxed danish enterprises are covered by the danish 
on-account tax scheme. 
 
additions, deductions and allowances relating to the on-account tax scheme are included in financial items. 
 
current tax on the net profit or loss for the year is recognised as an expense in the income statement together with any change in the 
provision for deferred tax. tax on changes in other comprehensive income is taken directly on other comprehensive income.

earnings per share (eps) reflects the ratio between profit for the year and the year’s weighted average of issued, ordinary shares, 
excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held as treasury shares. earnings per share, diluted, is calculated as the net 
profit for the year divided by the average number of outstanding shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding share options in 
the money.

intangible assets 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 accounting policies
intangible assets with a finite life are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. subsequent milestone 
payments related to acquired patents, trademarks and know-how payable on achievement of a contingent event will be capitalised 
when the contingent event is achieved. borrowing costs are recognised as part of cost. amortisation is made on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are: 
 
software 
 
 
 
3 – 5 years 
acquired patents, trademarks and know-how etc. 
 
5 – 15 years 
 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication of 
impairment, while the carrying amount of intangible assets with finite lives, property, plant and equipment and investments measured 
at cost or amortised cost are assessed if there is an indication of impairment. if a write-down is required, the carrying amount is written 
down to the higher of net selling price and value in use. for the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped in the smallest 
group of assets that generates identifiable cash inflows (cash-generating units). the cash-generating units are defined as the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and which are largely independent of cash flows from other assets or groups of 
assets. 
 
for other intangible assets, the amortisation period is determined on the basis of management’s best estimate of the expected 
economic lives of the assets. the expected economic lives are assessed at least annually, and the amortisation period is determined 
based on the latest assessment. for purposes of calculating amortisation, the residual value of the assets is nil, unless a third party has 
committed to purchasing the asset after its use or there is an active market for the asset. with the exception of goodwill and some 
specific trademarks, all intangible assets have a finite life. 
 
all in-house research costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. management believes that mandatory regulatory 
approvals of products, completing the development of new products involves a high degree of uncertainty, for which reason the 
technical feasibility criteria are not considered to have been met. 
 
gains or losses on the disposal of intangible assets are stated as the difference between the selling price less costs to sell and the 
carrying amount at the date of disposal and are included in the income statement under other operating income or other operating 
expenses, respectively. 
 
  key accounting estimates and judgements 
goodwill and other intangible assets: the measurement of intangible assets, including goodwill, could be materially affected by 
significant changes in estimates and assumptions underlying the calculation of values. the carrying amount of intangible assets was 
dkk 3,651 million as at 30 september 2021 (30 september 2020: dkk 2,364 million). 
 
nine continents medical was acquired in a share deal. shortly following the acquisition, all intangible assets was transferred to 
coloplast a/s resulting in us exit taxation. the subsequent transfer of the intangible assets to coloplast a/s is considered an integral 
part of the transaction and, consequently, the tax base in coloplast a/s is considered established upon the acquisition. the transfer is 
considered an integral part of the transaction because not transferring the intangible assets to coloplast a/s with the current tax 
setup of the groups is not a viable solution.

goodwill 
goodwill mainly relates to the acquisitions of mentor's urology and continence business in 2006, mpathy in 2010, comfort 
medical in 2016, lilial in 2018 as well as hope medical and affordable medical in 2021. goodwill from the acquired businesses 
has been allocated on the individual cash-generating units according to earnings at the date of acquisition. the allocation was 
made to the cash-generating units chronic care and interventional urology. 
 
pursuant to ias 36, a goodwill impairment test is performed when there is an indication of impairment, but at least once a year. 
in the impairment test, the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount (value in use) of each cash-generating 
unit, calculated as the discounted expected future cash flows. 
 
future cash flows are determined using forecasts based on realised sales growth, earnings and strategy plans, etc. these 
forecasts are based on specific assumptions for each cash-generating unit during the planning period with respect to sales, 
results of operations, working capital, capital investments and assumptions for cost of capital, inflation and the level of interest 
rates. 
 
growth rates during the terminal period correspond to the expected long-term rate of inflation.

the discount rate for 2020/21 is based on the wacc used by the external analysts’ covering coloplast.   
 
special assumptions applied in impairment tests performed in chronic care 
chronic care consists of the ostomy care and the continence care businesses. the ostomy care business involves the 
production and sale of ostomy pouches and accessories. the continence care business involves the production and sales of 
disposable catheters and various types of products designed for people suffering from urinary or faecal incontinence. 
 
 
consolidated financial statements 
independent auditor’s reports

note 11, continued 
 
the impairment test performed for chronic care was based on forecasts for the 2021/22 financial year. assumptions for 
coloplast’s long-term strategy were applied for the financial years 2022/23 to 2024/25. 
 
revenue growth rates of 6-7% were assumed for the budget period, which are supported by the organic growth rates in recent 
financial years. on the other hand, it was assumed that the gross margin will decrease slightly until the terminal period due to 
anticipated price pressures and health care reforms. it was also assumed that the group’s focus on cost management and 
regular efficiency improvements will ensure that overhead costs will increase at a rate lower than revenue, which will in turn 
produce an annual margin improvement. 
 
the group’s general tax rate was applied in the impairment test for chronic care because these products are sold in all of the 
group’s markets. 
 
working capital invested has been projected using the same growth rate as that for revenue. 
 
special assumptions applied in impairment tests performed in interventional urology 
the interventional urology business consists of the production and sale of products used in surgical procedures in urology and 
gynaecology, including prostate catheters, stents, vaginal slings used to restore continence, mesh products used to treat weak 
pelvic floor and penile implants for men experiencing severe impotence. 
 
the impairment test performed for interventional urology was based on forecasts for the 2021/22 financial year. assumptions 
for the long-term strategy of the urology business were applied for the financial years 2022/23 to 2024/25. 
 
revenue growth rates of 5-9% were assumed for the budget period, which are supported by the interventional urology organic 
growth rates in recent financial years. on the other hand, it was assumed that the gross margin will decrease slightly until the 
terminal period due to general anticipated price pressures and health care reforms. it was also assumed that the group’s focus 
on cost management and regular efficiency improvements will ensure that overhead costs would increase at a rate lower than 
revenue, which will in turn produce an annual margin improvement. 
 
the tax rate applied in the impairment test for interventional urology was higher than the rate applied for the group because 
sales and production mostly take place in the us, which imposes a corporate tax rate higher than the group average. 
 
working capital invested has been projected using the same growth rate as that for revenue. 
 
acquired patents, trademarks and know-how etc. 
acquired patents and trademarks are associated with the acquisition of mentor’s urology business in 2006, the mpathy 
acquisition in 2010 as specified in the table below. coloplast acquired during 2020/21 three small us direct-to-consumer 
durable medical equipment (dme) dealers, hope medical supply, rocky mountain medical supply and affordable medical, llc 
amounted to dkk 50 million, and nine continents medical of dkk 1,218 million, where of the full amount has not been paid in 
cash. in connection with the acquisitions, intangible assets were identified, and the cost was allocated to net assets at fair value 
at the date of acquisition, calculated on the basis of factors such as expected sales and revenue trends. each component is 
amortised over its estimated useful life using the straight line method.

patented and unpatented technologies 
on acquiring mentor’s urology business, coloplast acquired a large number of patented technologies (more than 300) and 
unpatetented technologies. on acquiring mpathy, coloplast acquired about 50 patented technologies. 
 
unpatented technologies include (mentor only): 
 
inventions not patentable/protectable 
 
trade secrets 
 
know-how 
 
confidential information 
 
copyrights on computer software, databases or instruction manuals and the like 
 
most relate to know-how regarding various materials and processes used in production. division of the individual components 
into small intangible assets is not considered material or relevant. 
 
on acquiring nine continents medical in november 2020, coloplast acquired a number of patented and unpatented 
technologies. unpatented technologies include inventions not patentable or protectable, know-how, confidential information 
and copyrights on computer software and the like. most relate to know-how regarding various technologies. division of the 
individual components into small intangible assets is not considered material or relevant. 
 
trademarks 
in addition to patented and unpatented technologies, coloplast acquired a large number (more than 150) of registered and 
unregistered trademarks, including pending applications for trademark registration, but coloplast did not acquire the mentor 
trademark. individual acquired trademarks, each representing a limited value, are not material for coloplast’s sales, as is also the 
case for patented and unpatented technologies. on acquiring mpathy, coloplast acquired a small number (less than 20) of 
trademarks. on acquiring nine continents, coloplast acquired some unregistered trademarks and a domain name. 
 
customer lists/loyalties 
coloplast also acquired a substantial number of customer relationships when acquiring both mentor and mpathy. as long-term 
customer contracts are rarely made in the field of urology, customer lists are valued as a whole at the date of acquisition.

property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. cost comprises the cost of 
acquisition and expenses directly attributable to an acquisition until the asset is ready for use. in case of assets manufactured by the 
company, cost comprises materials, components, sub-supplier services, direct labour and costs directly attributable to the 
manufactured asset. in addition, borrowing costs are recognised as part of cost. 
 
depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets. the expected useful lives are: 
 
land 
 
 
not depreciated 
buildings 
 
 
15 – 25 years 
building installations 
 
5 – 10 years 
plant and machinery 
 
5 – 15 years 
other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 
3 – 7 years 
 
at the balance sheet date, the residual values, remaining useful lives and depreciation pattern of the assets are reassessed. any 
changes are treated as changes to accounting estimates. gains and losses on the sale or scrapping of an item of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in the income statement as other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.

right-of-use assets 
 
 
the majority of the group's right-of-use assets comprise office space, warehouses, cars and it equipment. leasing 
arrangements are preferred for certain types of assets as it stabilises cash flows and reduces capital invested in non-current 
assets. 
 
in certain situations, the leasing contracts include a right for coloplast to extend the leasing period but this is only reflected in the 
cost of the right-of-use assets, and the corresponding lease liability, if it is reasonably certain that the option will be utilised. 
 
variable lease payments, which are not included in the measurement of the lease liability, are expensed directly in profit or loss. 
these payments are mainly related to consumption-based charges, e.g. extra mileage in leased cars. 
 
the group enters into new lease contracts continually, e.g. to replace an old right-of-use asset which is returned to lessor. the 
new contracts are usually entered prior to commencing the leasing period when a right-of-use assets is available for use. 
consequently, the group may have committed to lease contracts, which are insignificant from an individual perspective, at the 
balance sheet date which are not yet recognised on the balance sheet date. 
 
the extent of residual value guarantees for right-of-use assets is limited and expected payments are included in the initial 
amount of the lease liability. 
 
 
notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
at the commencement date, when a leased asset is made available for use, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability is 
recognised on the balance sheet.  
 
right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, any lease payments made 
prior to the commencement date and any initial direct costs. subsequently, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less depreciation 
and impairment losses and adjusted for the remeasurement of the lease liability. the right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset. 
 
options to extend the initial leasing period are only included in the initial measurement if it is reasonably certain that the option will be 
utilised. 
 
lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments. the lease payments are discounted using the 
implicit rate of the lease contract or, if not readily determinable, the incremental borrowing rate of coloplast for loans with similar term 
and security. as a practical expedient, the discount rates are determined on basis of a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics, 
e.g. a portfolio of leased cars in a specific country. the lease liabilities are subsequently reduced by the portion of lease payments 
which is regarded as repayment of those lease liabilities. lease liabilities are remeasured in the event of a lease modification or a 
reassessment of the lease term which in turn may also impact the carrying value of the right-of-use assets. the lease term is 
reassessed when a significant event or change, which is within the control of coloplast, affects the prior assessment. 
 
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are exempted from the above accounting model. consequently, lease payments 
associated with such lease contracts are recognised as an operating expense on either a straight-line basis over the lease term or 
another systematic basis which is more representative of the pattern of the benefit of the leased assets.

deferred tax 
 
 
the group’s tax losses expiring after more than five years amount to dkk 21 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 19 million at 
30 september 2020). of these tax losses, the group has recognised a tax asset of dkk 6 million on a dkk 21 million tax loss at 
30 september 2021 (dkk 2 million on a dkk 7 million tax loss at 30 september 2020). 
 
 
 
notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
full provision is made for deferred tax on the basis of all temporary differences in accordance with the balance sheet liability method. 
temporary differences arise between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts which are offset over time.  
 
deferred tax relating to differences between initial recognition of assets or liabilities is not recognised if at the transaction date neither 
the accounting profit nor the taxable income is affected unless such differences occurred in a business combination. 
 
uncertain tax positions generally relate to transfer pricing disputes and are recognised under payable tax and measured according to 
current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised. 
 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future positive taxable income will be generated, against which 
the temporary differences and tax losses can be offset. deferred tax assets are measured at expected net realisable values. 
 
the value of future tax deductions in relation to share option programmes is recognised as deferred tax, until they are exercised by 
the employees. any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is charged to equity. 
 
  key accounting estimates and judgements 
the recognition of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions requires an assessment by management. deferred tax assets, 
including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised if management estimates that the tax assets can be utilised within a 
foreseeable future by offsetting against future positive taxable income. the assessment is made annually on the basis of budgets and 
business plans for the following years, including any scheduled business measures. as the group conducts business globally, transfer 
pricing disputes may arise with tax authorities in respect of settlement prices etc. management applies a probability-weighted 
assessment to determine obligations in connection with transfer pricing disputes.

the tax value of the group’s tax credits amounts to dkk 128 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 130 million at 30 september 
2020). this amount includes a recognised tax asset of dkk 51 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 53 million at 30 september 
2020). the tax credits expire after more than five years. 
 
taxable temporary differences regarding investments in subsidiaries and branches are insignificant and no deferred tax has 
been provided because the company controls the timing of the elimination of the temporary difference, and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future.

notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined using the fifo principle. the cost of finished 
goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and indirect production overheads. production 
overheads comprise indirect material and labour costs, maintenance and depreciation of the machinery and production buildings used 
in the manufacturing process as well as costs of production administration and management. net realisable value is the expected 
selling price less cost of completion and costs to sell. 
 
  key accounting estimates and judgements 
capitalised production overheads have been calculated using a standard cost method, which is reviewed regularly to ensure the 
relevant assumptions concerning capacity utilisation, lead times and other relevant factors in the calculation of actual costs of sales. 
changes to the calculation method for production overheads, including levels of capacity utilisation, lead times, etc. could affect the 
gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories.

receivables consist mainly of trade receivables. on initial recognition, receivables are measured at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised cost. receivables are written down on the basis of an individual assessment and the simplified approach in accordance with 
ifrs 9 where loss allowances are based on lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
  key accounting estimates and judgements 
receivables and trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost less loss allowances. the individual provision is made for losses 
considered likely to arise. if the financial position of a customer deteriorates, making it unable to make payments, it may prove 
necessary to make additional provisions in future accounting periods. the allowance for lifetime expected losses is based on credit risk 
characteristics for a group of customers and days past due. when assessing whether the group has made adequate allowances for 
bad and doubtful debts, management reviews the receivables, including previous losses on trade receivables, the customer's 
creditworthiness, current economic conditions and changes to customer payment terms and conditions. 
 
loss allowances are generally linked to a customer’s inability to pay resulting from bankruptcy or expected bankruptcy. overdue 
receivables do not only reflect customers’ general ability to pay, but also the payment patterns in markets in which coloplast operates.

other receivables, non-current 
the portion of other receivables, which are falling due after more than one year after the balance sheet date, is recognised in 
the balance sheet as non-current assets and amounts to dkk 26 million (dkk 24 million at 30 september 2020). 
 
the majority of the non-current other receivables falls due after three years of the balance sheet date. interest accruing on 
receivables is 0%.

share options 
 
 
share options are granted to members of the executive management and other senior management for the purpose of 
motivating and retaining a qualified management group and in order to align the interests of management with those of the 
shareholders. options are awarded as unconditional allocations at the date of grant, but vest over a three-year period. the 
value of options at the date of grant equalled an average of three months' salary for each recipient, with the exception of the 
executive management.  
 
the accounting liability of the share option programmes was dkk 7 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 11 million at 30 
september 2020), while the fair value of all option programmes amounted to dkk 553 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 746

the accounting value of the options was calculated using the black-scholes formula at the date of the grant, in which the 
interest rate applied was the yield on danish government securities. volatility in the share is calculated as monthly movements 
(period-end to period-end) over five years. options are assumed to be exercised on average one year into the exercise period. 
 
 
notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
share options are granted to the executive management and senior management. for equity-settled schemes, the fair value of 
options is determined at the grant date. the option value is subsequently recognised over the vesting period as staff costs. for cash-
settled schemes, the fair value of options granted during the period is recognised as staff costs, whereas the fair value adjustment of 
granted options from previous periods is recognised under financial items. the purchase and selling prices of treasury shares on 
exercise are deducted from or added to equity, as the case may be.

provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
 
 
defined contribution plans 
the group offers pension plans to certain groups of employees in denmark and abroad. most of the pension plans are defined 
contribution plans. the group funds the plans through regular payments of premiums to independent insurance companies 
responsible for the pension obligations towards the beneficiaries. once the pension contributions for defined contribution plans 
have been made, the group has no further obligation towards current or former employees. contributions to defined 
contribution plans are recognised in the income statement when paid. in 2020/21, dkk 360 million (2019/20: dkk 317 million) 
was recognised. 
 
defined benefit plans 
for certain groups of employees in foreign subsidiaries, the group has signed agreements to pay defined benefits, including 
pension payments.

italy have been closed, and no further payments are made. 
 
the figures below include liabilities regarding the post-service remuneration scheme applicable to board members prior to the 
amendment to the articles of association adopted at the annual general meeting held in 2002. 
 
the pension plans are based on the individual employee's salary and years of service with the company, and benefits are paid as 
a lifelong pension. the active plans are not exclusive to any particular employee group. 
 
 
notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
in defined contribution plans, the group makes regular payments of fixed contributions to independent pension funds and insurance 
companies. the group is under no obligation to pay additional contributions. costs for defined contribution plans are recognised in the 
income statement as coloplast assumes an obligation to make the payment. 
 
in defined benefit plans, the group is under an obligation to pay a defined benefit on retirement. the actuarially calculated present 
value less the fair value of any plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet under provision for pension and similar obligations or in 
plan assets in the balance sheet. the total service costs of the year plus calculated interest based on actuarial estimates and financial 
assumptions at the beginning of the year are recognised in the income statement. the difference between the forecast development 
in plan assets and liabilities and the realised values at the end of the year is called actuarial gains or losses and is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. in connection with a change in benefits regarding the employees’ employment with the group to date, there 
will be a change in the actuarial calculation of the net present value, which is taken directly to the profit or loss.

special funding requirements apply in the uk, while this is not the case for the other countries. in the uk, employee interests are 
handled by a trustee board. accounts are prepared every three years and funding of any deficit is determined. any surplus 
reverts to coloplast. the plans have no requirements for risk diversification on equities or for matching strategies. the plans 
have a duration of an average of 15 years, and all plans generally mature after more than 10 years. 
 
the group expects to pay dkk 15 million to the defined benefit plans in 2021/22.

 accounting policies
provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event, and it is probable that an 
outflow of the group’s financial resources will be required to settle the obligation. provisions are measured as management's best 
estimate of the amount with which the liability is expected to be settled. the group recognises a provision for the replacement of 
products covered by warranties at the balance sheet date. 
 
  key accounting estimates and judgements 
provisions for legal obligations consist of provisions for pending litigation. management makes assessments of provisions and 
contingent liabilities, including the probable outcome of pending and possible future litigation, which is inherently subject to uncertain 
future events. based on information available, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for pending litigation, 
but there can be no assurance that the scope of these matters will not be extended, nor that material lawsuits, claims, legal 
proceedings or investigations will not arise in the future.

legal claims 
the amounts are gross amounts relating to certain legal claims. 
 
since 2011, coloplast, along with a number of other major manufacturers, has been named as a defendant in individual lawsuits 
in various federal and state courts around the united states alleging injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh 
products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. a multidistrict litigation (mdl) was formed in 
2012 in the southern district of west virginia to consolidate federal court cases in which coloplast is the first named defendant. 
 
since the first lawsuits were filed, coloplast has been intent on disputing the current and any future litigation and has continually 
considered which strategy and other steps may serve the company’s best interests. 
 
against this background, coloplast has from the start reached settlements with groups of law firms. in 2017, judge joseph 
goodwin issued a court order stating that plaintiffs may no longer direct claims against coloplast in the ongoing mdl. in 2019, 
the remaining cases were remanded to the relevant courts, and on 18 december 2020 the mdl was formally closed. it is 
estimated that around 98% of the mdl cases have been settled to date. 
 
an additional expense of dkk 0.2 bn has been recognised in the 2020/21 financial year to resolve the remaining claims as the 
process takes longer than previously anticipated.  the expense is recognised under special items in the income statement. this 
brings the total amount recognised since the 2013/14 financial year for expected costs of litigation in the us to dkk 5.85 bn 
including legal costs (before insurance cover of dkk 0.5 bn).  
 
the total expense is based on a number of estimates and assumptions and is therefore subject to substantial uncertainty. 
 
the remaining provision made for legal claims amounted to dkk 0.2 billion at 30 september 2021 (dkk 0.3 billion at 30 
september 2020) plus dkk 0.1 billion recognised under other debt (dkk 0.1 billion at 30 september 2020). liabilities are 
classified as other debt when agreements are reached with the plaintiffs’ legal counsel and amounts and timing become known. 
 
with reference to the prejudicial exemption in ias 37, coloplast will not disclose any further information about the assumptions 
for the provision, including any details about current and the expected number of lawsuits and settled claims. 
 
the disclosure of such information is believed to be detrimental to coloplast in connection with the ongoing confidential 
negotiations and could inflict financial losses on coloplast and its shareholders. 
 
other 
other liabilities relate to provisions for expenses associated with restructuring, guarantees and other non-legal claims.

debt to credit institutions from repo transactions 
coloplast has concluded repo transactions on mortgage bonds, according to which coloplast has an obligation to buy back the 
bonds at a fixed price. repo transactions are accounted for as lending transactions. repo debt amounted to dkk 203 million at 
30 september 2021 (dkk 208 million at 30 september 2020) with a due date of 13 october 2021. the repo debt carries a 
fixed rate of interest of minus 0.3% from the transaction date (minus 0.3% at 30 september 2020). 
 
bonds for which the ownership has been transferred to the counterpart as part of a repo transaction had a carrying amount of 
dkk 203 million at 30 september 2021 (dkk 208 million at 30 september 2020). see note 22 to the financial statements for 
information on interest rate risk relating to bonds. 
 
other borrowings from credit institutions 
other borrowings from credit institutions mainly comprise drawdowns on revolving credit facilities which are committed for 
three years on the balance sheet date in addition to minor bank overdrafts on authorised short-term facilities.  
 
the borrowings from credit institutions are presented as current liabilities due to its nature as instruments for liquidity 
management. 
 
 
 accounting policies
borrowings from credit institutions are recognised at fair value less expenses incurred and subsequently at amortised cost. repo debt 
relates to mortgage bonds forming a part of repo transactions. repo debt is recognised at amortised cost plus accumulated repo 
interest.

notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 accounting policies
financial instruments are measured at either amortised cost or fair value. those financial instruments, which are measured at fair 
value, can be categorised according to the fair value measurement hierarchy below: 
 
level 1: observable prices in active markets for identical instruments.  
level 2: valuation models primarily based on observable prices or traded prices of comparable instruments. 
level 3: valuation models primarily based on non-observable prices. 
 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts and other derivative financial instruments are considered a level 2 fair value 
measurement as the fair value is determined directly based on the published exchange rates and quoted forward exchange rates at 
balance sheet dates. the fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated on the basis of current market data.

financial risks 
risk management policy 
financial risks are managed centrally and, accordingly, all derivative instruments are managed and controlled by the parent 
company. the framework is determined by the financial policy approved annually by the board of directors. the financial policy 
comprises policies for foreign exchange, funding, liquidity and financial counterparts. the core principle is for financial risk to be 
managed with a view to reducing significant risk. 
 
foreign exchange risk 
a number of the group’s financial instruments is exposed foreign exchange risks as a natural consequence of its global activities. 
the board of directors determines the level of risk as a percentage of ebitda. foreign exchange risk is calculated by applying 
the principles of a cash-flow-at-risk model. the foreign exchange risk related to financial instruments is concentrated in 
receivables, payables and cash positions denominated in foreign currencies. in addition to this, the fair value of the group’s 
hedging instruments is significantly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. on the other hand, there is only a low foreign 
exchange risk attached to the group’s marketable securities as these are denominated in dkk and eur. borrowings from credit 
institutions, including repo debt, are denominated in dkk. 
 
while eur is a key currency for the group, the foreign exchange risk is regarded as low due to fixed exchange rate policy of the 
central bank of denmark. 
 
as at 30 september 2021, an average of 52% of the following twelve months of expected net cash flows were hedged (30 
september 2020: 58% of the following twelve months of cash flows). 
 
the table below show how a theoretical change of +/- 5% in all currencies against danish kroner will impact the financial 
instruments recognised at the balance sheet date. the impact on profit or loss comes mainly from receivables denominated in 
foreign currencies. the impact on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of hedging instruments. the hedged 
exposure is included in the sensitivity analysis and, therefore, the effect is reduced.

interest rate risk 
the exposure to interest rate risks is consider insignificant as the group's net interest-bearing debt remains an insignificant part 
of the groups capital structure. the credit facilities are at floating interest rate. the duration as per balance sheet date was 1.6 
years. 
 
liquidity risk 
the exposure to liquidity risks is considered to be low. in addition to cash available for withdrawal and marketable securities, the 
group’s cash reserves comprise a mix of committed and uncommitted credit facilities to ensure an adequate level of funding for 
the group’s activities, even in periods of operational uncertainty.

the board of directors generally intends to distribute excess cash to the shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks. 
it is expected that dividends will be paid twice a year: after the annual general meeting and after the release of the half-year 
interim report. however, share buybacks and distribution of dividend will always be made with due consideration for the group’s 
liquidity requirements and plans. 
 
the capital management objective of the group is to raise new debt only for acquisition purposes or for other special purposes. 
the group assesses the capital on the basis of the solvency ratio, which is calculated in accordance with the guidelines issued by 
the danish society of financial analysts. 
 
credit risk 
the group’s credit risk relates to the possibility that the counterparties of its financial assets are not able to meet their oblige-
tions as they fall due. the carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure. the group’s 
policy for managing credit risks involves an ongoing credit assessment of major customers and other key business partners. 
 
the credit risk exposure relates to (i) receivables, (ii) bank deposits, (iii) marketable securities (mortgage bonds and corporate 
bonds) as well as (iv) derivative financial instruments (forward exchange contracts) with a positive fair value at the balance sheet 
date. 
 
 
the credit risk relating to trade receivables and other receivables is diversified over a large number of customers and other 
counterparties. for this reason, the credit risk is regarded as insignificant. see also note 16. 
 
 
the credit risk relating to bank deposits is, pursuant to the group’s counterparty policy, managed and mitigated by making 
money market deposits only with selected financial institutions holding a satisfactory credit rating. in addition, the maximum 
deposit limits have been defined for each financial counterparty. 
 
 
the credit risk relating to marketable securities is considered to be limited as investment is only made in selected liquid bonds 
with a high credit rating. 
 
 
the credit risk relating to derivative financial instruments is aligned with the credit risk for bank deposits as derivative 
contracts are only entered with selected financial institutions with a satisfactory credit rating.

derivative financial instruments 
 
 
pursuant to the group’s foreign exchange policy, forward exchange contracts are used for the purpose of neutralising and 
delaying the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in profit or loss and thereby enhance the predictability of the financial results. 
 
the foreign exchange risk is calculated by applying the principles of a cash-flow-at-risk model, with the board of directors 
determining the level of risk as a percentage of operating profit (ebitda). the risk is managed and mitigated through cash flow 
hedges and, in some cases, through fair value hedges. sources of hedging ineffectiveness comprise mainly those that arise from 
assumptions on expected 12-month rolling cash flows not being realised. 
 
the group hedges key currencies e.g. usd, gbp, jpy and huf, and selectively hedges emerging markets currencies taking the 
cost of hedging into consideration. 
 
the group does not hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in eur as the foreign exchange risk is regarded as low due to 
the fixed exchange rate policy of the central bank of denmark. 
 
 
 
 accounting policies
at the initiation of derivative contracts, it is assessed whether they qualify for hedge accounting and the derivatives are classified as 
either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. cash flow hedges relates to forecasted transactions at a future point in time. fair value 
hedges relate to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. 
 
upon initial recognition, the fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognised as an asset or a liability on the balance sheet 
date. these are presented together with other receivables or other payables, respectively. the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. 
 
the subsequent value adjustments of cash flow hedges are recognised through other comprehensive income as a cash flow hedge 
reserve when the hedging relationship continues to meet the effectiveness requirement. the reserve is recognised in the income 
statement upon realisation of the hedged transactions. if a derivative financial instrument used to hedge expected future transactions 
expires, is sold or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any accumulated reserve remains in equity until the hedged transaction is 
concluded. if a transaction is no longer expected to be concluded, any reserve accumulated under equity is transferred to the income 
statement.  
 
the subsequent value adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised through profit or loss along with any adjustments of the value 
of the hedged asset that concern the hedged risk.

acquisitions 
coloplast acquired 100% of the shares and voting rights of three small us direct-to-consumer durable medical equipment 
(dme) dealers in the financial year, rocky mountain medical supply on 4 january 2021, hope medical supply on 1 march 2021 
and affordable medical, llc on 4 may 2021. 
 
the agreed consideration for the shares in total for the entities amounts to dkk 97 million (usd 16 million), which fell due for 
payment on the date of the acquisitions. 
 
the acquisitions are expected to expand coloplast’s footprint in the us market and enable coloplast to offer innovative 
products and services to a broader part of the us market. 
 
if the acquisitions had occurred on 1 october 2020, the contribution to the group’s reported growth, revenue and profit in the 
financial year would have been immaterial. 
 
the fair value adjustments for the three distributors consist mainly of trademarks of dkk 4 million and customer lists of dkk 45 
million. customer lists consist of access to durable medical equipment (dme) dealers’ existing customer base (users) and 
physician lists. trademarks consist of the durable medical equipment (dme) dealers’ trademark and name, which are both 
associated with sales of catheter supplies. 
 
after recognition of identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value, goodwill related to the acquisition amounts to dkk 45 million, 
which amount is deductible for tax purposes. goodwill expresses the synergies expected to be achieved from the broader 
geographical coverage of the us market, access to providing innovative products and services and the opportunity to attract 
new users.

our opinion is consistent with our

october 2020 to 30 september 2021 
comprise statement of comprehensive 
income, statement of cash flows,

the parent company financial 
statements of coloplast a/s for the 
financial year 1 october 2020 to 30 
september 2021 comprise income 
statement, balance sheet and notes, 
including summary of significant 
accounting policies. 
 
collectively referred to as the “financial 
statements”. 
 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance 
with international standards on auditing 
(isas) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. our 
responsibilities under those standards 
and requirements are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. 
 
we believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
 
independence 
we are independent of the group in 
accordance with the international ethics 
standards board for accountants’ 
international code of ethics for 
professional accountants (iesba code) 
and the additional ethical requirements 
applicable in denmark. we have also 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements 
and the iesba code. 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, 
prohibited non-audit services referred to 
in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 
537/2014 were not provided.  
 
appointment 
we were first appointed auditors of 
coloplast a/s on 12 june 1998 for the 
financial year 1997/98. we have been 
reappointed annually by shareholder 
resolution for a total period of 
uninterrupted engagement of 24 years 
including the financial year 2020/21. 
 
key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters 
that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of 
the financial statements for 2020/21. 
these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.

key audit matter 
 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
 
effect of pending and potential transvaginal 
mesh cases 
since 2011, coloplast has been a party to individual lawsuits 
in different federal and state courts in the usa where claims 
of product liability have been registered relating to the use of 
transvaginal mesh for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse 
and stress urinary incontinence.  
 
we focused on the assessment of the liability relating to the 
transvaginal mesh cases as the valuation is subject to 
significant estimates, including significant assumptions relating 
to expected settlement amounts and legal costs per case as 
well as the number of cases. 
 
we refer to note 19 in the consolidated financial statements 
for detailed information on the transvaginal mesh cases. 
 
 
we discussed the principles for the assessment of the liability 
relating to the transvaginal mesh cases with management.  
 
we obtained and evaluated the accuracy of management’s 
calculation of the liability relating to the transvaginal mesh 
cases. further, we assessed and tested key data input and 
significant assumptions and recalculated the liability. 
 
we tested the principles for identification and assessment of 
potential and on-going transvaginal mesh cases, and we 
discussed and obtained statements from internal and external
legal counsel on the likely economic consequences of the 
transvaginal mesh cases, including the expected number of 
cases, the expected settlement amounts and the expected 
legal costs. 
 
based on the historical development of the overall 
proceedings of the transvaginal mesh cases, we evaluated 
coloplast’s ability to estimate its monetary exposure to the 
transvaginal mesh cases by comparing historically recorded 
liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon 
resolution of prior legal matters. furthermore, we assessed 
the reasonableness of management’s expectations of the 
settlement amount per case with respect to cases not yet 
settled and expectations for any additional registration of 
claims as well as additional legal costs. 
 
we also assessed the disclosures in note 19 of the 
consolidated financial statements relating to the cases. 
 
 
revenue recognition 
the preparation and negotiation of sales agreements take 
place with due consideration of territorial healthcare reforms, 
diverse legislation, increased competition, growth strategies 
and requirements relating to various tenders. the main part 
of coloplast’s sales are carried out through distributors, who 
operate under diverse circumstances and consequently have 
different requirements that affects the sales agreements.  
 
coloplast’s agreements with distributors include volume and 
product dependent discounts, which requires data 
management and monitoring of sales at product level to the 
individual distributors. 
 
we focused on the recognition of revenue as the accounting 
rules are complex and involve assessments of the timing and 
amount of the revenue to be recognised. 
  
we refer to note 3 in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
we reviewed and assessed the procedures and internal 
controls relating to revenue and tested relevant controls with 
special focus on controls relating to the conclusion of 
agreements and collection of relevant data. 
 
we discussed the recognition principles with management 
including distributor agreements and the related sales 
transactions.  
 
we applied data analysis to revenue transactions in order to 
obtain an understanding of the transaction flow in the group 
and in relation hereto, we tested a sample of revenue 
transactions. 
 
finally, we tested a sample of revenue transactions to sales 
agreements, tested provisions for discounts and tested the 
time of recognition of sales transactions. 
 
 
statements    independent auditor’s reports

statement on management’s review 
management is responsible for 
management’s review. 
 
our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover management’s review, 
and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
 
in connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read management’s review and, in 
doing so, consider whether 
management’s review is materially 
inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
 
moreover, we considered whether 
management’s review includes the 
disclosures required by the danish 
financial statements act.  
 
based on the work we have performed, 
in our view, management’s review is in 
accordance with the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements and has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in management’s 
review. 
 
management’s responsibilities for the 
financial statements  
management is responsible for the 
preparation of consolidated financial 
statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further 
requirements in the danish financial 
statements act and for the preparation 
of parent company financial statements 
that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal 
control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
 
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for 
assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the group or the 
parent company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
isas and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
 
as part of an audit in accordance with 
isas and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the 
audit. we also:  
 
 
identify and assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. the risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
 
 
obtain an understanding of internal 
control relevant to the audit in order 
to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the group’s and the 
parent company’s internal control. 
statements 
independent auditor’s reports 
 
108 
 
evaluate the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 
 
 
conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and 
based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause the 
group or the parent company to 
cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
 
evaluate the overall presentation, 
structure and content of the 
financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 
 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or 
business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.  
we communicate with those charged 
with governance regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 
 
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we 
have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence and, where 
applicable, actions taken to eliminate 
threats or safeguards applied. 
 
from the matters communicated with 
those charged with governance, we 
determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such 
communication.

esef regulation 
 
as part of our audit of the financial 
statements we performed procedures

 
ensuring consistency between 
ixbrl tagged data and the 
consolidated financial statements 
presented in human-readable 
format; and 
 
for such internal control as 
management determines necessary 
to enable the preparation of an 
annual report that is compliant with 
the esef regulation. 
statements    independent auditor’s reports 
109 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable 
assurance on whether the annual report 
is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation 
based on the evidence we have 
obtained, and to issue a report that 
includes our opinion. the nature, timing 
and extent of procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of 
material departures from the 
requirements set out in the esef 
regulation, whether due to fraud or 
error. the procedures include: 
 
 
testing whether the annual report is 
prepared in xhtml format; 
 
obtaining an understanding of the 
company’s ixbrl tagging process 
and of internal control over the 
tagging process; 
 
evaluating the completeness of the 
ixbrl tagging of the consolidated 
financial statements; 
 
evaluating the appropriateness of 
the company’s use of ixbrl 
elements selected from the esef 
taxonomy and the creation of 
extension elements where no 
suitable element in the esef 
taxonomy has been identified;  
 
evaluating the use of anchoring of 
extension elements to elements in 
the esef taxonomy; and 
 
reconciling the ixbrl tagged data 
with the audited consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
in our opinion, the annual report of

with the file name coloplast-2021-09-

notes to parent company financial statements 
parent company financial statements 
note 1   
accounting policies 
basis of preparation 
the parent company’s financial statements are presented in accordance with the danish financial statements act for 
companies in reporting class d. 
the accounting policies of the parent company are the same as those of the group, but with the addition of the policies 
described below. the group’s accounting policies are set out in note 1, 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 
other than as set out hereinabove, there have been no changes to the accounting policies relative to last year. 
 
general information 
no separate cash flow statement has been prepared for the parent company as per the exemption clause of section 86(4) of 
the danish financial statements act. the consolidated cash flow statement is set out on page 53. 
 
intangible assets 
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method over the expected useful life, estimated at 10 years. this estimate was made on the basis of estimated useful lives of the 
other assets acquired in the transaction. 
 
property, plant and equipment 
leases, under which substantially all risk and rewards or ownership of an asset are transferred, are classified as finance leases. 
other leases are classified as operating leases. no finance leases have been recognised in the parent company’s financial 
statements. 
 
financial assets 
in the parent company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are recognised according to the equity

the coloplast story begins back in 1954. elise 
sørensen is a nurse. her sister thora has just had 
an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out in 
public, fearing that her stoma might leak. listening 
to her sister’s problems, elise conceives the idea of 
the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag.  
 
based on elise’s idea, aage louis-hansen, a civil 
engineer and plastics manufacturer, and his wife 
johanne louis-hansen, a trained nurse, created 
the ostomy bag. a bag that does not leak, giving 
thora – and thousands of people like her – the 
chance to live the life they want. 
 
a simple solution that makes a difference. 
 
today, our business includes ostomy care, 
continence care, wound & skin care and 
interventional urology. we operate globally 
and employ about 12,500 employees.
