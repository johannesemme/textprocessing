2020 
annual report
changes to reporting structure 
in this annual report 2020, we have made several changes 
to our reporting structure to further enhance transparency 
in the value created by each of our different business areas.  
• the changes include disclosing separate income state-
ments to the ebit level for two business segments: 
hearing healthcare comprises four business areas: 
hearing aids, hearing care, hearing implants and 
diagnostics.
communications comprises only our headset business, 
which operates under the epos brand. this business 
was fully consolidated in the group’s financial state-
ments with financial effect from 1 january 2020 as a 
result of the demerger of sennheiser communications, 
our 50/50 joint venture with sennheiser electronic gmbh 
& co. kg. due to the previous set-up as a joint venture, 
there are no comparative figures to report for 2019.
• we have changed the descriptive name of our hearing 
aid wholesale business to hearing aids. at the same 
time, the name of our hearing aid retail business has 
been changed to hearing care.  
• we now report revenue separately for each of our 
hearing aids and hearing care business areas (as  
well as separate growth rates, as we have also done 
historically). 
• we no longer report growth rates separately for our 
cochlear implants and bone anchored hearing systems 
businesses but only a growth rate for hearing implants 
as a whole.

in 2020, oticon launched the new flagship product 
oticon more, which processes and balances the full 
sound scene to give people with a hearing loss  
access to all relevant sounds.

demant · annual report 2020
insights and highlights · ceo letter
the demant group entered 2020 at a high pace, which we 
kept in the first months of the year. then, in the unprece-
dented period from mid-march and a couple of months 
onwards, the coronavirus pandemic caused almost a com-
plete halt to activities in the hearing healthcare market. 
restrictions all over the world forced especially the elderly 
population to stay at home, and consequently hearing aid 
clinics had to close. conversely, epos experienced tailwind 
and benefitted from the surge in demand for virtual collab-
oration tools and entered the market under the best condi-
tions for a company that is active in audio solutions. 
approaching the second half-year, we saw positive recov-
ery in almost all our markets, and the trend continued until 
almost the end of the year, resulting in strong revenue 
growth in local currencies of 14% in the second half-year 
compared to -18% in the first half. faced with a second 
wave of coronavirus, we closed 2020 with uncertainties 
about the hearing healthcare market but also with confi-
dence that vaccines will pave the way for the release of 
pent-up demand for hearing care solutions from both cur-
rent and first-time users, who were put on hold in 2020. 
the essential link confirmed 
our experience from the impact of coronavirus in 2020 is, 
however, not entirely discouraging. the crisis proved that 
hearing care and a person’s ability to be an active part  
of society matter more than ever. remote service surely 
picked up during the most extensive restrictions, but as 
soon as hearing aid clinics started to reopen, we saw the 
need for access to both person-centred care and the latest 
technology, with users literally queuing up outside our clin-
ics. this emphasises that what we do is essential not only 
for the individual user but indeed for society as a whole.
the need for personal hearing care also underlines 
demant’s all-important engagement in hearing aid retail, 
and in 2021, we are happy to increase the transparency  
of reporting in this business area, renamed hearing care. 
hearing care professionals are indeed frontline staff, and 
their ability and willingness to show flexibility in difficult 
times have been very important, most notably the impres-
sive speed at which they managed to reopen clinics and 
offer their services while never compromising on safety 
and health.
access to all sounds 
the ability to hear is one of the finest senses we have, and 
audio stimulation is fundamental for all people. from our 
research in hearing and the brain, we have found that the 
brain needs access to all sounds in the environment to 
function optimally. by applying this knowledge to hearing 
technology, we enable the hearing aid users to enjoy more 
complete sound landscapes with less effort and simply get 
more out of life when they use our products. the new plat-
forms recently launched in all our hearing aid brands are 
further testament to these claims, and with oticon more, 
we took a giant leap forward by being the first manufac-
turer to apply new innovative technology to a hearing  
aid in the form of an on-board deep neural network. with 
ceo letter
in the light of the coronavirus challenges that  
the hearing healthcare market faced in 2020,  
i am very satisfied with our performance,  
particularly with the strong second half-year 
and generally with the accomplishments of our 
new communications brand, epos. in a tough 
year, our ability to steer the company in the right 
direction by balancing cost savings and invest-
ments and by supplying products and services 
to our highly valued customers has been crucial. 
this only goes to show the innovative capabil-
ities and can-do attitude of every employee of 
this group: we take initiative, we find solutions 
and we act.

these groundbreaking new products, we are in excellent 
shape to deliver on our ambition to becoming the biggest 
provider of hearing aids in a market with tough compe- 
tition. 
as soon as clinics started to reopen, 
we saw the need for access to both 
person-centred care and the latest 
technology, with users literally  
queuing up outside our clinics
shared opportunities 
in demant, we take advantage of our shared opportunities 
in the group. evidently, our market presence and shared 
functions can be leveraged across the group, but equally 
important is it to harvest synergies across our core r&d 
activities. the brainhearing paradigm used for the devel-
opment of hearing aids is also used for sound processing  
in hearing implants. keeping a high pace in our r&d activi-
ties and successfully introducing new products and ser- 
vices in oticon medical are key for us to be able to help 
more people with severe or profound hearing loss. so, in  
a difficult year, i am very pleased with oticon medical’s 
ability to take market shares in bone anchored hearing  
systems and also with the ability of oticon medical’s  
cochlear implants business to keep pace with the market. 
furthermore, we have succeeded in submitting the final 
application to the fda for approval of the neuro system  
in the us, and we expect to get the approval in the second 
half of 2021.
a long tradition for creating business 
the year turned out to be much more positive for our 
diagnostics business area than we had dared to hope 
when the market was hit the hardest. the fact that we 
continue to take market shares and sustain almost neutral 
growth levels in a very difficult market proves the impor-
tance of diagnostics in hearing healthcare. from a modest 
market position in the mid-90s, demant’s diagnostics busi-
ness has for more than a decade been global market lead-
er thanks to the development of existing and addition of 
new business activities. 
this ability to create business and expand the group con-
tinues with epos. for transparency purposes, we have 
split our business into two financial segments, hearing 
healthcare and communications. epos addresses a differ-
ent market, but there is major technological overlap to 
hearing healthcare, and even though epos fundamentally 
provides very different products and solutions, the results 
we aim to achieve are similar: to enable people to connect 
through solutions that are free of noise or poor sound qual-
ity, which challenges dialogue.
i am extremely pleased that our audio solution activities 
have now been fully integrated into the group and also 
with epos’s ability to meet the unforeseen surge in de- 
mand for headsets caused by coronavirus. also in this 
business area, we have seen how a crisis can confirm  
that what we offer is essential, namely high-quality virtual 
meeting and collaboration tools, which – together with  
digital platforms – make up for the physical meetings we 
could not have, a trend that we believe will extend into  
the future.
sustainable behaviour 
i would like to extend my thanks to all demant’s stakehold-
ers: users who show trust and loyalty, customers, suppliers 
and employees who are dedicated to making things work 
in difficult times as well as investors, banks, local authori-
ties, politicians and society at large that have all supported 
hard hit businesses like ours, removed uncertainties and 
given us the confidence to maintain our investments in the 
future. to me, this is sustainability and brings me to our 
own responsibility, our own sustainable behaviour.
i am happy that we have launched a new strategic direc- 
tion for our work with sustainability, and we have indeed 
made progress this year, especially in the area of business 
ethics with the launch of a new code of conduct and 
whistleblower scheme. the core of our sustainability 
efforts is life-changing hearing health and the quality of  
life that we bring to our users. in addition to focusing on 
our core contribution to society, we will also strengthen 
sustainability in our operational practices, and we have 
two main priorities in this regard: diversity and inclusion, 
with focus on fostering an unbiased and inclusive culture 
with equal opportunities, and our climate footprint, with 
focus on reducing our packaging and waste, on sourcing 
green energy and on ambitious co2 reductions.
i take an optimistic view of 2021. due to coronavirus, many 
people did unfortunately not have access to the high-quali-
ty hearing care they should have received in 2020, so we 
at demant are ready to support them with our broad and 
unmatched portfolio of products and services.

world’s leading hearing healthcare 
company
innovation
infrastructure

hearing implants
hearing aids & care
diagnostics

favourable demographic trends – particularly the growing 
ageing population – as well as general consumer trends 
continue to drive growth in the hearing healthcare market. 
similarly, we see an attractive and fast-growing market for 
intelligent audio and video solutions, which represents a 
great opportunity to further expand our communications 
business. 
to achieve our purpose, the strategic ambition is to further 
expand our position as the leading global hearing health-
care company with the broadest, deepest and most inno-
vative product offering. hence, we invest heavily in r&d, 
including new areas, such as artificial intelligence as well 
as cloud and connectivity solutions. in all our business 
areas – where each of the activities are run separately  
– we are focused on delivering the best services and  
products to our customers.
apart from excelling in different business areas, we focus 
on harvesting synergies across our business areas and 
thus enabling our customers and users to benefit from our 
multi-business approach backed by a comprehensive glob-
al distribution set-up and efficient infrastructure. we have 
a strong local presence in all regions and key markets, and 
we continue to expand significantly in markets with great 
potential. in all our businesses, capacity and scale are be- 
coming increasingly important, and as a group, we have 
the necessary scale to compete effectively. there is a clear 
technology overlap between hearing aids and hearing im- 
plants and also between hearing aids and headsets, and 
we exploit the synergies, but essentially hearing health- 
care and communications address different markets in  
different ways and are run as two individual segments.
to deliver on our ambition, we strongly rely on our thor-
oughly tested and well-functioning operating model and  
an organisation that is agile and shaped to deal with the 
opportunities of the future. our strongest asset to ensure 
our success is a diverse group of competent people who 
make sure that the plans and strategies are realised. 
in the demant group, we want to contribute to live-chang-
ing hearing health, and we are committed to caring for and 
acting responsibly towards our employees, users, custom-
ers, partners, investors and the surrounding society. this is 
our way of ensuring a positive impact on our surroundings, 
and at demant, we work every day to ensure financially 
viable, socially balanced and environmentally sustainable 
business results.
to create life-changing differences through hearing health
demant is a purpose-driven company. for more than 115 years, our company has provided  
hearing health, and from this platform, we have taken new steps into broader areas of audio.  
our roots are in hearing health, and in the demant group, we share a common purpose of creating 
life-changing differences through hearing health. equally important, with our new company  
epos in the communications business area, we strive to perfect audio and video  
experiences to optimise communication and collaboration between people.

revenue by geographic region fy 2020
a very strong start to the year was disrupted in mid-march 
by the coronavirus pandemic. consequently, revenue in h1 
was significantly below expectations. however, we saw 
strong recovery in the hearing healthcare market towards 
the end of h1 and throughout most of h2. 
growth in hearing healthcare in h2 was also positively 
impacted by low comparative figures due to the it incident 
in h2 2019. communications contributed with significant 
growth from mid-march, which accelerated further in h2.

demant · annual report 2020
the group’s revenue in h2 2019 was negatively impacted 
by an estimated dkk 575 million due to the it incident  
that occurred on 3 september 2019. the low comparative 
figures represent a positive impact on the group’s organic 
growth of 7 percentage points in h2 2020 and of 3 per-
centage points for the full year. please refer to page 27  
for an overview of underlying organic growth rates in our 
hearing healthcare segment (not relevant for communi- 
cations).
in terms of geography, revenue in europe recovered well in 
h2 relative to the low point in q2, and organic growth was 
positive, although it was mainly driven by low comparative 
figures due to the it incident in 2019. we also saw a large 
acquisitive impact in the region due to the fact that our 
communications business, which is reported as acquisitive 
growth, generates a large share of its revenue in europe.  
in north america, we also saw some recovery in revenue 
growth, but the pace was slower than in other developed 
markets. we saw the strongest recovery in asia but also 
strong growth in pacific aided by weak comparative fig-
ures, as the it incident in 2019 had a large relative impact 
on that region. both regions delivered double-digit organic 
growth rates, whereas our other countries region, which

severely impacted by coronavirus throughout h2.

operating expenses (opex)
thanks to tight cost control, the group saw material sav-
ings in opex throughout 2020, and in h2, opex growth 
was flat in local currencies, which is in line with the latest 
guidance. in organic terms, opex decreased by 9% in h2 
driven by strong savings in distribution costs, whereas  
r&d costs only decreased slightly, as we were focused  
on maintaining high momentum in our innovation efforts. 
administrative expenses, which generally vary less with 
the activity level in the business, saw slight organic growth.
acquisitions added more than 9 percentage points to the 
group’s opex in h2 of which the consolidation of epos 
accounted for around 7 percentage points.
gross profit 
the group’s gross profit increased by 8% to dkk 6,085 
million in h2, corresponding to a gross margin of 72.5%. 
this is a decrease of 1.5 percentage points compared to 
h2 2019 due to the consolidation of epos, which had a 
dilutive effect of 2.0 percentage points on the gross mar-
gin. hearing healthcare improved its gross margin slightly 
in h2 supported by weak comparative figures due to the it 
incident. for the full year, the group’s gross profit amount-
ed to dkk 10,340 million, corresponding to a gross margin 
of 71.5%, or a decrease of 4.3 percentage points of which 
2.1 percentage points relate to the dilution attributable to 
the consolidation of epos, and the rest primarily relates to 
the severe impact of coronavirus on revenue in h1.

operating profit (ebit)
consolidated operating profit (ebit) for h2 amounted to 
dkk 1,506 million before epos one-offs and thus reached 
the upper end of our latest guidance range of dkk 1,400-
1,550 million. hearing healthcare contributed dkk 1,425 
million and communications dkk 81 million. compared to 
h2 2019, which was negatively impacted by an estimated 
dkk 550 million related to the it incident, growth in ebit 
was 45%. the resulting ebit margin for h2 was 17.9%, 
which is an increase of 4.2 percentage points. the strong 
ebit margin was driven, in particular, by the cost savings 
described in operating expenses (opex).
including the negative results in h1, ebit for the full year 
amounted to dkk 1,313 million, corresponding to an ebit 
margin of 9.1%.
due to the consolidation of epos with financial effect from 
the beginning of the year, we realised one-offs of dkk -90 
million in h2, which are shown in the income statement on 
page 18. the one-offs comprise the following elements:
• a negative adjustment of inventory purchased as part  
of the demerger of dkk -38 million (dkk -109 million in 
h1) with no effect on cash flows. the adjustment is rec-
ognised in production costs.
• costs related to extraordinary spending on the branding 
of epos of dkk 52 million (dkk 37 million in h1) with 
direct effect on cash flows. the costs are recognised  
in distribution costs.
for the full year, one-offs were positive by net dkk 217 
million, which also includes a positive fair value adjustment 
of dkk 453 million recognised in h1. the fair value adjust-
ment is recognised in share of profit after tax, associates 
and joint ventures and has no effect on cash flows.
consequently, the group’s reported ebit after epos one- 
offs amounted to dkk 1,416 million in h2 and to dkk 
1,530 million for the full year.
financial items 
reported net financial items for h2 amounted to dkk 106 
million, or a decrease of dkk 15 million on the same period 
in 2019. this is mainly due to lower interest expenses, 
resulting from both a lower average interest rate and a 
decrease in the net interest-bearing debt in the period.  
for the full year, net financial items amounted to dkk 194 
million, or a decrease of dkk 46 million on 2019.

five-year opex (dkk million)
our hearing healthcare segment accounts for all the  
savings realised in h2, which were both of a temporary 
and a structural nature. the structural savings amount to 
around dkk 250 million on an annual basis and had full 
effect in h2 2020. please refer to the financial review of 
hearing healthcare on page 27 for more details on both 
temporary and structural cost savings. 
for the full year, opex decreased by 2% in local currencies 
of which -10 percentage points were organic growth and 8 
percentage points relate to acquisitions, the latter including 
around 6 percentage points from the consolidation of epos.

cash flow statement 
in h2 2020, the group’s cash flow from operating activities 
(cffo) grew by 72% to dkk 1,892 million after epos one-
offs. besides the improvement in ebit compared to 2019, 
the very strong growth was driven by tight working capital 
management. despite the significantly lower ebit, cffo for 
the full year amounted to dkk 2,621 million, corresponding 
to an increase of 22% compared to 2019. 
our net investments in tangible and intangible assets 
(capex) in h2 amounted to dkk 340 million, which is  
a decrease of 19% on h2 2019. the decrease reflects the 
temporary suspension of non-essential investments from 
mid-march and into h2. for 2020 as a whole, capex 
decreased by 12% to dkk 667 million.
net investments in other non-current assets amounted to 
dkk 18 million, a minor decrease of dkk 27 million. for the 
full year, cash flow from other non-current assets was posi-
tive by dkk 69 million driven by the settlement of a loan in 
connection with an acquisition in france at the beginning  
of the year. 
free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments in- 
creased significantly by 141% to dkk 1,534 million in h2 
and by 51% to dkk 2,023 million for the year as a whole.
cash flow relating to acquisitions decreased by 65% to  
dkk 101 million in h2, as we saw a temporary pause in 
transactions at the beginning of the period. however, the 
m&a activity level increased towards the end of the year. 
profit for the year 
the group’s reported profit before tax for h2 amounted to 
dkk 1,310 million, or an increase of 43% compared to the 
same period in 2019. tax amounted to dkk 297 million, 
resulting in an effective tax rate of 22.7%, which is a de- 
crease of 1.0 percentage point compared to 2019.
for the full year, profit before tax amounted to dkk 1,336 
million, or a decrease of 30% on 2019, while tax amounted 
to dkk 202 million. the resulting effective tax rate of only 
15.1% reflects a net tax gain of dkk 95 million in h1 due  
to the fact that the group is exempt from paying tax on the 
positive one-off fair value adjustment realised as part of the 
consolidation of epos. adjusted for this, the effective tax 
rate was 22.9%, or a decrease of 0.3 percentage point  
on 2019. 
reported net profit for h2 was dkk 1,013 million, or an 
increase of 45%, resulting in earnings per share (eps) of 
dkk 4.18, which is an increase of 46% from dkk 2.87 in 
h2 2019. for the full year, net profit was dkk 1,134 million, 
or a decrease of 23%, resulting in eps of dkk 4.68, which  
is a decrease of 22% from dkk 6.00 in 2019. as outlined 
earlier, growth in net profit and eps was partly driven by  
the adverse impact of the it incident on profits in h2 2019.
at the annual general meeting, the board of directors will 
propose that the entire profit for the year be retained and 
transferred to the company’s reserves.

balance sheet 
as of 31 december 2020, the group’s total assets amounted 
to dkk 21,927 million, which is a marginal decrease of 1% 
compared to 30 june 2020. the decrease primarily related to 
a decrease in other non-current assets, including goodwill 
and deferred tax assets, whereas we saw an increase in 
trade receivables related to the increase in revenue in h2 
compared to h1. relative to the end of 2019, total assets 
increased by 1% driven entirely by acquisitive growth of 6%, 
primarily in the form of goodwill. this includes growth re- 
lated to the consolidation of epos. organic growth in total 
assets was -1%, driven to a large extent by a reduction in 
our net working capital, and exchange rate effects were -5%.
reflecting our tight working capital management, the 
group’s net working capital was dkk 2,452 million at the 
end of 2020, a slight decrease of 2% since 30 june 2020 
despite the increased activity level in h2. relative to the  
end of 2019, our net working capital was down by 24%. 
thanks to the strong cash flow generation in 2020, particu-
larly in h2, our net interest-bearing debt (nibd) decreased 
by 15% in h2 and by 13% for the full year and amounted  
to dkk 7,135 million at 31 december 2020. the decrease 
relates to a decrease in the short-term part of our inter-
est-bearing debt, which more than outweighed an increase 
in the non-current part of our interest-bearing debt. the 
resulting gearing multiple (nibd/ebitda) was 2.8, which is 
slightly above our medium- to long-term target of 2.0-2.5 
(target is unchanged and corresponds to 1.7-2.2, excluding 
the impact of leasing). the above-normal gearing is a natu-
ral consequence of the depressed ebitda in 2020, particu-
larly in h1.
total equity increased by 11% in h2 to dkk 8,279 million of 
which dkk 29 million is attributable to non-controlling inter-
ests and dkk 8,250 million to the shareholders of demant 
a/s. the increase was a result of the strong profitability real-
ised in h2 combined with the suspension of share buy-backs 
in the reporting period. for the full year, equity increased by 
8% driven by the realised profit after tax but was partly off-
set by share buy-backs of dkk 147 million made in h1 and 
by customary currency translation adjustments of subsidiar-
ies reported as other comprehensive income.
share buy-backs recognised in the group’s balance sheet 
totalled 667,702 shares bought at an average price of dkk 
220.31, totalling dkk 147 million. the difference between 
this amount and the dkk 197 million stated in the group’s 
cash flow statement relates to shares bought back as part 
of a voluntary salary-for-shares conversion scheme offered 
to most danish employees, which are expensed as opex in 
the income statement.
employees
as of 31 december 2020, the group had 16,591 employees 
(2,016 in denmark) compared to 15,678 (1,991 in denmark) 
as of 30 june 2020, an increase of 6% of which most was 
relates to an increase in staffing at our production sites 
and to acquisitions. the number of employees increased  
by 5% for the full year relative to the 15,837 employees  
(1,689 in denmark) at the end of 2019. the increase 
relates solely to the consolidation of epos and other 
acquisitive impacts, and organic growth was flat, as 
growth in certain business areas and geographies was  
offset by structural reductions in others.
events after the balance sheet date 
there have been no events that materially change the 
assessment of this annual report 2020 from the balance 
sheet date and up to today. 
for the full year, cash flow relating to acquisitions was down 
by 35% and amounted to dkk 394 million.
share buy-backs have been suspended between 15 march 
2020 and today. prior to the suspension, the group had 
bought back shares worth dkk 197 million. 
after other financing activities of dkk -1,381 million, mostly 
related to changes in short-term bank facilities, the net cash 
flow in h2 was dkk 52 million. for the full year, the net cash 
flow was dkk 194 million.

medium- to long-term outlook
recent developments
after a very challenging 2020 where the hearing health-
care market was severely impacted by coronavirus, we 
expect to see very strong growth in 2021, as the market 
gradually recovers and also as a result of low comparative 
figures from around mid-march. however, due to increas-
ing infection rates and the tightening of restrictions in most 
markets at the end of 2020, the hearing healthcare market 
continues to be negatively impacted by coronavirus at the 
beginning of 2021 where the group’s revenue remains be- 
low the normal level. this is especially the case in the uk, 
in several emerging markets and to a lesser extent in the 
important us market. of all our business areas, hearing 
implants is still the business area that is impacted the 
most.
conversely, the market for enterprise and gaming headsets 
has entered 2021, experiencing continued strong demand 
driven by the increased use of virtual collaboration tools, 
and we have so far seen high double-digit growth rates 
supported partly by relatively soft comparative figures  
from the beginning of 2020.
assumptions
given these recent developments, our outlook for 2021 is 
clearly subject to greater uncertainty than usual. below,  
we highlight the key assumptions on which our outlook  
is based:
• the global hearing healthcare market will gradually  
normalise during h1 supported by the global roll-out  
of coronavirus vaccines, which will make it possible to 
lift coronavirus-related restrictions in developed markets.
• we expect a slower pace of normalisation in certain 
government channels and in emerging markets, and  
for the latter, the normalisation process may even go 
beyond 2021.
• we expect to see the release of some pent-up demand, 
predominantly in h2, but we also expect that some of 
this pent-up demand will not be released until 2022  
or beyond.
• despite strong comparative figures for 2020, we expect 
that the demand for headsets will continue to grow 
roughly in line with our medium- to long-term market 
growth estimates of 8-10%.

insights and highlights · outlook
at demant, a key objective is to continue our long-standing 
track record of growing our business. to achieve this, our 
strategic ambition is to further expand our position as a 
leading global hearing healthcare group by offering the 
broadest, deepest and most innovative portfolios of prod-
ucts and services across all distinct business areas. at the 
same time, we want to succeed in the highly attractive  
and fast-growing market for premium audio and video 
solutions. 
in this section, we share our view of how our respective 
markets will grow in the medium to long term, and to 
ensure transparency for external stakeholders, we pro- 
vide an overview of a number of other medium- to long-
term targets.
our markets
at their core, the two markets we address today, i.e. the 
hearing healthcare market and the market for audio solu-
tions for enterprise and gaming applications, both benefit 
from strong structural drivers of demand:
for our hearing healthcare segment, the market is first 
and foremost driven by favourable demographic trends. 
hearing loss strongly correlates with ageing, and as the 
size of the ageing population and the average life ex- 
pectancy are increasing globally, the growth trajectory  
is – except during the global pandemic – both stable and 
predictable. at the same time, penetration rates are in- 
creasing in several emerging markets, as awareness 
grows, hearing healthcare infrastructures improve, and  
the purchasing power increases – all supporting growth.
for our communications segment, the market for headsets 
is driven by the secular trend of increasing virtual collabo-
ration and digital communication. the trend is not least 
supported by the widespread focus by enterprises on re- 
ducing the costs and environmental footprint of business 
travelling and meetings and on increasing flexibility for 
employees. the coronavirus pandemic has significantly 
accelerated the adoption of virtual collaboration tools,  
and we expect continued growth due to this “new normal”. 
as far as gaming headsets are concerned, the key driver  
is increasing focus on home entertainment, including  
gaming, and the increasing extent to which gaming 
involves live communication between players.
our estimates of medium- to long-term value growth rates 
for each of our addressable markets are shown below.

organic growth
for the group, we aim to generate an organic growth rate above the market growth rate, which we  
estimate at around 4% per year in hearing healthcare and 8-10% per year in communications. we  
thus aim to increase our market share in both segments.
ebit margin
we aim to increase the ebit margin in each of our business areas over time. for the group as a whole, the 
ebit margin is subject to changes in business mix as well as to acquisitions and exchange rate effects.
capex
on an annual basis, we expect to invest around 4% of the group’s revenue in tangible and intangible  
assets (i.e. excluding customer loans and acquisitions).
gearing
we target a gearing multiple of 2.0-2.5 measured as net interest-bearing debt relative to ebitda  
(nibd/ebitda).*
capital allocation
subject to our gearing target, we will return any excess free cash flow after acquisitions to shareholders  
in the form of share buy-backs.
   
*our gearing target no longer excludes the impact of leasing. the target remains unchanged if adjusted for the estimated impact of leasing on our gearing of 0.3.

revenue 
for h2 2020, revenue in our hearing healthcare segment 
amounted to dkk 7,631 million, corresponding to a growth 
rate of 4% in local currencies with organic growth of 2% 
and acqusitive growth of less than 2%. exchange rates 
had an impact on revenue of -3%, and total reported 
growth for the period was around 0%. for the full year, 
growth in local currencies in hearing healthcare was -11% 
with organic growth of -13% and acquisitive growth of 
2%. as such, reported growth in hearing healthcare was 
-12% in 2020.
after the severe impact of coronavirus in h1, we saw  
significant recovery in h2 in hearing healthcare, particu-
larly in the first months of the period. growth in local cur-
rencies in hearing aids amounted to 1% with good perfor-
mance in sales to independent hearing care professionals 
and chains, particularly in europe, while sales in the us 
were hampered by a relatively slower recovery. moreover, 
low sales to government systems, including the nhs and 
va, and to export markets continued to be a drag on reve-
nue. in hearing care, we saw strong performance in a 
number of european markets, whereas the us market  
saw relatively slower recovery. revenue grew by 9% in 
local currencies supported by acquisitive growth of 4%. 
while revenue in hearing implants recovered partly from 
h1 to h2, growth in local currencies remained negative by 
9% in h2, as elective procedures, such as cochlear implant 
surgeries, were postponed in many markets. diagnostics 
showed strong resilience to difficult market conditions and 
returned to growth in h2 and delivered 6% growth in local 
currencies, not least driven by the service business. 
 
due to the it incident in september 2019, revenue in the 
comparative period was negatively impacted by an esti-
mated dkk 575 million, of which roughly dkk 300 million 
relates to hearing aids and dkk 275 million to hearing 
care. the table below shows underlying organic growth 
rates by business area adjusted for the estimated negative 
impact of the it incident.
gross profit 
gross profit increased by 1% to dkk 5,683 million in h2, 
resulting in a gross margin of 74.5%, or an increase of 0.5 
percentage point compared to h2 19. the gross margin 
expansion was primarily driven by an increased share of 
revenue generated by our hearing care business, which 
has a higher structural gross margin than our other 
hearing healthcare businesses. we only saw modest 
changes in gross margins within each of the business 
areas.
operating expenses (opex)
opex amounted to dkk 4,297 million in h2, corresponding 
to a decline in local currencies of 7%, reflecting the realisa-
tion of material savings throughout the year. the savings 
realised in h2 were both of a temporary and of a structural 
nature. the most important temporary savings included 
savings in sales and marketing costs and in travelling ex- 
penses. however, we also benefitted from global support 
from government compensation schemes of around dkk 
100 million (around dkk 350 million in h1) and from the 
reversal of part of a provision for bad debt recognised in 
h1 of dkk 50 million.

we also implemented structural savings of around dkk 
250 million on an annual basis, which had full effect in h2. 
these include savings related to the headcount reductions 
made in h1, which primarily relate to the elimination of 
double functions after the full integration of a large retail 
network acquired in the us in 2018. also, we have aligned 
our marketing model in our us retail network, which has 
improved efficiency in our sales and marketing activities. 
our store network remains largely unchanged. lastly, we 
expect to continue to achieve savings in travelling and con-
ference expenses, as we will continue to meet and collabo-
rate virtually to a larger extent than before the pandemic. 
by far, the major part of the structural savings impact dis-
tribution costs, whereas r&d costs and administrative 
expenses are only impacted to a minor degree.
for the full year, opex decreased by 8% in local curren- 
cies. apart from the material savings mentioned above,  
the full-year decrease includes a net effect of dkk 100  
million in extra costs from the provision for bad debt as 
well as support of approx. dkk 450 million from govern-
ment compensation schemes.
operating profit (ebit)
ebit in h2 amounted to dkk 1,425 million, corresponding 
to a growth rate of 43% compared to the same period in 
2019. the resulting ebit margin was 18.7%, or an increase 
of 5.0 percentage points from the reported margin in h2 
2019. despite subdued revenue in the reporting period,  
we managed to lift profitability materially, first and fore-
most due to tight cost control but also due to support from 
government compensation schemes and the partial rever-
sal of the provision for bad debt made in h1 as mentioned 
above. furthermore, ebit in the comparative period was 
negatively impacted by an estimated dkk 550 million as  
a result of the it incident.
profitability was especially strong in hearing care, which 
benefitted from some pent-up demand in europe that 
resulted in a higher-than-normal return on sales and mar-
keting activities, but we also saw improved profitability in 
hearing aids and hearing implants driven by material cost 
savings, while profitability was flattish in diagnostics.
for the full year, ebit amounted to dkk 1,211 million with 
a corresponding margin of 9.2%.

market developments
based on available market statistics, covering around two 
thirds of the market, and on our own internal assumptions, 
we estimate that the global hearing aid market saw unit 
growth of around -15% in 2020 after having been signifi-
cantly impacted by coronavirus and the resulting lock-
downs, particularly in q2.
we saw significant recovery in the global hearing aid  
market in q3 and at the beginning of q4, but the spike in 
new coronavirus infections that swept across most major 
markets from around the end of october caused the recov-
ery to pause at the end of the year. at the very end of the 
year, growth even decelerated in some markets, including 
the uk and to a lesser extent the us. for q4, we estimate 
that global unit growth was around -4%.
despite the negative market growth in 2020, we see no 
changes in the fundamental drivers of demand for hearing 
aids: the size of the ageing population continues to in- 
crease globally, we live longer, and infrastructure and  
purchasing power are improving in a number of emerging 
markets. consequently, we believe that the underlying 
need for hearing aids is largely unaffected by coronavirus 
and that the market will return to the structural level of 
4-6% unit growth per year. in fact, we believe that the 
hearing aid market will see some tailwinds over the coming 
years when at least part of the pent-up demand from 2020 
is released. we estimate that total sales in the global hear-
ing aid market dropped by more than 3 million units com-
pared to what we would have seen if coronavirus had not 
occurred. this clearly indicates that many users – existing  
as well as new ones – are likely to seek assistance over the 
coming years, but both the magnitude and the timing of 
the release of such pent-up demand remain uncertain.
north america was severely impacted by coronavirus  
with estimated unit growth of -18% in 2020. in the us,  
the impact on the large public channel, veterans affairs 
(va), was particularly severe in q2 and subsequently, va 
saw slower recovery than the commercial market. growth 
in canada was slightly less negative than in the us.
in europe, we estimate that unit growth was around -15% 
in 2020. all markets were severely impacted by coronavi-
rus, but the commercial markets in europe recovered at a 
faster pace than the us market and also showed better 
resilience when the second wave of coronavirus hit in q4. 
however, unit growth in the large public channel in the uk, 
the nhs, lagged considerably behind unit growth in the 
commercial market and thus had a negative impact on  
the total growth rate in europe.
looking beyond the us and europe, we estimate that unit 
growth in japan was less negative than in europe and that 
unit growth in australia was flattish.
there are no reliable industry statistics available on the 
development of prices in the global hearing aid market,  
and given the dynamic market environment in 2020, we 
are unable to accurately estimate the development in  
asps on the hearing aid market.
with regard to the new over-the-counter (otc) category  
of hearing aids, the us food and drug administration 
(fda) has yet to issue a draft ruling in order to establish 
the new category, and the timing remains uncertain. such 
draft ruling will go out for consultation before a final ruling 
is issued. we maintain our view that any impact of the  
otc category will be limited.

the negative impact of coronavirus was most pronounced 
in h1 where a strong start to the year was disrupted by 
strict lockdowns in virtually all major markets from around 
mid-march. supported by pent-up demand in europe, we 
saw better-than-expected recovery in most markets and 
channels from the beginning of h2. growth in h2 was 1% 
in local currencies, which includes around 8 percentage 
points from the negative impact of the it incident last year 
on the comparative figures. growth was supported by 
sales to hearing care, which grew by 12% thanks to the 
strong recovery of that particular business area in the pe-
riod combined with a slight increase in the share of wallet.
the asp grew by 6% in h2, as differences in the pace of 
recovery between channels and markets led to positive  
mix changes. unit growth was -5%.
on 30 november 2020, we announced the launch of  
new flagship hearing aids in all our four hearing aid 
brands: oticon, philips hearing solutions, bernafon and 
sonic. these include oticon more™, which is the world’s 
first hearing aid with an on-board deep neural network 
that provides superior sound processing (please refer to  
the text box on page 33 for more details). in addition to 
market- leading audiological concepts, the new products 
feature both ios and android connectivity and are pre-
pared for bluetooth le audio. the products have now been 
rolled out in most major markets in the powerful minirite 
rechargeable style and at three upper price points, and  
we have received excellent feedback from customers and 
users. due to the timing of the launch, the new range  
of products had no material financial impact in 2020, but 
we are now very well positioned to address the needs of 
customers and users in 2021 and beyond.
in terms of geographies, europe saw relatively fast-paced 
recovery in q3 after a challenging h1, and the second 
wave of coronavirus, which started in autumn, and the 
ensuing lockdowns only had limited effect on our revenue. 
overall, our growth in 2020 was most persistent – and 
positive – in the scandinavian countries, but several of our 
other major markets also performed well under the circum-
stances, including germany, france and spain. despite the 
improvements we saw towards the end of the year, the  
uk was a drag on growth, which is mostly due to the slow 
recovery in sales to the nhs.
our growth in north america was more heavily impacted 
by coronavirus than growth in europe. in the us, the low 
point in terms of growth came slightly later than in europe, 
but the recovery was also significantly slower and ulti-
mately stalled in the last months of the year, as infections 
resurged and new restrictions were imposed in most 
states. especially the recovery in va was very slow. in 
canada, the impact of coronavirus was less severe. for 
north america as a whole, pent-up demand did not ma- 
terialise in 2020, which represents a potential upside for 
the coming years.
in asia, we saw solid organic growth despite the pan- 
demic. this was primarily driven by the success in china 
following the introduction of philips hearing solutions at 
the beginning of 2020. at the same time, we saw solid 
growth in south korea and only slightly negative organic 
growth in japan. the pacific region delivered slightly ne- 
gative organic growth, whereas the other countries region 
– which comprises a number of emerging markets – was 
severely impacted by coronavirus.

hearing care
a resilient business model in hearing care
in 2020, our global hearing care business area was  
challenged by several rounds of lockdowns in most  
of our markets, but our business model proved very  
resilient thanks to new and innovative approaches and 
the flexibility and dedication of our employees. during 
the first lockdowns in march and april, almost all our
clinics all over the world were closed. however, fol- 
lowing the general reopenings in may, we found new 
ways of operating our business and servicing our  
customers, while ensuring their safety as well as the
safety of our employees. this included combining 
remote services via app and telephone with safe
physical visits to our clinics where we use both gloves 
and face masks. consequently, we have since may
managed to keep most of our clinics open, even in  
times when other retail shops have been closed  
and general instructions have been to stay at home.  
hearing healthcare is considered essential healthcare 
by public authorities, and in these extraordinary cir- 
cumstances, we have thus been able to service both 
existing and new customers at a level that comes  
very close to our normal level.

market developments
please refer to market developments in the hearing aids 
section above for details on developments in the hearing 
aid market in 2020. under normal circumstances, growth 
rates in the hearing aid retail and wholesale markets are 
relatively similar, but we have seen notable differences in 
2020 as a result of coronavirus, especially in the hearing 
aid wholesale market, which includes government chan-
nels, such as va in the us and the nhs in the uk, which 
have both been hit relatively harder by coronavirus than 
the commercial market. consequently, we estimate that 
unit growth in the hearing aid retail market was slightly 
better than in the hearing aid wholesale market.
business update
in 2020, our hearing care business, covering our hearing 
aid retailing activities, saw growth of -12% in local curren-
cies with organic growth of -16% and acquisitive growth 
of 4%, primarily in france. exchange rate effects were  
-2%, resulting in growth of -13% in reported terms.
naturally, coronavirus had a very significant negative  
impact on growth in 2020. the peak impact was seen  
in spring where revenue dropped by almost 80%. sub- 
sequently, we saw healthy recovery in h2, not least in 
europe, despite new lockdowns in most markets from 
around the end of october in response to the rising number 
of infections. in h2, growth was to 9% in local currencies, 
which includes around 9 percentage points from the nega-
tive impact of the it incident last year on the comparative 
figures.
when lockdowns were re-enforced in h2, hearing aid clin-
ics were generally classified as essential healthcare, and 
they were thus allowed to remain open. many people had 
then learned to cope with some level of restrictions being 
part of their everyday life, and hearing aid users were gen-
erally comfortable visiting our clinics thanks to our efforts 
to maintain very high standards for cleaning and hygiene. 
when lockdowns were originally enforced in spring, we 
saw a temporary increase in the demand for remote care 
solutions and telephone consultations, but we have largely 
seen this demand return to the normal level, and we be- 
lieve that this clearly confirms the need for in-person coun-
selling and for hearing care professionals playing an active 
part throughout the user journey.
in europe, our revenue saw strong recovery in h2 and al- 
most reached the normal level. our key growth drivers in 
2020 were france and ireland, whereas the uk and italy 
were most severely impacted by coronavirus. the uk was 
relatively slow to recover but saw significant improvement 
during most of h2, until the situation started to deteriorate 
again at the very end of the year.
the recovery in north america was slower than in europe, 
and in both the us and canada, it stalled towards the end 
of the year. in the us, the impact of coronavirus has dif-
fered significantly from state to state, but the halt in the 
recovery towards the end of the year was relatively broad-
based. in canada, acquisitions contributed slightly to 
growth.
in australia, the impact of coronavirus in h1 was slightly 
less severe than in europe. in h2, however, revenue re- 
mained below the normal level due to regional lockdowns, 
although we saw positive reported growth driven by low 
comparative figures due to the it incident.

hearing implants
market developments
with less than 5% of the people that could benefit from  
an implantable solution actually being treated, the cochlear 
implant (ci) market remains heavily underpenetrated and 
the unfulfilled need remains significant. while ci solutions 
have become the standard of care for children born with  
a profound hearing loss in developed markets, increased 
awareness and clinical research continue to fuel the  
adoption of ci solutions among adults and seniors. in  
addition, improved hearing healthcare infrastructure,  
public funding and higher purchasing power are some  
of the drivers of the increase in the adoption of ci solu- 
tions among children in developing markets. aside from  
the significant improvement of the patient’s quality of life,  
the benefits of ci solutions are from a societal standpoint  
gaining more and more ground. the aggregated societal 
lifetime cost of profound hearing loss and deafness greatly 
outweighs the cost of cochlear implant surgery, and the 
economic rationale behind cochlear implants is one of  
the growth drivers in the industry.
the market for bone anchored hearing solutions (bahs)  
is considered one of the fastest growing segments in  
hearing healthcare with annual growth rates in value  
of 10-15%, although annual growth rates are subject to  
significant fluctuations year-over-year, depending on the 
timing of product launches. the penetration of bahs  
solutions is still very low – even in developed markets  
– and the fundamental growth drivers of the bahs market 
include increasing awareness and improved reimbursement 
schemes. in addition, better patient outcomes and contin-
ued product innovation are key to fuelling market growth 
and further penetrating the market. there are several  
solutions in the marketplace that address some of the  
clinical indicators pointing towards the advantages of 
using bone conduction devices, including passive and 
active transcutaneous systems (without abutment but  
with an implant that is connected to an external sound 
processor through magnetic attraction) as well as percu- 
taneous systems (with abutment), which are still the gold 
standard. the widespread penetration of other solutions 
will depend heavily on whether the solutions are adopted 
for distribution through the highly diverse reimbursement 
systems that exist around the world.
the hearing implants market was heavily impacted by the 
outbreak of coronavirus in 2020. as the virus spread across 
the globe and hospitalisations increased, resources were 
allocated to patients infected with coronavirus, while elec-
tive surgeries, such as ci procedures, were postponed. 
while the overall market recovered from the low point in 
spring, the pace of the recovery was slower than in other 
areas of hearing healthcare, not least in emerging markets, 
and with the resurge in the number of infections in autumn 
and winter, elective surgeries were once again postponed. 
overall, we estimate that the ci market declined by around 
20% in 2020, which is significantly below our expectations 
of 10-12% growth under normal circumstances. we esti- 
mate that the bahs market declined by more than 20%, 
which is also significantly below our normal expectations 
of market growth of 10-15%. however, we expect to see  
a normalisation of the market in 2021, but it is still too 
early to conclude if the market will benefit from pent-up 
demand, which is highly dependent on capacity and 
resource allocation.
business update
in 2020, our hearing implants business area, which oper-
ates under the oticon medical brand, realised -13% growth 
in local currencies, which was entirely organic growth.
sales were heavily impacted by widespread lockdowns  
in virtually all markets and the resulting postponement of 
elective surgeries, particularly in the ci market. our bahs 
business was also severely impacted, but sales of sound 
processors, including upgrades, supported the business 
during the year.

coclear implants
our ci business was heavily impacted by the outbreak of 
coronavirus in spring, and the activity level quickly dropped 
to almost zero, as hospitals in virtually all markets where 
we are present prioritised coronavirus treatment. while we 
have seen recovery in sales since the low point in spring, 
this has happened at a slower pace than in other parts of 
the hearing healthcare market, and hospitals have priori-
tised surgeries of paediatric patients, which is an area 
where our exposure is lower than in the adult segment. 
still, we started to see revenue growth in a number of mar-
kets in h2, including germany and italy, whereas france, 
our biggest market, continued to record negative growth, 
albeit to a much lesser extent than in h1. while the devel-
opment was encouraging in most of the developed mar-
kets, sales to emerging markets continued to be a drag  
in h2 with only limited tender activity owing to the contin-
ued impact of coronavirus on both healthcare systems  
and public finances.
our r&d efforts have continued in 2020, and earlier this 
year, we submitted our final application to the fda for 
pre-market approval of the neuro system in the us. we 
expect to be able to access the us market in h2 2021 at 
the earliest. we also published an updated reliability 
report, demonstrating that our neuro system is one of  
the most reliable systems in the industry, which continues 
to be a driver in our dialogue with key opinion leaders and 
enables us to increase our penetration into clinics all over 
the world.
bone anchored hearing systems 
our bahs business was also impacted by coronavirus, 
albeit to a lesser extent than the ci business, and despite  
a negative development in revenue, we gained significant 
market share in 2020. the business entered 2020 on a 
high note by continuing the very strong growth we had 
seen in 2019 after the launch of the ponto 4 sound pro- 
cessor with its industry-leading audiology and wireless 
streaming from smartphones. however, coronavirus also 
impacted bahs sales significantly, and growth in h1 was 
slightly negative. we have seen encouraging recovery from 
the low point in spring driven by sound processor upgrades 
and temporary soft-band solutions that allow patients to 
start using the system while waiting for the actual implan-
tation. on a sequential basis, we saw a material uplift in 
sales in h2, but due to strong comparative figures, growth 
was slightly more negative than in h1. from a geographic 
perspective, we recorded strong growth in a range of mar-
kets, including france, germany and the netherlands, 
whereas growth was negative in the us and the uk,  
our two largest markets.
in early spring, oticon medical introduced connectivity 
solutions for neuro 2 worldwide, which was an impor-
tant step for the neuro system to become a truly pre- 
mium offering in the market for cochlear implants. a few 
months later, in summer, the neuro 2 swim kit solution 
was launched, featuring a waterproof solution that is 
highly functional, reliable and reusable. with these re- 
leases, neuro 2 is a highly attractive solution for new 
candidates and existing users looking for the ultimate 
combination of sound quality, aesthetics and ease of use.

diagnostics
market developments 
we estimate that in 2020, the global market for diagnostic 
instruments and accessories related to hearing healthcare 
declined by approx. 10% compared to 2019 due to corona-
virus. the impact of coronavirus varied significantly be- 
tween product categories and segments, with audiometers 
and equipment for hearing aid fitting, impedance and 
otoacoustic emissions (oae) declining by around 20%, 
while other categories, including disposables, balance 
equipment and diagnostic auditory brainstem response 
(abr) equipment, only saw modest declines or even slight 
growth. the negative market growth is significantly below 
our long-term growth expectations of 3-5%, which we 
believe are intact despite the significant – but temporary  
– impact of coronavirus. despite coronavirus, the market 
for diagnostic equipment for hearing and balancing pur-
poses is constantly developing – not only from a product 
perspective but also due to the increasing importance of 
software solutions and customer database management 
as well as ongoing consolidation in the industry. 
business update
with 2% growth in local currencies of which organic 
growth accounted for 1 percentage point, we succeeded  
in expanding our market-leading position in diagnostics  
in 2020 with significant market share gains in a market 
that had declined due to coronavirus.
at the beginning of 2020, diagnostics continued its strong 
momentum from the year before and delivered strong 
growth. however, in line with the development in other 
parts of the hearing healthcare market, the outbreak of 
coronavirus in spring had a severe negative impact on  
the sales of diagnostic equipment, and we saw a mate- 
rial slowdown in new orders. in h2, we saw encouraging 
recovery and returned to growth in local currencies. al- 
though instrument sales continued to be impacted by  
a lower activity level in some customer segments, we  
saw strong recovery in revenue generated by our  
service business thanks to pent-up demand.
from a geographic perspective, we saw full-year growth  
in both pacific and asia driven by australia, china and 
south korea. in europe, revenue rose in h2 with strong 
sales growth in a number of markets, including germany, 
france and switzerland. despite the positive recovery in 
h2, growth was flat in europe for the full year. we also 
saw recovery in sales in the us in h2, but it lagged behind 
other regions due to the continued impact of coronavirus. 
diagnostics has a higher share of sales to emerging mar-
kets than other hearing healthcare businesses in the group, 
which has been a drag on revenue growth during the year 
due to the severe impact of coronavirus in these markets.
the past year has been another successful year for our 
multi-brand strategy, which allows us to focus on separate 
segments and customers and thereby increasing our al- 
ready significant market share in the market as a whole. 
our success is, among other factors, due to strong per- 
formance by our biggest brand, interacoustics, which  
managed to grow its business even in a year that was 
heavily impacted by coronavirus. the strong performance 
was partly driven by affinity compact in the hearing aid 
fitting segment and by significant growth in the balance 
segment.

interacoustics launches new solution for diagnosing 
dizzy patients 
a new milestone in diagnosing patients with balance 
conditions was reached in autumn 2020 when the  
third generation of micromedical visualeyes™ by 
interacoustics was launched. the product is the new 
generation of diagnostic equipment aimed at helping 
patients with balance and dizziness issues both in the 
vestibular system and in the central nervous system.  
the new visualeyes™ system features more applica-
tions, for example the eyeseecam vhit and several 
new tests, which makes the product relevant to more 
patient and customer groups.

communications
introduction
in the following sections, we review the income statement 
for our communications segment, which only comprises  
our headset business and operates under the epos brand. 
epos was fully consolidated into the group with financial 
effect from 1 january 2020 as a result of the demerger of  
sennheiser communications, our 50/50 joint venture with 
sennheiser electronic gmbh & co. kg. the joint venture 
only focused on r&d and production and had no external 
distribution activities, as products were distributed through 
the subsidiaries of our joint venture partner. consequently, 
the composition of the income statement has changed, so 
there are no accurate comparative figures for 2019. 
revenue
in h2, revenue in communications amounted to dkk 760 
million, which is significantly above our initial plans for the 
half-year. this reflects sequential growth of 39% compared 
to h1 driven by an acceleration of the already strong de-
mand for virtual collaboration tools, which started in mid-
march. all in all, revenue for the full year amounted to dkk 
1,306 million, which is significantly above our initial plans 
despite a slow start to the year.
performance was strong in both enterprise solutions and 
gaming, and revenue in both areas exceeded our plans to 
roughly the same extent. from a geographic perspective, 
sales exceeded our plans in all regions, but we saw extra-
ordinarily strong performance in europe, the historic strong-
hold of the business, and almost two-thirds of epos’s reve-
nue in 2020 was generated in this region. revenue in north 
america accounted for roughly one fourth of total revenue 
followed by asia and pacific, and we see ample opportu- 
nities to grow our market shares in these regions.
gross profit 
gross profit was dkk 402 million in h2, resulting in a gross 
margin of 52.9%. this corresponds to a margin expansion 
of 6.2 percentage points compared to h1 where significant-
ly higher-than-normal freight charges and a particularly high 
demand for usb headsets, which have a relatively lower 
gross margin, had a dilutive effect on the gross margin.  
for the full year, the gross margin was 50.3%.
operating expenses (opex)
opex amounted to dkk 321 million in h2, corresponding  
to a sequential growth rate of 37% from h1. the significant 
sequential growth reflects the strong revenue growth we 
have seen in the business, as we have continued to invest 
further in r&d and distribution activities, including sales and 
marketing activities. as outlined in the financial review for 
the group, extraordinary branding costs were recognised 
as one-offs in 2020, but the total level was below our origi-
nal expectations, as trade fairs and other activities were to 
a large extent cancelled in 2020 due to coronavirus. some 
of these activities are, however, likely to take place in 2021 
instead.
operating profit (ebit) 
ebit for h2 amounted to dkk 81 million, corresponding to 
an ebit margin of 10.7%. compared to h1, the significant 
margin improvement of 6.9 percentage points was driven 
by higher revenue and an improved gross margin. although 
not directly comparable, ebit was 113% higher than the 
group’s share of profit after tax in the joint venture in h2 
2019, i.e. prior to the demerger.
ebit for the full year was dkk 102 million, corresponding  
to a growth rate of 55% compared to the group’s share of 
profit after tax in the joint venture in 2019 and to an ebit 
margin of 7.8%.

market developments
 
enterprise headsets
in the past year, the market witnessed a surge in demand 
for headsets and virtual collaboration tools following the 
outbreak of coronavirus, and we estimate that the enter-
prise headset market has seen growth of around 30% in 
2020. the global pandemic has led to a significant increase 
in remote working and a general acceleration of digitali- 
sation, and enterprises around the world have become  
accustomed to online meetings as a substitute for travel-
ling. this has naturally boosted the demand for profession-
al audio and video devices significantly. our expectations  
of a structural growth rate in the underlying market remain 
unchanged at 8-10% per year, and while the coronavirus 
pandemic has boosted market growth in 2020, we expect 
that the enterprise headset market will continue to grow  
at these historic rates in the coming years.
gaming headsets
the market for gaming headsets has also experienced sig-
nificant tailwind from the pandemic due to the increase in 
online gaming that we have seen in the past year, and the 
market grew significantly more than the 8-10% that we 
see as the structural growth rate for the market. aside  
from the abnormal tailwind in 2020, the gaming commu- 
nity continues to grow with the increasing popularity of 
esports across the globe. as the average age of gamers 
continues to go up, the demand for high-end solutions and 
premium headsets is expected to develop favourably and 
support growth in the overall market value. on the product 
side, the wireless trend we have seen in the past years in  
consumer headsets is now also catching on in the gaming 
segment, driving an opportunity for smaller in-ear form 
factors.
business update
our communications business specialises in premium 
audio and video solutions for enterprises and gamers, 
offering cutting-edge design and performance based  
on leading and advanced technologies under the epos 
brand. driven by the surge in demand for headsets and  
virtual collaboration tools, the performance of epos  
greatly exceeded our initial expectations for 2020 and  
contributed 9 percentage points to the group’s growth  
in local currencies. 
after a soft start to the year where supply chain head-
winds hampered sales, epos succeeded in exploiting the 
strong demand for headsets that arose as the pandemic 
spread across the globe from around mid-march. in par- 
ticular, we experienced strong demand for usb-wired 
products, and we also saw significant growth in sales 
through online channels. the strong demand continued 
throughout the year, and in h2, we successfully increased  
our production capacity and thus unit sales, the former 
having been a limiting factor in h1. despite the increased 
production capacity, we still had a higher-than-normal 
level of open orders at the end of 2020.
after having assumed end-to-end responsibility for distri-
bution and establishing sales subsidiaries in many markets 
as part of the demerger process, epos was ready for an 
eventful year with focus on ensuring the successful launch  
of a completely new brand as well as new premium prod-
ucts. as a consequence of coronavirus, we had to adjust 
the launch of the epos brand in 2020, which was originally 
planned – among other marketing initiatives – to be fuelled 
by our presence at a range of trade fairs and conferences, 
which were, however, cancelled. instead, we converted to 
virtual set-ups, and marketing initiatives were to a large 
extent conducted online due to the increased working-
from-home trend.

epos launches “understanding sound experiences” 
report and highly successful “bad audio is bad 
business” campaign
bad audio is bad business, and “what?” is the most  
expensive word in business today. this is the clear  
conclusion of the latest survey performed by epos, which 
finds that 95% of audio end-users and decision-makers 
experience pain points relating to sound that affect their 
concentration or efficiency at work. launched along with 
the successful “bad audio is bad business” campaign, 
epos’s marketing efforts have secured maximum global 
reach, strong brand engagement and a significant 
increase in the voice of the epos brand.

dividend and share buy-backs
the company uses its substantial cash flow from operating 
activities for investments and acquisitions, and any excess 
liquidity will be used for continuous share buy-backs. 
until the next annual general meeting in march 2021, the 
board of directors has been authorised to let the company 
buy back shares at a nominal value of up to 10% of the 
share capital. the purchase price may, however, not de- 
viate by more than 10% from the price quoted on nasdaq 
copenhagen.
investor relations (ir)
demant strives to ensure a steady and consistent flow  
of information to ir stakeholders in order to promote the 
basis for a fair pricing of the company’s shares – pricing 
that will at any time reflect the company’s strategies, 
financial capabilities and outlook for the future. the flow 
of information will contribute to a reduction of the com- 
pany-specific risk associated with investing in demant 
shares, thereby leading to a reduction of the company’s 
cost of capital.
we aim to reach this goal by continuously providing rele- 
vant, correct, adequate and timely information in our com-
pany announcements. in addition to the statutory publi- 
cation of annual reports and interim reports, we publish 
quarterly interim management statements, containing 
updates on the group and its financial position and re- 
sults in relation to the full-year outlook, including updates 
on important events and transactions in the period under 
review. our interim management statements do not in- 
clude actual figures.
with the release of the annual report 2020, we have 
increased the level of disclosure by providing segmental 
profit and loss statements for hearing healthcare and 
communications, and with respect to the former, we have 
decided to report revenue separately for our hearing aids 
and hearing care businesses. both initiatives serve the 
purpose of providing relevant, correct and adequate  
information about our group.
we strive to maintain an active and open dialogue with 
analysts as well as current and potential investors, which 
helps us stay updated on the views, interests and opinions 
of the company’s various stakeholders. at our annual ge- 
neral meeting and through presentations, individual meet-
ings, participation in investor conferences, webcasts, capi-
tal market days etc., we aim to maintain an ongoing dia-
logue with a broad spectrum of ir stakeholders, and in 
2020, we held more than 450 investor meetings and pre- 
sentations. in 2020, the vast majority of these meetings 
were held in virtual settings because of travel restrictions 
and social distancing measures, but we expect – and  
welcome – an increase in the number of virtual meetings  
in the coming years. we also use our website,  
www.demant.com, as a means of communication with  
our stakeholders. at the end of 2020, 26 equity analysts 
were covering demant. we refer to our website for a full 
list of analyst coverage.
demant has a three-week quiet period prior to publication 
of annual reports, interim reports and interim management 
statements where communication with ir stakeholders is 
restricted.

william demant foundation, demant’s majority share- 
holder, was founded in 1957 by william demant, son of 
the company’s founder hans demant. its primary goal is  
to safeguard and expand the demant group’s business 
and provide support for various commercial and charitable 
causes with particular focus on the fields of audiology and 
hearing impairment. william demant invest, which is a 
wholly owned holding company for all william demant 
foundation’s investment activities, holds the foundation’s 
shares in demant. charitable tasks are thus handled by 
the foundation itself and the foundation’s investment 
activities by william demant invest. voting rights and  
decisions to buy and sell demant shares are still exercised 
and made, respectively, by william demant foundation. 
in accordance with william demant invest’s investment 
strategy, the foundation’s investments – apart from an 
ownership interest in demant – also include other assets, 
as william demant invest can make active investments in 
companies whose business model and structure resemble 
those of the demant group but fall outside the group’s 
strategic sphere of interest. the investments include, 
among others, majority ownership of Össur and vision rt. 
the foundation has made a management agreement  
on a commercial arm’s length basis with demant, which  
governs the exchange of various investment support and 
administrative services between the foundation, william 
demant invest and demant. please also see note 8.1.

risk management  
activities
risk management activities
risk management activities in the demant group first and 
foremost focus on the business-related and financial risks 
to which the group is fairly likely to be exposed. in connec-
tion with the preparation of the group’s strategic, budget-
ary and annual plans, the board of directors considers the 
risks identified. 
in general, we act in a stable market with a limited number 
of players, and under normal circumstances, the risks to 
which the group may be exposed do not change in the 
short term.
business risks 
the major risks to which the group may be exposed are of 
a business nature – be they risks within the group’s control 
or external risks due to, for instance, the behaviour of the 
competition. 
coronavirus
for most of 2020, coronavirus presented a challenge to  
the group beyond comparison, and while we are always 
exposed to the inherent risk of working in physical proxi- 
mity to our users, patients and customers, the global pan-
demic was unprecedented. we faced widespread lock-
downs in virtually all hearing healthcare markets, and 
many activities in our group came to an almost complete 
stop, which included the temporary closure of hearing  
clinics and the postponement of elective surgeries, such  
as cochlear implant surgeries. going into 2021, coronavirus 
continues to pose a risk to our business, but as we learned 
in 2020 where we saw remarkable recovery in the hearing 
healthcare market as governments eased restrictions, there 
have been no changes to the fundamental driver of de- 
mand for hearing healthcare.
innovation
aside from coronavirus, the hearing healthcare market  
in which we act is a highly product-driven market where 
our significant r&d initiatives help underpin our market 
position. it is thus vital in the long term to maintain our 
innovative edge and to attract the most qualified and  
competent staff. our continuous development of new  
products carries inherent product risks, including the risk  
of delay of launches of new products. an important part  
of our ongoing product innovation is to take out, protect 
and maintain patents for our own groundbreaking product 
development and technology. these are indeed complicated 
processes in the hearing healthcare industry, and we  
therefore continue to maintain and develop our competen-
cies in this area. it is our policy to continuously watch that 
third-party products do not infringe our patents and that 
our products do not infringe third-party patents. from time 
to time, the group is involved in legal disputes, but we  
are of the opinion that these do not or will not significantly 
affect the group’s financial position. as a rule, we seek to 
make adequate provisions for legal proceedings. 
supply
we closely monitor our supply situation and seek to ensure 
that we always have an inventory level that can counter 
any interruptions in production. in 2020, the outbreak of 
coronavirus presented a challenge to the supply of goods 
and raw materials in many industries, including the mar- 
kets for hearing healthcare and professional headsets, but 
due to the close monitoring of our supply situation, we did 
not face any critical disruptions to our operations. we do, 
on a continuous basis, evaluate the geographical location 
and dependency of key suppliers of raw materials and 
components to ensure that we strike the right balance 
between flexibility, exposure and costs. 
product recalls
product recalls also constitute a business risk in relation  
to bone anchored hearing systems and cochlear implants, 
specifically in relation to claims-related costs, such as the 
cost of replacing products, medical expenses, compensa-
tion for actual damage as well as legal fees. we seek to 
minimise the risk of product recalls by meeting detailed 
production requirements, by living up to well-defined  
quality control standards and by extensive testing.
regulatory risks
as a major player in the hearing healthcare market, the 
group is also exposed to certain regulatory risks in terms 
of changes to product requirements, reimbursement 
schemes and public tenders in the markets where we  
operate. in august 2017, us lawmakers passed new  
legislation, requiring the food and drug administration 
(fda) to introduce a new over-the-counter (otc) cate- 
gory of hearing aids within three years. the formal dead-
line for the release of the draft legislation has now been 
exceeded, and it remains unclear when the otc category 
will be established. in any case, we expect any impact of 
this legislation on the hearing aid industry to be limited, but 
until the final design of the category has been defined by 
the fda, the impact of this legislation is considered part  
of the regulatory risks to which the group is exposed. 
over the past couple of years, we have seen an increasing 
part of hearing aid purchases in the us being covered 
either partly or fully by insurance. the resulting emergence 
of a number of large managed care organisations could 
potentially pose a risk to the asp in hearing aids due to 
consolidation on fewer hands of large volumes of hearing 
aids. it could, however, also pose a risk to our hearing care 
corporate information · risk management activities
49
demant · annual report 2020
corporate information · risk management activities
business, as managed care organisations aim to capture 
the margin on product sales at the expense of hearing aid 
retailers by only offering retailers a fee for performing the 
actual fitting of the hearing aids. in response to this trend, 
we are working on adapting our operating model to a 
higher level of efficiency, which we have already done in 
other markets that have seen changes to reimbursement 
schemes over the years. 
on a similar note, discussions are currently ongoing in  
the us about potentially introducing medicare coverage  
for hearing aids. even though these discussions are still  
at an early stage, the passing of legislation to that effect 
could potentially pose a risk for hearing aid sales in the  
us, depending on the final design of such legislation.
while we closely follow the progress of the uk’s exit from 
the eu (brexit), we do not expect any significant impact  
on our business, as medical equipment is exempt from 
import duty. in addition, we have sufficient inventory in 
local stock, and we do not expect brexit to result in any 
significant disruption of the supply of medical equipment 
into the uk. it is the nature of our business to operate 
across markets with different characteristics, including  
different customs clearance processes. our logistical and 
operational set-ups are flexible, and short lead times allow 
us to adapt to the business environment. 
overall, we feel well positioned to respond to regulatory 
changes, and our broad presence in the hearing health- 
care market should help minimise any impact on the  
group as a whole. 
it infrastructure
being a large, global organisation, we are naturally de- 
pendent on a number of it systems and on the general  
it infrastructure to operate efficiently across our value 
chain. this entails the risk of system errors, human errors, 
data breaches or other interruptions that may impact the 
group financially. we continuously seek to minimise these 
risks, and our it strategy includes both prevention and  
contingency plans. 
as our group becomes increasingly digitalised, more de- 
vices and control systems are connected online, resulting  
in a broader interface across the it infrastructure that 
could potentially be compromised. threats may include 
attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial  
of service and other digital security breaches. in september 
2019, the group’s it infrastructure was hit by cybercrime. 
after thorough investigations, we concluded that no per-
sonal data had been exposed, extracted or accessed as  
a result of the incident. the it incident was reported to the 
danish data protection agency (ddpa) in accordance with 
the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), and  
in 2020, we received the agency’s final assessment of the 
incident. the agency found that we had processed person-
al data in accordance with the provisions of the gdpr, and 
it did not express any criticism of demant’s security level or 
handling of the matter. the final assessment concluded the 
agency’s investigation of the matter. the us office for 
consumer rights (ocr) is also reviewing our response  
to the it incident based on concern raised by a consumer.  
we are still awaiting the assessment from the ocr.
we are – and will continue to be – committed to continu-
ously improving the group’s it security. during the recovery 
process from the it incident, we took steps to initiate a 
wide range of security activities and detection measures  
to further improve the level of it security. we have con-
ducted a maturity assessment of our it security based  
on the cybersecurity framework of the national institute  
of standards and technology (nist) to focus our work on  
relevant parameters. the increasing digitalisation also 
means increased volume and complexity of the personal 
data collected by the group. 
sustainability risks
the demant group is by nature an impact business that 
seeks to make a true difference for people living with  
hearing loss, and the group thus contributes directly to 
improving world health. as a natural part of operating our 
business, we seek to limit the risk of adversely impacting 
our employees, society and the environment – in such areas 
as human and labour rights, retention, co2 emissions as 
well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption – by working with 
the four pillars of our sustainability framework, which pri-
marily have to do with our operational practices: people 
and culture, society and local community, environment and 
climate and business ethics and governance. for each pil-
lar, we have individual ambitions, initiatives and targets 
that drive our progress. please also refer to our 2020 
sustainability report. 
financial risks 
financial risk management concentrates on identifying 
risks in respect of exchange rates, interest rates, credit  
and liquidity with a view to protecting the group against 
potential losses and ensuring that our forecasts for the  
current year are only to a limited extent affected by changes 
or events in the surrounding world. it is the group’s policy 
to exclusively hedge financial risks arising from our com-
mercial activities and not to undertake any financial trans- 
actions of a speculative nature. 
exchange rate risks 
with around two-thirds of the group’s sales being invoiced 
in other currencies than danish kroner and euros, reported 
revenue is significantly affected by movements in the 
group’s trading currencies. the group seeks to hedge 
against exchange rate risks – mainly through forward 
exchange contracts with a horizon of up to 18 months.  
in relation to exchange rate fluctuations, hedging provides 
some predictability in terms of profit and gives us the 
opportunity – and necessary time – to potentially redirect 
business arrangements in the event of persistent changes 
in foreign exchange rates. besides entering into forward 
exchange contracts, the group aims to hedge such chang-
es in foreign exchange rates by seeking to match positive 
and negative cash flows in the main currencies as much  
as possible.

corporate information · risk management activities
please see note 2.2 for the impact on consolidated operat-
ing profit (ebit) and equity for the year, given a change of 
5% in the currencies with the highest exposure. 
please see note 2.3 for an overview of the material forward 
exchange contracts in place as of 31 december 2020 to 
hedge against the group’s exposure to movements in ex- 
change rates. 
at the end of 2020, the fair value of the group’s forward 
exchange contracts was dkk 68 million, consisting of  
unrealised gains of dkk 80 million and losses of dkk 12  
million. please refer to note 2.3 and 4.4 for more details. 
interest rate risks 
in order to secure attractive interest rates for the group  
in the long term and as a consequence of our attractive 
funding possibilities in the financial market, more than  
half of the group’s debt is funded through medium-term  
committed facilities with fixed rates and through financial 
instruments, which limits the interest rate risk. all in all, the 
group’s interest expenses are very low with a manageable 
interest rate risk. 
the group’s net interest-bearing debt (nibd) was dkk 
7,135 million as of 31 december 2020. based on this level, 
a rise of 1 percentage point in the general interest rate 
level will cause an increase in annual interest expenses 
before tax of dkk 10 million (dkk 17 million in 2019). 
credit risks 
the group’s credit risks relate primarily to trade receivables 
and loans to customers or business partners. our customer 
base is fragmented, so in general, credit risks only involve 
minor losses on loans to individual customers. the accumu-
lated revenue from our ten largest customers accounts for 
approx. 11% of total consolidated revenue. furthermore, 
when granting loans, we require that our counterparties 
provide security in their business. overall, we therefore 
estimate that the risk relative to our total credit exposure  
is well-balanced at group level.
the maximum credit risk relating to receivables matches 
the carrying amounts of such receivables. overall, the 
group has limited deposits with financial institutions for 
which reason the credit risk of deposits is considered to  
be low. in 2020, the group made an additional provision  
for bad debt of dkk 150 million, reflecting the increased 
risk of customers defaulting on their debt due to coronavirus. 
the provision was partly reversed by dkk 50 million to- 
wards the end of the year as a result of an updated risk 
assessment.  
liquidity risks 
the group aims to have sufficient cash resources at its  
disposal to be able to take appropriate steps in case of 
unforeseen fluctuations in both cash inflows and cash  
outflows. we have access to considerable undrawn credit 
facilities, and the liquidity risk is therefore considered to  
be low. in light of the uncertainty related to the outbreak  
of coronavirus in spring 2020, we expanded our available 
credit facilities considerably during the year, and through-
out the process, we have had strong support from both 
commercial and non-commercial banks. we are of the 
opinion that the group has strong cash flows and a satis- 
factory credit rating, and the group has not defaulted on 
loan agreements neither in the financial year 2020 nor in 
previous years. 
financial reporting process and internal control 
once a year, we carry through a very detailed planning 
and budgetary process, and any deviations from the  
plans and budgets resulting from this process are care- 
fully monitored month by month. in terms of sales and 
costs, month-over-month development is very similar from 
one year to the other, and due to the repetitive nature of 
our business, deviations will normally become visible fairly 
quickly. to ensure high quality in the group’s financial 
reporting systems, the board of directors and executive 
board have adopted policies, procedures and guidelines  
for financial reporting and internal control to which the 
subsidiaries and reporting units must adhere, including: 
• continuous follow-up on the results achieved  
compared to the approved budgets 
• policies for it, insurance, cash management,  
procurement etc. 
• reporting instructions as well as reporting and  
finance manuals  
the responsibility for maintaining sufficient and efficient 
internal control and risk management in connection with 
financial reporting lies with the executive board. the  
board of directors has assessed the group’s existing  
control environment and concluded that it is adequate.
safeguarding corporate assets 
management continuously seeks to minimise the financial 
consequences of any damage to corporate assets, including 
operating losses resulting from such damage. we have 
invested in security and surveillance systems to prevent 
damage and to minimise such damage, should it arise. 
major risks, which cannot be adequately minimised, are 
identified by the company’s management, which will en- 
sure that appropriate insurance policies are, on a conti- 
nuous basis, taken out under the group’s global insu- 
rance programme administered by recognised and cred-
it-rated insurance brokers and that such insurances are 
taken out with insurance companies with high credit rat-
ings. the group’s insurance programme has deductible 
clauses in line with normal market terms. following the  
it incident in 2019, the company has increased its cyber 
insurance coverage. the board of directors reviews the 
company’s insurance policies once a year, including the 
coverage of identified risks, and is briefed regularly on 
developments in identified risks. the purpose of this re- 
porting is to keep the board members fully updated and  
to facilitate corrective action to minimise any such risks.

sustainability 
in 2020, we further developed our sustainability approach 
to reflect our commitment to and ambitions for our work. 
aside from focusing on our main contribution to society, we 
are strengthening sustainability in our operational practic-
es. in the coming years, we have two main priorities in this 
regard: diversity and inclusion as well as climate impact. 
while we focus on these areas in our new sustainability 
strategy, we will continue to improve other important  
areas of our business.
demant is and has always been a responsible and well-functioning business. 
established in 1904 out of a desire to help people with hearing loss, demant’s positive  
contribution to a healthy society has always driven our business.
sustainability reporting 
in addition to our annual report, we publish a 
sustainability report every year. the report serves 
as demant’s communication on progress report to 
the united nations global compact and as our  
statement on the uk modern slavery act. 
furthermore, the report serves as the statutory 
report to be presented under sections:
99a, 99b and 107d of the danish financial 
statements act.
on the following pages, we highlight our main  
sustainability achievements of the year.

porate governance structures, we determine the extent to 
which the company complies with the recommendations 
and regularly assess whether the recommendations give 
rise to amendments to our rules of procedure or manageri-
al processes.
when reporting on corporate governance, we follow the 
“comply or explain” principle. demant follows 44 of the 47 
recommendations. the few cases (three) where we have 
chosen to deviate from a recommendation are well-founded, 
and we explain what we do instead. to further increase 
transparency, we provide supplementary and relevant 
information, even when we follow the recommendations.

a complete presentation of the recommendations and how 
we comply, the statutory report on corporate governance, 
is available on our website,  
www.demant.com/about/sustainability/
 
the report as well as the financial reporting process and 
internal control described in risk management activities  
in this annual report, constitute demant’s statement on 
corporate governance, cf. section 107b of the danish 
financial statements act.
tasks and responsibilities
of the board of directors
in accordance with danish legislation, demant has a two- 
tier management system comprising the board of directors 
and the executive board, with no individual being a mem-
ber of both. the division of responsibilities between the 
board of directors and the executive board is clearly out-
lined and described in the rules of procedure for the board 
of directors and the instructions for the executive board.
the board of directors is responsible for the overall stra- 
tegic management and for the financial and managerial 
supervision of the company, the ultimate goal being to 
ensure long-term value creation. on an ongoing basis,  
the board of directors evaluates the work of the executive 
board as for instance reflected in the annual plan prepared 
for the board of directors.
composition and organisation
the board of directors has eight members: five members 
elected by the shareholders at the annual general meeting 
and three members elected by staff in denmark. niels b. 
christiansen has been chairman of the board since 2017. 
shareholders elect board members for a term of one year, 
and staff elect board members for a term of four years. 
staff-elected members are elected in accordance with  
the provisions of the danish companies act.
although the board members elected by the annual  
general meeting are up for election every year, the  
individual board members are traditionally re-elected  
and sit on the board for an extended number of years.
this ensures consistency and maximum insight into the 
conditions prevailing in the company and the industry. 
such consistency and insight are considered important in 
order for the board members to bring value to the company.
of the five board members presently elected by the  
shareholders at the annual general meeting, benedikte 
leroy, anja madsen and lars rasmussen are considered 
independent. niels b. christiansen and niels jacobsen are  
not considered independent as they are associated with 
william demant foundation.
niels b. christiansen, niels jacobsen and anja madsen 
stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in 
march 2021. lars rasmussen and benedikte leroy do  
not stand for re-election. the board proposes that sisse 
fjelsted rasmussen and kristian villumsen be elected new 
members of the board. if the proposals are adopted, they 
will be considered independent. kristian villumsen brings 
excessive knowledge and commercial insights into the 
medtech industry. sisse fjelsted rasmussen has strong 
competences in finance, accounting and tax and will 
become chairman of the audit committee after lars 
rasmussen.
the board is composed to ensure the right combination  
of competencies and experience, with extensive interna-
tional managerial experience and board experience from 
major listed companies carrying particular weight. this 
also applies when new board candidates are selected.
since 2012, demant has had a diversity policy and has 
taken specific initiatives aimed at ensuring gender equality. 
the age, gender, education and competences of the mem- 
bers of our board of directors are listed in the annual 
report 2020. at the annual general meeting in march 
2020, the board of directors reached its target to have  
at least two female members before the end of 2020,  
and with 40% female members and 60% male members, 
we have now reached an even distribution between the 
board members elected by the shareholders.
as part of our ambitions to ensure diversity and inclusion  
in the group, we have worked on preparing a new demant 
diversity and inclusion policy, which will cover a broader 
definition of diversity than merely gender. we are still 
working on amending this policy for the group and will  
in that context decide on our need to have a diversity  
policy with a broader definition of diversity for the  
board of directors and executive board.
on our website, www.demant.com/about/management/, 
we describe the competencies and qualifications that the 
board of directors deems necessary to have at its overall 
disposal in order for the board to be able to perform its 
tasks for the company.
board committees
the company’s board of directors has set up an audit 
committee. the board of directors appoints the chairman 
of the audit committee, who must be independent and 
must not be chairman of the board of directors. lars 
rasmussen is chairman of the audit committee.
the company’s board of directors has also set up a no- 
mination committee. the members are the chairman and 
the deputy chairman of the company’s board of directors, 
the chairman and the deputy chairman of the company’s 
major shareholder, william demant foundation, and the 
president & ceo of the company. the chairman of the 
board also chairs the nomination committee.

demant · annual report 2020
corporate information · corporate governance
a remuneration committee, consisting of the chairman  
and the deputy chairman of the company’s board of 
directors, has also been set up. additionally, the board  
of directors set up an it security committee in 2019 whose 
members are the chairman and the deputy chairman of 
the company’s board of directors and the chairman of  
the audit committee.
meetings in 2020 and attendance
in 2020, the board of directors convened on seven  
occasions. the audit committee held three meetings  
in connection with ordinary board meetings. the nomi- 
nation committee held two meetings, the remuneration 
committee held three meetings and the it security  
committee held three meetings.
evaluation of the performance
of the board of directors
once a year, the chairman of the board of directors  
performs an evaluation of the board’s work. the evalu- 
ation is performed either through personal, individual  
interviews with the board members or by means of a  
questionnaire to be filled out by the individual board  
members. in both instances, the findings of the evaluation 
are presented and discussed at the subsequent board 
meeting. at least every third year, the evaluation is per-
formed with external assistance.
at the evaluation in 2020, external assistance was included, 
and the feedback was based on individual meetings with 
each board member. overall, the evaluation confirmed that 
the board performs high-quality work and that it is diligent 
and well-functioning. the collaboration between the board 
of directors and the executive board works very well, and 
there is an open and trustful working atmosphere. the 
work performed by the board takes its starting point in  
the annual wheel, which is continuously refined and up- 
dated and ensures the board’s commitment and immersion 
into relevant areas. as a result of the evaluation, the board 
decided to dedicate more time and effort to the long-term 
strategic development of the company to continuously 
ensure that the potential of the company is exploited  
to the fullest.
board of directors’ and
executive board’s remuneration
demant has a remuneration policy and publishes a remu- 
neration report. at the annual general meeting in march 
2020, a revised remuneration policy was approved to com-
ply with the new provision in section 139(a) of the danish 
companies act.
the remuneration report is available on our website 
www.demant.com. the report will be submitted for  
advisory vote at the annual general meeting.

financial circumstances of the group and the parent, of  
the results for the year and of the financial position of the 
group and the parent as well as a description of the most 
significant risks and uncertainties facing the group and

opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements  
and the parent financial statements of demant a/s for  
the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020, which  
comprise the income statement, balance sheet, statement 
of changes in equity and notes, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies, for the group as well as  
the parent, and the statement of comprehensive income 
and the cash flow statement of the group. the consoli- 
dated financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards as  
adopted by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act, and the parent financial 
statements are prepared in accordance with the danish 
financial statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give  
a true and fair view of the group’s financial position as of  
31 december 2020 and of the results of its operations and 
cash flows for the financial year 1 january 2020 to 31 
december 2020 in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements under the danish financial statements act.
further, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give 
a true and fair view of the parent’s financial position as of 
31 december 2020 and of the results of its operations for 
the financial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020  
in accordance with the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit book comments 
issued to the audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards on auditing (isas) and the additional require-
ments applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under 
those standards and requirements are further described  
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent financial state-
ments section of this auditor’s report. we are independent 
of the group in accordance with the international ethics 
standards board of accountants’ code of ethics for pro- 
fessional accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  
for our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not pro-
vided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014.
after demant a/s was listed on nasdaq omx copenhagen, 
we were appointed auditors for the first time on 29 april 
1996 for the financial year 1996. we have been reappoint-
ed annually by decision of the general meeting for a total 
contiguous engagement period of 24 years up to and 
including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes- 
sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit  
of the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements for the financial year 1 january 2020 
to 31 december 2020. these matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
accounting for business combinations 
refer to note 6.1 in the consolidated financial statements. 
the allocation of the purchase price in business combina-
tions to other intangible assets acquired relies on assump-
tions and judgements made by management. management 
has performed fair value calculations, which include judge-
ments and estimates, including the future cash flow antici-
pated from the acquired customer base and the discount 
rate applied. 
we have tested internal controls that address the account-
ing for business combinations and tested the reasonable-
ness of the key assumptions, including market potential, 
revenue and cash flow growth and discount rates. we 
assessed and challenged management’s assumptions  
used in its fair value models for identifying and measuring 
customer bases and for other intangible assets, including:
to the shareholders of demant a/s

• the future cash flow projections by discussing with 
management and key employees.
• consulted with subject matter experts regarding the  
valuation methodologies applied.
• tested the valuation model, including mathematical 
accuracy and obtained supporting evidence for future 
cash flow projections, estimates and key assumptions, 
including the applied discount rate.
• considered the impact of reasonably possible changes 
in key assumptions and performed sensitivity calcula-
tions to quantify the impact of potential downside 
changes to management’s models.
• assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of dis- 
closures in the notes and compliance with the require-
ments of ifrs 3.
accounting for the business  
combination related to the demerger 
of sennheiser communications a/s  
refer to note 6.1 in the consolidated financial statements. 
on 1 january 2020, demant a/s obtained control over  
the gaming and enterprise solutions business within the 
joint venture sennheiser communication a/s through a 
demerger and thus effectively dissolved the joint venture. 
consequently, management has determined the purchase 
price based on fair value calculation of the business ob- 
tained and allocated this to the identifiable assets and  
liabilities. the business combination was recognised as  
of 1 january 2020 in the consolidated financial statements. 
the gaming and enterprise solutions segments represent 
the new communications segment in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
the determination of fair value and the allocation of the  
purchase price to identifiable assets and liabilities as well 
as the step-up gain recognised rely on management’s 
judgements and assumptions, including the future cash 
flow anticipated from the business and the discount rate 
applied.
we have evaluated the judgements and tested the reason-
ableness of the key assumptions, including market poten-
tial, revenue and cash flow growth and discount rate. we 
assessed and challenged management’s assumptions used 
in its assessment of the fair value of the acquired business 
and determination of the purchase price, including:
• assessed management’s process for determining the  
purchase price, including consulting with subject matter 
experts regarding the methodology and judgements 
made.
• considered management’s process for identifying assets 
and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets and 
fair value of inventory, considering the rationale for the 
acquisition and the nature of the business.
• tested the valuation model, including mathematical 
accuracy and obtained supporting evidence for future 
cash flow projections, estimates and key assumptions, 
including the applied discount rate.
• considered the impact of reasonably possible changes 
in key assumptions and performed sensitivity calcula-
tions to quantify the impact of potential downside 
changes to management’s models.
• assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of dis- 
closures in the notes and compliance with the require-
ments of ifrs 3 business combinations.
statement on the management  
commentary 
management is responsible for the management com- 
mentary.
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements does not cover the man-
agement commentary, and we do not express any form  
of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements, our re- 
sponsibility is to read the management commentary and,  
in doing so, consider whether the management commen-
tary is materially inconsistent with the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
 
67
demant · annual report 2020
financial report · independent auditor’s report
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the 
management commentary provides the information 
required under the danish financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, we conclude  
that the management commentary is in accordance with 
the consolidated financial statements and the parent fi- 
nancial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the danish financial statements 
act. we did not identify any material misstatement of the 
management commentary.
management’s responsibilities for the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation of consoli-
dated financial statements that give a true and fair view  
in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional require-
ments of the danish financial statements act as well as 
the preparation of parent financial statements that give a 
true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act and for such internal control as manage- 
ment determines is necessary to enable the preparation  
of consolidated financial statements and parent financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the group’s and the parent’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and for using the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements, unless 
management either intends to liquidate the group or the 
entity or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements as a whole are free from ma- 
terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and  
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but  
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. mis-statements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the eco-
nomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these  
consolidated financial statements and these parent  
financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas  
and the additional requirements applicable in denmark,  
we exercise professional judgement and maintain profes-
sional skepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  
of the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  
omissions, misrepresentations or the override of in- 
ternal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant  
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  
of the group’s and the parent’s internal control. 
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use  
of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s and the parent’s ability to continue as  
a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncer-
tainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the conso- 
lidated financial statements and the parent financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. however, future events or conditions may cause 
the group and the entity to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content

we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden-
tify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with  
a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence and communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may  
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,  
and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged  
with governance, we determine those matters that were  
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law  
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report  
because the adverse consequences of doing so would  
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  
benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef 
regulation

ments and the parent financial statements of demant a/s, 
we performed procedures to express an opinion on wheth-
er the annual report of demant a/s for the financial year  
1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 with the file name 
dema-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, 
in compliance with the commission delegated regulation 
(eu) 2020/815 on the european single electronic format 
(esef regulation), which includes requirements related to 
the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format. 
management is responsible for preparing an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility 
includes the preparing of the annual report in xhtml for-
mat. our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance 
on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef regulation based  
on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report 
that includes our opinion. the procedures consist of testing 
whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format.  
in our opinion, the annual report of demant a/s for the 
financial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 with 
the file name dema-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the esef regulation.
management is responsible for preparing an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility 
includes: 
• the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format; 
• the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, 
including extensions to the esef taxonomy and the 
anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for 
financial information required to be tagged using  
judgement where necessary;
• ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data  
and the consolidated financial statements presented  
in human readable format; and  
• for such internal control as management determines 
necessary to enable the preparation of an annual  
report that is compliant with the esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on 
whether the annual report is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef regulation based 
on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report 
that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent of 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material depar-
tures from the requirements set out in the esef regulation, 
whether due to fraud or error. the procedures include: 
• testing whether the annual report is prepared in  
xhtml format; 
• obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl 
tagging process and of internal control over the  
tagging process; 
• evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of  
the consolidated financial statements; 
• evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use 
 of ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxonomy 
and the creation of extension elements where no suita-
ble element in the esef taxonomy has been identified; 
• evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements  
to elements in the esef taxonomy; and 
• reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited 
consolidated financial statements. 
in our opinion, the annual report of demant a/s for the 
financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the  
file name dema-2020-12-31.zip is prepared in all material 
respects, in compliance with the esef regulation.

description of products and services for each reportable 
segment
based on ifrs 8 operating segments and the internal 
reporting model used by management for the assessment 
of results and the use of resources, management has iden-
tified hearing healthcare and communications as the 
reportable segments in the group. 
this reflects management’s approach to the organisation 
and management of activities.
hearing healthcare comprises the four business areas: 
hearing aids, hearing care, hearing implants and 
diagnostics, which provides hearing healthcare solutions 
involving manufacturing, servicing and sale of hearing aids 
and implants as well as diagnostics products and services.
communications comprises only our headset business, 
which operates under the epos brand and provides  
solutions for the professional call centre and office market 
(enterprise headsets) and gaming headsets (gaming).
segment performance is evaluated on ebit level and is 
based on the accounting policies for the consolidated 
income statement. 
the group’s financial income and expenses as well as 
income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not 
allocated to operating segments.

segment assets and liabilities are based on the accounting 
policies for the consolidated balance sheet and allocated 
based on the operation of the segment. the group’s  
borrowings, derivative financial instruments and income 
tax related assets and liabilities are managed on a group 
basis and not allocated to operating segments.

1.2 revenue from contracts with customers
accounting policies
revenue is recognised when obligations under the terms of 
the contract with the customer are satisfied, which usually 
occurs with the transfer of control of our products and  
services within hearing healthcare and communications. 
revenue is measured as the consideration we expect to 
receive in exchange for transferring goods and providing 
services net of the estimated discounts or other custom-
er-related reductions.
nature of goods and services
control is normally transferred to the customer when the 
goods are shipped to the customer, though delivery terms 
can vary and control may be transferred at a later point. 
when selling hearing aids to end-users, we transfer control 
and recognise revenue when a hearing aid is initially fitted 
to the customer’s specific hearing loss, and the hearing aid 
is delivered to the customer at a given point in time. in 
some countries, the customers are granted a trial period.  
in such cases, the transfer of control occurs when the trial 
period expires.
in some countries, customers are given the right to return 
the hearing aid during a certain period. in such cases, the 
expected returns are estimated based on an analysis of 
historical experience adjusted for any known factors 
impacting expectations for future return rates. revenue 
and cost of goods sold are adjusted accordingly, and  
contract liabilities (refund liabilities) and rights to the 
returned goods (included in prepaid expenses) are  
recognised for the expected returns. 
our activities also involve delivery of various services,  
such as extended warranties, warranty-related coverages 
(loss and damage) and after-sales services (e.g. fine-tuning 
of the hearing aid, additional hearing test and cleaning). 
revenue from these services is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the warranty or service period as the  
customer makes use of the service continuously. some  
customers purchase a battery package or are given batter-
ies free of charge as part of the purchase of the hearing 
aid, entitling them to free batteries for a certain period. 
revenue is recognised when the customer receives the 
batteries or is given batteries free of charge as part of the 
purchase of the hearing aid. when available, we use an 
observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price 
for the separate performance obligations related to these 
services, and in countries where observable prices are not 
available, we use a cost-plus-margin method.
the standard warranty period for hearing aids and  
diagnostic equipment varies across countries, typically 
between 12 and 24 months and for certain products up to 
48 months. the extended warranty covers periods beyond 
the standard warranty period or standard warranty terms. 
payment terms vary significantly across countries and 
depend on whether the customer is a private or public  
customer.
the majority of hearing aids sold to end-users are invoiced 
and paid for after the initial fitting, but some customers 
choose to have the hearing aid financed by us. the trans-
action price of such arrangements is adjusted for any  
significant financing benefit, and the financing component 
is recognised as financial income.
accounting estimates and judgements
discounts, returns etc.
discounts, loyalty programmes and other revenue reduc-
tions are estimated and accrued when the related revenue 
is recognised. to make such estimates is a matter of judge-
ment, as all conditions are not known at the time of sale, 
e.g. the number of units sold to a given customer or the 
expected utilisation of loyalty programmes. sales dis-
counts, rebates and loyalty programmes are adjusted, as 
we gain better information on the likelihood that they will 
be realised and the value at which they are expected to  
be realised. sales discounts and rebates are recognised  
under other cost payables in other liabilities, and loyalty 
programmes are recognised in deferred income.
depending on local legislation and the conditions to which 
a sale is subject, some customers have the option to return 
purchased goods for a refund. based on historical return 
rates, an estimate is made of the expected returns and  
a provision is recognised. this provision is updated, as 
returns are recognised or when we collect more accurate 
data on return rates.
after-sales services
after-sales services are provided to end-users of our  
hearing aids and are based on estimates as not all end- 
users make use of these services. the estimate is a matter 
of judgement and is based on the number of visits, the 
duration of an average customer’s visits and the expected 
number of end-users that make use of the after-sales  
services.

section 1 · operating activities and cash flow
the group has two types of share-based remuneration 
programmes, which consist of rsu (restricted stock units) 
and “shadow share” programmes. the rsu programme 
was introduced in 2019 and is equity-settled, whereas the 
“shadow share” programme, which was introduced in 
2016, is cash-settled. both programmes are contingent on 
the employee still being employed and not under termina-
tion when the three years have passed from the time of  
the grant. further, the fair value of the shares granted 
under both programmes is based on the average share 
price of the first five trading days after publication of the 
annual report.
rsu programme
the fair value of rsu granted to 13 employees (10 employ-
ees in 2019) was dkk 5 million (dkk 2 million in 2019)  
at the time of the grant (21,899 shares), and in 2020, the 
group recognised costs of dkk 2 million (dkk 1 million  
in 2019) in the income statement related to the rsu  
programme. the costs are recognised on a straight-line 
basis, as the service is rendered.
at 31 december 2020, the remaining average contractual 
life of equity-settled share programmes was 21 months. 
the employees under the rsu programme are not entitled 
to dividend during the vesting period.
“shadow shares” programme
the fair value of “shadow shares” granted to six employees 
(eight in 2019) was dkk 10 million (dkk 9 million in 2019) 
at the time of the grant, and at 31 december 2020, the 
group had liabilities of dkk 16 million (dkk 12 million in 
2019) related to the shadow share programme. the liability 
is recognised on a straight-line basis, as the service is  
rendered, and the liability is remeasured at each reporting 
date and at the settlement date based on the fair value  
of the “shadow shares”. fair value adjustments are recog-
nised as financial income or financial expenses. if relevant, 
the liability is adjusted to reflect the expected risk of 
non-vesting as a result of resignations.
any changes to the liability are recognised in the income 
statement. the group bought back shares to cover the 
financial risk of share price fluctuations related to the  
programmes. at 31 december 2020, the remaining  
average contractual life of cash-settled remuneration  
programmes was 19 months (16 months in 2019).
accounting policies
employee costs comprise wages, salaries, social security 
contributions, annual and sick leave, bonuses and 
non-monetary benefits and are recognised in the year  
in which the associated services are rendered by the 
employees. where demant provides long-term employee 
benefits, the costs are accrued to match the rendering of 
the service by the employees concerned.
accounting estimates and judgements
management must evaluate the likelihood of vesting  
conditions for the share-based programmes being fulfilled. 
vesting is entirely dependent on the persons enrolled in the 
share-based programmes remaining employed until the 
end of the vesting period.
the estimate made based on this likelihood is used to  
calculate the fair value of the share-based programmes. 
furthermore, the shares must be valued. for this purpose, 
management uses the share price quoted at nasdaq 
copenhagen.

write-downs for the year are shown net, as breakdown 
into reversed write-downs and new write-downs is not 
possible. inventories are generally expected to be sold 
within one year.
accounting policies
raw materials, components and goods for resale are 
measured at cost according to the fifo principle (according 
to which the most recently purchased items are considered 
to be in stock) or at their net realisable value, whichever is 
lower. 
group-manufactured products and work in progress are 
measured at the value of direct cost, direct payroll costs, 
consumables and a proportionate share of indirect produc-
tion costs, which are allocated on the basis of the normal 
capacity of the production facility. indirect production costs 
include the proportionate share of capacity costs directly 
relating to group-manufactured products and work in  
progress. 
the net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the 
estimated selling price less costs of completion and costs 
to sell.
accounting estimates and judgements
indirect production cost allocations to inventory  
indirect production cost allocations are based on relevant 
judgements related to capacity utilisation at the production  
facility, production time and other product-related factors. 
the judgements are reviewed regularly to ensure that 
inventories are measured at their actual production cost. 
changes in judgements may affect gross profit margins  
as well as the valuation of work in progress, finished  
goods and goods for resale.
obsolescence provision
the obsolescence provision for inventories is based on the 
expected sales forecast for the individual types of hearing 
devices, diagnostic equipment and hearing implants.  
sales forecasts are based on management’s expectations 
of market conditions and trends, and the obsolescence  
provision is subject to changes in these judgements.

section 1 · operating activities and cash flow
of the total amount of trade receivables, dkk 243 million 
(dkk 239 million in 2019) is expected to be collected after 
12 months. for information on security and collateral, 
please refer to credit risks in note 4.1.
in 2020 the group has made a provision for additional bad 
debt of dkk 100 million due to the uncertainties caused by 
the covid-19 pandemic. the additional provision for bad 
debt is recognised in loss allowance for trade receivables 
more than 12 months overdue. the expected loss rate is 92 
% for amounts more than 12 months overdue including the 
provision for additional bad debt. the adjusted loss rate is 
61% excluding the provision for additional bad debt.
accounting policies
receivables include trade receivables, customer loans and 
other receivables. receivables are financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments, which are not listed on  
an active market and are not derivatives.
on initial recognition, receivables are measured at fair 
value with the addition of transaction costs. receivables 
with a definite maturity date are measured at amortised 
cost. 
receivables without a definite maturity date are measured 
at cost. current receivables arisen as a result of the group’s 
ordinary activities are measured at nominal value. 
impairment is based on expected credit losses, which 
include the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for 
trade receivables.
accounting estimates and judgements
allowance for impairment is calculated for both trade 
receivables and other receivables. for trade receivables, 
the allowance is calculated for expected credit losses 
based on an assessment of the debtor’s ability to pay.  
this assessment is made by local management and is 
made for uniform groups of debtors based on a maturity 
analysis. when indicated by special circumstances,  
impairments are made for individual debtors. other  
receivables, including customer loans, are assessed on  
an individual basis based on  expected credit loss.

section 2 · exchange rates and hedging
the group seeks to hedge against any exchange rate risks, 
first and foremost through forward exchange contracts. in 
relation to exchange rate fluctuations, hedging ensures 
predictability in the profit and gives management the 
opportunity – and the necessary time – to redirect business 
arrangements in the event of persistent changes in foreign 
exchange rates.
the group aims to hedge such changes in foreign 
exchange rates by seeking to match positive and negative 
cash flows in the main currencies as much as possible and 
by entering into forward exchange contracts. the group 
predominantly hedges estimated cash flows with a horizon 
of up to 18 months.
the below tables show the impact on the year’s operating 
profit (ebit) and consolidated equity, given a change of 5% 
in the currencies with the highest exposures. the exchange 
rate impact on ebit has been calculated on the basis of 
the group’s ebit for each currency and does not take into 
account a possible exchange rate impact on balance sheet 
values in those currencies.

on initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value 
at the settlement date. after initial recognition, derivatives 
are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. any 
positive or negative fair values of derivatives are recog-
nised as separate items in the balance sheet. forward 
exchange contracts are measured based on current market 
data and by use of commonly recognised valuation meth-
ods. please refer to note 4.5.
any changes in fair values of derivatives classified as 
hedging instruments and satisfying the criteria for hedging 
the fair value of a recognised asset or a recognised liability 
are recognised in the income statement together with any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or hedged 
liability. any changes in fair values of derivatives classified 
as hedging instruments and satisfying the criteria for  
effective hedging of future transactions are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. the ineffective portion is  
recognised directly in the income statement. on realisation 
of the hedged transactions, the accumulated changes are 
recognised together with the related transactions.
derivatives not fulfilling the conditions for treatment as 
hedging instruments are considered trading investments 
and measured at fair value, with fair value adjustments 
being recognised on an ongoing basis in the income  
statement.

2.3 hedging and forward exchange contracts
open forward exchange contracts at the balance sheet 
date may be specified as shown below, with contracts for 
the sale of currency being shown at negative contract  
values. the expiry dates reflect the periods in which the 
hedged cash flows are expected to be realised.
realised forward exchange contracts are recognised in the 
income statement together with the items, typically the 
revenue in foreign currency, that such contracts are 
designed to hedge. in 2020, our forward exchange  
contracts realised a gain of dkk 12 million (loss of dkk 91  
million in 2019), which increased reported revenue for the 
year. in addition, we raised loans in foreign currencies to 
balance out net receivables. at year-end 2020, we had 
entered into forward exchange contracts with a total  
contractual value of dkk 1,053 million (dkk 697 million  
in 2019) and a total net fair value of dkk 69 million  
(dkk -28 million in 2019).

on initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of 
the transaction. the functional currencies of the enterprises 
are determined by the economic environment in which the 
enterprises operate, normally the local currency.
receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign 
currencies are translated into danish kroner at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
realised and unrealised foreign currency translation 
adjustments are recognised in the income statement  
under gross profit or net financial items, depending on the 
purpose of the underlying transaction.
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, invento-
ries and other non-monetary assets purchased in foreign 
currencies and measured on the basis of historical cost  
are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the 
transaction date. non-monetary items, which are revalued 
at their fair values, are translated using the exchange rates 
at the revaluation date.
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements  
of enterprises presenting their financial statements in a 
functional currency other than danish kroner, the income 
statement is translated using average exchange rates for 
the months of the year in question, unless they deviate 
materially from actual exchange rates at the transaction 
dates. in case of the latter, actual exchange rates are 
applied.
balance sheet items are translated at the exchange rates 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. goodwill is considered 
as belonging to the acquired enterprise in question and is 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance 
sheet date.
all foreign currency translation adjustments are recognised 
in the income statement, except for the following, which 
are recognised in other comprehensive income:
• the translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries 
using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet 
date
• the translation of income statements of foreign subsidi-
aries using monthly average exchange rates for the 
respective months of the year, while the balance sheet 
items of such foreign subsidiaries are translated using 
exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date
• the translation of non-current, intra-group receivables 
that are considered to be an addition to or deduction 
from net investments in foreign subsidiaries
• the translation of investments in associates and joint 
ventures

accounting policies
on initial recognition, goodwill is recognised and measured 
as the difference between the acquisition cost – including 
the value of non-controlling interests in the acquired enter-
prise and the fair value of any existing investment in the 
acquired enterprise – and the fair values of the acquired 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. please refer to 
accounting policies in note 6.1.
on recognition, goodwill is allocated to corporate activities 
that generate independent payments (cash-generating 
units). the definition of a cash-generating unit is in line 
with the group’s managerial structure as well as the  
internal financial management reporting.
goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment  
at least once a year. if the recoverable amount of a cash- 
generating unit is lower than the carrying amounts of  
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, 
including goodwill, attributable to the particular cash- 
generating unit, the particular assets will be written down.
patents and licences acquired from third parties are  
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. patents and licenses are amortised on  
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
other intangible assets consist of software, other rights 
than patents and licenses and other intangible assets 
acquired in connection with business combinations,  
primarily brand value, customer bases and non-compete 
agreements.
other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumu-
lated amortisation and impairment losses. other intangible 
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives, except other rights, which are  
not amortised, as the residual value of other rights is  
considered to exceed the cost price and is instead tested 
for impairment annually. please refer to note 3.6.
assets under development include internally developed it 
systems. assets under development are measured at cost, 
which includes direct salaries, consultant fees and other 
direct costs attributable to the development of such assets. 
assets under development are not amortised, as they are 
not available for use.
accounting estimates and judgements 
impairment testing is carried out annually on preparation 
of the annual report or on indication of impairment in 
which discounted values of future cash flows are compared 
with carrying amounts. group enterprises cooperate closely 
on r&d, purchasing, production, marketing and sale, as the 
use of resources in the individual markets is coordinated 
and monitored by management in denmark. group enter-
prises are thus highly integrated. regardless of this the 
products and services within hearing healthcare and 
communications address different customer demands  
and customer groups, which would not be comparable in 
nature. management therefore considers it most appropri-
ate to separate the activities into two reportable segments, 
hearing healthcare and communications. impairment test-
ing is therefore carried out for the group´s two cash-gener-
ating units, hearing healthcare and communications. 
please refer to note 3.6.
it is management’s opinion that the product development 
undertaken by the group today cannot meaningfully be 
allocated to either the development of new products or the 
further development of existing products. moreover, as the 
products are subject to approval by various authorities, it is 
difficult to determine the final completion of new products.

section 3 ·  asset base
accounting policies
property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. cost is 
defined as the acquisition price and costs directly relating 
to the acquisition until such time as the particular asset is 
ready for use. for assets produced by the group, cost 
includes all costs directly attributable to the production of 
such assets, including materials, components, sub-supplies 
and payroll. if the acquisition or the use of an asset 
requires the group to defray costs for the demolition or  
restoration of such asset, the calculated costs hereof are 
recognised as a provision and as part of the cost of the 
particular asset, respectively.
the cost of a total asset is divided into various elements, 
which will be depreciated separately if their useful lives  
are not the same.
property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. land  
is not depreciated.
accounting estimates and judgements 
the depreciation basis is cost less the estimated residual 
value of an asset after the end of its useful life. the  
residual value is the estimated amount, which could after 
deduction of costs to sell be obtained through the sale of 
the asset today, such asset already having the age and 
being in the state of repair expected after the end of its 
useful life. the residual value is determined at the time of 
acquisition and is reviewed annually. if the residual value 
exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation will be  
discontinued.

section 3 ·  asset base
the group’s leases primarily comprise agreements  
regarding properties. the lease terms are of various length 
and may contain extension and termination options. 
management exercises significant judgement in determin-
ing whether it is reasonably certain that these extension 
and termination options will be exercised.
accounting policies
lease assets
lease assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance 
sheet at the commencement date of the contract, if it is or 
contains a lease. lease assets are recognised at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. cost is defined 
as the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date. lease assets are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
lease liabilities
lease liabilities are measured at the present value of  
future payments, using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
agreement. lease payments are discounted using the 
group’s incremental borrowing rate adjusted for the  
functional currencies and length of the lease term, if the 
interest rate implicit in the lease agreement cannot be 
determined. lease payments contain fixed payments less 
any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payment 
that depend on an index or a rate as well as payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the terms of the lease 
warrants that the group exercises that option.
the lease liability is remeasured if or when the future  
payment or lease term changes. any net  remeasurement 
of the lease liability is recognised as an adjustment to the 
lease asset. if the carrying amount of the lease asset is 
reduced to zero, the adjustment will be recognised in the 
income statement.
additional information
short-term lease expenses, low-value assets and variable 
lease payments are classified as operating expenses in the 
income statement.
ifrs 16 covid-19-related rent concessions amendment
ifrs 16 is amended to exempt lessees, who have received 
rent concessions as a direct consequence of the covid-19 
pandemic, from the requirement to assess whether the 
concession is a lease modification. the group has decided 
to apply the practical expedient to all rent concessions that 
meet the conditions as outlined in paragraph 46b of ifrs 
16. this resulted in accounting for the concession as a  
variable lease payment. the rent concessions recognised in 
the income statement for 2020 amount to dkk 12 million.
accounting estimates and judgements 
expired leases
the lease term is the period during which the lease  
contract is enforceable. if the original expiry date of a  
lease contract has passed, typically in the case of property 
leases, but the contract continues without a determined 
expiry date, the lease term is set for an estimated period 
during which the lease contract is expected to be enforcea-
ble. this estimate is based on management’s judgement 
and takes into  consideration the location of the lease,  
capitalised leasehold improvements and the experience 
with similar leases for the specific area.
extension and termination options
when determining the lease term for lease agreements 
containing extension and termination options, management 
considers circumstances that create a financial incentive  
to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termi-
nation option. extension and termination options are only 
included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that  
a lease will be extended/terminated.

transactions with associates and joint ventures
in 2020, the group recognised revenue from associates 
and joint ventures of dkk 294 million (dkk 457 million in 
2019), received royalties from and paid license fees to 
associates and joint ventures, amounting to net income of 
dkk 1 million (net income of dkk 1 million in 2019) and 
received dividends from associates and joint ventures in 
the amount of dkk 41 million (dkk 183 million in 2019).  
in 2020, the group received interest income from associ-
ates and joint ventures in the amount of dkk 4 million 
(dkk 3 million in 2019).
under the provisions of contracts concluded with associ-
ates and joint ventures, the group is not entitled to receive 
dividends from certain associates and joint ventures. this 
is reflected in the profit included in the income statement, 
as no profit is recognised if the group is not entitled to 
receive dividends.
accounting policies
investments in associates and joint ventures are  
recognised and measured using the equity method, i.e.  
investments are recognised in the balance sheet at the  
proportionate share of the equity value determined in 
accordance with the group’s accounting policies after the 
deduction and addition of proportionate intra-group gains 
and losses, respectively, and after the addition of the  
carrying amount of any goodwill. the proportionate  
shares of profit after tax in associates and joint ventures 
are recognised in the income statement after the year’s  
changes in unrealised intra-group profits less any  
impairment loss relating to goodwill.
the proportionate shares of all transactions and events, 
which have been recognised in other comprehensive 
income in associates and joint ventures, are recognised  
in consolidated other comprehensive income. on the  
acquisition of interests in associates and joint ventures,  
the acquisition method is applied.

3.6 impairment testing
impairment testing is carried out for the group´s two 
cash-generating units, hearing healthcare and 
communications. based on the impairment tests per-
formed, a material excess value was identified in each 
cash-generating unit, compared to the carrying amount,  
for which reason no impairment of goodwill was made at 
31 december 2020.
future cash flows are based on the budget for 2021,  
on strategy plans and on projections hereof. projections 
extending beyond 2021 are based on general parameters, 
such as expected market growth, selling prices and  
profitability assumptions. the terminal value for the period 
after 2025 is determined on the assumption of 2% growth. 
the pre-tax discount rate is 7% for hearing healthcare 
and 12% for communications. sensitivity calculations 
show that even a significant increase in the discount rate 
or a significant reduction of the growth assumptions will 
not change the outcome of the impairment test. apart from 
goodwill, all intangible assets have limited useful lives.
the market capitalisation of the company on nasdaq 
copenhagen by far exceeds the equity value of the 
company, lending further support to the conclusion that 
we had no need for impairment in 2020.
accounting policies
the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets with definite useful lives as well as 
investments in associates and joint ventures are reviewed 
at the balance sheet date to determine whether there are 
indications of impairment. if so, the recoverable amount of 
the particular asset is calculated to determine the need for 
impairment, if any. the recoverable amounts of goodwill 
and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will 
be estimated, whether or not there are indications of 
impairment.
the recoverable amount is estimated for the smallest 
cash-generating unit of which the asset is part. the  
recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair 
value of the asset or cash-generating unit less costs to sell 
and the value in use of such asset or unit. on determina-
tion of the value in use, estimated future cash flows will  
be discounted to their present values using a discount rate 
that reflects partly current market valuations of the time 
value of money, and partly the special risks attached to the 
particular asset or cash-generating unit for which no 
adjustment has been made in the estimated future cash 
flows. if the recoverable amount of a particular asset or 
cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount, 
such asset or unit is written down to its recoverable 
amount.
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
on any subsequent reversal of impairment losses due to 
changes in the judgements on which the calculation of the 
recoverable amount is based, the carrying amount of an 
asset or cashgenerating unit is increased to the adjusted 
estimate of the recoverable amount, however not exceed-
ing the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating 
unit, had the particular asset or cash-generating unit not 
been written down. impairment of goodwill is not reversed.

4.1 financial risk management and capital structure
policies relating to financial risk management and  
capital structure
financial risk management concentrates on identifying 
risks in respect of exchange rates, interest rates, credit and 
liquidity with a view to protecting the group against 
potential losses and ensuring that management’s forecasts 
for the current year are only to a limited extent affected by 
changes or events in the surrounding world – be they 
changes in exchange rates or in interest rates. it is group 
policy to exclusively hedge commercial risks and not to 
undertake any financial transactions of a speculative 
nature.
interest rate risks
in previous years, we only hedged interest rate risks on 
group loans to a limited extent, as the group only had 
limited debt compared to its volume of activities. because 
of the group’s high level of cash generation and relatively 
low financial gearing, the majority of our loans are raised 
on floating terms and predominantly as short-term  
commitments, resulting in a low level of interest expenses. 
in order to secure relatively low interest rates for the group 
on the long term and as a consequence of our attractive 
funding possibilities in the financial market, the group now 
partly funds its debt through medium-term committed 
facilities with fixed rates and through financial instruments, 
which limits the interest rate risk. the group’s net inter-
est-bearing debt amounted to dkk 7,135 million as of  
31 december 2020, and the gearing multiple was 2.8 
(nibd/ebitda).
credit risks
the group’s credit risks relate primarily to trade receivables
and loans to customers or business partners. our customer
base is fragmented, so in general, credit risks only involve
minor losses on loans to individual customers. the accu-
mulated revenue from our ten largest customers accounts 
for approx. 11% of total consolidated revenue. further- 
more, when granting loans, we require that our counter-
parties provide security in their business. overall, we 
therefore estimate that the risk relative to our total credit 
exposure is well-balanced at group level.
the maximum credit risk relating to receivables matches
the carrying amounts of such receivables. overall, the
group has limited deposits with financial institutions for
which reason the credit risk of deposits is considered to
be low. in 2020, the group made an additional provision
for bad debt of dkk 150 million, reflecting the increased
risk of customers defaulting on their debt due to coronavi-
rus. the provision was partly reversed by dkk 50 million
towards the end of the year as a result of an updated risk
assessment.
liquidity risks
the group aims to have sufficient cash resources to be 
able to take appropriate steps in case of unforeseen  
fluctuations in cash outflows. we have access to consider-
able undrawn credit facilities, and the liquidity risk is  
therefore considered to be low. we are of the opinion that 
the group has strong cash flows and a satisfactory credit 
rating to secure the current inflow of working capital and 
funds for potential acquisitions. neither in previous years 
nor in the financial year 2020 has the group defaulted  
on any loan agreements.

section 4 · capital structure and financial management
in addition to the foreign exchange items above, the  
consolidated income statement is also affected by foreign 
exchange hedging instruments as described in note 2.3 as 
well as by foreign exchange effects of balance sheet items, 
affecting production costs by a loss of dkk 83 million in 
2020 (a loss of dkk 5 million in 2019).
accounting policies
net financial items mainly consist of interest income and 
interest expenses, credit card fees and bank fees and also 
include interest on lease liabilities, the unwinding of  
discounts on financial assets and liabilities, fair value 
adjustments of “shadow shares” under share-based  
remuneration programmes as well as certain realised and 
unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses. interest 
income and interest expenses are accrued based on the 
principal amount and the effective interest rate. 
the effective interest rate is the discount rate used for  
discounting expected future payments attaching to the 
financial asset or financial liability in order for the present 
value to match the carrying amount of such asset or  
liability.

as regards financial assets and liabilities, their carrying 
amounts approximate their fair values. the following 
non-financial item is included in the balance sheet and  
represents the difference between the table above and  
the balance sheet: other liabilities dkk 351 million (dkk 
405 million in 2019).
accounting policies
debt to credit institutions is recognised at the date of  
borrowing at the proceeds received less transaction costs. 
for subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured  
at amortised cost in order for the difference between  
proceeds and the nominal value to be recognised as a 
financial expense over the term of the loan.
on initial recognition, other financial liabilities are  
measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, and the difference 
between proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in 
the income statement as a financial expense over the term 
of the loan.

the fair value of the interest cap (a strip of call options) 
outstanding at the balance sheet date is dkk -2 million 
(dkk -2 million in 2019), and the contractual value of  
interest cap is dkk 650 million (dkk 650 million in 2019). 
the cap will run until 2023.
sensitivity analysis in respect of interest rates
based on consolidated net debt at the end of the 2020 
financial year, a rise of 1 percentage point in the general 
interest rate level will cause an increase in consolidated 
annual interest expenses before tax of approx. dkk 10  
million (dkk 17 million in 2019). about 59% (56% in 2019) 
of consolidated interest-bearing debt is subject to fixed or 
limited interest rates, partly due to a bought cap (a strip of 
call options), and partly due to loans being raised at fixed 
interest rates.

4.5 fair value hierarchy
methods and judgements for calculation of fair values
other investments
other investments are assessed on the basis of their equity 
value.
derivatives
forward exchange contracts are assessed using discounted 
cash flow valuation techniques. future cash flows are 
based on forward exchange rates from observable forward 
exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and on 
contractual forward exchange rates discounted at a rate 
that reflects the credit risk related to various counterpar-
ties.
interest swaps are assessed using discounted cash flow 
valuation techniques. future cash flows are based on 
observable forward yield curves at the end of the reporting 
period and on contractual interest rates discounted at a 
rate that reflects the credit risk related to various counter-
parties.
the value of a cap is assessed using discounted cash flow 
valuation techniques. a cap consists of a series of interest 
rate options (irgs) with the same strike rate. the individual 
interest rate options each cover an interest period. the key 
elements when pricing interest rate options are strike rate, 
forward rate, maturity and volatility. the value of an  
interest rate option is made up of the intrinsic value and 
the time value of such option. the value of a cap is the 
combined value of the individual irgs.
contingent considerations
contingent considerations are measured at their fair values 
based on the contractual terms of the contingent consider-
ations and on non-observable inputs (level 3), such as the 
financial performance and purchasing patterns of the 
acquired enterprises for a period of typically 1-5 years  
after the date of acquisition.
fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value in the balance sheet
financial instruments measured at fair value are broken 
down according to the fair value hierarchy:
• listed prices in an active market for the same type  
of instrument (level 1)
• listed prices in an active market for similar assets or  
liabilities or other valuation methods, with all significant 
inputs being based on observable market data (level 2)
• valuation methods, with any significant inputs not being 
based on observable market data (level 3)
accounting policies
on initial recognition, other investments are classified  
as assets available for sale, recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit and 
loss. unrealised value adjustments are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. on realisation, value adjustments 
are transferred to net financial items in the income state-
ment. the determination of fair values is based on equity 
values. contingent considerations arising from the  
acquisition of enterprises and activities are recognised at 
fair value at the time of acquisition. the obligations are 
re-evaluated on a recurring basis at fair value.

accounting policies
tax on the year’s profit includes current tax and any 
changes in deferred tax. current tax includes taxes payable 
determined on the basis of the estimated taxable income 
for the year and any prior-year tax adjustments. tax on 
changes in equity and other comprehensive income is  
recognised directly in equity and in other comprehensive 
income, respectively. foreign currency translation adjust-
ments of deferred tax are recognised as part of the year’s 
adjustments of deferred tax.
current tax liabilities or tax receivables are recognised in 
the balance sheet and determined as tax calculated on the 
year’s taxable income adjusted for any tax on account. the 
tax rates prevailing at the balance sheet date are used for 
calculation of the year’s taxable income.

accounting policies 
deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability 
method on any temporary differences between the tax base 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, except 
for deferred tax on temporary differences arisen either on 
initial recognition of goodwill or on initial recognition of a 
transaction that is not a business combination, with the 
temporary difference ascertained on initial recognition 
affecting neither net profits nor taxable income.
deferred tax is determined on the basis of the tax rules and 
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date in a particular 
country. the effect of any changes in tax rates on deferred 
tax is included in tax on the year’s profit, unless such 
deferred tax is attributable to items previously recognised 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. in the 
latter case, such changes will also be recognised directly in 
equity or in other comprehensive income. the tax base of  
a loss, if any, which may be set off against future taxable 
income, is carried forward and set off against deferred tax  
in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction.
accounting estimates and judgements 
deferred tax assets, including the tax value of any tax losses 
allowed for carryforward, are recognised in the balance 
sheet at the estimated realisable value of such assets, either 
by a set-off against a deferred tax liability or by a net asset 
to be set off against future positive taxable income. at the 
balance sheet date, an assessment is made as to whether it 
is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available  
in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be 
utilised. deferred tax on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts and the tax values of investments in  
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is recognised, 
unless the parent is able to control the time of realisation of 
such deferred tax, and it is probable that such deferred tax 
will not be realised as current tax in the foreseeable future. 
deferred tax is recognised in respect of eliminations of  
intra-group profits and losses.

on 1 january 2020, the ownership structure of sennheiser 
communications a/s was changed through a demerger 
whereby demant a/s obtained full control of the gaming 
and enterprise solutions segments, and german 
sennheiser electronic gmbh & co. kg (“sennheiser kg”) 
obtained control of the mobile segment. the purchase 
price for the gaming and enterprise solutions segments 
was dkk 477 million. the demerger is based on a cashfree 
split of ownership. 
 
on 2 january 2020, demant a/s acquired an additional 
interest in audilab sas, which is a large retail network of 
hearing aid clinics in france, based on a model of shared 
ownership with audiologists. we previously held a 
non-controlling interest in the network, and we are now 
the direct owner of 95% of the shares in audilab sas.  
the total fair value of 95% of the shares in audilab sas, 
on the acquisition date, was dkk 381 million. 
the group’s other acquisitions in 2020 consist of a number 
of minor retail acquisitions, in north america and europe. 
in respect of these acquisitions, we paid acquisition costs 
exceeding the fair values of the acquired assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities. such positive balances in value 
can be attributed to expected synergies between the  
activities of the acquired entities and our existing activities, 
to the future growth opportunities and to the value of staff 
competencies in the acquired entities. these synergies are 
not recognised separately from goodwill, as they are not 
separately identifiable.
at the time of acquisition, non-controlling interests’ shares 
of acquisitions were measured at their proportionate 
shares of the total fair value of the acquired entities includ-
ing goodwill. on obtaining a controlling interest through 
step acquisitions, previously held non-controlling interests 
are at the time of obtaining control included at fair value 
with fair value adjustments in the income statement. 
in 2020, a few adjustments were made to the preliminary 
recognition of acquisitions made in 2019. these  
adjustments were made in respect of payments made, 
contingent considerations provided, and net assets and 
goodwill acquired. the impact of these adjustments on 
goodwill was dkk 1 million (dkk 2 million in 2019), the 
impact on contingent considerations was dkk 0 million 
(dkk 3 million in 2019). in relation to acquisitions with final 
recognition in 2015-2019, adjustments were made in 2020 
in respect of estimated contingent considerations. such 
adjustments are recognised in the income statement. 
the total impact on the income statement of fair value 
adjustments of non-controlling interests in step acquisi-
tions amounted to dkk 454 million (dkk 13 million in 
2019), and adjustments of contingent considerations made 
via the income statement of dkk 16 million (dkk 9 million 
in 2019) are recognised under distribution costs for acqui-
sitions and dkk 5 million are recognised in share of profit 
after tax, associates and joint ventures for associates and 
joint ventures. 
 
of the total acquisition entries in 2020, the fair value  
of estimated contingent considerations in the form of  
earn-outs or deferred payments accounted for dkk 76 
million (dkk 36 million in 2019). such payments depend on 
the results of the acquired entities for a period of 1-5 years 
after takeover and can total a maximum of dkk 82 million 
(dkk 39 million in 2019) for acquisitions. 
the acquired assets include contractual receivables 
amounting to dkk 126 million (dkk 38 million in 2019)  
of which dkk 1 million (dkk 1 million in 2019) was 
thought to be uncollectible at the date of the acquisition. 
of total goodwill in the amount of dkk 867 million  
(dkk 491 million in 2019), dkk 91 million (dkk 198 million 
in 2019) can be amortised for tax purposes.
transaction costs in connection with acquisitions made in 
2020 amounted to dkk 2 million (dkk 2 million in 2019), 
which has been recognised under distribution costs. 
revenue and profit generated by the acquired enterprises 
since our acquisition in 2020 amount to dkk 1,428 million 
(dkk 125 million in 2019) and dkk 143 million, excluding 
one-off in epos of dkk 217 million (dkk 6 million in 2019), 
respectively. had such revenue and profit been consolidat-
ed on 1 january 2020, we estimate that consolidated pro-
forma revenue and profit would have been dkk 14,524 
million (dkk 15,060 million in 2019) and dkk 1,136 million 
(dkk 1,472 million in 2019), respectively. without taking 
synergies from our core business into account, we believe 
that these pro forma figures reflect the level of consolidat-
ed earnings after our acquisition of the enterprises.
 
the above statements of the fair values of acquisitions are 
not considered final until 12 months after takeover.
from the balance sheet date and until the date of financial 
reporting in 2021, we have acquired additional distribution 
enterprises. we are in the process of assessing their fair 
value. the acquisition cost is expected to relate primarily  
to goodwill.

section 6 · acquisitions

demant · annual report 2020
demant · annual report 2020
accounting policies
newly acquired or newly established enterprises are  
recognised in the consolidated financial statements from 
the time of acquisition or formation. the time of acquisition 
is the date when control of the enterprise is transferred to 
the group. for group accounting policies on control, please 
refer to the consolidated financial statements in note 9.1. 
in respect of newly acquired enterprises, comparative  
figures and key figures will not be restated. on acquiring 
new enterprises of which the group obtains control, the 
purchase method is applied according to which their  
identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
measured at their fair values on the acquisition date. any 
non-current assets acquired for the purpose of resale are, 
however, measured at their fair values less expected cost 
of disposal. restructuring costs are solely recognised in the 
pre-acquisition balance sheet if they are a liability for the 
acquired enterprise. any tax effect of revaluations will be 
taken into account.
the acquisition cost of an enterprise consists of the fair 
value of the consideration paid for the enterprise with 
addition of fair value of previously held interests in the 
acquiree. if the final consideration is conditional upon one 
or more future events, the consideration will be recognised 
at the fair value on acquisition. any subsequent adjust-
ment of contingent consideration is recognised directly in 
the income statement, unless the adjustment is the result 
of new information about conditions prevailing on the  
acquisition date, and this information becomes available 
up to 12 months after the acquisition date. transaction 
costs are recognised directly in the income statement 
when incurred. if costs exceed the fair values of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities identified on acquisition, 
any remaining positive differences (goodwill) are recog-
nised in the balance sheet under intangible assets and 
tested for impairment at least annually. if the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, it is 
written down to such lower recoverable amount.
if, on the acquisition date, there are any uncertainties  
with respect to identifying or measuring acquired assets, 
liabilities or contingent liabilities or uncertainty with 
respect to determining their cost, initial recognition is  
made on the basis of provisionally calculated values.  
such provisionally calculated values may be adjusted, or 
additional assets or liabilities may be recognised up to  
12 months after the acquisition date, if new information 
becomes available about conditions prevailing on the 
acquisition date, which would have affected the calcula-
tion of values on that day, had such information been 
known. 
accounting estimates and judgements 
identification of assets and liabilities
on recognition of assets and liabilities from business  
combinations, management judgements may be required 
for the following areas:
• intangible assets resulting from technology, customer 
relationships, client lists or brand names 
• contingent consideration arrangements 
contingent consideration 
business combinations may include provisions that 
additional payments of contingent considerations be  
paid to the previous owners when certain events occur or  
certain results are obtained. management assesses on a 
regular basis the judgements made in respect of the  
particular acquisitions, taking sales run rates of the 
acquired entity into account.

generally, the group does not offer defined benefit plans, 
but it has such plans in switzerland, france and germany 
where they are required by law.
defined benefit plan costs recognised in the income state-
ment amount to dkk 28 million (dkk 22 million in 2019), 
accumulated actuarial loss recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income amount to dkk 129 million  
(dkk 128 million in 2019).
the group expects to pay approximately dkk 23 million in 
2020 (dkk 25 million in 2019) into defined benefit plans.
defined benefit obligations in the amount of dkk 117  
million (dkk 107 million in 2019) will mature within  
1-5 years and obligations in the amount of dkk 447  
million (dkk 412 million in 2019) after five years.
if the discount rate is 0,5% higher (lower), the defined  
benefit obligation would decrease with 8% (increase with 
9%). if the expected salary growth rate is 0,5% higher 
(lower) the defined benefit obligation would increase with 
1% (decrease with 1%).

accounting policies
provisions are recognised if, as a result of an earlier event, 
the group has a legal or constructive obligation, and if the 
settlement of such an obligation is expected to draw on 
corporate financial resources, but there is uncertainty 
about the timing or amount of the obligation. provisions 
are measured on a discounted basis based on 
management’s best estimate of the amount at which a 
particular liability may be settled. the discount effect of 
any changes in the present value of provisions is recog-
nised as a financial expense.
the group has defined benefit plans and similar agree-
ments with some of its employees. as regards defined  
contribution plans, the group pays regular, fixed contribu-
tions to independent pension companies. contributions are 
recognised in the income statement for the period in which 
employees have performed work entitling them to such 
pension contributions. contributions due are recognised  
in the balance sheet as a liability.
as regards defined benefit plans, the group is obliged to 
pay a certain contribution when an employee covered by 
such a plan retires, for instance a fixed amount or a  
percentage of the employee’s final salary. an actuarial  
calculation is made periodically of the accrued present 
value of future benefits to which employees through their 
past employment with the group are entitled and which 
are payable under the defined benefit plan. this defined 
benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected 
unit credit method on the basis of judgements in respect of 
the future development in for instance wage levels, interest 
rates and inflation rates. the defined benefit obligation less 
the fair value of any assets relating to the defined benefit 
plan is recognised in the balance sheet under provisions.
defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
• service costs, including current service costs,  
past-service costs as well as gains and losses on  
curtailments and settlements 
• net interest expense or income 
• remeasurements 
remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
any effects of changes to the asset ceiling as well as return 
on defined benefit assets, excluding interest, are reflected 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in 
which it occurs. 
remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reflected immediately in retained earnings and 
are not reclassified to the income statement. service costs 
and net interest expenses or income are included in the 
income statement as staff costs.
other non-current employee benefits are recognised using 
actuarial calculation. actuarial gains or losses on such  
benefits are recognised directly in the income statement. 
accounting estimates and judgements 
management assesses, on an ongoing basis, provisions for 
restructuring costs and the likely outcome of pending and 
probable lawsuits etc. (other provisions). when assessing 
the likely outcome of lawsuits, management bases its 
assessment on internal and external legal advice and 
established precedent. provisions for restructuring costs 
are based on the estimated costs of implementing restruc-
turing initiatives and thus on a number of assumptions 
about future costs and events. for all provisions, the  
outcome and final expense depend on future events,  
which are by nature uncertain. 
7.1 provisions (continued)

product-related liabilities include standard warranties  
and returned products etc. staff-related liabilities include 
holiday pay and payroll costs due.
the carrying amounts of other liabilities approximate the 
fair values of such liabilities
accounting policies
other non-financial liabilities are recognised if, as a result 
of an earlier event, the group has a legal or constructive 
obligation, and if the settlement of such obligation is 
expected to draw on corporate financial resources. other 
non-financial liabilities are measured on a discounted 
basis, and the discount effect of any changes in the  
present value of the liabilities is recognised as a financial 
expense.
on the sale of products with a right of return, a liability  
is recognised in respect of the profit on products expected 
to be returned and of any costs incurred with the return  
of such products. warranty commitments include an  
obligation to remedy faulty or defective products during  
the warranty period.
accounting estimates and judgements
liabilities in respect of service packages and warranties 
are calculated on the basis of information on products sold, 
related service and warranty periods and past experience 
of costs incurred by the group to fulfil its service and  
warranty liabilities. liabilities in respect of returns are  
calculated based on information on products sold, related 
rights concerning returns and past experience of products 
being returned in the  various markets. consolidated  
product-related liabilities are the sum of a large number of 
small items, the sum changing constantly due to a large 
number of transactions.

legal proceedings.
as part of our business activities, the group has entered 
into normal agreements with customers and suppliers etc.

general
the consolidated financial statements are presented in 
compliance with international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and danish  
disclosure requirements for annual reports published by 
reporting class d (listed) companies, cf. the danish  
executive order on ifrs issued in compliance with the 
danish financial statements act. the registered office  
of demant a/s is in denmark.
the consolidated financial statements are presented in 
danish kroner (dkk), which is the functional currency for 
the parent. the consolidated financial statements are  
presented based on historical cost, except for obligations 
for contingent consideration in connection with business 
combinations, share-based remuneration, derivatives and 
financial assets classified as assets available for sale, 
which are measured at fair value. 
the financial statements for the parent as well as the 
parent’s accounting policies are presented separately from 
the consolidated financial statements and are shown on 
the last pages of this annual report 2020.
except for the implementation of new and amended  
standards as described below as well as insignificant 
reclassifications of the comparative figures for 2019, the 
accounting policies remain unchanged compare to last year.
effect of new accounting standards
the group has adopted all new, amended and revised 
accounting standards and interpretations as published by 
the iasb and adopted by the eu effective for the account-
ing period beginning 1 january 2020. none of these new, 
updated and amended standards and interpretations 
resulted in any changes to the accounting policies for the 
group or had any significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements for 2020.
iasb has issued new accounting standards and amend-
ments not yet in force:
• ias 1 presentation of financial statements
• ifrs 3 business combinations
• ias 16 property, plant and equipment
• ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and  
contingent assets
none of the above standards are endorsed by the eu. the 
changes to these standards are not expected to have any 
significant impact on the group. 
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise demant 
a/s (the parent) and the enterprises in which the parent 
can or does exercise control by either directly or indirectly 
holding more than 50% of the voting rights, or in which the 
parent exercises control in some other manner. enterprises 
in which the group holds 20-50% of the voting rights and/
or in some other manner can or does exercise significant 
influence are considered associates or joint ventures and 
are incorporated proportionately into the consolidated 
financial statements using the equity method.
consolidation principles
the consolidated financial statements are prepared  
based on the financial statements of the parent and its 
subsidiaries by aggregating uniform items. enterprises 
that, by agreement, are managed jointly with one or more 
other enterprises are recognised using the equity method. 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the group’s accounting policies. intra-
group income, expenses, shareholdings, balances, and  
dividends as well as unrealised intra-group profits on 
inventories are eliminated.
the accounting items of subsidiaries are recognised  
100% in the consolidated financial statements. on initial 
recognition, non-controlling interests are measured either 
at fair value or at their proportionate share of the fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabili-
ties of the acquired subsidiary. the method is chosen for 
each individual transaction. non-controlling interests are 
subsequently adjusted according to their proportionate 
share of changes in equity of the subsidiary. 
9.1 group accounting policies
132
demant · annual report 2020
demant · annual report 2020
section 9 · basis for preparation
comprehensive income is allocated to non-controlling  
interests whether or not, as a result hereof, the value of 
such interests is negative. the purchase or sale of non- 
controlling interests in a subsidiary, which does not result  
in obtaining or discontinuing control of such subsidiary, is 
treated as an equity transaction in the consolidated  
financial statements, and any difference between the 
consideration and the carrying amount is allocated to  
the parent’s share of the equity.
income statement
income and costs are recognised on an accruals basis.  
the income statement is broken down by function, and all 
costs, including depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
losses, are therefore charged to production, distribution, 
administration and r&d.
production costs
production costs are costs incurred to generate revenue. 
distribution companies recognise cost of goods sold under 
production costs. production companies recognise cost of 
raw materials, consumables, production staff as well  
as maintenance of and depreciation, amortisation and 
impairment losses on property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets used in the production process under  
production costs.
r&d costs
research costs are always recognised in the income  
statement as such costs incur. development costs include 
all costs not satisfying capitalisation criteria, but incurred  
in connection with development, prototype construction, 
development of new business concepts and amortisation  
of capitalised development costs.
distribution costs
distribution costs include costs relating to training, sales, 
marketing, promotion materials, distribution, bad debts as 
well as depreciation and amortisation of and impairment 
losses on assets used for distribution purposes.
administrative expenses
administrative expenses include administrative staff costs, 
office expenses as well as depreciation and amortisation of 
and impairment losses on assets used for administrative 
purposes.
prepaid expenses
prepaid expenses recognised under assets include costs 
relating to the subsequent financial years. prepaid expenses 
are measured at cost.
other operating income
other operating income includes income from all activities 
not related to the core business activities of the group, such 
as income from insurance etc.
equity
foreign currency translation reserve includes foreign  
currency translation adjustments on the translation of 
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures from their respective functional currencies 
into danish kroner. foreign currency translation adjust-
ments are recognised in the income statement on realisa-
tion of the net investment. hedging reserves include fair 
value adjustments of derivatives and loans satisfying the 
criteria for hedging of future transactions. the amounts are 
recognised in the income statement or the balance sheet at 
the same time as hedged transactions are recognised.
treasury shares and dividend
on the buy-back of shares or sale of treasury shares, the 
purchase price or selling price, respectively, is recognised 
directly in equity under other reserves (retained earnings). 
a capital reduction through the cancellation of treasury 
shares will reduce the share capital by an amount  
corresponding to the nominal value of such shares. 
proposed dividends are recognised as a liability at the  
time of adoption at the annual general meeting.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is prepared according to the  
indirect method and reflects the consolidated net cash  
flow broken down into operating, investing and financing 
activities. 
cash flow from operating activities includes inflows from 
the year’s operations adjusted for non-cash operating 
items, changes in working capital, financial income 
received, financial expenses paid, realised foreign currency 
translation gains and losses and income tax paid. cash 
flow from operating activities also includes short-term 
lease payments, payments for leases of low-value assets 
and variable lease payments.
cash flow from investing activities includes payments in 
respect of the acquisition or divestment of enterprises and 
financial assets as well as the purchase, development, 
improvement or sale of intangible assets and property, 
plant, and equipment. in addition to this, cash flow from 
investing activities also includes movement in receivables 
from associates and joint ventures as well as customer 
loans.
cash flow from financing activities includes payments to 
and from shareholders and the raising and repayment of 
non-current and current debt and lease liabilities. 
cash flow in currencies other than the functional currency 
is recognised at average exchange rates for the months  
of the year unless they deviate significantly from actual 
exchange rates on the transaction dates. repayments  
of lease liabilities are included as well. 
cash and cash equivalents are cash less overdrafts, which 
consist of uncommitted bank facilities that often fluctuate 
from positive to overdrawn. any short-term bank facilities 
that are consistently overdrawn are considered cash flow 
from financing activities.

9.2 accounting estimates and judgements
on the preparation of the consolidated financial  
statements, management makes a number of accounting 
estimates and judgements. these relate to the recognition, 
measurement and classification of assets and liabilities. 
many items can only be estimated rather than accurately 
measured. such estimates are based on the most recent 
information available on preparation of the financial  
statements. estimates and assumptions are therefore reas-
sessed on an ongoing basis. actual figures may, however, 
deviate from these estimates. any changes in accounting 
estimates will be recognised in the reporting period in 
which such changes are made.
significant accounting estimates and judgements are 
described below: 
1.6 inventories 
1.7 receivables
3.3 leases
3.5 impairment (identification of cgus) 
5.2 deferred tax

the cap will run until 2023.
sensitivity analysis in respect of interest rates
based on the bank debt facilities at the end of the 2020 
financial year, a rise of 1 percentage point in the general 
interest rate level will cause an increase in the parent’s 
annual interest expenses before tax of approx. dkk 9  
million (dkk 12 million in 2019). about 90% of the inter-
est-bearing debt is subject to fixed or limited interest rates, 
partly due to a bought cap (a strip of call options), and 
partly due to loans being raised at fixed interest rates.

10.13 parent accounting policies
the financial statements of the parent, demant a/s, are 
presented in accordance with the provisions of the danish 
financial statements act for class d entities.
the parent financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner (dkk), which is also the functional currency for the 
parent. the accounting policies are the same as last year.
in respect of recognition and measurement, the parent’s 
accounting policies are generally consistent with the 
group’s accounting policies. the instances in which the 
parent’s accounting policies deviate from those of the 
group are described below.
the parent has decided to apply the recognition and meas-
urement in accordance with ifrs 15 and 16. the standards 
affects the parent’s proportionate share of its subsidiaries’ 
equity value, and ifrs 16 affects the parent’s leases.
income statement
tax
the parent is jointly taxed with its danish subsidiaries and 
its parent, william demant invest a/s. current income tax 
is allocated to the jointly taxed danish companies in pro-
portion to their taxable income.
balance sheet
goodwill
goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 
years, which is the useful life determined on the basis of 
management’s experience in respect of the individual busi-
ness activities. goodwill is written down to its recoverable 
amount, if lower than its carrying amount.
rights
rights acquired are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives and measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. the 
amortisation period is five years. rights acquired are writ-
ten down to their recoverable value, if lower than their car-
rying value.
investments in subsidiaries and associates
investments in subsidiaries and associates are recognised 
and measured using the equity method, i.e. interests are 
measured at the proportionate share of the equity values 
of such subsidiaries and associates with the addition or 
deduction of the carrying amount of goodwill and with the 
addition or deduction of unrealised intra-group profits or 
losses, respectively.
the parent’s proportionate shares of profits or losses in 
subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income 
statement after elimination of unrealised intra-group profits 
or losses less any amortisation and impairment of goodwill.
subsidiaries and associates with negative equity values 
are measured at dkk 0, and any receivables from such 
companies are written down with the parent’s share of the
