we compose the portfolio

management's report
the coronavirus pandemic made 2020 a year like 
no other, causing major changes. our businesses 
were impacted in various ways, and looking back on 
the year, we can see how the conglomerate has truly 
shown its strength. schouw & co. is well prepared 
for the years ahead, and 2021 has the potential to 
be another year of solid results.
the conglomerate 
shows its strength
a turbulent and very unusual year
our basic mantra at schouw & co. is that re-
sults are created by people. when the corona-
virus crisis struck in early 2020, there was no 
doubt whatsoever that the health and safety 
of our nearly 10,000 employees would be our 
top priority. already in february, we defined 
the foundation for our corona strategy: ‘people 
first, profit next’. 
the culture at schouw & co. is based on 
strong values and on delegating responsibil-
ity to the executives and managements of our 
businesses. it has been very reassuring to see 
how managers and staff alike in more than 
thirty countries have taken responsibility, and 
it has been great to witness how people pro-
duce solid results when shown trust and given 
opportunities. i am honestly very proud and 
impressed by the efforts made by our loyal 
and dedicated employees across the group.
as in many other years, openness to change 
and business acumen were key at schouw & 
co. in 2020. we managed to respond to sud-
den changes to the market situation, adapting 
quickly and efficiently. we saw our customers’ 
factories closing at very short notice and had 
to halt our own production, virtually overnight. 
on the other hand, there were also examples 
of how the coronavirus pandemic caused a 
surge in demand for ppes and hospital equip-
ment. we have pursued opportunities, been 
creative, used the potential of our value chains 
and made the best of a highly extraordinary 
situation.

journey in growth with  
focus on profitability
responsible and profitable growth is deeply 
embedded in our dna, and i am very pleased 
to note that we managed to increase our 
revenue to an all-time high of dkk 21.3 billion 
despite the turbulence, uncertainty and lower 
prices of raw materials. our operations also 
performed better than ever with ebitda at 
dkk 2.2 billion and operating cash flows of 
dkk 2.3 billion.
our ambitions for growth are unchanged, 
and in the coming years, we will continue to 
invest in more capacity, innovation and in 
future-proofing our businesses. our focus is 
on long-term and responsible transformation, 
and we will be making capex investments of 
close to dkk 1 billion in 2021. we are making 
significant investments in our two fibertex 
businesses, but gpv and hydraspecma also 
provide attractive opportunities to create 
future growth and to pave the way for more 
streamlined and efficient production. 
company acquisitions are always on our 
agenda, but this is a difficult topic to commu-
nicate on in any detail. we aim to make use of 
our financial capacity, and our main focus is 
on bolt-on acquisitions for our existing busi-
nesses and within fields where we can build on 
our strong existing positions. 
at schouw & co., we are ambitious for the 
future. our businesses all operate in indus-
tries driven by basic growth trends, and they 
all continue to have a large potential. when 
allocating capital, we evaluate new markets 
and technologies; we consider opportunities 
that can support innovation, and we build for 
resilience. we believe that dynamic compa-
nies create the most value. 
more relevant than ever before
the strength of our conglomerate becomes 
clear in times of global turbulence and un-
certainty. our six portfolio businesses give us 
significant risk diversification, both geo-
graphically and in terms of the industries they 
operate in. 
schouw & co.’s strategy and business model 
are unchanged and very clear. we develop 
and transform a diversified portfolio of leading 
b2b businesses through long-term, inspiring 
and responsible ownership. our long-term fo-
cus remains the cornerstone of our group, but 
we never forget that solid day-to-day opera-
tions are the foundations of profitability. 
over the past few years, we have upgraded 
our esg reporting on environmental, social 
and governance issues. to complement our 
annual report, we also publish an esg report, 
in which we comment on many of our initia-
tives and non-financial performance indica-
tors. our businesses managed to reduce their 
relative energy consumption and had fewer 
lost-time injuries in virtually every year from 
2016 to 2020. we own a number of busi-
nesses where an increased focus on esg will 
create additional value.
we hope and trust that 2021 may be a more 
normal year. we expect our revenue will 
increase, mainly due to higher prices of raw 
materials, whereas our operating profit will 
likely not surpass the high level achieved 
in 2020, which was a year of non-recurring 
events and favourable prices of raw materials. 
the investments we will be making in 2021 
will be the foundation for future growth, and as 
always we will have a keen eye on optimising 
margins, strengthening customer relation-
ships, optimising production setups and value 
chains and on streamlining capacity costs.

schouw & co.'s business model
schouw & co. has a long-term investment horizon. we invest in

the potential to grow and evolve through active ownership.
b u i l d i n g  o u r  p o r t f o l i o
buying and selling businesses has historically been an essential component of creating value at schouw

best ownership
when schouw & co. has bought a company, it has never been  with the intention of reselling it.  
we believe businesses develop best when focused on long-term growth and development. 
schouw & co. is the best owner of the businesses in our portfolio as long as we have the necessary 
resources to support their strategy and transformation. however, we are also open to strategic joint 
ownership or to divesting a company if a new ownership has the potential to take the company to the 
next level, thereby providing the best solution for the shareholders of schouw & co.
schouw & co.  
as an active owner
when exercising ownership of  
a business, schouw & co. will always be  
guided by an intention to create value in a  
decent and trustworthy manner. our aim is to  
consistently be a relevant and meaningful  
owner and to challenge and develop  
our businesses. we do not  believe that  
micromanagement and unnecessary  
reporting and intervention  
create long-term 
value.
long-term and 
visionary
as owners, we willingly  
take risks and invest to  
future-proof our businesses 
when the long-term poten-

management's report
it was a very unusual year for the schouw & 
co. group in 2020. the guidance provided 
at the release of annual report 2019 was for 
revenue increasing in 2020 with ebitda at the 
same high level as reported for 2019. a few 
weeks later, uncertainty had grown to such an 
extent that we found it necessary to suspend 
the announced financial guidance. 
however, the situation gradually stabilised 
over the months that followed to an extent 
that allowed us to restore guidance in august 
at a level slightly higher than what we had 
communicated at the start of the year, before 
upgrading it further in november. the year 
closed with a record-setting fourth quarter 
and revenue up by 1% year on year despite 
lower prices of raw materials and lower 
exchange rates, and with ebitda up by 14% 
over q4 2019.

the 2020 consolidated revenue was up by 
2% to dkk 21,273 million from dkk 20,946 
million in 2019. biomar, fibertex nonwovens 
and gpv all contributed to the improvement, 
while the three other businesses all reported 
lower revenue. however, the moderate revenue 
increase was based on a higher increase in 
volume sales, as selling prices of a number of 
products had dropped relative to the previous 
year due to lower prices of raw materials and 
lower exchange rates.
reported ebitda was up from dkk 1,951 
million in 2019 to dkk 2,209 million in 2020, 
for a 13% increase driven mainly by sharply 
improved performances by fibertex nonwo-
vens, gpv and fibertex personal care.
associates and joint ventures, which are 
recog nised at a share of profit after tax, 
contributed a dkk 36 million loss for 2020 
compared to a dkk 50 million profit in 2019. 
the loss was due to the biomar operations, 
and was especially due to the chilean fish 
farming business salmones austral, while the 
joint ventures in china and turkey combined 
contributed better profits than the year before. 
consolidated net financial items were an ex-
pense of dkk 133 million in 2020, compared 
with a dkk 79 million expense in 2019. as 
actual net interest expenses fell from dkk 84 
million in 2019 to dkk 76 million in 2020, the 
increase in total net financing was attributable 
to the remaining financial items, including  for-
eign exchange and fair value adjustments, etc. 
this brought the consolidated profit before 
tax for 2020 to dkk 1,209 million against dkk 
1,149 million in 2019.
financial highlights of the six portfolio busi-
nesses are set out on pages 32-33, while

liquidity and capital resources
the schouw & co. group’s operations gener-
ated a cash inflow of dkk 2,296 million in 
2020, compared with dkk 1,410 million in 
2019. the main drivers of the significant in-
crease were biomar and fibertex nonwovens, 
but all the group’s businesses contributed 
with the exception of fibertex personal care, 
which still managed to retain the strong cash 
inflows of the previous year. 
cash flows for investing activities amounted 
to dkk 533 million in 2020, which in addi-
tion to ongoing maintenance purposes in all 
businesses was used primarily for capacity-
expanding investments in biomar, build-
ing extensions in hydraspecma and for a 
company acquisition by borg automotive. by 
comparison, the 2019 cash flows for invest-
ing activities amounted to dkk 1,043 million, 
which were mainly for capacity-expanding 
investments in biomar and company acquisi-
tions in biomar and fibertex nonwovens.
the consolidated working capital fell by 17% 
from dkk 3,738 million at 31 december 2019 
to dkk 3,107 million at 31 december 2020. 
all of the group’s business contributed to 
reducing the working capital, while another 
supportive factor was the effects of extended 
deadlines for paying employee income taxes, 
etc. due to the coronavirus situation.
a highly unusual year with increased volume sales and a strong ebitda improvement.  
solid cash flows from operations and sharply reduced debt along with successful capitalisation 
of business opportunities. growing and developing the business still a high priority.

group developments
the companies of the schouw & co. group 
worked during 2020 to align their businesses 
to a situation in which coronavirus is a part of 
day-to-day operations. this is a comprehen-
sive task, given the fact that the group oper-
ates production facilities in 29 countries and 
sells its products in more than 100 countries 
but, at the same time, the diverse nature of 
the portfolio companies has shown the true 
strength of the conglomerate.
the group’s businesses have truly managed 
to incorporate the necessary precautions to 
tackle the coronavirus situation in their day-
to-day operations, and bar a few temporary 
exceptions, the group managed to maintain 
near-normal operations and its usual service 
levels throughout the year. the primary 
objective of the strategy for addressing the 
coronavirus situation has been, first of all, to 
organise good and safe working conditions for 
the employees and, next, to keep operations 
as near-normal as possible. this approach 
generally proved successful, and several of the 
businesses found new and attractive business 
opportunities, which we had the necessary 
resources and capacity to capitalise on.
the combination of strong consolidated 
cash flows and a moderate investment rate in 
2020 enabled the group to sharply reduce its 
debt. obviously, this strengthens our financial 
versatility and enables us to have growth and 
development as a high priority. our businesses 
already have major capacity-expanding invest-
ments underway, and we expect additional 
attractive profitable investment opportunities 
going forward.
the following is a brief review of other business 
developments in the portfolio companies in 
2020. see the individual company reviews on 
the following pages for more information.
biomar had a good year with revenue and 
ebitda improving and strong positive cash 
flows from operations. despite the un usual con-
ditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, 
biomar managed to maintain near-normal 
operations during the year. the company estab-
lished new product capacity in australia, china 
and ecuador and, after the end of the financial 
year, the planned agreement for a partnership 
in viet-uc in vietnam was finally concluded. 
fibertex personal care reported good finan-
cial results and maintained large cash inflows 
from operations. the company increased its 
volume sales, but lower selling prices resulting

other than as set out elsewhere in this 
annual report, schouw & co. is not 
aware of events occurring after 31 de-
cember 2020 which are expected to 
have a material effect on the group's 
financial position or outlook.

the board of directors recommends 
to the annual general meeting that 
the dividend for 2020 remain at dkk 
14 per share, for an amount equal to 
2.3% of the market capitalisation at 
31 december 2020. as a result, total 
dividend payments will amount to dkk 
357 million, equal to a payout ratio of 
39% after tax.
from lower prices of raw materials and lower 
exchange rates led to a drop in revenue. new 
production capacity is underway in malaysia 
and the usa. 
fibertex nonwovens reported strong 
improvements in both revenue and ebitda. 
by quickly adapting to the changing market 
situation brought about by the coronavirus 
pandemic, the company managed to increase 
sales of materials for healthcare-related pur-
poses. full-year ebitda better than expected.
gpv reported a strong earnings improvement 
in an otherwise challenging year. a surge in 
volume sales to selected segments, mainly to 
medtech, offset slumping trends in other seg-
ments. full-year ebitda better than expected.  
hydraspecma closed out a challenging year 
on a strong note in the fourth quarter, increas-
ing sales of products for the vehicles segment 
and retaining strong sales of solutions for wind 
turbines and other stationary equipment. as 
a result, the full-year ebitda was better than 
expected. 
borg automotive clearly felt negative effects 
of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in 
april and may when a number of important 
european markets experienced a significant 
drop in traffic intensity. however, the company 
ended the year on a positive note with growing 
demand. at the end of 2020, borg automo-
tive acquired the turbocharger operations of 
spanish remanufacturing company turbo 
motor inyección.
t a x a t i o n
at schouw & co., we take a respon-
sible approach to tax payments. in 
establishing tax structures, business 
considerations are always the most 
important decision-making parameter, 
and we do not apply tax structures for 
the purpose of tax evasion. the group 
is liable to pay tax in some 30 coun-
tries and regularly conducts related 
party transactions across national 
borders, and payment of corporate 
tax, country-specific charges, vat, 
etc. takes place in accordance with 
national and international tax rules, 
including transfer pricing rules
 
schouw & co. achieved a consolidat-
ed profit before tax of dkk 1,209 mil-
lion for 2020, with corporate income 
tax amounting to dkk 300 million. a 
detailed review of the tax for the year is 
provided on pages 78-81.

depreciation 
in recent years, schouw & co. has described 
its financial results and guidance at ebitda 
level. however, the group believes in the 
importance of reporting developments 
further down the income statement and so 
also discloses depreciation/amortisation and 
impairment charges. 
total ppa-related depreciation and amor-
tisation from the acquisition of businesses 
amounted to dkk 89 million in 2020 and 
related mainly to the acquisitions of alimentsa 
(biomar), ccs (gpv), specma (hydraspec-
ma) and borg automotive. in 2021, ppa-relat-
ed depreciation and amortisation is expected 
to amount to about dkk 85 million. 
other depreciation/amortisation and impair-
ment charges will increase from dkk 744 
million in 2020 to about dkk 775 million in 
2021 as a result of the completed investments 
and the full-year effects of investments made 
in 2019. details of depreciation/amortisation 
for the portfolio companies are shown in the 
table below.
capital expenditure
in the years prior to 2020, schouw & co. 
completed several significant investment 
processes with total annual capex investments 
in the dkk 700–900 million range. going into 
2020, therefore, a natural next step would be 
for the group to focus on optimising and mak-
ing use of the acquired assets. the resulting 
investment restraint planned for 2020 was 
reinforced when the coronavirus pandemic 
escalated and capex investments for the year 
were reduced to dkk 493 million.
the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 resulted in 
a vast number of challenges, but at the close 
of the year it was clear that the group’s overall 
level of activity had not contracted and that 
there are still good opportunities for organic 
expansion available to the group’s businesses. 
accordingly, schouw & co.’s ambitions for 
growth are intact, exposing a potential for 
capex investments for 2021 increasing to 
about dkk 1 billion.
in addition to ongoing maintenance require-
ments and minor expansion projects in all 
portfolio businesses, the expected capex in-
vestments for 2021 would in particular include 
capacity expansion for fibertex personal care,  
fibertex nonwovens, gpv and hydraspecma.

outlook
outlook for 2021
despite a very unusual and challenging year 
in 2020, reported ebitda was higher than 
expected at the beginning of the year. a big 
part of the explanation to this paradox is the 
fact that the group’s businesses had produc-
tion capacity available and were able to adapt 
to changing market conditions.
the good performance was supported by 
favourable price trends for raw materials, but 
the results were only achieved because our 
portfolio companies had strong organisations 
that were ready to deliver under the very dif-
ferent conditions. those strong organisations 
are also in place for 2021, but some of the 
very attractive conditions seen in 2020 are not 
expected to repeat in 2021.  
we expect to see another good year in 2021. 
business activity is expected to remain at a 
high level, and increased investments to be 
made during the year will provide the basis 
for additional growth. even then, the full-year 
results will at best only match those of 2020, 
which was an altogether unusual year. 
the following brief comments provide full-year 
2021 revenue and ebitda guidance for the 
individual portfolio companies. 
 
biomar assumes stable market conditions 
and gradual normalisation and on that basis 
expects to increase volume sales. the outlook 
is supported by the strategic investments 
made in recent years.
fibertex personal care expects to retain 
a high level of volume sales, but earnings will 
be adversely affected by developments in the 
prices of raw materials.
fibertex nonwovens expects good capacity 
utilisation and to increase revenue, but with 
earnings under pressure due to higher prices of 
raw materials and sharply higher freight rates. 
gpv expects the good business activity 
to continue, but the large shipments to the 
medtech segment in 2020 are not expected 
to repeat in 2021, which will slow revenue and 
earnings.
hydraspecma expects to grow its sales to 
customers in the vehicles segment. by retain-
ing business activities in other segments, the 
company expects to increase both revenue 
and ebitda.
borg automotive expects a positive trend in 
demand, and the acquisition of the turbo-
charger operations in spain is expected to 
drive both revenue and ebitda improve-
ments. the projected improvement includes 
the increase in costs expected from britain’s 
withdrawal from the eu and the resulting more 
complex trading environment. 
schouw & co. group’s overall guidance
overall, the schouw & co. group projects full-
year 2021 consolidated revenue of about dkk 
21.9 billion against dkk 21.3 billion in 2020, 
equal to a 3% increase. however, part of the ex-
pected improvement is based on higher prices 
of raw materials, which are of material impor-
tance for several of the group’s businesses. 
schouw & co. provides consolidated earn-
ings guidance at ebitda level based on an 
aggregation of individual portfolio company 
forecasts, and actual portfolio company 
ebitda results may deviate from these in-
dividual forecasts. accordingly, the actual 
guidance is expressed through consolidated 
ebitda, which for 2021 is in the range of 
dkk 2,015-2,225 million compared with dkk 
2,209 million in 2020. 
depreciation and amortisation charges are 
expected to increase from dkk 833 million 
in 2020 to approximately dkk 860 million 
in 2021. as a result, the group guides for 
consolidated 2021 ebit in the range of dkk 
1,155-1,365 million. 
associates and joint ventures, which are 
recognised at a share of profit after tax, are 
expected to contribute profit of approximately 
dkk 40 million in 2021 compared with a dkk 
36 million loss in 2020. 
consolidated net financial items are expected 
to be an expense of about dkk 90 million 
in 2021, compared with a dkk 133 million 
expense in 2020.

risks
building on different business areas and geographies, schouw & co.’s  
conglomerate structure means highly diversified business risk. the main 
business-specific risk relate to biomar, the largest business of the portfolio. 
global macroeconomics
for biomar, fibertex personal care and to some extent 
fibertex nonwovens and borg automotive, their busi-
ness models and sales are not particularly affected by 
the global economic developments. demand for fish and 
thus for fish feed, the consumption of hygiene products, 
and automotive spare parts are cyclical only to a lim-
ited extent, whereas gpv and hydraspecma face more 
cyclicality in sales.
country-specific risk
the group sells its products in more than 100 countries 
and has 60 production facilities in 29 countries, some 
countries have a greater effect than others, and any 
country-specific conditions in countries of special impor-
tance may have derived global effects on the value chain.
acquisitions
m&a has historically been a major value creator, and the 
group will in future have additional opportunities to con-
tribute to consolidate operations and create acquisitive 
growth within the different business areas and geogra-
phies in which the portfolio businesses operate.  
cyber risk
the it systems used by the group’s companies are not 
interconnected. the companies are generally well pro-
tected, but there will always be a risk that individual com-
panies will experience an it breakdown or cybercrime.
market risk
all of the portfolio companies operate in 
highly competitive markets and face natural 
concerns as to whether it will be possible to 
sell the projected volumes at the expected 
prices and to collect trade receivables. risks 
vary from market to market, as there may be 
excess capacity causing pressure on prices in 
some, while in others technology innovation 
may change the competitive setting.
reliance on major customers
all of our portfolio businesses operate in b2b 
markets and serve relatively large customers. 
no one single customer accounts for more 
than 5% of the group’s consolidated revenue, 
but in some cases, the five largest custom-
ers account for more than 50% of a particular 
subsidiary’s revenue. 
risk relating to raw materials
raw material represent the majority of costs 
at group level. our portfolio businesses rely 
on certain raw materials and are thus sensitive 
to large fluctuations in the prices of such raw 
materials. biomar and fibertex personal care 
apply automatic price adjustment mecha-
nisms to a large extent, which at long or short 
lags compensate for price fluctuations.
climate risk
the world is increasingly experiencing 
climate-related effects, but the geographic 
diversification of schouw & co.’s opera-
tions minimises the implications of local 
and regional natural disasters and weather 
phenomena. any reliance on specific 
sources of energy is company-specific. 
currency risk
the broad geographical diversification with 
strong production and sales overlap within 
countries creates a natural hedge at group 
level. the overall foreign currency risk is 
considered to be moderate.
financing risk
debt is generally managed centrally, and 
the parent company and the companies are 
jointly liable for debts. the group mainly 
raises financing with four banks (three of 
which are nordic) and through a schuld-
schein issue. 
interest rate risk
the group has moderate interest-bearing 
debt relative to its earnings, and higher 
interest rates would only have a moderate 
impact on earnings.

fish feed
presence
salmon is farmed mainly in the 
north sea region (mostly in norway 
and scotland) and in chile, though 
in australia too, where biomar also 
has a feed factory. biomar has a total 
of seven factories producing salmon 
feed and a market share of 25–30%.
growth
aquaculture in general, and salmon 
farming in particular, is a growth 
industry driven by global demand 
for healthy and tasty foods. due to 
its high content of omega 3 fatty 
acids, salmon is considered to be 
particularly healthy to eat. with lim-
ited volumes of wild-caught salmon, 
aquaculture is the only sustainable 
way of increasing supply without 
overfishing the oceans.
value creation
biomar has produced quality fish 
feed for farmed salmon since 1987. 
biomar manufactures feed for all 
phases of fresh-water and salt-water 
fish farming operations, from larvae 
to fish ready for slaughter. much of 
today’s feed offers various value-
adding properties, such as feed 
with a higher energy content, feed 
containing special raw materials and 
feed used for treating diseases.
f e e d  f o r  s a l m o n
schouw & co.’s largest business segment, biomar, is 
a global manufacturer of feed for all stages of fish and 
shrimp farming. more than half of the feed produced is for 
salmon farmed in norway, scotland or chile, but biomar 
produces feed for more than 45 different species. biomar 
is an innovative business and its ongoing feed optimi-
sation creates opportunities for sustainable growth.
presence
biomar’s emea region spans 
operations in the mediterranean 
and the baltic regions and includes 
factories in denmark, france, spain, 
greece and turkey. the company 
produces feed for more than forty 
different species, but mainly for 
trout, sea bass and sea bream.  
shrimp farming takes place in 
many different parts of the world. 
biomar manufactures shrimp feed 
in ecuador and costa rica, and 
will soon open a facility in vietnam. 
in china, biomar has a presence 
through a joint venture with a local 
feed manufacturer. 
growth
the global population is growing, 
and healthy and sustainable food 
is in great demand including for 
fish and shellfish, which are eaten 
in all cultures and accepted in all 
religions. shrimp farming takes 
place in many places around the 
world, but mainly in asia and south 
america where the industry is grow-
ing the strongest. the business of 
feed for mediterranean fish species 
is growing at a slower rate. 
value creation
since the company was founded 
in 1962, biomar has produced fish 
feed for a large number of different 
species. innovation and product 
development is deeply entrenched 
in biomar’s dna, and the company 
operates global test centres where 
new raw materials and feed con-
cepts are trialled and feed recipes 
are optimised. sustainability and 
responsibility are key concepts in 
aquaculture. biomar is at the fore-
front of developments and sets the 
standards for quality and reliability 
for the entire value chain.
f e e d  f o r  o t h e r  f i s h  s p e c i e s
biomar is one of the world’s larg-
est manufacturers of quality feed 
for the fish and shrimp farming 
industries and a global player with 
a presence in all major fish and 
shrimp farming regions. schouw 
& co. took an initial ownership 
interest in biomar in 2005, and the 
company became a wholly-owned 
subsidiary through a merger 
process in 2008. biomar accounts 
for about half of schouw & co.’s 
revenue and earnings.

biomar
a good year with revenue and ebitda improving and strong positive cash flows 
from operations. new production capacity in australia, china and ecuador together 
with a new partnership in vietnam. guiding for sustained improvements in 2021. 
biomar is one of the world’s largest manufac-
turers of quality feed for the fish and shrimp 
farming industries. the company’s operations 
are divided into four divisions: 
•  the salmon division covering operations 
in norway, scotland, chile and australia. 
the division supplies high-yielding feed for 
atlantic salmon, pacific salmon and trout.
•  the emea division covering the emea 
region and involving all operations other 
than salmon. the division has production 
facilities in denmark, france, spain, greece 
and turkey.
•  the latam division covering latin american 
operations involving shrimp and fish other 
than salmon. the division has production 
facilities in ecuador and costa rica. 
•  the asia division covering operations involv-
ing fish and shrimp in asia. the division has 
two factories in china and, from 2021, a new 
factory in vietnam. 
the business operations in turkey and china, 
both driven through 50/50 joint ventures with 
local partners, are not consolidated.
financial performance
biomar closed out the year on a high level of 
business activity in the fourth quarter, as vol-
ume sales increased by 5%. however, reported 
revenue fell by 3% from dkk 3,126 million in 
q4 2019 to dkk 3,045 million in q4 2020, 
mostly due to foreign exchange developments. 
both for the fourth quarter and for the year as 
a whole, the increase in volume sales was at-
tributable mainly to the salmon division, with 
the exception of chile where the coronavirus 
situation led to sluggish demand. the ongoing 
efforts to develop close relationships with cus-
tomers on advanced feed solutions and the 
start-up of the new factory in australia were 
some of the most important factors driving the 
improvement. the emea and latam divisions 
were impacted by the coronavirus situation, 
although the emea division improved year-
on-year sales in the fourth quarter as favour-
able water temperatures offset the negative 
effects of the coronavirus pandemic. 
as a result, full-year 2020 revenue was up by 
4% to dkk 11,649 million from dkk 11,180 
million in 2019. the revenue improvement 
was based on a 7% increase in volumes sold 
relative to 2019, which were offset mainly by 
foreign exchange developments. overall, ex-
change rate developments had a negative ef-
fect on revenue of more than dkk 400 million. 
reported q4 2020 ebitda was down 11% 
year on year, especially due to difficult market 
conditions in chile and ecuador caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic, bringing full-year 
j o i n t  v e n t u r e s  a n d  a s s o c i a t e s
biomar manufactures fish feed in china 
and turkey through 50/50 joint ventures 
with local partners. these activities are not 
consolidated, but having a strong presence 
in these markets is very important to biomar 
due to their large growth potential. 
the two feed businesses reported com-
bined 2020 revenue (100% basis) of dkk 
682 million and ebitda of dkk 40 million, 
against revenue of dkk 676 million and 
ebitda of dkk 25 million in 2019. revenue 
developments consisted of a decline in 
turkey due to challenging macroeconomic 
conditions and improvements in china 
following the start-up of the new factory 
in wuxi, near shanghai. the earnings 
improvement was driven by relatively normal 
conditions in 2020, whereas the 2019 figure 
was impacted by provisions for bad debts 
in turkey. 
 
however, the non-consolidated businesses 
also include the chilean fish farming com-
pany salmones austral and three minor 
businesses, letsea, atc patagonia and lcl 
shipping. 
biomar holds a non-strategic ownership 
interest of 22.9% in salmones austral, which 
is recognised as an associate in the consoli-
dated financial statements. at the beginning 
of 2020, the owners of salmones austral 
had expected to work towards a listing of 
the company in santiago, chile for purposes 
of raising capital for the continued develop-
ment of the business. however, the plans for 
an ipo have been postponed until further 
notice due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
furthermore, the coronavirus situation has 
had a severe, negative impact on the year’s 
revenue and earnings in salmones austral. 
the main reason is lower settlement prices 
for farmed salmon, which has obviously in-
fluenced the volumes of fish sold, but it has 
also resulted in negative value adjustments 
of salmon stocks at fish farms. as a result, 
salmones austral reported 2020 revenue of 
dkk 1,089 million and ebitda of dkk -112 
million, against revenue of dkk 1,605 mil-
lion and ebitda of dkk 418 million in 2019. 
the non-consolidated joint ventures and 
associates are recognised in the 2020 
consolidated financial statements at a dkk 
36 million share of loss after tax, compared 
with a dkk 50 million share of profit in 2019.

ebitda to dkk 972 million, compared with 
dkk 966 million in 2019. the moderate 
improvement was driven by increased volume 
sales and a number of cost cuts, but which 
were partially offset by unfavourable foreign 
exchange developments compared with 
2019, and costs related to the coronavirus 
pandemic, such as additional costs for testing, 
cleaning, extra production shifts and support 
provided to local communities in affected 
areas. 
working capital fell from dkk 1,315 million at 
31 december 2019 to dkk 955 million at 31 
december 2020. the reduction of the working 
capital was due to a number of factors, includ-
ing reduced trade receivables and invento-
ries and an increase in other debt. foreign 
exchange developments also contributed to 
reducing the working capital. the use of sup-
ply chain financing amounted to dkk 829 mil-
lion at 31 december 2020, which was largely 
unchanged from 31 december 2019.
roic excluding goodwill remained high, at 
18.4% at 31 december 2020, compared with 
18.8% at 31 december 2019. 
business review 
despite the unusual conditions caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic, biomar managed to 
maintain near-normal operations in 2020. the 
situation varied from country to country, but 
biomar implemented a number of measures in 
order to protect the employees and to support 
local communities in the most affected areas. 
the negative impact on biomar’s overall vol-
ume sales has been relatively modest to date, 
although certain markets have faced more 
challenges than others, particularly chile, 
ecuador and the mediterranean markets. 
however, the current challenges in ecuador 
resulting from the coronavirus pandemic have 
not affected the expectations for long-term 
market growth that were the background 
for the capacity expansion which biomar 
launched in ecuador in 2019. completed 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, the expan-
sion includes a production line for extruded 
feed, which has increased annual production 
capacity by a further 40,000 tonnes. the new 
production line represents an investment of 
about dkk 50 million.
despite the exceptional circumstances in 
2020, biomar also successfully managed to 
start up production at new factories in aus-
tralia and china, despite the travel restraints 
faced by technicians and specialists. the two 
new factories, located in tasmania, australia 
and in wuxi, china, respectively, began com-
mercial operations in the second quarter of 
2020 and, as part of biomar’s global produc-
tion facilities, they now play an important 
role in the company’s presence in those two 
important aquaculture markets.
in the second quarter of 2020, biomar con-
cluded a declaration of intent with a leading 
player in vietnam’s shrimp farming industry, 
viet-uc, intended to pave the way for biomar 
becoming a co-owner and taking operational 
charge of a relatively new feed factory owned 
by viet-uc. the new partnership is expected 
to produce substantial synergies and to 
strengthen biomar’s global position in the 
shrimp feed business. the process to define 
the partnership has taken longer than origi-
nally expected due to the continuing travel 
restrictions, but the parties have collaborated 
constructively and the final agreement on the 
partnership has been signed after year end. 
outlook 
from a general perspective, demand for 
farmed fish and shrimp is progressing well in 
most markets. however, the coronavirus situ-
ation has disrupted the usual sales channels 
for farmed fish and shrimp, leading to import/
export restrictions and creating a highly vola-
tile supply/demand situation and, as a result, 
volatile pricing. 
to date, the coronavirus pandemic has had 
only a limited impact on biomar’s overall vol-
ume sales. however, there have been shifts in 
geographical sales, as fish farmers in certain 
markets have reduced feed volumes, while in 
others sales of more advanced feed products 
have declined and have been replaced by 
relatively more ordinary products. 
according to current assessments, the mar-
kets in chile and ecuador are subject to the 
most uncertainty, as fish farmers are seeing 
the coronavirus pandemic having a very sig-
nificant impact on their sales, especially to the 
horeca segment. the effects of the ongoing 
vaccination programmes are as yet unknown, 
but biomar’s guidance for 2021 assumes 
that primary market conditions will gradually 
normalise. based on that assumption, biomar 
expects an increase in volume sales driven in 
part by gradual normalisation, in part by the 
effects of the strategic investments made in 
recent years.
against this background, biomar expects to 
generate full-year 2021 revenue of about dkk 
12.0 billion, but as always changes in raw 
materials prices and foreign exchange rates 
may impact revenue. earnings may also be af-
fected by foreign exchange developments, but 
based on the current outlook, biomar expects 
to generate ebitda in the range of dkk 950–
1,020 million in 2021.
associates and joint ventures, which are 
recognised at a share of profit after tax, are 
expected to contribute a total share of profit 
of approximately dkk 40 million in 2021. the 
improvement relative to 2020 is largely attrib-
utable to salmones austral, and subject to a 
significant degree of normalisation of salmon 
prices in chile.

fibertex personal 
care is one of the 
world’s largest 
manufacturers of 
spunbond/spun-
melt nonwovens 
for the personal 
care industry.
fibertex nonwo-
vens manufactures 
special-purpose 
nonwovens for a wide 
range of industrial 
and healthcare-relat-
ed applications.
value creation
fibertex nonwovens manu-
factures nonwovens for use in, 
among other things, cars and 
furniture, for wipes, as weed 
covers, in composite products, 
filtration solutions and in 
infrastructure projects. the 
products can be used in place 
of other, more expensive and 
heavier materials, but also as 
an integral part of a customer’s 
production. 
growth
growth in the use of nonwo-
vens derives from new applica-
tions and increased use in 
existing products. for example, 
nonwovens are used to reduce 
the weight of a car and thereby 
to improve its fuel economy, 
while new applications, such 
as for cleaning and filtration, 
are expanding the accessible 
market.
presence
considerable parts of produc-
tion and sales take place within 
the eu, and fibertex nonwovens 
operates factories in denmark, 
france and the czech republic. 
currently, the fastest grow-
ing market is north america, 
where fibertex nonwovens has 
two manufacturing facilities.  
in addition, the company has 
production facilities in turkey, 
brazil and south africa.
growth
in asia, disposable diapers 
are still used much less than 
in europe, where disposable 
diapers are used for virtually all 
babies. due to growing pros-
perity and attention to personal 
hygiene, the asian market has 
grown by more than 10% annu-
ally over the past many years. 
the rate of growth in the global 
market is lower.
value creation
fibertex personal care manu-
factures much of the materials 
used for diapers, sanitary tow-
els and incontinence products. 
in many cases, customers are 
major hygiene product manu-
facturers, such as procter & 
gamble, selling their products 
under well-known brands. for 
many years, customers have 
recognised fibertex personal 
care for its focus on innovation 
and product development.
presence
the production of spunbond 
materials is based in denmark 
and malaysia. the materials 
can be transported relatively 
efficiently, and customers are 
based throughout europe and 
in most parts of south-east 
asia and in japan. in addition 
to the production of spunbond 
nonwovens, the company 
possesses a unique technology 
that allows direct printing on 
nonwoven fabrics. these ser-
vices are provided in germany, 
malaysia and the usa.

fibertex was founded in 1968 and the personal care activities were started up in 1998. in 2011, the two units became 
separate independent companies through a demerger. a common trait for the two companies is that they manufacture 
nonwoven textiles from similar raw materials, whereas their technologies, customers and markets differ completely.

fibertex personal care
fibertex personal care is one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of spunbond/spunmelt 
nonwovens for the personal care industry. the 
company has nonwovens production facilities 
in denmark and malaysia. 
operations include printing on nonwoven tex-
tiles for the personal care industry. the com-
pany is the market leader in this field. printing 
operations are based in germany, malaysia 
and the usa. both businesses focus mainly 
on materials for diapers, sanitary towels and 
incontinence products.
financial performance
fibertex personal care generated revenue of 
dkk 524 million in q4 2020, compared with 
dkk 546 million in q4 2019. the revenue 
decline was driven by a number of opposing 
factors with volume sales increasing in den-
mark and malaysia, while selling prices have 
declined due to lower prices of raw materials 
and lower exchange rates. full-year revenue 
for 2020 was dkk 2,118 million, a 3% drop 
from dkk 2,183 million in 2019.

reported ebitda for 2020 was dkk 406 
million, compared with dkk 352 million in 
2019. the earnings improvement was driven 
in particular by higher volume sales at the 
factories in malaysia and denmark, but also by 
exchange rate terms in contracts and positive 
trends in prices of raw materials. nevertheless, 
reported q4 2020 ebitda was down 5% year 
on year, in part due to less favourable trends 
in prices of raw materials towards the end of 
the year. 
fibertex personal care reduced its working 
capital from dkk 332 million at 31 december 
2019 to dkk 250 million at 31 december 
2020. the reduction of the working capital 
was mainly due to a drop in trade receivables.
the improved earnings lifted roic excluding 
goodwill to 18.3% at 31 december 2020 from 
13.0% at 31 december 2019.
business review
in september 2020, fibertex personal care 
announced plans to set up another production 
line in sendayan, malaysia. the new produc-
tion line is expected to be operational in the 
second half of 2021, enabling fibertex per-
sonal care to share in the continuing growth 
being projected for the asian market. 
at the same time, fibertex personal care 
announced plans to add a new printing line to 
operations in the usa, which is also expected 
to be operational in the second half of 2021, 
to accommodate growing demand for printed 
nonwovens in the us market. representing a 
combined investment of about dkk 250 mil-
lion, the two new production lines will add 10% 
to the existing capacity within each business 
area.
for many years, sustainable production and 
responsible use of resources have been focus 
areas for fibertex personal care and the com-
pany is now the world’s first nonwoven manu-
facturer to be iscc plus certified. as a result, 
the company is now able to supply nonwovens 
based on a sustainable raw material called 
bio-polypropylene or circular polypropylene. 
fibertex personal care’s efforts in this context 
involve six of the united nations’ seventeen 
sustainable development goals (sdgs). in 
order to strengthen its communications in this 
field, fibertex personal care launched a new 
communication concept under the slogan 
“sustainable is possible” along with a different 
visual expression. through a new, more ho-
listic approach to sustainability, the company 
has now launched new initiatives based on a 
mindset to ‘reimagine – reuse – reduce’.  
outlook
demand for nonwovens for the production of 
personal protective equipment remains strong 
due to the coronavirus pandemic, but fibertex 
personal care has retained its main focus 
on materials for diapers, sanitary towels and 
incontinence products. however, business has 
picked up in prints for face masks as still more 
private companies and organisations see an 
opportunity to express their brand, which has 
driven up demand for printed nonwovens with 
various designs, symbols or text. 
from a general perspective, asia is expected 
to see growth in all three core areas, but 
incontinence products have shown particu-
larly positive trends in the european market. 
the high levels of volume sales are expected 
to continue in 2021, whereas developments 
in prices of raw materials will likely impact on 
earnings. 
as a result, fibertex personal care expects to 
generate full-year 2021 revenue of about dkk 
2.2 billion and ebitda in the dkk 320-360 
million range. as always, revenue and ebitda 
are subject to changes in prices of raw materi-
als and in foreign exchange rates.
improved volume sales and effect of exchange rate terms in contracts  
driving all-time high ebitda and strong positive cash flows from operations. 
new production capacity underway in malaysia and the usa.

fibertex nonwovens
fibertex nonwovens is among the world’s 
leading manufacturers of special-purpose 
nonwovens, i.e. fibre sheets produced on 
high-tech processing facilities with various 
purpose-specific post-processings. the 
products are used for a number of differ-
ent industrial and healthcare purposes. the 
company’s core markets are in europe and 
north and south america, while its secondary 
markets are in africa.
financial performance 
fibertex nonwovens reported q4 2020 
revenue of dkk 476 million, a 28% increase 
from dkk 373 million in q4 2019. sales were 
strong in all segments and earnings grew in 
all regions, bringing full-year 2020 revenue to 
dkk 1,791 million, an 5% increase from dkk 
1,705 million in 2019. the revenue improve-
ment was driven by a surge in sales of filtration 
materials and materials for disposable wipes 
as well as a generally positive performance in 
north america. overall sales in europe were 
also slightly higher than in 2019, but reduced 
demand from the automotive industry due 
to the shutdown of automotive plants in the 
second quarter as a consequence of the 
coronavirus pandemic also impacted activities 
in the region.  
the strong turnover in the fourth quarter, which 
also drove a strong earnings improvement, 
brought reported 2020 ebitda to an all-time 
high of dkk 270 million, compared with dkk 
141 million in 2019, which was better than the 
guidance provided in the q3 2020 interim re-
port. the main reasons for the improved earn-
ings were higher sales late in the year com-
bined with an improved product mix, growing 
sales of advanced products and a considerable 
effect from a temporary drop in prices of raw 
materials, although the latter were trending 
upwards towards the end of the year. 
despite the increase in business activity, 
working capital fell from dkk 510 million at 31 
december 2019 to dkk 472 million at 31 de-
cember 2020 due in part to lower inventories.
roic excluding goodwill surged from 3.1% at 
31 december 2019 to 12.2% at 31 december 
2020, driven by increased earnings and lower 
invested capital. 
business review 
in recent years, fibertex nonwovens has con-
solidated its position as a leading manufactur-
er of special-purpose nonwovens. in 2020, the 
company reaped the benefits of recent years’ 
investments in global production capacity, 
which has enabled the company to capitalise 
on the opportunities that have arisen during 
the coronavirus pandemic based on a surge 
in the consumption of filtration materials for 
face masks and materials for wipes, used for 
disinfection purposes, for example. 
market conditions were generally turbulent 
during 2020, with large fluctuations in de-
mand. many of the company’s customers have 
been hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, 
with the automotive industry especially hard 
hit because many factories were forced to 
close in the second quarter. however, there 
were also new business opportunities, and 
the company managed to adapt production 
to market needs as the year progressed. the 
north american operations continued the 
positive developments, and building a pres-
ence in the usa is considered an important 
long-term investment in an attractive growth 
market.  
production capacity has been expanded in 
an ongoing process, most recently with a 
new production line in the usa, while other 
production lines have been upgraded in order 
to increase the proportion of value-added 
products. fibertex nonwovens is planning 
additional investments to expand capacity, in 
both the usa and europe.  
outlook 
going forward, fibertex nonwovens expects 
promising growth opportunities in the use 
of nonwovens for industrial and healthcare-
related purposes. however, the outlook for 
2021 remains full of uncertainty about eco-
nomic developments due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. the latest effect has been a global 
shortage of raw materials, which has triggered 
higher prices and, combined with higher 
freight rates, this will put earnings under pres-
sure until a new equilibrium has been found. 
fibertex nonwovens expects satisfactory 
market activity in 2021 along with good ca-
pacity utilisation for the company. demand for 
filtration material and materials for wipes is 
expected to remain high, making this a logical 
focal area for future strategic investments. the 
company also expects the automotive industry 
will recover some of its business activity. 
against this background, fibertex nonwovens 
expects to generate full-year 2021 revenue of 
dkk 1.8–1.9 billion, while ebitda is projected 
at the range of dkk 220–250 million due to 
rising prices of raw materials.
strong close to the year with considerable revenue and earnings improve-
ments. growing sales of materials for healthcare purposes and strong business 
activity in north america. full-year ebitda better than expected.

gpv
gpv is a leading european ems (electron-
ics manufacturing services) company. the 
company is a high-mix/low-medium vol-
ume manufacturer in the b2b market. core 
products are electronics, mechanics, cable 
harnessing, mechatronics (combination of 
electronics, mechanics and software) and as-
sociated services. 
the company’s customers are mainly major 
international businesses typically headquar-
tered in europe or north america, and gpv 
supplies its customers’ international units in 
more than fifty countries. gpv has a strong 
production platform and operates production 
facilities in denmark, switzerland, germany, 
austria, slovakia, thailand, sri lanka, china 
and mexico.
financial performance
gpv reported q4 2020 revenue of dkk 696 
million, a 2% increase from dkk 682 million 
in q4 2019, bringing full-year revenue to dkk 
2,887 million, a 1% improvement from dkk 
2,856 million in 2019 and a new record. the 
revenue performance was restrained because 
a few of the company’s factories were tempo-
rarily closed fully or in part in compliance with 
government-imposed restrictions on account 
of the coronavirus pandemic. in addition, the 
company saw reduced demand in certain 
market segments during the year, whereas 
other segments, such as medtech and 
semiconductors, enjoyed growing demand. 
in particular, gpv delivered a large order in 
2020 to a medtech customer in the ventilator 
segment, which had a positive effect on both 
revenue and earnings, especially in the third 
quarter.
ebitda for the fourth quarter was much 
better than expected, bringing the full-year 
ebitda to dkk 271 million and ahead of the 
guidance provided in the q3 interim report, 
compared with dkk 196 million in 2019. earn-
ings were lifted by the higher business activity 
resulting from the increased sales to the med-
tech segment, tight cost management and by 
the lower integration and other costs incurred 
relative to the previous year. 
working capital fell from dkk 766 million at 
31 december 2019 to dkk 701 million at 31 
december 2020, mainly due to the ongoing 
work to optimise inventories and the effects 
of extended government deadlines for paying 
in vat and employee income taxes, etc. due 
to the coronavirus situation. roic excluding 
goodwill improved to 11.0% at 31 december 
2020 from 6.0% at 31 december 2019.
business review
meeting customer requirements for high qual-
ity standards and reliability of supply is a top 
priority for gpv. to ensure adequate flexibility, 
the company has an ongoing investment pro-
gramme to step up automation and efficiency. 
this includes ongoing attention to digitising 
business processes, including the use of video 
streaming for customer audits, certification 
audits and implementing new products. 
gpv expects to initiate two planned expan-
sion projects in 2021, one in thailand and one 
in sri lanka. however, the project start-ups 
will depend on how the coronavirus situation 
develops.
outlook
gpv believes the coronavirus situation will 
continue to impact market developments in 
the early months of 2021, which would likely 
affect the general level of business activity in 
the first half of the year. recently, increased 
consumption of components, in particular for 
electrification, computers and 5g networks, 
has extended lead times for electronic com-
ponents. this has led to higher component 
prices and longer lead times.
the large shipments to the medtech segment 
made in 2020 are not expected to repeat in 
2021, but gpv is experiencing growing de-
mand from a number of customers, including 
in the instruments & industry and semicon-
ductor segments, and the company has a 
strong pipeline with an ongoing inflow of new 
contracts and new customers, which in the 
longer term will support its business activity. 
considering the time frame usually required 
for integrating such new activities, the process 
is not expected to offset the negative impact 
of the coronavirus pandemic or the reduced 
sales to the medtech segment over the com-
ing quarters.
against this background, gpv expects to 
generate fy 2021 revenue of about dkk 
2.7 billion and ebitda in the range of dkk 
220–250 million. 
strong earnings improvement in an otherwise challenging year. 
surge in volume sales to selected segments offsets slump in other 
segments. full-year ebitda better than expected.

hydraspecma
hydraspecma is a manufacturing, trading and 
engineering company specialising in power 
& motion whose core business is hydraulic 
components and systems for industry and the 
aftermarket. the company is a market leader 
in the nordic region and also serves custom-
ers from its own businesses in poland, the uk, 
china, india, brazil and the usa. 
financial performance 
the fourth quarter proved to be better than 
expected for hydraspecma. sales improved 
to global customers in the vehicles segment, 
especially commercial vehicle and construc-
tion equipment which had both seen reduced 
activity during the year due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. by the end of the quarter, activity 
in the segment had almost recovered to pre-
pandemic levels. sales of solutions for wind 
turbines and other stationary equipment have 
remained at a high level, while a few other 
segments are still affected by the coronavirus 
situation. 
hydraspecma generated q4 revenue of dkk 
513 million, compared with dkk 509 million 
in q4 2019, bringing full-year revenue to dkk 
1,977 million, a 7% drop from dkk 2,123 mil-
lion in 2019.
driven by the cost adjustments made, a 
change in the product mix and the effects 
of investments in efficiency improvements, 
reported q4 ebitda rose to dkk 51 million 
from dkk 37 million in q4 2019, which was 
better than expected. the full-year ebitda 
was dkk 211 million, in line with the reported 
ebitda for 2019 of dkk 215 million, of which 
gains from the sale of property accounted for 
dkk 6 million. 
working capital fell from dkk 665 million at 
31 december 2019 to dkk 621 million at 31 
december 2020. the decline was due espe-
cially to the continuous efforts to optimise 
inventories.
roic excluding goodwill fell from 13.5% at 
31 december 2019 to 12.9% at 31 december 
2020, mainly due to the slightly lower earn-
ings. 
business review 
in recent years, hydraspecma has expanded 
its product assortment and grown its expertise 
within electrified solutions that not only operate 
independently but can also be combined with 
hydraulic components for hybrid solutions. 
hydraspecma is currently building new 
logistics and production facilities covering 
11,000m2 in the gothenburg area, which will 
help the company optimise its current produc-
tion and increase capacity to meet anticipated 
future demand from customers in the vehicles 
segment. the new unit is expected to begin 
operations by the end of the second quarter of 
2021. the company has also begun to build a 
new tech centre at ishøj outside copenhagen 
which is scheduled to be operational by the 
end of the third quarter of 2021.
production efficiency has generally im-
proved thanks to investments made and the 
work to optimise production lead times. the 
geographical distribution of the business is 
expected to continue to shift towards asia, 
with business activity growing especially in the 
wind turbine segment, and to accommodate 
this situation, hydraspecma plans to begin 
expanding its production facilities in india in 
2021. 
outlook 
hydraspecma expects to grow its sales 
to major global customers in the vehicles 
segment. in combination with its growing 
market share, the company expects sales will 
return to pre-corona levels in the near future. 
hydraspecma also expects to maintain sales 
to customers in the wind turbine segment and 
for other stationary equipment at the current 
satisfactory level. other customers are also 
experiencing growing business activity, but it 
is believed that a full return to normal will take 
a good deal longer. 
the hydraulics market remains volatile, with 
prospects continually changing and at short 
notice. the growing market demand will result 
in higher prices as well as longer lead times 
from suppliers and higher transport costs. 
hydraspecma continues to help its compa-
nies align to the future market situation while 
also making the necessary investments to 
ensure that the organisation remains agile and 
retains its competitive strength and high level 
of service. earnings for the year are expected 
to be reduced by the extra costs involved 
in the relocation of activities from current 
locations to the new facilities in gothenburg, 
sweden and ishøj, denmark.

borg automotive
as europe’s largest independent remanufac-
turing company, borg automotive defines the 
concept of the circular economy, being a pro-
ducer, seller and distributor of remanufactured 
automotive parts to the european market.
borg automotive sells its products under four 
different brands: the international brand lucas 
and the company’s three proprietary brands, 
elstock, dri and tmi. the company’s main 
products are starters, alternators, brake cal-
lipers, air-condition compressors, egr valves, 
steering racks, pumps and turbochargers. the 
company’s business model is supported by 
a sales deposit system that encourages cus-
tomers to return defective spare parts as they 
are replaced, so they can be used as cores for 
remanufacturing purposes. 
headquartered in silkeborg, denmark, borg 
automotive has a sales subsidiary in belgium, 
production facilities in poland, the uk and, 
since the end of 2020, in spain. 
financial performance 
borg automotive reported increasing busi-
ness activity in several markets in the fourth 
quarter of 2020, although the coronavirus 
pandemic remains a factor. reported q4 rev-
enue was dkk 224 million, up from dkk 198 
million in q4 2019, bringing the reported full-
year revenue to dkk 871 million, a 5% decline 
from dkk 918 million in 2019. 
borg automotive launched a number of initia-
tives and cost adjustments during 2020 in-
tended to counter the effects of the pandemic, 
which combined with the improved revenue 
towards the end of the year lifted ebitda from 
dkk 24 million in q4 2019 to dkk 35 million 
in q4 2020. the company made a positive 
value adjustment of cores for the full year, 
but it was offset by a corresponding nega-
tive inventory adjustment, bringing reported 
ebitda to dkk 108 million, compared with 
dkk 110 million in 2019. 
working capital fell from dkk 156 million at  
31 december 2019 to dkk 113 million at 31 
december 2020, which is a good deal less than 
would otherwise have been expected. the re-
duced working capital was due to, among other 
things, lower trade receivables. roic excluding 
goodwill improved from 14.9% at 31 december 
2019 to 17.5% at 31 december 2020. 
business review 
borg automotive was clearly negatively af-
fected by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
in april and may, especially, a number of 
important european markets experienced 
reduced traffic intensity and lower activity, and 
production had to be reduced temporarily due 
to the much weaker demand. however, the 
company managed to retain its customer base 
and adapted to the business activity as the 
year progressed.
borg automotive has continuously worked to 
develop its product portfolio and as part of 
these efforts, the company struck a deal with 
spanish remanufacturing company turbo mo-
tor inyección (tmi) to acquire its turbocharger 
operations effective from 16 december 2020. 
with the takeover date so late in the year, the 
acquisition had a negligible effect on 2020 
revenue and ebitda. remanufactured turbo-
chargers constitute a rapidly growing product 
segment, and this addition to the product 
portfolio accommodates customer demand. 
the acquisition added about 150 employees 
to borg automotive’s staff and about dkk 100 
million to annual revenue. the acquisition was 
made with an earn-out model that over time is 
expected to lead to an enterprise value of dkk 
70-80 million.
outlook 
the considerable customer consolidation 
seen in recent years in the market borg auto-
motive serves has obviously caused changes 
to prevailing trading patterns, but it also pro-
vides added revenue opportunities for large, 
well-established players like borg automotive. 
borg automotive has a broad product port-
folio and a strong pipeline that will support 
positive sales developments to the independ-
ent aftermarket and to the oe segment.
expectations to 2021 demand remain gener-
ally positive, and the acquisition of the tur-
bocharger operations in spain is expected to 
support borg automotive’s product portfolio 
and its market position. however, growing 
competition and rising costs are also expected 
to affect the market. borg automotive gener-
ated about 20% of its total sales in the uk, 
and the country’s exit from the eu will have 
a negative impact, not only in terms of rising 
costs, but also due to a more complex trading 
environment.
borg automotive expects full-year revenue of 
around dkk 1,050 million in 2021, corre-
sponding to a 20% improvement on 2020. the 
full-year ebitda is expected to be in the dkk 
130–150 million range. 
good momentum to close out the year with growing demand in key 
markets. strengthened product offering to boost sales. expecting 
sharply improving revenue and ebitda in 2021.

consolidated statements
amounts in dkk million
the structure of the schouw & co. consolidated 
financial statements is consistent with that ap-
plied last year. in this annual report, the notes 
have been grouped into five sections. each 
section contains comments with a description 
of the group's accounting policies, estimates 
and judgments. only individually material items 
are presented in the primary statements. both 
quantitative and qualitative factors are used in 
determining whether or not an item is deemed to 
be principal. 
the names of fibertex personal care, fibertex 
nonwovens, hydraspecma and borg automotive 
may be abbreviated to fpc, fin, hs and borg, 
respectively. 
accounting policies 
the schouw & co. annual report for the year 
ended 31 december 2020 has been prepared 
in accordance with the international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu 
and other requirements pursuant to the danish 
financial statements act. the annual report also 
complies with the international financial report-
ing standards (ifrs) issued by iasb. 
recognition and measurement 
schouw & co. has implemented the standards 
and interpretations which are effective from 
2020. the consolidated accounting policies are 
consistent with those of last year. the annual 
report is presented in danish kroner. 
roundings and presentation 
in the preparation of the annual report, the 
schouw & co. group uses minimum amounts 
of dkk 1,000 in the measurement of underlying 
data. as the annual report is generally presented 
in millions of danish kroner, all amounts provided 
have been rounded, for which reason some addi-
tions may not add up. 
consolidated financial statements 
the financial statements of the group con-
solidate the financial statements of schouw & 
co. and subsidiaries controlled by schouw & 
co. control is achieved by directly or indirectly 
holding or having the disposal of more than 50% 
of the voting rights or otherwise exercising a 
controlling influence over the relevant enter-
prise. enterprises in which the group exercises 
significant influence but not control are classified 
as associates. significant influence is gener-
ally achieved by directly or indirectly holding or 
controlling 20% or more, but less than 50%, of the 
voting rights. factors used to determine whether 
or not schouw & co. has control include de facto 
control and potential voting rights exercisable at 
the balance sheet date.
 
non-controlling interests are recognised in con-
solidated enterprises that are not wholly owned 
by the group. 
joint arrangements are activities or companies 
in which the group has joint control through col-
laborative agreements with one or more parties. 
joint control implies that unanimous decisions 
on the relevant activities are required by the par-
ties sharing the controlling influence. 
joint arrangements are classified either as joint 
ventures or as joint operations. a joint opera-
tion refers to activities where the parties have 
direct rights to assets and direct obligations for 
liabilities, whereas a joint venture means activities 
for which the parties only have rights to the net 
assets. 
schouw & co. has joint operations consisting of 
fish feed activities in costa rica. this business is 
consolidated on a pro-rata basis. schouw & co. 
also has joint ventures, including biomar’s opera-
tions in turkey and china. these businesses are 
recognised in a single line at the proportionate 
share of the profit or loss after tax attributable to 
the group. 
the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared by aggregating the financial statements 
of the parent company, the individual subsidiar-
ies and joint operations prepared in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies. intra-group 
income and expenses, shareholdings, intra-
group balances and dividends and realised and 
unrealised gains on transactions between the 
consolidated companies are eliminated. unreal-
ised gains on transactions with associates and 
joint ventures are eliminated in proportion to the 
group’s share of the enterprise. unrealised losses 
are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains, to the extent that no impairment has oc-
curred. 
foreign currency translation 
a functional currency is determined for each 
of the reporting enterprises of the group. the 
functional currency is the currency used in the 
primary economic environment in which the re-
porting entity in question operates. transactions 
in currencies other than the functional currency 
are transactions in foreign currencies. 
on initial recognition, transactions denominated 
in foreign currency are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling on the transaction date. exchange 
differences arising between the exchange rate 
at the transaction date and the exchange rate 
at the date of actual payment are recognised in 
the income statement under financial income or 
financial expenses. 
receivables, payables and other monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency are translated 
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. the difference between the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date and the ex-
change rate ruling at the date when the receiva-
ble or payable arose or the exchange rate applied 
in the most recent annual report is recognised in 
the income statement under financial income or 
financial expenses. 
on consolidation of enterprises with functional 
currencies other than danish kroner, the income 
statements are translated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the transaction date and the balance 
sheets are translated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. the average 
exchange rate for each individual month is used 
as the transaction date exchange rate. exchange 
differences arising on the translation of the open-
ing equity of such enterprises at the exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date and on the 
translation of the income statements from the ex-
change rates ruling at the transaction date to the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date 
are recognised in other comprehensive income in 
the exchange adjustment reserve under equity. 
foreign exchange adjustment of balances that 
are considered as part of the overall net invest-
ment in enterprises with functional currencies 
other than danish kroner, are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income in the exchange 
adjustment reserve under equity. similarly, 
exchange gains and losses on the part of loans 
and derivative financial instruments effectively 
hedging the net investment in such enterprises 
are recognised in other comprehensive income in 
the exchange adjustment reserve under equity. 
on consolidation of associates and joint ventures 
with functional currencies other than danish kro-
ner, the pro-rata share of the results is translated 
at the exchange rates ruling at the transaction 
date, and the share of equity including goodwill is 
translated at the exchange rates ruling at the bal-
ance sheet date. exchange differences arising on 
the translation of the share of the opening equity 
of foreign associates at exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date and on the translation of 
the share of the results for the year from average 
exchange rates to the exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the exchange adjust-
ment reserve under equity.

derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are measured 
at fair value and recognised in the balance 
sheet under other receivables or other payables, 
respectively. the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments is calculated on the basis of current 
market data and recognised valuation methods. 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that effectively hedge the fair value 
of a recognised asset or a recognised liability are 
recognised in the income statement together 
with any changes in the value of the hedged asset 
or hedged liability. hedging of future cash flows 
under agreements are treated as hedging of the 
fair value of a recognised asset or a recognised 
liability. 
changes in the part of the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments effectively hedging future 
cash flows are recognised in other comprehen-
sive income in the reserve for hedging transac-
tions under equity. on realisation of the hedged 
transaction, any gains or losses relating to such 
hedge transactions are transferred from other 
comprehensive income and recognised in the 
same item as the hedged item. 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial in-
struments effectively hedging net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries or associates are recognised 
in other comprehensive income in the exchange 
adjustment reserve under equity. 
for derivative financial instruments that do 
not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in 
fair value are recognised as interest income or 
expenses and similar items in the income state-
ment as they occur. 
shareholders' equity 
the hedge transaction reserve contains the ac-
cumulated net change in the fair value of hedging 
transactions that meet the criteria for hedging 
future cash flows and for which the hedged 
transaction has yet to be realised. the exchange 
adjustment reserve in the consolidated financial 
statements comprises exchange differences 
arising on the translation of the financial state-
ments of foreign enterprises from their functional 
currencies into danish kroner including exchange 
differences on financial instruments considered 
to be a part of the net investment or as hedging 
of the net investment. 
treasury shares 
the purchase and sale sums of treasury shares 
and dividends thereon are taken directly to 
retained earnings under equity. proceeds from 
the sale of treasury shares in schouw & co. in 
connection with the exercise of share options are 
taken directly to equity. 
dividend 
dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of 
adoption by the shareholders at the annual gen-
eral meeting (the date of declaration). dividends 
expected to be declared in respect of the year are 
stated as a separate line item under equity. 
significant accounting estimates 
in preparing the financial statements, manage-
ment makes a number of assessments, estimates 
and makes assumptions necessary for calculat-
ing the carrying amount of certain assets and 
liabilities. 
the estimates and assumptions applied are 
based on factors such as historical experience 
and other factors that management considers 
reasonable under the circumstances, but which 
are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. such 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, 
and unexpected events or circumstances may 
arise. due to the risks and uncertainties the 
group is subject to, actual outcomes may deviate 
from estimates made. it may be necessary to re-
vise previous estimates as a result of changes to 
the assumptions on which such estimates were 
based or due to new information or subsequent 
events. 
management has identified two areas of particu-
lar materiality for the financial reporting: 
•  total trade receivables is one of the largest 
items in the balance sheet and have had a sig-
nificant effect on the income statement when 
viewed in terms of historical business cycles.. 
management reviews the need for bad debt 
provisions on an ongoing basis. see note 6. 
•  valued at dkk 2.451 billion, goodwill rep-
resents a significant amount in the balance 
sheet, and the value of goodwill is subject to 
the future earnings of the underlying units. 
management performs at least one impair-
ment test annually. see note 15. 
in addition, accounting estimates are also made 
in a number of other areas, including assess-
ments of depreciation periods for property, plant 
and equipment, assessments of needs for writ-
edowns on inventories, warranty provisions and 
deferred tax/deferred tax asset estimates.

comments 
the coronavirus situation
the coronavirus pandemic had both positive 
and negative effects on the group in 2020. 
the effects were mainly positive for fibertex 
personal care and fibertex nonwovens, whereas 
hydraspecma and borg automotive suffered a 
sharp decline in business activity, especially in 
the second quarter. during the second half of 
2020, the effects of the coronavirus situation di-
minished, although some of biomar’s customers 
are experiencing a lower level of activity related to 
temporary closures in the horeca segment.
fibertex personal care and fibertex nonwovens 
saw positive effects on earnings and sales, and 
a large order to the medtech segment had a 
positively impact for gpv. on the other hand, 
hydraspecma and borg automotive experienced 
a negative impact on earnings due to the reduced 
level of activity during 2020. 
however, public compensation schemes have 
offset the impact on earnings of the lower level 
of business activity, and the group’s subsidiaries 
received wage compensation in 2020 amounting 
to a total of dkk 37 million, the majority of which 
was received by hydraspecma in sweden and 
by borg automotive in poland. the total amount 
received in denmark was dkk 4 million. 
generally, the ability to pay among the group’s 
customers is not believed to have deteriorated 
during the year, and it has not been necessary 
to increase provisions for expected losses on 
bad debts. see note 6. biomar’s customers in 
ecuador and chile are the main exceptions to the 
generally unchanged or improved ability to pay, 
due to a decline in market prices of shrimp and 
salmon in 2020.
in a number of countries, the coronavirus 
situation has led to extensions of government 
deadlines for paying in vat and employee income 
taxes, and at 31 december 2020, this factor had 
increased the consolidated cash flow by dkk 62 
million. 
the group’s employees were affected by major 
production-related changes during 2020, and 
many employees working in administrative 
positions were required to work from home 
during parts of the year. as a direct effect of the 
coronavirus situation, borg automotive reduced 
its workforce in poland by up to 15% in the sec-
ond quarter, but as business activity picked up, 
the workforce was partially restored during the 
second half of the year.
revenue
consolidated revenue was up by dkk 328 mil-
lion, or 1.6%, to dkk 21,273 million in 2020.

borg automotive’s acquisition of turbo motor 
inyección was completed so late in the year that it 
contributed less than dkk 1 million to revenue.
changes in exchange rates relative to 2019 ad-
versely impacted the recognition of revenue from 
foreign entities by approximately dkk 600 million 
in 2020. adjusted for this factor, organic growth 
was about 4.5%.
ebitda
ebitda improved by dkk 258 million, from dkk 
1,951 million in 2019 to dkk 2,209 million in 
2020, for a 13.2% increase.

apart from hydraspecma and borg automotive, 
all group businesses reported improvements in 
ebitda.
gpv reported a dkk 7 million improvement in 
ebitda, for a 0.7% increase that was mostly due 
to a 7.3% increase in volume sales, whereas earn-
ings per kilo declined in part due to a change to 
the geography mix.
fibertex personal care recorded a strong 
improvement in ebitda, by dkk 53 million or 
15.1%. the improvement was based on more 
than a 10% increase in volume sales in both the 
nonwovens and the print business, which led to 
very efficient utilisation of the production appa-
ratus. in addition, currency clauses in contracts 
also contributed to the improvement.
for fibertex nonwovens, 2020 was a year in 
which the automotive segment was adversely 
affected by the coronavirus situation, but with 
strong growth in the sale of wipes and advanced 
products. fibertex nonwovens managed to adapt 
production to the various product types, thereby 
using the stronger demand to increase earnings 
by 92.1%. as a result, ebitda increased from 
dkk 141 million to dkk 270 million in 2020. 
gpv reported a dkk 74 million improvement in 
ebitda, for a 37.7% increase. the improvement 
was driven in part by a single order for the med-
tech segment that was a result of the coronavirus 
situation.
hydraspecma recorded a dkk 4 million drop in 
ebitda, equal to 2.1%, primarily due to the drop 
in business activity resulting from coronavirus 
lockdowns in march/april 2020. the decline in 
business activity in the second quarter was the 
main reason for the overall drop in revenue of 
6.9% that hydraspecma incurred in 2020.
borg automotive reported a dkk 2 million de-
cline in ebitda, equal to 1.6%. like hydraspec-
ma, borg automotive experienced a severe 
slowdown in the second quarter of 2020, and the 
company incurred a 3% drop in the number of 
cores sold.
working capital
the consolidated working capital fell from dkk 
3,738 million at 31 december 2019 to dkk 3,107 
million at 31 december 2020, driven in part by 
all portfolio companies’ efforts to optimise their 
working capital. another part of the explanation 
is that biomar has moved from markets with a 
tradition for long terms of payment to markets 
with shorter terms of payment. due to the appre-
ciation of danish kroner versus a large number of 
currencies, foreign subsidiaries’ working capital 
were translated at lower exchange rates resulting 
in lower amounts when expressed in danish kro-
ner. the effects are estimated at approximately 
dkk 100 million.

the extension of government deadlines for 
paying vat and taxes had the effect of reducing 
working capital by dkk 62 million.  
as can be seen from the chart above, all six 
portfolio businesses successfully reduced their 
working capital. 
cash flow statement
cash flows from operations for the year before 
changes in working capital improved by dkk 
216 million to dkk 2,228 million from dkk 2,012 
million in 2019. a positive dkk 471 million shift 
in the 2020 working capital brought the cash flow 
from operations to dkk 2,699 million, against 
dkk 1,784 million in 2019. net of interest and 
taxes paid, cash flows from operating activi-
ties for the year amounted to dkk 2,296 million 
compared with dkk 1,410 million in 2019. the 
dkk 886 million improvement in cash flows from 
operating activities for the year corresponds to an 
increase of 62.8%. as shown in the chart below, 
almost all portfolio companies improved their 
cash flows from operating activities. fibertex 
personal care was the only exception, recording 
a slight drop.

cash flows from investing activities amounted 
to an outflow of dkk 533 million, a reduction of 
dkk 511 million, or 49%, from an outflow of dkk 
1,043 million in 2019. investment in property, 
plant and equipment reflects the fact that, at the 
beginning of 2020, the group had completed a 
number of major investments in output capacity 
and did not start up any new capacity-expanding 
investments until towards the end of 2020.
a total of dkk 60 million was used for company 
acquisitions in 2020, which consisted of borg au-
tomotive’s acquisition of spanish company turbo 
motor inyección. company acquisitions made in 
2019 amounted to dkk 259 million.
cash flows from operating activities for the year 
amounted to dkk 2,296 million, of which dkk 
533 million was used for investing purposes. 
debt financing was reduced by a net amount of 
dkk 1,305 million. 
a total of dkk 336 million of the cash flows for 
the year was used to pay dividends to the compa-
ny’s shareholders. in addition, the company sold 
treasury shares for option settlement purposes 
for dkk 11 million. 
net of amounts used for investing and financing 
purposes, the group had a total cash inflow for 
2020 of dkk 133 million, compared to a cash 
outflow in 2019 of dkk 54 million.
accounting policies
segment reporting
segment reporting is consistent with the internal 
management reporting. schouw & co. is an 
industrial conglomerate consisting of a number 
of sub-groups operating in various industries and 
independently of the other sub-groups. currently, 
six sub-groups are classified as independent 
reporting segments. the reporting segments are 
presented separately and without aggregation of 
operating segments.
included in the reporting segments are revalua-
tions of assets and liabilities made in connection 
with schouw & co.’s acquisition of the segment 
in question and consolidated goodwill arising as 
a result of the acquisition. the operational impact 
of depreciation/amortisation and write-downs 
on the above revaluations or goodwill is also 
included in the profit or loss presented for each 
reporting segment.
geographical segment information indicates the 
group’s revenue and assets by national market. 
revenue
revenue from the sale of goods for resale and 
finished goods is recognised in the income 
statement if transfer of risk to the buyer has taken 
place before year-end and if the income can be 
reliably measured.
although a sales agreement for the sale of fin-
ished goods and goods for resale often contains 
more than one performance obligation, such 
obligations are treated as one combined perfor-
mance obligation because delivery typically takes 
place at one point in time.
the sale of services mainly consists of fibertex 
personal care’s print business. print services 
typically involve a delivery obligation recognised 
in revenue on a straight-line basis during the 
period the service is provided.
the terms of payment set out in the group’s 
sales agreements with customers depend on the 
underlying performance obligation and on the 
underlying customer relationship. for the sale of 
goods for which control passes at a specific point 
in time, the terms of payment will typically be 
from one to three months.
revenue is measured excluding vat and other 
taxes and duties charged on behalf of third par-
ties. all discounts granted are deducted from 
revenue.
cost of sales
cost of sales comprises costs defrayed to 
achieve the year’s revenue. enterprises engaged 
in trading recognise cost of sales and enterprises 
engaged in manufacturing recognise production 
costs corresponding to revenue for the year. this 
includes direct and indirect costs of raw materials 
and consumables, wages and salaries, deprecia-
tion and amortisation of intangible assets and 
production facilities, depreciation and amortisa-
tion of lease assets as well as depreciation of 
inventories. cost of sales also includes research 
costs and product development costs that do not 
meet the criteria for capitalisation, as well as am-
ortisation and impairment of capitalised product 
development costs.
distribution costs
distribution costs comprise expenses incurred 
in connection with the distribution of goods sold 
during the year and in connection with sales 
campaigns, etc. launched during the year under 
review, including cost of sales and logistics staff, 
advertising and exhibition costs, as well as depre-
ciation/amortisation and impairment.
administrative expenses
administrative expenses comprise expenses 
incurred during the year for management and 
administration, including expenses for adminis-
trative staff, office premises and office expenses,

and depreciation and impairment. administra-
tive expenses also comprise write-downs on 
receivables.
employee benefits
wage compensation received in connection 
with the coronavirus situation has been offset 
in wages and salaries under production costs, 
distribution costs or administrative costs.
equity-settled share options are measured at 
fair value at the grant date and their value is 
recognised in the income statement under staff 
costs over the vesting period. the balancing item 
is recognised directly in equity as a shareholder 
transaction.
on initial recognition of the share options, the 
number of options expected to vest is estimated. 
subsequently, changes in the estimated number 
of vested options are adjusted to the effect that 
the total amount recognised is based on the 
actual number of vested options.
the fair value of options granted is estimated us-
ing a valuation model that takes into account the 
terms and conditions of the options granted.
other operating income and expenses
other operating income and costs comprise 
items secondary to the primary activities of the 
enterprises and consists of the following:
•  gains or losses on the disposal of intangible 
assets and property plant and equipment. 
•  government grants include grants and funding 
of development work and grants for invest-
ments, etc. grants for research and develop-
ment costs recognised directly in the income 
statement are included in other operating 
income.
investment grants in the form of certain tax-privi-
leged schemes in individual countries are recog-
nised in the balance sheet under receivables and 
as deferred income under liabilities. grants are 
recognised in the income statement under other 
operating income as the underlying investments 
are depreciated. the receivable is reduced as the 
grant is received and the deferred income item is 
reduced as the grant is recognised in the income 
statement.
inventories
inventories are measured at cost in accordance 
with the fifo method. where the net realisable 
value is lower than cost, inventories are written 
down to this lower value. the cost of goods for re-
sale, raw materials and consumables comprises 
the purchase price plus delivery costs. the cost 
of finished goods and work in progress compris-
es the cost of raw materials, consumables, direct 
labour and indirect production costs. indirect 
costs of production include indirect materials and 
labour as well as maintenance of and deprecia-
tion and impairment of the machines, factory 
buildings and equipment used in the manufactur-
ing process as well as factory management and 
administrative expenses. the net realisable value 
of inventories is calculated as the selling price 
less costs of conversion and costs incurred to 
execute the sale and is determined having regard 
to marketability, obsolescence and expected sell-
ing price movements.
biological inventories are recognised at fair value 
less estimated selling costs. 
receivables
receivables are measured at amortised cost. 
provisions for bad debts are made in accordance 
with the simplified expected credit loss-model, 
under which total losses are recognised immedi-
ately in the income statement at the same time as 
the receivable is recognised in the balance sheet 
in the amount of the lifetime expected credit loss 
on the receivable. impairment write-downs on 
receivables are recognised in the income state-
ment under administrative expenses.
prepayments
prepayments include expenses paid in respect 
of subsequent financial years. deferred income 
comprises payments received relating to income 
in subsequent financial years, including invest-
ment grants.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement shows the cash flows 
for the year distributed on operating, investing, fi-
nancing and discontinued activities, net changes 
for the year in cash as well as cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. 
the cash effect of acquisitions and divestments 
is shown separately under cash flows from 
investing activities. in the cash flow statement, 
cash flows concerning acquired companies are 
recognised from the date of acquisition, while 
cash flows concerning divested companies are 
recognised until the date of divestment. 
cash flows in currencies other than the functional 
currency are translated at average exchange 
rates unless these differ materially from the ex-
change rate ruling at the transaction day. 
cash flows from operating activities are calcu-
lated according to the indirect method as the 
profit for the year before tax adjusted for non-
cash operating items, changes in working capital, 
interest paid and income taxes paid. 
cash flows from investing activities comprise 
payments made in connection with the acquisi-
tion and divestment of companies and operations 
and the acquisition and disposal of intangible as-
sets, property, plant and equipment as well as the 
purchase and sale of securities not recognised 
under cash and cash equivalents. dividends from 
associates are included in cash flows from invest-
ing activities.
cash flows from financing activities include pay-
ments to and from shareholders and related ex-
penses as well as the raising of loans, repayments 
on interest-bearing debt, including lease debt, 
and the purchase and sale of treasury shares. 
cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank 
and in hand as well as securities with a maturity 
of less than three months at the time of acquisi-
tion that can immediately be converted into 
cash and that involve insignificant risk of value 
fluctuations.
significant accounting estimates
trade receivables
management applies estimates in the assess-
ment of the likelihood that receivables at the bal-
ance sheet date will be received. for the schouw 
& co. group, the largest risks of losses on trade 
receivables have historically related to customers 
of biomar. biomar sells a significant part of its 
products in markets in south america (chile), and 
in southern and central europe. historically, the 
largest debtor risks have been for customers in 
chile and in southern europe, especially greece. 
the group has substantial receivables with 
certain customers in these geographical areas. 
thorough analyses have been made of the credit 
quality of these debtors, and management be-
lieves that adequate provisions for losses on these 
debtors had been made at 31 december 2020. 
the other companies are not believed to involve 
material credit risks. see note 6.
inventories
the uncertainty involved in estimating invento-
ries is related to the assessment of obsolescence 
and lack of marketability. goods considered to 
be obsolete or to have impaired marketability 
are written down to net realisable value. as the 
schouw & co. group consists of companies of a 
diverse nature, the process of estimating net re-
alisable value of inventories varies from company 
to company.

notes · ebit, working capital and cash flows
the uncertainty involved in estimating inventories 
for the schouw & co. group is predominantly 
related to the group’s companies gpv, hy-
draspecma and borg automotive. 
gpv generally produces to order and its in-
ventories predominantly consist of electronics 
components and metal sourced and/or manufac-
tured to meet customer needs. for its compo-
nent inventory, gpv applies a general model of 
writing down goods after they have been in stock 
for a certain period of time. the company reviews 
its impairment model on a regular basis, and in 
the group's best estimate, the model provides an 
appropriate and fair presentation of the net realis-
able value of inventories.
hydraspecma applies a general impairment 
model of automatically writing down goods 
after they have been in stock for a certain period 
of time. the company reviews its impairment 
model on a regular basis, and in the group's best 
estimate, the model provides an appropriate and 
fair presentation of the net realisable value of 
inventories. 
borg automotive remanufactures used compo-
nents – called cores - such as alternators, start-
ers, brake callipers, etc. when a remanufactured 
component is sold, borg also takes a deposit 
which gives the customer the right to return a 
similar core. 
borg automotive has an obligation to accept the 
returned core, and eventually the market for the 
type of cores in question will shrink, and borg 
automotive will be left with unusable cores. as 
a result, borg automotive has relatively large 
impairment losses on the part of its inventory 
relating to cores.
the company applies an impairment model 
which is based on expected future sales. in the 
group's best estimate, the model provides an 
appropriate and fair presentation of the net realis-
able value of inventories.

based on management control and financial management, schouw & co. has identified six reporting segments, which are biomar, fibertex personal care, fibertex nonwovens, gpv, hydraspecma and borg 
automotive.
all inter-segment transactions were made on an arm’s length basis.
capital expenditure is defined as the net cash flows from investment activities in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
acquisitions is defined as cash flows from investment activiteis in acquisitions and divestments of businesses, including associates, joint ventures and capital injections.

the expected volatility is calculated as 12 months' historical volatility based on average prices. if the 
option holders have not exercised their share options within the period specified, the share options will 
lapse without any compensation to the holders. exercise of the share options is subject to the holders 
being in continuing employment during the above-mentioned periods. if the share option holder leaves 
the company’s employ before a share option vests, the holder may in some cases have a right to exercise 
the share options early during a four-week period following schouw & co.’s next following profit an-
nouncement. in the event of early exercise, the number of share options will be reduced proportionately.
the following assumptions were applied in calculating the fair value of outstanding share options at 
the date of grant:

trade payables and other payables all fall due in all material respects within one year. extended govern-
ment deadlines for paying vat and personal income taxes intended to support company liquidity has 
an overall effect of dkk 62 million at 31 december 2020. the amount is recognised under other debt.
for a number of years, biomar has facilitated a supply chain financing programme (reverse factor-
ing) through banks. the purpose of the programme is to develop and ensure long-term relations with 
strategically important suppliers of raw materials. the supply chain finance programme contributes 
to ensuring low raw materials prices and financing costs in the value chain. suppliers participating 
in the programme have the option of receiving early payment once biomar has approved a delivery. 
under the system, biomar assigns approved invoices to the bank in a factoring arrangement without 
recourse. the bank then pays the supplier early while ensuring the best possible credit period for 
biomar. supply chain finance debt of dkk 829 million is recognised in the balance sheet under trade 
payables (2019: dkk 818 million). 
borg automotive sells remanufactured automotive spare parts charging a deposit for a product's 
core component. the system of deposits give the customers an incentive to return the cores, ensur-
ing a flow of raw materials to the company. this produces a core liability that applies for two years. 
the liability amounted to dkk 237 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 250 million). of this 
amount, dkk 178 million (2019: dkk 188 million) is recognised as current liabilities, while the rest is 
recognised as other non-current liabilities.

the risk assessment is based on a combination of country risk and market risk as well as a company-
specific risk assessment. low-risk markets are mainly norway and scotland, while high-risk market 
are mainly greece, russia, ecuador and costa rica. medium-risk markets consist of chile, denmark, 
france, spain and australia.
biomar has taken out credit insurance for dkk 1,133 million for its trade receivables (2019: dkk 
1,101 million). in addition, customers have provided collateral to biomar in the amount of dkk 203 
million (2019: dkk 254 million). the collateral provided consists mainly of assets such as fish stocks 
and fish farming equipment. 
the group’s portfolio companies closely monitor trade receivables in order to estimate the need to 
make provisions for bad debts. provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of a general 
impairment model and an individual assessment of the debtor’s expected ability to pay with due 
consideration for any collateral provided by the customer plus any debtor insurance. at group level,  
a debtor report is prepared quarterly and submitted to schouw & co.’s board of directors.

invested capital
invested capital exclusive of goodwill declined 
by dkk 1,089 million from dkk 10,510 million 
to dkk 9,421 million at 31 december 2020. 
changes in invested capital by portfolio company 
appear from the chart below.

as can be seen from the chart, invested capital 
declined in all businesses with the exception of 
hydraspecma, whose invested capital increased 
by 1%. 
biomar accounted for the largest drop, amount-
ing to dkk 611 million, equal to 56% of the total 
decline.  
the drop reflects the reduced investment activity 
in 2020 as well as the reduced working capital. 
similar to the working capital, the reduction of 
invested capital was also affected by foreign 
exchange developments.
roic
return on invested capital (roic) is measured 
as operating profit/loss before amortisation of 
intangible assets (ebita) as a percentage of aver-
age invested capital. roic exclusive of goodwill 
improved from 12.3% in 2019 to 15.3% in 2020. 
the reason for the higher roic was, in part, a 
6% decline in average invested capital exclusive 
of goodwill in 2020, whereas ebita increased by 
only 17%.

accounting policies
intangible assets
goodwill is initially measured in the balance 
sheet at cost. subsequently, goodwill is mea-
sured at cost less accumulated impairment. 
goodwill is not amortised. the carrying amount 
of goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-
generating units at the date of acquisition. the 
determination of cash-generating units is based 
on the management structure and the in-house 
financial management. 
intangible assets such as customer relations, 
brands and know-how, acquired in connection 
with business combinations are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment. 
other intangible assets comprise it solutions 
and development projects. intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful lives of the assets, which are as 
follows:
customer relations
7-20 years
brands
10-20 years
know-how
5-15 years
other intangible assets
3-10 years
goodwill is not amortised, but is tested 
for impairment once a year.
property, plant and equipment
land and buildings, plant and machinery, fixtures 
and fittings, tools and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment.
 
cost comprises the purchase price and any costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition until the 
date when the asset is ready for use. for assets 
produced in-house, cost comprises direct and 
indirect costs of materials, components, third-
party suppliers and labour. cost is increased by 
the present value of estimated liabilities for the 
removal and disposal of the asset and restoration 
of the site on which the asset was used. the cost 
of a total asset is divided into separate compo-
nents that are depreciated separately if such 
components have different useful lives.
interest expense of constructing a new asset 
and incurred during the construction period is 
recognised in the cost of the asset.
subsequent costs, such as the cost of replacing 
components of property, plant and equipment, 
are included in the asset’s carrying amount. the 
replaced components are no longer recognised 
in the balance sheet, and the carrying amount is 
transferred to the income statement. all other or-
dinary repair and maintenance costs are recog-
nised in the income statement when incurred.
property, plant and equipment are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the expected use-
ful lives of the assets/components, which are 
expected to be as follows:
buildings
10-50 years
plant and machinery
4-15 years
other fixtures and fittings, tools and 
equipment
3-10 years
land
not depreciated

notes · invested capital
the basis of depreciation is calculated with 
due consideration to the asset’s scrap value, 
reduced by any impairment losses. the residual 
value is determined at the acquisition date and 
reassessed annually. where the residual value ex-
ceeds the carrying amount, the property ceases 
to be depreciated.
if the depreciation period or the scrap value 
is changed, the effect on depreciation going 
forward is recognised as a change in accounting 
estimates.
depreciation is recognised in the income state-
ment as production costs, distribution costs or 
administrative expenses.
leases
leases are recognised in the balance sheet as a 
lease asset (right of use of the lease) and a lease 
liability. however, leases and lease agreements 
for minor assets and short-term agreements (of 
less than one year) are exempt from the recogni-
tion requirement. lease assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over their expected useful 
lives, and rent and lease payments are broken 
down into principal component reducing the 
lease and an interest component recognised in 
financial expenses.
the underlying asset is depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the expected term, which is as 
follows:
ships
up to 15 years
property
3-10 years
other assets
up to 5 years
many of the property leases have extension op-
tions, which are recognised in the lease asset if 
the group reasonably expects to exercise the op-
tion. other assets mainly consist of cars, trucks 
and other production equipment.
the lease liability is calculated as the present 
value of future lease payments and discounted 
using the internal rate of return of the lease or an 
alternative borrowing rate. 
service elements included in the lease are not 
included in the lease liability, but are disclosed 
separately.
for purposes of assessing expected lease terms, 
the group identifies the non-cancellable lease 
term of the agreement plus periods comprised by 
an extension option which management reason-
ably expects to exercise.
investments in joint ventures and associates 
joint ventures and associates are recognised in 
consolidated income statement at the propor-
tionate share of the profit or loss after elimination 
of the proportionate share of intra-group gains or 
losses after impairment of goodwill.
investments in joint ventures and associates are 
measured in the balance sheet at the proportion-
ate share of the companies’ net asset value cal-
culated in accordance with the group’s account-
ing policies with the deduction or addition of the 
proportionate share of unrealised intra-group 
gains and losses and with the addition of the car-
rying amount of goodwill.
associates with a negative equity value are 
recog nised at zero.
receivables from associates are written down to 
the extent they are deemed to be irrecoverable.
business combinations.
newly acquired or newly established companies 
are recognised in the consolidated finan-
cial statements from the date of acquisition. 
comparative figures are not adjusted to reflect 
acquisitions. 
the purchase method is applied on acquisitions 
if the parent company gains control of the com-
pany acquired. assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities in companies acquired are measured 
at their fair value at the date of acquisition. intan-
gible assets are recognised if they can be sepa-
rated or if they arise from a contractual right and 
the fair value can be reliably measured. deferred 
tax on revaluations made is recognised.
any excess of the consideration paid for the busi-
ness over the fair value of the acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised 
as goodwill under intangible assets. in the event 
of uncertainty regarding measurement, goodwill 
may be adjusted until 12 months after the acqui-
sition. goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for 
impairment annually. the first impairment test is 
performed before the end of the year of acquisi-
tion. on acquisition, goodwill is transferred to the 
cash-generating units that will subsequently form 
the basis for future impairment tests.
on initial recognition, minority interests are either 
recognised at their fair value or at their pro-rate 
share of the fair value of the acquired company's 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabili-
ties. accordingly, for the former option, goodwill 
is recognised relating to minority interests of the 
acquired business, while for the latter option, 
goodwill relating to minority interests is not recog-
nised. the measurement of minority interests 
is determined on a case-by-case basis and dis-
closed in the presentation of acquired businesses 
in the notes to the financial statements.
when put options are issued as part of the 
consideration for business combinations, the 
put options received by non-controlling interests 
are considered to have been redeemed on the 
acquisition date.
the non-controlling interest is reversed and 
a liability is recognised at fair value on initial 
recognition, and the difference is adjusted under 
equity. fair value is determined as the present 
value of the exercise price of the option. the 
option is subsequently measured at amortised 
cost corresponding to the discounted value of 
the expected future cash flows. value adjust-
ments are recognised directly in equity. dividend 
payments agreed in relation to the put option are 
considered a financial expense and recognised in 
the income statement.
contingent consideration agreed in connection 
with company acquisitions and paid to the seller 
if certain conditions are met, are recognised at 
fair value and considered part of the total con-
sideration for acquiring the company. changes 
in fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in the income statement.
company divestments
companies divested or wound up are consoli-
dated in the income statement until the date they 
are divested or wound up. comparative figures 
are not adjusted to reflect divestments. 
any gains or losses on the disposal of sub-
sidiaries, associates or joint ventures are stated 
as the difference between the sales sum or the 
proceeds from the winding-up and the carry-
ing amount of net assets, including goodwill, 
at the date of disposal and expenses for selling 
or winding-up. on the disposal of subsidiaries, 
adjustments accumulated in equity through other 
comprehensive income and which are attribut-
able to the unit are reclassified to the income 
statement and recognised together with any 
gains or losses from the disposal.
on the divestment of a subsidiary, the profit/loss 
is recognised under profit/loss from the divest-
ment of equity investments if the company sold 
does not represent an independent reporting 
segment or if its revenue, profit/loss or assets 
represent less than 10% of consolidated rev-

enue, consolidated profit/loss or consolidated 
assets.
profit from the sale of other subsidiaries is recog-
nised in profit from discontinued operations.
gains on the sale of associates and joint ventures 
are recognised in gains on equity divestments.
non-current asset impairment test
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives are tested annually for impairment, 
initially before the end of the year of acquisition. 
development projects in progress are also tested 
for impairment annually. 
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for 
impairment together with the other non-current 
assets of the cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill has been allocated and is written down 
over the income statement to the lower of the 
recoverable amount and the carrying amount. 
the recoverable amount is generally calculated 
as the present value of the future net cash flows 
expected to be derived from the business or ac-
tivity (cash-generating unit) to which the goodwill 
relates. 
a write-down is recognised when the carrying 
amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit 
exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset 
or the cash-generating unit. write-downs are 
recognised in the income statement as produc-
tion costs, distribution costs or administrative 
expenses. however, goodwill write-downs are 
recognised as a separate item in the income 
statement. impairment write-downs of goodwill 
are not reversed. impairment of other assets is 
reversed to the extent changes have occurred 
to the assumptions and estimates leading to the 
impairment. impairment is only reversed to the 
extent the new carrying amount of an asset does 
not exceed the carrying amount the asset would 
have had net of depreciation, had the asset not 
been impaired.
the carrying amounts of other non-current as-
sets are tested annually to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. if such an 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is calculated.  the recoverable amount 
is the higher of the fair value of the asset less 
expected costs to sell and the value in use.
significant accounting estimates
acquisitions
in connection with the acquisition of turbo motor 
inyección, a number of estimates were made 
of the acquired assets and liabilities, including 
primarily the value of customers and the value 
of know-how. the valuation of these intangible 
assets are subject to a number of assumptions 
based on estimates. due to the amount of the 
transaction, however, these estimates are of mi-
nor importance to the group than has been the 
case with previous acquisitions.
impairment test
goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and 
other intangible assets are tested if there is evi-
dence of impairment.
an assessment is made as to whether the cash-
generating unit to which the asset relates will be 
able to generate sufficient cash flows in future to 
support the carrying amount of the asset. 
assessments are made of the estimated cash 
flows for the next many years and of the long-
term growth rate and a reasonable discount rate 
reflecting the risk inherent to the asset or cash-
generating unit, all of which is inherently subject 
to uncertainty. see note 15.
useful lives
estimated useful lives of intangible assets, prop-
erty, plant and equipment and lease assets which 
are depreciated are reviewed regularly.

dkk 15 million (2019: dkk 16 million) was recognised in the income statement for 2020 regarding 
leases not recognised in the balance sheet, the amount consisting of dkk 6 million in services, dkk 
2 million in small assets and dkk 7 million in short-term leases. 
at the balance sheet date, liabilities concerning leases of small assets and services amounted to 
dkk 9 million (2019: dkk 12 million), of which dkk 5 million falls due within 12 months and dkk 4 
million falls due in between one and five years.

through borg automotive, the group has acquired the turbocharger operations of the spanish 
company turbo motor inyección (tmi), giving it a new product segment within the remanufacturing of 
turbochargers. the transaction has also given borg automotive a stronger presence in the important 
southern european markets, consolidating the company’s position as europe’s largest independent 
automotive remanufacturing company. headquartered in pamplona, spain, tmi generated revenue 
of dkk 105 million in 2019 and employs 150 people. tmi remanufactures 65,000 turbochargers per 
year and currently has a capacity for up to 140,000 cores per year. the group paid dkk 60 million to 
acquire the company and expects to pay an additional dkk 16 million under an earn-out agreement. 
half of the dkk 16 million is expected to be paid in 2021 and the rest in 2022, assuming the criteria for 
the agreement are met. the acquisition involved costs of dkk 2.7 million, of which dkk 1.6 million was 
recognised in 2020 under administrative expenses. had the company been acquired effective from 1 
january 2020, revenue would have been dkk 84 million higher, while profit would have been the same.
in 2019, the group acquired a newly-established spunlace production business in south carolina, 
usa through fibertex nonwovens. also 2019, the group acquired the outstanding 50% of the shares 
in the fish feed factory alitec pargua s.a. lastly, in december 2019, the group acquired the opera-
tions of htr-hydraulics oy, finland.

impairment test
goodwill
the management of schouw & co. has tested the carrying amounts of all goodwill in the group. in 
the tests performed, the senior management of each company estimated the expected free cash 
flows in a five-year budget and forecast period (2021-2025). the realised values for 2020 in the 
model were based on eleven months of actual figures plus budget figures for december 2020.
the impairment test estimates the present value of goodwill (value-in-use principle) by discount-
ing expected free cash flows using an estimated discount rate to assess the company’s total value 
and related goodwill, which is subsequently compared with the carrying amount recognised in the 
schouw & co. consolidated financial statements. the rate of growth post the forecast period, the 
so-called terminal growth, is based on general long-term growth forecasts for the individual markets. 
the estimates for the schouw & co. entities vary from 1% to 3% growth.
at 31 december 2020, capitalised goodwill in the schouw & co. group amounted to dkk 2,366 
million, compared with dkk 2,451 million at 31 december 2019. there was no addition of goodwill in 
2020, and the change consisted entirely of a foreign exchange adjustment pf dkk 85 million, a large 
part of which was related to biomar ecuador.
the discount rate (wacc) was estimated on the basis of available market data and an assessment of 
the risk profile of the individual entities. specifically, a risk-free interest rate based on the current yield 
of a 10-year government bond in the relevant geography plus an estimated market-risk premium are 
used to estimate the required rate of return on equity. estimated risk premiums are then added, de-
pending on industry, business model and geography. the required rate of return on debt is based on 
an estimated credit assessment of the entities and current interest rate levels. the required rates of 
return on debt and equity are weighted using a capital structure based on a group of company peers.

impairment test (continued)
goodwill relating to biomar amounted to dkk 1,317 million, which was equal to about 56% of 
schouw & co.’s consolidated goodwill of dkk 2,366 million. of the goodwill amount recognised in 
biomar, dkk 545 million relates to biomar ecuador, which is considered an independent cash-
generating unit because the products and market conditions applying to shrimp feed are materially 
different from the feed for the other fish species biomar is involved in. as a result, biomar ecuador is 
tested separately.
biomar continues to operate in a growth industry driven by rising population growth and rising 
standards of living. volume sales are generally expected to increase slightly in chile and ecuador, 
while weaker growth is expected in other fish farming markets. against that background, biomar 
assumes 3.8% revenue growth during the forecast period and 9.5% revenue growth for biomar 
ecuador. the assumed production capacity for the budget period will cover the expected increase 
in business activity, and no productivity enhancements or cost savings have been assumed for the 
period. biomar's feed products are mainly based on marine and vegetable raw materials, for which 
price fluctuations can in all material respects be passed on to selling prices.
the impairment tests made at 31 december 2020 did not result in a write-down of carrying 
amounts.
sensitivity analyses were performed as part of the tests to determine if reduced cash flows or a 
higher wacc would produce evidence of impairment. the sensitivity analyses showed that likely 
changes in basic assumptions would not produce evidence of impairment.
other intangible assets 
at 31 december 2020, schouw & co. recognised other intangible assets of dkk 1,057 million, dkk 
60 million less than at 31 december 2019. the amount consisted of an addition of dkk 97 million, in 
part due to borg automotive’s acquisition of operations in spain, while the item was reduced by dkk 
129 million due to amortisation. the remaining changes under other intangible assets were due to 
foreign exchange adjustments.
property, plant and equipment 
in 2020, the group identified assets with an indication of impairment. total impairment was dkk 8 
million consisting of minor write-downs in biomar, fibertex nonwovens, gpv and borg automotive. 
investments in joint ventures and associates 
the equity investment in salmones austral was tested for impairment in 2020. the test did not show 
any indication of impairment.
other non-current assets 
there were no indications of impairment in other non-current assets, except an impairment of leas-
ing assets of dkk 2 million.

dkk 5 million. adjusted for this amount, financial 
income amounted to dkk 72 million in 2020, 
compared with dkk 80 million in 2019. foreign 
exchange gains fell by dkk 10 million and inter-
est income increased by dkk 2 million. 
financial expenses

in 2020 compared with dkk 164 million in 2020. 
interest expenses dropped from dkk 99 million 
in 2019 to dkk 93 million in 2020. financial ex-
penses also included foreign exchange losses of 
dkk 105 million compared with dkk 45 million in 
2019. dividends paid to the minority shareholder 
in biomar ecuador amounted to dkk 12 million 
compared with dkk 20 million in 2019. 
liabilities 
interest-bearing debt was dkk 2,599 million at 
31 december 2020, representing a year-on-year 
decrease of dkk 1,287 million that was driven by 
the group’s positive cash flows and its reduced 
investment activity. a large part of the group’s 
debt is in dkk or in eur, these currencies rep-
resenting 56% of total debt in 2020 (2019: 51%). 
nok, aud and usd account for 14%, 14% and 
7% of the debt, respectively, while a number of 
currencies combine to make up the remaining 8%.

accounting policies
financial income and expenses 
financial income and expenses include interest 
and capital gains and losses on transactions 
in foreign currency and impairment losses on 
securities. also included are amortisation of 
financial assets and liabilities, lease liabilities, 
surcharges and refunds under the on-account tax 
scheme. and changes in fair values of derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify as hedge 
accounting. financial expenses relating to the 
construction of non-current assets are recog-
nised as part of the cost of the asset.
financial liabilities
debt to credit institutions is recognised at the 
raising of a loan at fair value less transaction 
costs. in subsequent periods, financial liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost, applying the 
“effective interest rate method”, to the effect that 
the difference between the proceeds and the 
nominal value is recognised in the income state-
ment under financial expenses over the term of 
the loan. in addition, the capitalised residual lease 
liability under finance leases is recognised under 
financial liabilities.
significant accounting estimates
no significant accounting estimates were made 
in the calculation of financial liabilities.

the fair value of liabilities relating to lease assets corresponds in all material respects to the carrying 
amount. the lease liability was calculated using mainly an alternative discount rate based on the lease 
term, the base rate of the country in question and a risk premium, among other factors. the average 
discount rate applied was 2.9% per annum (2019: 2.9%). 
total lease payments made in 2020 amounted to dkk 220 million (2019: dkk 208 million), consisting of  
a repayment of dkk 196 million (2019: 182 million) and interest of dkk 24 million (2019: dkk 26 million).
the weighted average effective rate of interest for the year was 2.8% (2019: 2.5%).
the weighted average effective rate of interest at the balance sheet date was 2.1% (2019: 2.2%).

capital resources
it is group policy when raising loans to maximise flexibility by diversifying borrowing in respect of  
maturity/renegotiation dates and counterparties, with due consideration to costs. the group’s capi-
tal resources consist of cash and undrawn credit facilities. the group's objective is to have sufficient 
capital resources to make company acquisitions and to allow it to continue in an adequate manner to 
operate the business and to react to unforeseen fluctuations in its cash holdings.

the group’s companies get a significant proportion of their financing from resources and credit 
facilities of the parent company schouw & co. the parent company schouw & co.’s financing con-
sists mainly of a syndicated bank facility, which in december 2020 was refinanced with a total facility 
line of dkk 3,275 million (of which dkk 500 million as an accordion) compared with dkk 2,100 
million previously. the new facility has a three-year term with an option for a one-year extension 
after the first and second year. in connection with refinancing the bank facility, the international bank 
hongkong & shanghai banking corporation (hsbc) joined the existing bank consortium consist-
ing of danske bank, dnb and nordea. in addition, in april 2019, the parent company schouw & co. 
issued schuldscheins for a total of eur 136 million (dkk 1,012 million) maturing in 2024 (80%) and 
2026 (20%), and in april 2020 two committed bilateral facilities for a total of dkk 1,000 million were 
established to ensure maximum economic versatility for the group during the coronavirus pandemic. 
the bilateral facilities expire in april 2021, but have a one-year extension option. 
capital management 
schouw & co. gives priority to having a high equity ratio in order to ensure financial versatility as 
well as to having adequate capital resources. the group believes that its capital resources of dkk 
5,030 million represent appropriate cash resources. the group aims to have a financial gearing of 
from 1.0x to 2.5x. during periods immediately following a (major) acquisition, however, gearing may 
exceed 2.5x. at 31 december 2020, the financial gearing was 0.9x.

notes · tax
this section of the annual report contains notes 
relating to the group's taxation. 
the following notes are presented in this section:
21. tax on profit/loss for the year
22. deferred tax
23. corporate income tax
comments
corporate income tax
schouw & co. recorded a profit for the year 
before tax of dkk 1,209 million (2019: dkk 1,149 
million), resulting in total tax for the year of dkk 
300 million (2019: dkk 243 million) for an effec-
tive tax rate of 24.8% (2019: 21.2%). 
profit before tax includes the share of profit or 
loss after tax in associates and joint ventures. 
however, the tax on the share of profit or loss 
is not included in the tax for the year. accord-
ingly, an adjustment for the share of profit or loss 
increases the effective tax rate.
the effective tax rate was also driven higher by a 
dkk 5 million drop in non-taxable income and an 
dkk 18 million increase in non-deductible costs. 
non-deductible costs included among others the 
costs of the group’s stock option awards for the 
year (black & scholes). 
also a part of the increase was withholding tax 
of dkk 5 million that could not be offset against 
other tax, and uncertain tax positions for an 
amount corresponding to dkk 13 million relating 
to tax disputes, mainly in france. 
accounting policies
taxation
schouw & co. is taxed jointly with all its danish 
subsidiaries. the current danish income tax 
liability is allocated among the companies of the 
tax pool in proportion to their taxable income. 
companies that use tax losses in other com-
panies pay a joint tax contribution to the parent 
company at an amount corresponding to the tax 
value of the tax losses used. companies whose 
tax losses are used by other companies receive 
joint tax contributions from the parent company 
corresponding to the tax value of the losses used 
(full absorption). the jointly taxed companies pay 
tax under the danish on-account tax scheme.
tax for the year comprises current tax and 
changes in deferred tax for the year. in addi-
tion, the tax for the year comprises changes to 
prior-year tax and changes in assessed provi-
sions for uncertain tax positions. tax for the year 
is recognised in the income statement as regards 
the amount attributable to the profit for the year 
and in equity as regards the amount attributable 
to equity entries.
in certain countries, the distribution of dividends 
is liable to taxation. tax on dividends is provided 
only to the extent a resolution to distribute 
dividends has been made or to the extent the 
company has a dividend distribution policy.
to the extent the schouw & co. group benefits 
from a deduction in the determination of its 
taxable income in denmark due to share-based 
incentive programmes, the tax effect of such 
programmes is included in income tax. any tax 
deduction exceeding the accounting cost is 
recognised directly in equity.
current tax liabilities and current tax receivables 
are recognised in the balance sheet as calculated 
tax on the taxable income for the year, adjusted 
for tax on prior years’ taxable income and for tax 
paid under the on-account tax scheme.
deferred tax is measured in accordance with the 
balance sheet liability method on all timing differ-
ences between the carrying amount and tax base 
of assets and liabilities. however, no deferred 
tax is recognised on timing differences regard-
ing non-deductible goodwill and other items 
for which timing differences have arisen at the 
acquisition date without affecting the financial 
results or taxable income. 
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of 
tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised under 
other non-current assets at the expected value 
of their utilisation, either as a set-off against tax 
on future income or as a set-off against deferred 
tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and 
jurisdiction.
deferred tax adjustments are made regarding 
eliminations of unrealised intercompany gains 
and losses. deferred tax is measured based on 
the tax rules and rates in the respective countries 
that will apply under the legislation in force on the 
balance sheet date when the deferred tax asset is 
expected to crystallise as current tax. changes in 
deferred tax resulting from changes in tax rates 
are recognised in the income statement. 
deferred tax assets are reviewed annually and 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that they will be utilised. depending on type, 
uncertain tax position are measured either as a 
probability-weighted average of possible out-
comes or as the most likely outcome. uncertain 
tax positions are recognised in the tax positions 
they relate to, i.e. as current tax or deferred tax as 
the case may be, unless it is deemed highly prob-
able that the tax authorities will accept the com-
pany’s tax treatment of the matter in question.
significant accounting estimates
deferred tax assets
the calculation of deferred tax assets is based 
on estimates of the extent to which prior-year 
losses can be utilised against future earnings. for 
danish companies, tax assets have been capi-
talised at a tax rate of from 22%. the group has 
operations and is liable for tax in many different 
countries. the calculation of tax on the profit for 
the year and the computation of taxable income 
involves making significant estimates regarding 
tax assets/liabilities and provisions for uncertain 
tax positions. however, in some instances the tax 
treatment in the relevant tax jurisdictions has not 
been finally resolved. this may result in discrep-
ancies between calculated tax and actual tax 
payments.
deferred tax, including prior-year tax losses, 
is recognised at the tax rate expected to apply 
taking into account current local tax rules. tax 
losses are capitalised to the extent management 
believes they can be used within a few years. 
such estimates are made at least once a year on 
the basis of budgets and business plans for the 
following years. accordingly, those estimates 
are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty. 
another factor considered is the distribution of 
taxable income on the basis of the companies’ 
transfer pricing policies. at 31 december 2020, 
the group had capitalised tax losses at a value 
for tax purposes of dkk 47 million, which are 
expected to be utilised within the next few years. 
non-capitalised tax losses at an aggregate total 
value for tax purposes of dkk 116 million are not 
expected to be utilised within the next few years. 
more than one third of the non-recognised losses 
relate to fibertex south africa.
a pending case involving the malaysian tax au-
thorities is discussed in the note “deferred tax”.

deferred tax recognised in profit for the year consists of an adjustment of deferred tax at the begin-
ning of the year of dkk 12 million and changes in deferred tax for the year of dkk -25 million, for a 
total of dkk -13 million.
schouw & co. has capitalised tax assets of dkk 104 million (2019: dkk 122 million). it is expected 
that the capitalised tax asset will be absorbed by taxable income within the next few years. all de-
ferred tax liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet. 
tax losses with an aggregate value for tax purposes of dkk 116 million (2019: dkk 114 million) have 
not been recognised, because it is considered unlikely that the deferred tax assets will be realised. 
in a transfer pricing review performed in 2013, the danish tax authorities (“skat”) made an assess-
ment to increase the taxable income of fibertex personal care a/s by dkk 122 million for the years 
2007-2011. an administrative agreement was entered into with the danish tax authorities in 2018 to 
raise the taxable income of fibertex personal care a/s concerning estimated regular royalty income 
by dkk 87 million for the years 2007-2013, corresponding to a tax payment of dkk 22 million. the 
group has subsequently opened mutual agreement procedures with the malaysian tax authori-
ties with a view to achieving a corresponding reduction of the taxable income of the subsidiary in 
malaysia. as a corresponding reduction is believed to be highly likely, a prior-year tax asset relating 
to malaysia of dkk 22 million has been recognised in the consolidated financial statements at 31 
december 2020. this matter is unchanged from last year.

securities
the carrying amount of the group’s securities at 
31 december 2020 consisted mainly of a 15.8% 
shareholding in incuba a/s. 
accounting policies
securities
security holdings which do not enable the com-
pany to exercise control or a significant influence 
are measured at fair value. value adjustments of 
securities for which changes in fair value are reg-
ularly monitored, are recognised under financial 
items in the income statement when they occur. 
liability regarding put option
debt relating to a put option for the purchase of 
non-controlling interests is initially measured at 
fair value. in subsequent periods, financial liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost, applying the “ef-
fective interest rate method”, to the effect that the 
difference between the proceeds and the nominal 
value is recognised in the income statement under 
financial expenses over the term of the loan.
pension liabilities 
the group has set up pension plans and similar 
arrangements with the majority of the group’s 
employees.
liabilities relating to defined contribution plans 
are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which the benefits vest, and payments 
due are recognised in the balance sheet under 
other payables.
for defined benefit plans, annual actuarial 
calculations are made of the net present value of 
future benefits to be paid under the plan. the net 
present value is calculated based on assumptions 
of the future developments of salary, interest, 
inflation and mortality rates, among other things. 
the net present value is calculated only for those 
benefits earned by the employees through their 
past employment with the group. the actuarial 
calculation of the net present value less the fair 
value of any plan assets is recognised in the bal-
ance sheet as pension liabilities. see below. 
current service cost is recognised in the income 
statement based on actuarial estimates and 
financial forecasts at the beginning of the year. 
differences between the expected development 
of pension assets, liabilities and the realised val-
ues are termed actuarial gains and losses and are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
if changes occur in benefits payable regarding 
the employees’ past service with the company, a 
change in the actuarial net present value arises. 
this is termed past service cost. past service 
cost is recognised immediately if the employees' 
right to the changed benefit has already vested. if 
not, it is recognised in the income statement over 
the period during which the employees' right to 
the changed benefits vests.
provisions
provisions are recognised when, as a conse-
quence of an event occurring before or at the 
balance sheet date, the group has a legal or 
constructive obligation, the settlement of which 
is likely to result in an outflow from the group of 
economic benefits.
in the measurement of provisions, the expendi-
ture required to settle the obligation is discount-
ed. changes in present values during the year are 
recognised as financial expenses.
warranty commitments are recognised as the 
sale of goods and services is effected, based on 
incurred warranty costs from prior financial years.
restructuring costs are recognised as liabilities 
when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has 
been announced to the parties affected by such 
plan on or before the balance sheet date. on ac-
quisition of enterprises, restructuring provisions 
relating to the acquired enterprise are included 
in the calculation of goodwill only if the acquired 
enterprise has a liability at the date of acquisition.
a provision for onerous contracts is recognised 
when the unavoidable costs under a contract 
exceed the expected benefits to the group from 
the contract. 
other liabilities
other liabilities are measured at net realisable 
value.
significant accounting estimates
liability regarding put option
the put option pertains to the acquisition of the 
outstanding shareholding interest in biomar 
ecuador (alimentsa) using a pre-determined 
pricing model. the non-controlling sharehold-
ers may exercise the option during the period 
from 2020 to 2022, and its value will be based 
on, among other things, the company’s financial 
results during the period until the date of exer-
cise. the obligation prior to exercise is based on 
an estimate of the company’s expected financial 
performance.

it is group policy to insure all pension liabilities and predominantly to avoid defined benefit plans. 
provisions for defined benefit pension liabilities exist mainly as a result of gpv’s acquisition of ccs 
in 2018. total pension liabilities amounted to dkk 130 million at 31 december 2020 compared with 
dkk 115 million at 31 december 2019. ccs has pension plans in several units, but mainly relating to 
switzerland where the liability was dkk 92 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 76 million). like 
last year, provisions were actuarially calculated, and the dkk -17 million adjustment for the year was 
recognised as other comprehensive income. gross liabilities amounted to a total of dkk 381 million 
at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 364 million), and the corresponding gross assets in switzer-
land amounted to dkk 290 million (2019: dkk 288 million). the calculation of the present value in 
switzer land is based on a discount rate of 0.15% (2019: 0.30%). 
provisions made comprise warranty commitments, etc. for certain products, the group has a 
contractual commitment to provide warranties of from 12 to 24 months. under these warranties, the 
group undertakes to replace or repair goods that do not function satisfactorily. the statement of ex-
pected expiry dates is based on previous experience of when claims for repair are typically received 
or goods are returned. 
other debt consists of holiday funds payable and the non-current component of the cores liability in 
borg automotive. deferred income mainly consists of investment grants.

the schouw & co. group is currently a party to a small number of legal disputes. management be-
lieves that the results of these legal disputes will not impact the group’s financial position other than 
the receivables and liabilities that have been recognised in the balance sheet at 31 december 2020. 
the chilean competition authority, fiscalia nacional económica (“fne”), initiated an investiga-
tion of the chilean fish feed industry in october 2016. as part of the investigation, biomar chile sa 
and other companies were subject to unannounced inspections. naturally, biomar chile has been 
cooperative, responding to questions and providing documentation to the extent possible. further to 
the industry investigation, the fne indicted four chilean fish feed producers, including biomar chile 
sa, on 19 december 2019 on charges of concerted practice, claiming that biomar chile sa be fined 
up to 30,000 annual tax units, which at 31 december 2020 corresponded to approximately usd 26 
million. the charges are based on isolated circumstances related to the chilean fish feed industry 
during the 2003-2015 period. 
biomar chile does not acknowledge the charges and intends to rebut the charges that it has par-
ticipated in concerted practices so as to restrict competition in the industry. based on the chilean 
lawyers’ opinion in the matter and the information currently available, management believes it is not 
likely that biomar will be convicted of participating in concerted practices. accordingly, no provisions 
have been recognised concerning claim submitted.
biomar chile submitted the company’s statement of defence on the indiction from the chilean 
competition authorities on 19 may 2020. however, the entire process has been delayed due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, and the matter is still at an early stage of what is expected to be a long-term 
process.

financial risk
the group’s risk management policy
due to the nature of their operations, investments and financing, each of the group’s portfolio com-
panies are exposed to changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. 
finance and interest rate risks are managed at group level through the parent company schouw 
& co. currency and commodity risks are managed by the portfolio companies, but subject to the 
group’s risk management policy. all financial instrument transactions are intended to contribute to 
mitigating fluctuations in profit/loss and to secure the value of cash flows. financial instruments are 
not used for speculative purposes.
interest rate risk
decisions to hedge interest rate risk are made at group level on the basis of an ongoing assessment 
of the group’s gearing and the ratio of the floating rate debt and equity.
credit risk
the group’s credit risk is primarily related to trade receivables and cash deposits. the group seeks 
to avoid significant exposure to individual customers or business partners. the group’s policy for 
undertaking credit risks involves an ongoing credit assessment of all major customers. at 31 decem-
ber 2020, the maximum credit risk considering the collateral provided was dkk 4,207 million (trade 
receivables less collateral + cash). 
currency risk
most of the group’s portfolio companies cover their currency risk naturally through same-currency 
procurement and manufacturing in local selling markets. in addition, it is group policy for the portfo-
lio companies to hedge all significant transaction risks relating to future cash flows. the purpose of 
hedging is to stabilise the value of the group’s cash flows and mitigate profit/loss volatility. 
as a general rule, currency risks are hedged by way of forward contracts with a duration of up to 12 
months. individually, the portfolio companies hedge their exposure by way of currency clauses built 
into customer and supplier contracts. based on the foreign exchange exposure at the balance sheet 
date, the table below shows the anticipated effect on the profit of likely changes in exchange rate 
crosses:

it is group policy not to hedge net investments or translation risk relating to the recognition of profit/
loss and equity in foreign subsidiaries from average exchange rates in local currencies to the group’s 
functional currency.

1) listed shares, stated at market value of shareholding (level 1)

data (level 2).
3) unlisted shares, stated at estimated value (level 3) 
the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost corresponds in all 
material respects to the carrying amount.
the group sold its holding of equities measured at the official market value (level 1) in 2020. 
securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (level 3) amounted to 
dkk 1 million at the beginning of the year and was unchanged at dkk 1 million at the end of 
the year. 
the group uses interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts to hedge fluctuations in 
the level of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. forward exchange contracts and inter-
est rate swaps are valued using generally accepted valuation techniques based on relevant 
observable swap curves and exchange rates (level 2). the fair values applied are calculated 
mainly by external sources on the basis of discounted future cash flows. other securities 
and investments forming part of a trading portfolio (level 2) includes the shareholding in 
incuba a/s. 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by way of valuation models such 
as discounted cash flow models. anticipated cash flows for individual contracts are based on 
observable market data such as interest rates and exchange rates. in addition, fair values are 
based on non-observable market data, including exchange rate volatilities, or correlations be-
tween yield curves and credit risks. non-observable market data account for an insignificant 
part of the fair value of the derivative financial instruments at the end of the reporting period.

notes · basis of preparation of the parent company financial statements
the structure of the parent company schouw & 
co.’s financial statements is consistent with that 
applied last year. 
accounting policies
general reference is made to the description of 
accounting policies provided in the consolidated 
financial statements. matters particular to the 
parent company are described in the following.
changes in accounting policies
schouw & co. has implemented the standards 
and interpretations which are effective from 
2020.
the parent company’s accounting policies are 
consistent with those of last year.
profit/loss from investments in subsidiaries
the proportionate share of the profit or loss of 
subsidiaries after tax is recognised in the income 
statement after full elimination of intra-group 
gains/losses.
investments in subsidiaries
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost 
on initial recognition and subsequently at the 
proportionate share of the companies’ net asset 
value calculated in accordance with the parent 
company’s accounting policies with the deduc-
tion or addition of unrealised intra-group gains 
and losses and with the addition or deduction of 
goodwill calculated according to the purchase 
method.
companies with a negative net asset value 
are recognised at dkk nil, and any receivable 
amount from these companies is written down, to 
the extent it is deemed to be irrecoverable, by the 
parent company’s share of the negative net asset 
value. if the negative net asset value exceeds 
the amount receivable, the residual amount is 
recognised under provisions to the extent that 
the parent company has a legal or constructive 
obligation to cover the subsidiary’s negative 
balance.
the net revaluation of investments is taken to the 
reserve for net revaluation under equity accord-
ing to the equity method to the extent the carry-
ing amount exceeds cost.
newly acquired or newly established companies 
are recognised in the financial statements from 
the date of acquisition.
enterprises disposed of or wound up are recog-
nised until the date of disposal.
securities
security holdings which do not enable the com-
pany to exercise control or a significant influence 
are measured at fair value. securities for which 
changes in fair value are regularly monitored, are 
recognised under financial items in the income 
statement when they occur. 
shareholders' equity
the purchase and sale sums of treasury shares 
and dividends thereon are taken directly to 
retained earnings under equity.
treasury shares
proceeds from the sale of treasury shares in 
schouw & co. in connection with the exercise 
of share options or employee shares are taken 
directly to equity.
dividend
dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of 
adoption by the shareholders at the annual gen-
eral meeting (the date of declaration). dividends 
expected to be declared in respect of the year are 
stated as a separate line item under equity.

most of the financing of subsidiaries is made through the parent company schouw & co. by way of a 
structure of intra-group loans through cash pools.
for receivables which mature within 12 months after the end of the financial year, the nominal value 
is estimated to correspond to the fair value.
the parent company has not made provisions for losses on receivables from subsidiaries in the cash 
pool agreement. as the subsidiaries generate good earnings and are solid financially, provisions for 
losses are not considered necessary.

it is company policy to fund all pension liabilities, so as predominantly to avoid defined benefit plans. 
however, as part of the merger with biomar holding, schouw & co. assumed a defined benefit 
obligation. 
the pension obligation was calculated at dkk 16.0 million at 31 december 2020. the entire amount 
relates to the liability to insure the entitlements to receive supplementary pensions in accordance 
with the previous practise of the kfk pension funds. the entire obligation is related to people who 
were on the labour market at 30 september 2002 and who transferred to employment with the con-
sortium that took over the divested grain and feed operations (the former kfk). some uncertainty 
applies as to the amount of the pension obligation. accordingly, final coverage of this liability may 
impact future financial results in a positive or a negative direction.

surety for group debt to credit institutions amounted to dkk 0.0 million (2019: dkk 19.6 million).

marily to changes in the level of interest rates. interest rate risks are described in greater detail in the

management of financial risk relating to operations and investment.

the parent company does not hedge these investments. 
the parent company’s currency risk exposure at 31 december 2020 was limited to eur-denominat-
ed net debt of dkk 267 million and as such not subject to any material currency risk.

cash deposits.

the board of directors and the executive 
management have considered and approved the 
annual report for the 2020 financial year.

ance with the international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for annual

opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company financial state-
ments of aktieselskabet schouw & co. for the 
financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020, 
which comprise income statement, statement 
of comprehensive income, balance sheet, state-
ment of changes in equity, cash flow statement 
and notes, including accounting policies, for the 
group and the parent company. the consolidat-
ed financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional require-
ments of the danish financial statements act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the group and the parent company 
at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the 
group’s and the parent company’s operations 
and cash flows for the financial year 1 january – 
31 december 2020 in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our long-form au-
dit report to the audit committee and the board 
of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with inter-
national standards on auditing (isas) and ad-
ditional requirements applicable in denmark. our 
responsibilities under those standards and re-
quirements are further described in the ”auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements” (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as ”the financial statements”) section 
of our report. we believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the international ethics standards board 
for accountants’ code of ethics for profes-
sional accountants (iesba code) and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these rules and requirements. 
to the best of our knowledge, we have not 
provided any prohibited non-audit services as 
described in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no. 
537/2014.
appointment of auditor
we were initially appointed as auditor of aktie-
selskabet schouw & co. before 1995 and must 
therefore withdraw from the audit no longer than 
at the annual general meeting in 2021. we have 
been reappointed annually by resolution of the 
general meeting for a total consecutive period of 
25 years up until the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most signifi-
cance in our audit of the financial statements 
for the financial year 2020. these matters were 
addressed during our audit of the financial state-
ments as a whole and in forming our opinion 
thereon. we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. for each matter below, our de-
scription of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in 
the ”auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements” section, including in rela-
tion to the key audit matters below. accordingly, 
our audit included the design and performance 
of procedures to respond to our assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements. the results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address 
the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the financial statements.
independent auditor’s report 
trade receivables
trade receivables represent a significant item in 
the consolidated financial statements, of which 
approx. 61% of the group’s trade receivables 
relate to biomar; see note 6 to the consolidated 
financial statements. biomar operates in an 
industry and in geographical markets that imply 
a risk of loss on trade receivables. the assess-
ment of impairment losses on trade receivables 
is based on management’s assessment of future 
payments, including the value of collateral. 
our audit procedures included test of manage-
ment’s estimate of provisions for losses on trade 
receivables, including an assessment of trade re-
ceivables ageing at financial year end and sample 
testing of payments received after the balance 
sheet date, registered collateral and realised 
losses on receivables in the financial year. we 
also examined the outcome of management’s es-
timates in previous periods of provisions for bad 
debts in order to assess management’s ability to 
accurately compute losses on trade receivables 
in previous financial years. our audit was in par-
ticular directed at the assessment of impairment 
losses on trade receivables from biomar.
goodwill
goodwill represents a significant item in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
in order to ensure that the carrying amount 
of goodwill does not exceed the recoverable 
amount, management performs an annual 
impairment test of group goodwill; see note 15 
to the consolidated financial statements. we 
compared the value of each of the cash-gen-
erating units to which goodwill relates with the 
recoverable amount. in accordance with ias 36, 
management has estimated the future cash flows 
for each cash-generating unit and calculated 
the value in use using the discounted cash flow 
model. 
our audit procedures included an assessment 
of the appropriateness of the group’s impair-
ment model.  we compared the assumptions on 
which the estimated future cash flows are based 
with budgets and projections approved by the 
board for the individual cash-generating units 
and compared the most significant expectations 
of future earnings (ebit) with the growth rates 
realised in the past. we assessed the discount 
factors used by comparing them to external 
market data. we also assessed the sensitivity of 
the most significant assumptions for earnings 
and discount factors.
statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the manage-
ment’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the management’s review, and we do not ex-
press any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read the manage-
ment’s review and, in doing so, consider whether 
the management’s review is materially inconsist-
ent with the financial statements or our knowl-
edge obtained during the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider 
whether the management’s review provides the

information required under the danish financial 
statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that the management’s review is in 
accordance with the financial statements and has 
been prepared in accordance with the require-
ments of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatement of 
the management’s review. 
management’s responsibilities  
for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, manage-
ment is responsible for assessing the group’s 
and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements unless management either 
intends to liquidate the group or the parent com-
pany or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assur-
ance as to whether the financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an au-
ditor’s report that includes our opinion. reason-
able assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in ac-
cordance with isas and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect a mate-
rial misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with 
isas and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material mis-
statement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations or 
the override of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s 
and the parent company’s internal control. 
•  evaluate the appropriateness of account-
ing policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of manage-
ment’s use of the going concern basis of ac-
counting in preparing the financial statements 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the group’s and the parent compa-
ny’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inad-
equate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause the group and 
the parent company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
contents of the financial statements, including 
the note disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transac-
tions and events in a manner that gives a true 
and fair view.
independent auditor’s report 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-
garding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and sig-
nificant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance 
with a statement that we have complied with rel-
evant ethical requirements regarding independ-
ence, and to communicate with them all relation-
ships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our audi-
tor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our re-
port because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
