travelers for the future
sas annual and sustainability report
fiscal year 2020
dear reader,
the covid-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on businesses, people, 
societies and the world as we know it. the magnitude of the pandemic 
became evident in mid-march when countries started to close their borders 
and impose strict travel restrictions, making it virtually impossible for the 
global aviation industry to continue operations and secure vital connectiv-
ity. of all impacted industries, aviation is probably the most exposed, being 
severely hit from day one and will most likely be the last industry to fully 
recover from the crisis. 
we’re still in the middle of the pandemic with the majority of our normal des-
tinations closed or under strict travel restrictions. the covid-19 crisis has of 
course significantly impacted our operations, people and  figures in fy 2020. 
it has been an unprecedented year, but the people of sas have demonstrated 
strong resilience, an ability to support the broader scandinavian society and 
a determination to adapt to a new reality. i’m convinced that sas will continue 
to be an important part of scandinavian infrastructure beyond the pandemic 
crisis and pave the way towards a more sustainable future for our industry.

at the start of the year, sas experienced high demand for its 
services. we delivered a robust operational performance and 
reported increased number of passengers, revenues as well as 
overall market share. as a direct consequence of the covid-19 
pandemic and imposed travel restrictions, the demand for air travel 
collapsed and the revenue loss during fiscal year 2020 amounted 
to sek -25.6 billion. despite immediate measures to reduce costs 
to adapt to the new market environment, a cost reduction of 33% 
did not offset the sharp decline in revenue and resulted in a sek 9.4 
billion lower earnings before tax and items affecting comparability.

our overall long-term goal is to create  
value for our shareholders and to deliver  
sustainable and profitable growth throughout  
the business cycle. during the year, our 
targets were adjusted in accordance with 
the revised business plan and the ifrs 16 
accounting standard – for definitions please 
see page 145.
return on invested capital (roic)* 
our target for roic is to exceed the post-tax weighted average 
cost of capital (wacc) over a business cycle, and is a prerequisite 
for us to create shareholder value. the target is also linked to our 
dividend policy, which stipulates that dividend can be paid when 
value is created through roic exceeding wacc, see page 36. 
 
financial net debt/ebitda*
the target financial net debt/ebitda is a key ratio used by credit 
rating agencies and banks for assessing creditworthiness. the 
aim with maintaining a ratio with a multiple of less than three and a 
half (3.5x) is aligned with the sas ambition to improve its financial 
position and credit rating, and thereby lowering financing costs. 
 
financial preparedness* 
our target for financial preparedness is for cash, cash equivalents 
and available credit facilities to exceed 25% of annual fixed costs. 
the target is set to ensure a sound level of cash and cash equiva-
lents to mitigate risks related to internal and external events and to 
fulfill regulatory requirements.
 
total co2 emissions  
sas has set an ambitious target to reduce its total co2 emissions 
25% compared with 2005. during the year, the pace toward the 
target was accelerated to 2025, from 2030. this is in line with sas’ 
strive for global leadership in sustainable aviation.
*the outcome during fy15–fy19 is shown under the old definition and target, whereas 
fy20 is shown under the new definition and target.
financial and environmental targets
total co2 emissions, m tonnes
outcome
the sharp decline in emissions is to the vast majority due to the covid-19 
pandemic. co2 emissions per ask improved by 5.3% in the same period.
outcome
a high cash position following the recapitalization as well as lower fixed 
costs led to an increase in financial preparedness to 67%.

outsourcing
in july, sas signed an agreement 
to outsource ground handling oper-
ations in gothenburg and malmö, 
concentrating the operations to the 
three main hubs in copenhagen, 
oslo and stockholm. 
new aircraft
during the year, sas took delivery 
of 13 a320neo, one a321lr and 
four a350 aircraft. after the out-
break of the pandemic, deliveries 
of airbus a320neo and a350-900 
aircraft were postponed, to better 
align with the expected return in 
demand. meanwhile, older and less 
fuel- efficient aircraft were phased 
out at a faster rate, to continue the 
fleet renewal in line with our strate-
gic priority to have one of europe’s 
most modern and fuel-efficient 
fleets. as a large part of our fleet 
has been grounded due to the pan-
demic, we have prioritized utilizing 
our newest and most energy-effi-
cient aircraft in operations.
dramatically 
reduced traffic
because of the outbreak of 
covid-19 and subsequent travel 
restrictions, sas halted most of 
its traffic from mid-march, with a 
certain degree of increase of limited 
operations during the summer 
months. 
operational 
financial 
product and offering 
safe travel
we always work hard to ensure 
the safety and well-being of our 
passengers. following the covid-
19 outbreak, we added additional 
safety precautions including face 
mask requirements, new boarding 
procedures, and limited access to 
lounges and meal services onboard 
to better facilitate social distancing.
new shareholder 
program 
in october, sas launched a new 
shareholder program with favorable 
discounts to individual sharehold-
ers holding 4,000 shares or more 
and tier level benefits for larger 
owners.
refunds 
because of the pandemic, sas had 
to cancel most of its flights from 
mid-march. this unprecedented 
situation led to an extreme number 
extended 
eurobonus 
membership level
sas decided to extend eurobonus 
membership levels by 12 months 
on their current membership level.
cost reductions
we carried out a number of meas-
ures to adapt our cost structure to 
a market defined by lower demand. 
the short- and long-term measures 
to reduce costs resulted in 33% 
lower total operating expenditure.
recapitalization
despite significant efforts to reduce 
costs, the covid-19 pandemic 
resulted in a need to remedy the 
liquidity situation and the negative 
equity caused by the outbreak. in 
response, a recapitalization plan 
was implemented and entailed the 
following components:
•   a directed issue of common 
shares of sek 2 billion to the 
governments of denmark and 
sweden 
•  a rights issue of common shares 
amounting to sek 4 billion
•   an issue of new hybrid notes 
of sek 5 billion split equally 
between the governments of 
denmark and sweden
•   an issue of new hybrid notes of 
sek 1 billion to the government 
of denmark
•  a conversion of existing sek 1.5 
billion hybrid notes into common 
shares at 90% of nominal value
•   a conversion of existing sek 
2.25 billion senior bond to sek 
0.6 billion into common shares 
and sek 1.6 billion into a new 
commercial hybrid note
in total, the recapitalization 
increased liquidity by sek 12 
billion, decreased liabilities by 
sek 2.25 billion and strengthened 
equity by sek 14.25 billion. 
since the outbreak of covid-19, sas has taken additional measures to ensure the safety 
and well-being of passengers.
the covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented 
global event. strict travel restrictions and a 
collapse in the demand for air travel had a 
 significant impact on the aviation industry in 
2020. for sas, this year has been character-
ized by adapting our operations to this new 
situation and securing critical scandinavian 
connectivity when it was needed the most. 
of requests for customer refunds 
and unfortunately long lead times. 
multiple initiatives have been 
introduced to improve the process, 
including self-service options for 
agents and customers, robots for 
automation where possible, addi-
tional staff to handle more complex 
cases and new voucher solutions.

co2 emissions
during the year, we decided to 
accelerate our efforts to reduce 
emissions and our goal to reduce 
total co2 emissions by 25% (com-
pared to 2005 levels) is now to be 
reached in 2025, five years earlier 
than planned.
co2 emissions decreased 57.2% 
year-on-year. the main reason was 
the reduced traffic due to covid-19, 
but deliveries of new aircraft, with 
15–30% lower fuel consumption 
than the aircraft they replace also 
had an effect.
emerging 
technologies
we continued to work with airbus 
on the development of next 
generation aircraft with low or 
zero emissions. sas also worked 
together with airbus on an innova-
tive concept where the aerodynamic 
benefits of formation flying will be 
evaluated in 2021. 
fuel efficiency
sas continued its work on fuel 
 efficiency with big data and innova-
tive systems to support efficiency 
efforts.
sustainable 
aviation fuels
sas consumed about 670 tonnes of 
biofuel during the year. this covers 
the biofuel sold to customers as well 
as the blend-in mandate introduced 
in norway on january 1, 2020.
sas has continued the work 
with multiple stakeholders to 
 accelerate the commercialization 
of sustainable aviation fuels, such 
as biofuel.
temporary layoffs
as of mid-march, approximately 
90% of sas' employees were 
 temporarily laid off. the layoff 
schemes have been crucial for opti-
mizing manning and to scale up and 
down according to demand.
new members of 
group management
charlotte svensson was appointed 
new chief information officer as of 
february 1, 2020. 
magnus Örnberg was appointed 
new cfo of sas as of september 
1, 2020.
redundancies
sas reduced the workforce by 
5,000 full-time positions to adapt 
the organization to a market with 
lower demand. this affected 
approximately 1,900 positions in 
sweden, 1,300 in norway, 1,700 
in denmark and 100 in other 
countries.
organization
repatriation flights
sas operated five special flights 
for the repatriation of citizens from 
countries such as peru, brazil 
and pakistan, on behalf of the 
scandinavian authorities.
air bridges for 
medical supplies
sas contributed with transport via 
air freight to bring important med-
icines and medical equipment to 
scandinavia during the pandemic.
supporting society
during temporary layoffs, commit-
ted employees engaged in relieving 
the strained healthcare sector, 
assisting in carrying out public 
covid-19 tests and volunteering as 
substitute teachers in elementary 
schools. 
securing critical 
infrastructure
sas continues to be scandinavia’s 
leading airline, maintaining 
scandinavian connectivity espe-
cially domestic destinations and 
securing critical infrastructure for 
travelers and cargo.

how has this dramatic year impacted sas?
we began our fiscal year in november 2019 with a 
strong tailwind, with high demand, strong passenger 
numbers, increased revenue and improved market 
shares. but in march the situation changed over-
night, when the full effects of the covid-19 pandemic 
became evident, and quickly resulted in lockdowns, 
closed borders and strict travel restrictions. the entire 
aviation industry was heavily impacted, and sas was 
no exception. almost our entire fleet was grounded 
from the end of march and throughout april. demand 
for air travel started to recover somewhat during the 
summer season, unfortunately to be abruptly halted 
again by a second wave of reported covid-19 cases in 
september and october. this led to reintroduced travel 
restrictions, and dramatically reduced demand. 
the temporary layoff schemes available from the 
scandinavian governments have been helpful in 
retaining as many of our employees as possible. the 
schemes also enabled us to better scale up and down 
traffic according to the volatility in demand. however, 
we unfortunately had to carry out 5,000 redundancies 
during the year, which were necessary to safeguard our 
business for the future. 
the successful recapitalization, that was finalized in 
the last quarter of the year, was essential to get us 
through these difficult times. the support from our 
major owners – the danish and swedish governments, 
the knut and alice wallenberg foundation – together 
with our other investors, has been vital for us. a large 
portion of the governmental support increased our 
debt that naturally needs to be repaid in the coming 
years. therefore, it’s important that we deliver on our 
transformational plan and adapt to a new market envi-
ronment, characterized by high uncertainty and lower 
demand.
what have you learned from the covid-19 pan-
demic so far?
this crisis has put people, societies and enterprises 
in a situation not experienced in modern times. sas 
reacted immediately and started to transform its entire 
business. as demand disappeared, we quickly reduced 
our capacity and launched an extensive cost savings 
program. we grounded a large part of our fleet and 
temporarily laid off approximately 90% of our staff. 
despite this, we ended the year with an annual loss 
exceeding sek 10 billion.
the year was significantly impacted by the pandemic, with a dramatic drop in both 
passengers and revenue, which resulted in the worst loss in modern times for sas. 
as a direct response to the pandemic crisis, sas embarked on a massive trans-
formational journey, to ensure a more sustainable future for our business – both 
financially and environmentally.

the safety and well-being of travelers and employ-
ees is always our highest priority. during the year, 
we reviewed the entire customer journey and imple-
mented changes to ensure the safest travel experience 
possible given the circumstances. our aircraft were 
already designed with safe air circulation systems and 
equipped with effective hepa filters that significantly 
reduce the risk of airborne contamination. in addition, 
we adapted our procedures on the ground and in the 
air to facilitate social distancing, introduced more fre-
quent disinfection of touch points and made sure that 
all crew and passengers use face masks during travel.
another major challenge for us this year, has been the 
enormous amount of refunds caused by this unprec-
edented situation. when the pandemic hit, our refund 
capacity was not designed for such an exceptionally 
large number of customer refunds for canceled flights. 
during the year, we have worked hard to scale up our 
capacity to manage the backlog, and toward the end 
of the year, we were able to process customer refunds 
at a much faster rate due to enhanced digital solutions 
and increased staffing. i want to offer a sincere apology 
to our customers who’ve been affected by excessively 
long lead times. i also want to stress that we will not 
rest until all rightful claims have been settled.
what other significant events for sas would you like 
to highlight during the year?
despite closed borders, sas continued to play a vital 
role in society. early on during the outbreak, sas also 
operated special flights to repatriate scandinavian citi-
zens from countries such as peru, brazil and pakistan, 
as well as ensuring air bridges for essential medical 
supplies.
i’m proud of our committed employees for their incred-
ible efforts during this turbulent year. we have collec-
tively worked hard with the required transformational 
initiatives, and we have seen exceptional examples of 
how sas colleagues quickly adapted to difficult situa-
tions. one of many examples, was when our temporar-
ily laid off staff, actively helped to relieve the strained 
healthcare sector.
the successful recapitalization process was an impor-
tant milestone, that required significant efforts to final-
ize. it has resulted in a strengthened cash position that 
is important in these uncertain times. we now have to 
honor the trust demonstrated by our investors by deliv-
ering on our efficiency targets, as well as by exploring 
additional improvements to safeguard our business for 
the future. we continue to strive for greater flexibility, 
higher productivity and increased cost-efficiency to 
adapt to a new market environment. 
in the light of covid-19, how is the work with sus-
tainability progressing?
our determined work toward a more sustainable avi-
ation industry, is more important now than ever. the 
entire airline industry has a responsibility to find a path 
toward a sustainable future. this is just as essential 
now as it was before the pandemic.
at sas, we want to lead the way. we have found a way 
to significantly increase the speed of our transition, and 
announced the most ambitious emission goal in the 
aviation industry – to reduce our total co2 emissions 
by 25% by 2025. one important part of achieving this 
goal, is the ongoing fleet renewal, where new airbus 
aircraft reduce carbon emissions by 15–30% com-
pared to the aircraft they replace. during the pandemic, 
we have phased out older and less fuel-efficient aircraft 
at a higher pace and thereby significantly shortened 
our path to a fully modernized fleet. 
“our determined work toward 
a more sustainable aviation 
industry, is more important 
now than ever.”

but our work toward zero emissions doesn’t stop there. 
we are also involved in different partnerships to find 
opportunities with promising emerging technolo-
gies and collaborations, for example within emerging 
carbon capture technologies and with train opera-
tors, to make sure that sas will be the first choice for 
 travelers of the future.
increased usage of sustainable aviation fuel (saf), 
such as biofuel, is another important part of our ambi-
tions to reduce co2 emissions. the challenge is that 
supply is still limited, and prices are high. therefore, 
sas has engaged with existing and future suppliers of 
saf to discuss offtake agreements and other ways to 
incentivize large-scale production of the desired fuels. 
given the new market conditions for the industry,  
how do you see the future of aviation?
the pandemic has changed the fundamentals for 
the aviation industry through restrictions and gen-
eral travel concerns. but air travel fulfils an extremely 
important function in society – connecting businesses, 
people and cultures in a time-efficient way. aviation is 
also a foundation for value creation, job security, inno-
vation and development. 
sas ensures scandinavian connectivity, even in these 
troubled times, and access to air travel means that 
scandinavian companies can prosper and continue 
to have access to global customers, without having to 
move their business to other countries. 
travel also enriches our lives. it’s fantastic to dis-
cover new places, experience other cultures and to be 
exposed to new ideas. i think that many, like myself, 
really look forward to being able to travel freely once 
again.
“air travel fulfils an extremely 
important function in  society 
– connecting businesses, 
people and cultures in a 
time-efficient way.”
what opportunities do you see when looking ahead?
we’re encouraged by the progress on the development

-45.5% 
the airline operating environment
the aviation industry was heavily impacted by 
covid-19 and associated travel restrictions 
during a substantial part of the fiscal year 
2020. the uncertainties regarding changing 
travel restrictions, digitalization and a general 
concern regarding travel, will affect the airline 
industry for years to come.
-59.9% 
decrease in the number of 
passengers from scandinavian 
airports in 2020
decrease in the number  
of seats offered in scandinavia 
in 2020
looking ahead 
our view is that the ramp-up phase for the airline 
industry will last until 2022 before demand can reach 
more normalized levels, with a return to pre covid-
19 levels a few years thereafter. a view which is also 
shared by iata.

the covid-19 effect on the airline industry
the covid-19 pandemic is having a significant negative 
impact on the global economy. the travel industry is 
one of the most affected sectors and the pandemic has 
created a global crisis for the aviation industry. what 
started with travel restrictions to mainland china quickly 
led to global health-concerns, travel restrictions, quar-
antines and strict advice against non-essential travel.
when the full effects of the pandemic became evident, 
counter measures such as social distancing, travel 
restrictions, quarantines and lockdowns, resulted in a 
sharp decline in passenger numbers and consequently 
revenue for all airlines. as a consequence of the meas-
ures taken by the authorities to prevent the spread, the 
demand for international air travel has been dramatically 
reduced from mid-march 2020.
uncertainty defining the market
during the summer months, customer demand slowly 
increased. but during the fall, with an increase in the 
spread of covid-19, new travel restrictions were intro-
duced, limiting operations. 
the pace and prerequisites of countries re-opening 
will not be the same in all geographies and regions, 
and uncertainty remains high. travel restrictions are 
introduced, removed and reintroduced, often with short 
notice and without coordination between countries, 
which leads to uncertainty for customers. as a conse-
quence, bookings and cancellations are being made 
closer to the date of travel, which makes predictability 
and planning difficult for airlines. 
demand going forward is heavily dependent on the 
global development of the covid-19 pandemic and 
travel restrictions. the global economic downturn is 
continuing to affect demand negatively. business travel 
is expected to be reduced as corporate travel budgets 
are constrained when companies continue to be under 
financial pressure. the demand for business travel can 
also be negatively affected as digital meetings replace 
some in- person meetings. the demand for leisure travel 
continues to be weak in the face of travel restrictions 
to limit the spread and concerns of being infected by 
covid-19 at different destinations. also concerns over 
job security and rising unemployment can have a nega-
tive effect on leisure travel.
as a result of these uncertainties, the prevailing market 
conditions will affect the airline industry for years to 
come. according to forecasts from the international air 
transport association (iata), passenger demand will 
not return to 2019 levels until 2024.

sas remains focused on scandinavia’s frequent travelers and on main-
taining its strong market position in scandinavia. to be the first choice 
of airline, we offer the most comprehensive network in scandinavia as 
well as attractive products and services. our customers can also enjoy 
our new and energy efficient aircraft, providing a more pleasant, com-
fortable and sustainable way of traveling.
as scandinavia’s leading airline, sas prioritizes main traffic flows to, from and within 
scandinavia. even during the current pandemic, scandinavian connectivity has been 
maintained by sas, which is able to quickly and effectively scale up and down capacity 
according to demand.
we constantly monitor customer preferences and satisfaction to see what our busi-
ness and leisure travelers appreciate. our passengers rate their interaction with sas 
employees highly, as well as the flexibility we offer when booking tickets and our safe 
travel experience. the safety of passengers and employees is always our highest pri-
ority and because of the covid-19 outbreak, additional measures were introduced to 
ensure safety and well-being throughout the customer journey.
we also provide opportunities for passengers to add travel extras, such as booking an 
extra seat or adding biofuel to reduce the environmental impact of their flight.
to further strengthen the relationship with our customers, we continuously develop 
scandinavia’s largest loyalty program, eurobonus. one of the benefits is that all sas 
tickets for eurobonus members, are automatically carbon offset, free of charge.

sas continues to renew its aircraft fleet and by 2025 plans to have one 
of europe’s most modern and efficient aircraft fleets, with 15–30% 
lower fuel consumption, compared with the aircraft they replace. the 
new state-of-the-art aircraft will give our customers a more pleasant, 
comfortable and sustainable way of traveling. 
our single-type airbus fleet will increase crew productivity through less need for 
training, lower stand-by levels and the possibility to combine shorter and longer 
flights in the planning. additionally, it will reduce maintenance costs and overall  
complexity in the organization.

sas will once again need to demonstrate its ability to adapt to an 
airline industry in transition. our operating model has been refined to 
increase flexibility and productivity and is based on three production 
platforms – sas scandinavia, sas ireland and regional production 
partners. 
our operating model allows us to serve different types of destinations and customer 
segments according to season, with single-type aircraft operations and full cost 
 competitiveness in each platform.
to increase our competitiveness we are continuing to implement our efficiency and 
productivity initiatives across the entire organization. we have renegotiated contracts 
with our largest suppliers, outsourced part of the ground handling operations and 
resized the administration. to adjust to a period of expected lower demand, we will 
continue to pursue additional efficiency improvements. these include a broad range 
of measures to deliver sek 4 billion in efficiency improvements by 2022 to adapt our 
cost structure and organization to the new market environment.

sas is fully committed to ambitious initiatives to reduce the climate and 
environmental impacts of its operations through innovation and invest-
ment in new technology and new ways of working. our initiatives are 
primarily focused on reducing co2 emissions from our aircraft opera-
tions as they account for over 99% of our total co2 emissions.
during the year, we decided to accelerate efforts to reduce our emissions and our 
target to decrease total co2 emissions by 25% (compared to 2005 levels) is now to 
be reached in 2025, five years earlier than planned. the reduction corresponds to 
the amount of co2 emissions from our flights within scandinavia during 2019 and it 
ensures that sas contributes positively to the targets set out in the paris agreement. 
a cornerstone to reach the target is our ongoing fleet renewal. in 2025, we expect to 
operate one of the most modern aircraft fleets in europe, with the most fuel-efficient 
aircraft type in each segment and at the same time work with multiple initiatives to 
minimize fuel consumption during flights.
additionally, we aim to take a world-leading position in the usage of sustainable 
aviation fuels (saf), which are renewable fuels that reduce climate-impacting co2 
emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuel. to reach our target by 2025, one 
condition is that the availability increases, so that up to 10% of our fuel consumption 
can consist of saf. in close collaboration with stakeholders across multiple industries, 
we are working to introduce sustainable aviation fuel production in scandinavia and to 
create a supportive regulatory framework. in combination with efficiency measures, 
such as a fully implemented single european sky, this could enable sas to achieve a 
reduction of up to 50% in total co2 emissions by 2030 (compared to 2005).

sustainability is an existential topic for sas and the aviation industry. by taking a global leadership position in sus-
tainable aviation, we want to be at the forefront of the transition to a more sustainable future. we have been working 
to reduce the environmental impact of our operations for many years and we believe that sustainability will be grow-
ing as a long-term competitive advantage for sas. during the year, we have accelerated our efforts and identified a 
roadmap to reduce our total co2 emissions 25% by 2025.

sas as an investment
leading market position in the scandinavian 
market targeting frequent travelers
2020 was challenging for the scandinavian air travel 
market due to the covid-19 pandemic. but as demand 
returns, air travel will continue to be an important part 
of the scandinavian transport infrastructure as it con-
nects communities, cultures and people in a time-ef-
ficient way. given scandinavia’s economic prosperity 
and that the region is characterized by relatively long 
distances and mountainous topography, the air travel 
market is very large in relation to its population under 
normal circumstances. 
for flights to, from, and within scandinavia, sas has 
held a leading market position with a market share of 
over 30% in a normal year and operates the region's 
most comprehensive network. together with star 
alliance and partners, we are in a position to offer a 
broad network with frequent departures. this means 
that sas is often the first choice for frequent travelers. 
no other airline in scandinavia has such a high level of 
preference among frequent travelers.
strong track record of 
transformational capabilities
sas has a proven ability to adapt to an airline industry 
in transition and has shown profitability during the past 
five years. to mitigate increased competitive pressure 
from other airlines as well as negative macro- economic 
events, sas has continuously focused on improving 
efficiency through the years and has delivered signifi-
cant efficiency improvements since 2013. during the 
ongoing covid-19 pandemic, sas has taken decisive 
steps to reduce costs to adapt to a market with lower 
demand. sas continues to pursue additional efficiency 
improvements to retake its place as a profitable and 
sustainable airline.  
aiming for global leadership  
in sustainable aviation
society and our customers are increasingly demanding 
more sustainable solutions. this trend is expected to 
continue in the airline industry, with a focus on reduc-
ing emissions and the more efficient use of resources. 
we work hard to continuously reduce the climate and 
environmental impact from our flight operations. this 
is done through a vast number of initiatives in our daily 
operations and large investments in new fuel- efficient 
aircraft. sas also collaborates with airbus to make low 
or even zero emission aircraft a reality in the future. 
meanwhile, we intend to increase our use of sustain-
able aviation fuels (saf) significantly. sas is pushing 
for the large-scale commercial production of saf in 
scandinavia. by 2025, our goal is to reduce our total 
co2 emissions 25%.

leveraging our strong loyalty program 
and brand to increase ancillary revenue 
sas is one of scandinavia’s strongest and best-known 
brands and has been regularly ranked as the  strongest 
brand within the travel category in scandinavia and 
europe.
sas eurobonus is scandinavia’s largest loyalty pro-
gram within travel and experiences, and forms the core 
of our efforts to establish a closer relationship with our 
customers. eurobonus has over 6 million members and 
more than 100 partners, which represents a valuable 
customer database and sets us apart from the competi-
tion. during the year eurobonus was transferred
it to a separate entity to illustrate its value and to
continue to further strengthen the relationship
with customers. sas also offers a program to rein-
force loyalty among corporate customers — sas for 
business. corporate-agreement customers account  
for just over a third of our passenger revenue.
operating model adapted to  
scandinavian travel patterns
airlines are capital-intensive due to major investments 
in aircraft and engines, and this requires efficient 
capital management. sas has developed an operating 
model that allows it to serve all types of destinations 
and customer segments. the sas operating model 
is based on its three production platforms – sas 
scandinavia, sas ireland and regional production part-
ners. additionally, sas is also evaluating a replacement 
for its ageing 737 fleet to offer a fuel-efficient alterna-
tive in its mid-size segment.
the production platforms allow sas to maintain its 
strong scandinavian footprint, secure its presence on 
highly competitive routes and participate in new leisure 
markets as well as rightsize aircraft during the off-peak 
season.
new shareholder program
our shareholders are an important part of our future as 
a vital part of scandinavian infrastructure as well as in 
supporting our journey to become the global leader in 
sustainable aviation.
during the year, we launched a new and improved share-
holder program where shareholders with 4,000 shares or 
more can benefit from special campaigns with discounted 
prices on selected domestic and international tickets. 
shareholders with 100,000 shares or more can also enjoy 
eurobonus tier level benefits.

1)  the revenue effects are estimated and comprise the difference in revenue between fy19 
and fy20 after adjustment for the pilot strike last year. the effects on expenses com-
prise the implemented cost reduction program including the decrease in variable pro-
duction costs (adjusted for strike-related costs last year) and support for temporary lay-
offs, etc.
income november 2019–october 2020
sas generated an ebit of msek -9,549 (1,166). 
income before tax amounted to msek -10,151 (794) 
and income after tax was msek -9,275 (621). tax for 
the year amounted to msek 876 (-173). year-on-year, 
the exchange-rate trend had a negative impact on rev-
enue of msek 1,008 and a positive effect on operating 
expenses of msek 935. foreign exchange rates thus 
had a negative impact on operating income of msek 
73. net financial items were positively impacted by cur-
rency items amounting to msek 737. in total, currency 
effects had a net positive impact of msek 664 on ebt. 
the effect mainly related to a stronger sek against the 
usd. 
punctuality and regularity
in fy 2020, sas increased its arrival punctuality to 
87.9% (80.3) together with a slight improvement in 
regularity to 97.7% (97.5) as a result of improvement 
initiatives implemented last year and fewer flights. 
impact of the covid-19 pandemic
the covid-19 pandemic and the actions taken in 
response to its spread, including various government 
measures and travel restrictions, have resulted in 
significant disruption to sas’ operations. for the year, 
capacity (ask) was down 55.4% and revenue passen-
ger kilometers (rpk) were 64.1% lower compared with 
same period last year. the reduction of the network 
and number of passengers resulted in a significant 
revenue decrease for sas of 55.5% compared with 
fy 2019. the estimated negative revenue impact from 
the covid-19 pandemic was msek -25,913 for the full 
fiscal year.
despite measures taken by sas to reduce costs, the 
significant decrease in revenue cannot be outweighed 
by cost reductions. therefore, the company concluded 
a recapitalization plan during the fourth quarter aimed 
at counteracting the effects from covid-19 and to 
remedy the liquidity shortage and the negative effects 
on equity caused by the pandemic.
in total, liquidity was strengthened by sek 12 billion 
and equity improved with sek 14.25 billion.
the demand and the financial performance for the 
coming year will continue to be uncertain—affecting 
revenue, and lowering ticket sales and cash flows to an 
extent and for a duration that are currently unknown.

revenue
revenue totaled msek 20,513 (46,112), see note 2. 
currency-adjusted revenue was down msek 24,591 
year-on-year. the decrease in revenue mainly related 
to lower overall demand following the covid-19 pan-
demic and the travel restrictions introduced. 
currency-adjusted passenger revenue decreased 
59.8%. the decrease was a result of lower scheduled 
capacity (ask) which, based on the preceding year’s 
circumstances, had a negative impact on revenue of 
msek 18,410. the lower load factor had a negative 
effect of msek 3,433. the higher yield had a positive 
impact of msek 1,107 on passenger revenue.
currency-adjusted cargo revenue decreased msek 
625 and currency-adjusted charter revenue was msek 
1,463 lower. other traffic revenue (currency-adjusted) 
was down msek 1,077. the decrease in revenue 
mainly related to lower traffic volumes. 
other operating revenue (currency-adjusted) was 
msek 689 lower year-on-year, mainly as a conse-
quence of lower revenue from ground handling oper-
ations, sale of eurobonus points, ticket fees and other 
volume related revenues.
 revenue breakdown fiscal year 2020
 passenger revenue 68.0% (76.9)
 freight and mail revenue 4.3% (3.3)

operational and financial expenses
personnel expenses amounted to msek -7,969 
(-9,934). after adjustment for currency and items 
affecting comparability, personnel expenses decreased 
msek 1,937 year-on-year. the decrease mainly related 
to covid-19 effects of msek 2,047, which included 
msek 788 of support received from the governments 
of denmark and sweden for temporary lay-offs. the 
decrease was also attributable to direct salary com-
pensation paid by the norwegian government to fur-
loughed employees in norway and to reduced person-
nel expenses due to lower production volume. 
fuel expenses amounted to msek -5,626 (-9,672). 
adjusted for currency, jet-fuel costs decreased 41.6%. 
volume effects had a positive impact on costs of 
msek 4,814. lower jet-fuel prices had a positive cost 
impact of msek 686. hedge effects had a negative 
impact of msek 1,456 year-on-year, of which msek 
1,370 related to hedge relationships that have been 
discontinued as they have ceased to meet the qualifica-
tion criteria. the effect on accruals was msek 2.
air traffic charges amounted to msek -1,872 (-4,194). 
adjusted for currency, air traffic charges decreased 
54.6%. the decrease pertained mainly to lower traffic 
volumes and reduced traffic charges during the covid-
19 pandemic.
other external expenses amounted to msek -7,782 
(-19,324), see note 4. as a result of ifrs 16 being 
implemented on 1 november 2019, lease expenses for 
aircraft are included in other external expenses. fuel 
expenses and air traffic charges are no longer included 
and are instead presented as separate line items in the 
income statement. the comparative year has also been 
reclassified. for detailed information on the changes, 
see note 1.
year-on-year, other external expenses (currency-ad-
justed) decreased msek 10,914. the decrease per-
tained mainly to lease expenses for aircraft, properties 
and ground handling equipment that, following the 
adoption of ifrs 16, are no longer recognized as other 
external expenses, with the exception of short-term 
leases. other year-on-year changes pertained mainly 
to a decrease in costs for handling, selling and distri-
bution, and technical maintenance. currency-adjusted 
handling costs, and selling and distribution costs 
decreased msek 1,376 and msek 1,378 respectively, 
mainly related to lower volumes. technical mainte-
nance costs (currency-adjusted) decreased msek 
1,037, relating to the covid-19 pandemic and the 
introduction and delivery of new aircraft which require 
less maintenance. wet-lease expenses decreased 
msek 568 (currency-adjusted) primarily due to lower 
demand due to covid-19.

depreciation, amortization and impairment amounted 
to msek -6,822 (-1,924), an increase of msek 4,898 
year-on-year. the increase mainly related to impair-
ment of aircraft (owned and rou assets) of msek 
1,210 and the adoption of ifrs 16, where depreciation 
of right-of-use assets had a negative impact of msek 
3,647, see notes 1 and 5.
financial income and expenses amounted to net msek 
-602 (-372), representing an increase in net expenses 
of msek 230 year-on-year. the increase pertained 
mainly to a higher net interest expense. the impact 
of the adoption of ifrs 16 was net msek 39, where 
currency revaluations on lease liabilities had a positive 
impact of msek 730. interest expenses on lease liabili-
ties had a negative impact of msek 691, see note 8.
net income for the year was msek -9,275 (621) and 
income tax amounted to msek 876 (-173). income tax 
for the year was largely attributable to temporary differ-
ences in fixed assets and capitalized loss carryforwards 
that primarily arose in the first quarter.
impact from ifrs 16
the adoption of ifrs 16 had a positive impact of 
msek 261 on income before tax (ebt) in the fiscal 
year. the expenses impacted in the income statement 
are operating expenses, depreciation and the financial 
net.
operating expenses were positively impacted by an 
amount of msek 4,039, since lease expenses for air-
craft, properties and ground handling equipment are 
no longer recognized in profit or loss. depreciation 
and impairment of right-of-use assets had a negative 
impact of msek 3,817 and the financial net was posi-
tively impacted by a net amount of msek 39, relating 
to positive currency revaluations of msek 730 and 
interest expenses of msek 691. for more information 
regarding the impact of ifrs 16, see note 1.

related to impairment of right-of-use aircraft. msek 
-324 (-230) related to restructuring costs for person-
nel and msek 2 (112) pertained to a capital loss from 
aircraft sales of msek -1 (112) and a gain from facility 
sales of msek 3 (0). the other items affecting compa-
rability last year related to a contractual settlement, a 
release of a fiscal-related provision for indirect taxes

employees.
balance sheet and financial position
assets
intangible and tangible fixed assets increased msek 
3,149 since 31 october 2019. changes included 
investments of msek 7,618, amortization, depreciation 
and impairment of msek -3,005 and other effects of 
msek -1,464. the amount for investments included 
three new airbus a320neo and four new airbus a350 
aircraft. other aircraft investments comprised capital-
ized expenditures for engine maintenance, modifica-
tions and advance payments to airbus. other effects 
included capitalized interest on prepayments and 
translation differences.
right-of-use assets increased msek 546 during the 
year. the transition impact on 1 november 2019 was 
msek 16,718. the increase of msek 546 did not 
include the transition impact. investments amounted 
to msek 3,742, mainly related to new aircraft lease 
agreements. changes in indexation and modification in 
underlying agreements increased the asset by msek 
649, and depreciation and impairment was msek 
-3,817. currency effects amounted to msek -28. for 
more information, see note 1.
financial assets increased msek 1,517, mainly due to 
an increase in restricted accounts and a net increase in 
sas’ defined-benefit pension plans.
deferred tax assets increased msek 890, mainly 
related to temporary differences in fixed assets and 
capitalized loss carryforwards that primarily arose in 
the first quarter.
current receivables decreased msek 1,031. this 
decrease was mainly attributable to lower accounts 
receivable.

at 31 october 2020. unutilized contracted credit facil-
ities amounted to msek 2,751 (2,899). financial pre-
paredness amounted to 67% (38) of sas’ fixed costs.
 
shareholders’ equity and liabilities
shareholders’ equity increased msek 5,118 to msek 
10,490. the increase pertained mainly to the recapi-
talization of msek 14,250, net income for the year of 
msek -9,275, changes in cash-flow hedges of msek 
-168 and the positive actuarial effect on defined-benefit 
pension plans of msek 752.
new hybrid bonds were issued in october 2020 to 
the governments of denmark and sweden for a total 
amount of msek 6,000. through the recapitalization 
plan, sas converted msek 1,500 in hybrid bonds to 
shares and msek 2,250 in bonds to equity, of which 
msek 1,615 was converted to a hybrid bond and the 
remaining debt to shares. 
non-current liabilities increased msek 14,795 and 
current liabilities increased msek 3,508 including 
the impact of ifrs 16. the total increase in liabilities 
excluding the transition effect of ifrs 16 was msek 
1,623 and was mainly due to higher interest-bearing 
liabilities. non-interest-bearing liabilities decreased 
msek 2,010 mainly due to a lower unearned trans-
portation liability. for more information regarding the 
impact of ifrs 16, see note 1.
interest-bearing liabilities
on 31 october 2020, interest-bearing liabilities 
amounted to msek 31,596, up msek 20,313 since 31 
october 2019, of which the transition effect of ifrs 16 
was msek 16,503.
new loans and amortization were msek 11,210 and 
msek 4,520 respectively. new loans and amortiza-
tion of lease liabilities were msek 4,385 and msek 
3,082 respectively. the change in gross debt since 31 
october 2019 included the bond conversion of msek 
2,250 and a negative change in the fair value of deriv-
atives, which increased liabilities msek 33. currency 
revaluations decreased liabilities msek 2,207, and 
accrued interest and other items increased liabilities 
msek 241. 
current interest-bearing liabilities excluding lease 
liabilities amounted to msek 3,773 (1,833) of the inter-
est-bearing liabilities and comprised borrowings that 
mature within one year of msek 2,708 and accrued 
interest and financial derivatives of msek 1,065. non-
current liabilities excluding lease liabilities totaled 
msek 11,219 (9,450) and consisted of subordinated 
loans, bonds and other loans. 
the average fixed-interest period for gross financial 
debt is governed by sas’ financial policy and has a 
target tenor of 3 years. the average fixed-interest 
period including the hybrid bonds was 2.9 years as of 
october 2020.

key ratios
ifrs 16 has a significant impact on the income state-
ment and balance sheet. following sas’ transition 
approach, financial reporting published by sas during 
fy 2020 does not include restated comparative infor-
mation for fy 2019.
at 31 october 2020, the return on invested capital 
(roic) was -27%, down 35 percentage points since 31 
october 2019. the decrease was mainly due to a lower 
ebit.
financial preparedness was 67% at the end of this year. 
a high cash position and lower fixed costs were the 
underlying factors behind the increased key ratio.
the financial net debt/ebitda ratio changed to a mul-
tiple of -9.2 at 31 october 2020. on 31 october 2019, 
the multiple was 3.7. the decrease related both to 
increased average financial net debt and lower ebitda.
at 31 october 2020, the equity/assets ratio was 18%, 
up from 16% at 31 october 2019. the increase in 
equity and the adoption of ifrs 16 had a significant 
impact on the key ratio.
credit rating
sas is rated by three credit-rating agencies: moody’s, 
standard and poor’s and the japanese agency, rating 
and investment information inc. (r&i).

the covid-19 pandemic and its spread have adversely 
impacted many airlines’ credit ratings, sas included. 
the rating agencies, moody’s and standard & poor’s 
needed to gradually downgrade their respective ratings 
for sas to caa2 and sd respectively before raising 
these ratings to b3 and b- respectively following the 
completed recapitalization.
financial targets and dividend policy
the overriding financial goal for sas is to create share-
holder value. to reach this goal, sas works with its cus-
tomer offering, efficiency enhancements and sustain-
ability to provide the basis for long-term sustainable 
profitability.
sas operates in a capital-intensive industry that 
requires optimization of the capital structure. for this 
reason, sas has three financial targets:
the sas financial targets are:
•  return on invested capital (roic) to exceed the post-
tax weighted average cost of capital (wacc) over a 
business cycle
•  financial net debt/ebitda to be a multiple of less 
than three and a half (3.5x)
•  financial preparedness: cash and cash equivalents 
and available credit facilities must exceed 25% of sas 
annual fixed costs. 
the roic target corresponds with the capital markets’ 
and sas’ internal assessment of sas’ weighted aver-
age cost of capital (wacc). this is also linked to sas’ 
dividend policy for holders of common shares, which 
stipulates that dividends can first be paid when value is 
created through sas’ roic exceeding its wacc.
leverage target – financial net debt/ebitda is a key 
ratio used by credit rating agencies and banks for 
assessing creditworthiness and includes the value of 
leased aircraft. the aim of maintaining a ratio with a 
multiple of less than three and a half (3.5x) is aligned 
with sas’ ambition of improving the financial position 
and credit rating, and thereby lowering financing costs.
the financial preparedness target is 25% of annual 
fixed costs. normally, this covers sas’ unearned trans-
portation liability and also meets regulatory require-
ments regarding liquidity.

dividend policy
sas’ overriding goal is to create shareholder value. 
dividends require a resolution by a shareholders’ 
meeting, and that sas ab has distributable earnings. 
dividends to holders of common shares can only be 
distributed when value is created through sas’ roic 
exceeding its wacc. the group’s financial position, earn-
ings, expected performance, investment requirements 
and relevant economic conditions should also be taken 
into account. the dividend should take into account any 
restrictions applying to the group’s right to distribute div-
idends to shareholders1). the dividend policy endeavors 
to achieve long-term sustainable dividends.
parent company
the parent company sas ab conducts extremely 
limited intra-group services.  revenue totaled msek 
49 (58) and operating expenses msek -73 (-80). net 
financial items amounted to msek -1,070 (-55) and net 
income for the year was msek -1,099 (-56). net financial 
items comprised a write down of shares in subsidiaries 
of msek 1,017.  the risks described in the report by the 
board of directors also encompass the parent company.
financing and capital management 
financing
sas can use bank loans, capital market products, 
export credits and leasing as sources of financing. new 
loans raised during the fiscal year amounted to msek 
11,210 (2,364) and comprised aircraft financing of 
msek 7,848, a revolving credit facility of msek 3,333 
and other borrowings of msek 29. in connection with 
aircraft transactions, the financing method is a very 
important factor that is taken into account together 
with residual value risks and financing costs. 
aircraft fleet 
sas has simplified its aircraft fleet considerably over 
the last few years; today, it has three aircraft fami-
lies under sas’ own traffic license. the aircraft fleet 
consists of boeing 737 ng, the airbus a320 family 
and airbus a330/350 aircraft. in addition, sas wet-
leases 32 aircraft through strategic business partners. 
in 2013, sas ordered eight airbus a350 aircraft for 
delivery in the 2019–2021 period. in june 2011, sas 
placed an order for 30 airbus a320neo aircraft with 
delivery from 2016 to 2019. in april 2018, sas ordered 
50 additional airbus a320neo aircraft with delivery 
from spring 2019 through 2023. the order means that 
for the first time, sas will have a single-type fleet for 
short- and medium-haul routes by 2023 that consists 
of the market’s most efficient short- and medium-haul 
aircraft in terms of cost and fuel economy. 
the aircraft fleet is sas’ largest tangible asset. sas 
depreciates directly-owned aircraft over 20 years utiliz-
ing a residual value of 10%, excluding aircraft engines. 
aircraft engines are depreciated over around eight 
years. maintenance of leased aircraft is set off on an 
ongoing basis related to use, whereas maintenance of 
owned aircraft is capitalized and depreciated. passenger 
aircraft are generally used for 20 to 25 years in commer-
cial passenger traffic but aircraft that are well maintained 
can operate for substantially longer periods. there are 
still items of value in an aircraft after it has been taken 
out of service, for example engines and spare parts. 
financing of aircraft orders
due to covid-19, sas has agreed with airbus to post-
pone some of the deliveries. delivery of eight a320neo 
aircraft has been postponed from 2024 to 2025 and 
delivery of two a350-900 aircraft has been postponed 
from 2021 to 2022. at 31 october 2020, sas had air-
craft orders for 39 airbus a320neo, two a321lr and 
four airbus a350-900 aircraft for delivery up through 
2025. in financing aircraft, sas uses a combination of 
leases and secured bank loans and credit facilities. sas 
aims to maintain a balance between owned and leased 
aircraft based on a cost, risk and flexibility perspective. 
the overall intention is to over time have about half of the 
fleet on operating leases. sas intends to utilize a mix of 
bank loans, leases and bank facilities to finance owned 
aircraft. when leasing, which can be conducted via sale 
and leaseback agreements, aircraft are sold on delivery 
and leased back over an eight- to 12-year period. 
of the remaining order for 39 airbus a320neo aircraft, 
sas has financed six aircraft through operating leases. 
a further two a321lr aircraft will be delivered under 
leases in 2021. in addition, sas has begun arranging 
finance for the two a350 aircraft with delivery in 2021.
1)  over the fiscal year, sas has received various forms of covid-19 pandemic-related state 
aid, which are conditional on sas not distributing funds to shareholders. the european 
commission’s approval of the aid encompassed by sas’ recapitalization plan includes, 
inter alia, such a prohibition on distributing dividends to shareholders, which ceases to 
apply once the instruments signed by the states under sas’ recapitalization plan have 
been fully redeemed or sold.

financing of pre-delivery payments for aircraft
airlines make prepayments before delivery. in addi-
tion to payment in conjunction with placing the order, 
pre-delivery payments (pdps) normally commence 
when production of the aircraft starts about two years 
prior to delivery. sas continuously evaluates possibili-
ties for external financing of pdps. 
through a combination of ownership, and operational 
and wet-leased aircraft, the aim is to have high flexibil-
ity regarding the return of aircraft. this is important, as 
the airline industry is exposed to several macro-eco-
nomic events that could rapidly have a negative effect 
on demand. sas has 19 aircraft on operating leases that 
could be returned to the owners over the next two years. 
seasonal effects and cash-flow optimization
sas analyzes balance-sheet items and operating trends 
to optimize cash flow with the aim of attaining the 
lowest possible funding cost within the framework of

sas annual and sustainability report, fiscal year 2020
sas’ financial policy. as a result of operating liabilities 
exceeding current assets, working capital amounted to 
msek -11,208 (-13,313) at 31 october 2020, repre-
senting a year-on-year decline of msek 2,105.
cash flow from operating activities in fy20 amounted 
to msek -5,111 (3,318). the substantial year-on-year 
deterioration was due to the extensive negative effects 
of covid-19. cash flow from operating activities follows 
clear seasonal trends. cash flow is strongest in the 
second and fourth quarters, which coincides with high 
passenger volumes and a higher proportion of advance 
bookings. the share of advance bookings is highest in 
the january to may period ahead of the holiday period 
and in the september to october period. since passen-
ger revenue is recognized when sas or another airline 
provides the transportation, this means that seasonal 
variations impact cash flow and earnings differently. 
accordingly, earnings are strongest in the third and 
fourth quarters (may to july and august to october), 
which is when traffic volumes are highest. 
sustainability report
in accordance with the swedish annual accounts act, 
sas has prepared a statutory sustainability report, 
which has been incorporated into the annual and 
sustainability report 2020, separate from the report 
by the board of directors, on pages 116–137. the 
auditor’s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability 
report is included on pages 138–139.
legal issues
the european commission’s decision in november 
2010 found sas and many other airlines guilty of 
alleged participation in a global air cargo cartel in the 
1999–2006 period and ordered sas to pay a fine
of meur 70.2. sas appealed the decision in january 
2011 and in december 2015, the court of justice of 
the european union (cjeu) annulled the european 
commission’s decision including the meur 70.2 fine. 
the cjeu’s ruling entered into force and the meur 70.2
fine was repaid to sas at the beginning of march 2016. 
the european commission took a new decision on the 
same issue in march 2017 and again imposed fines on 
sas and many other airlines for alleged participation in a 
global air cargo cartel in the 1999–2006 period. the fine 
of meur 70.2 was the same as that imposed under
the 2010 decision. sas has appealed the european 
commission’s decision and a hearing was held in cjeu 
in july 2019. judgement is expected in 2020 or 2021.
as a consequence of the european commission’s deci-
sion in the cargo investigation in november 2010 and 
the renewal of that decision in march 2017, sas and 
other airlines fined by the commission are involved in 
various civil lawsuits initiated by cargo customers in
countries including the netherlands and norway. sas 
contests its responsibility in all these legal processes. 
unfavorable outcomes in these disputes could have a 
significantly negative financial impact on sas. further 
lawsuits by cargo customers cannot be ruled
out. no provisions have been made.
a large number of former cabin crew of sas in 
denmark are pursuing a class action against sas at a 
danish court, demanding additional payments from 
sas to the pension improvements fund for cabin 
crew (the cau fund) citing that the cau fund is a 
defined-benefit supplementary plan. the city court 
of copenhagen, in a judgment in december 2016, 
rejected the cabin crew’s demand for further
payments into the cau fund by sas. the cabin crew 
appealed the judgment in january 2017 and court pro-
ceedingstook place in early november 2020.
following the sas pilot strike in april–may 2019, 
affected passengers turned to sas for standard-
ized compensation under the flight compensation 
regulation (eu 261/2004). sas disputed its liability 
to compensate the passengers with reference to the 
strike being an extraordinary circumstance. in august 
2019, the swedish national board for consumer 
disputes (allmänna reklamationsnämnden) ruled 
in favor of sas. the same assessment was made 
by the norwegian travel complaint handling body 
(transportklagenemnda) in october 2019. this not-
withstanding, a number of passengers and claim firms 
have brought claims against sas in national courts in 
several eu member states. in august 2019, a claim firm 
representing a large number of affected passengers 
initiated court proceedings in denmark and sweden 
against sas, asking the courts to request a preliminary 
ruling from the cjeu on whether the strike was an 
extraordinary circumstance. the district court in 
sweden referred the question to the cjeu in january 
2020. the hearing in the cjeu took place in december 
2020. the proceedings in the cjeu could take several 
years and if the cjeu rules against sas, sas could be 
liable to pay compensation to passengers affected by 
the strike.

the underlying objective of risk management is to 
create the optimal preconditions for growing value 
for shareholders and other stakeholders. all organi-
zations are exposed to risks and uncertainties, which 
entail both risks and opportunities. sas is exposed to 
a large number of general and more company-specific 
risks that can impact operations both negatively and 
positively. 
risk management at sas is about positioning sas in 
relation to, known and unknown, possible events with 
the aim of minimizing the potential negative effects 
should an unexpected event occur. overall risks are 
monitored and identified centrally and followed-up 
through policies that aim to control the risks. flight 
safety is always top priority at sas. 
value is maximized for shareholders and other stake-
holders in sas, when strategies, goals and their 
strategic priorities are set to ensure an optimal balance 
is reached in terms of growth, profitability and their 
related risks, as well as that resources are used effi-
ciently and sustainably. accordingly, risk management 
and risk assessment are of fundamental importance for 
ensuring sas’ long-term sustainable profitability.
1. market risks
1.1 macro-economic trend
demand in the airline industry is correlated to trends 
for economic growth and exports. sas’ primary oper-
ations are located in scandinavia and about 70% of 
passenger revenue stems from scandinavia. no single 
country accounts for more than 30% of sas’ passen-
ger revenue, which limits sas’ exposure to individual 
countries. as a region, however, demand in scandinavia 
is crucial for sas. according to the oecd, the corona-
virus pandemic is expected to lead led to substantial 
declines in real gdp, 3.2% in norway, 3.9% in denmark 
and 3.2% in sweden during 2020. the negative trend, 
in combination with travel restrictions, leads to a sub-
stantial negative impact on demand for flights. 
to meet this risk, sas is adapting its operations as far 
as possible to align with current demand, in terms of 
staffing, aircraft in service and other operations.
1.2 market and competition trends
the airline industry is subject to intense competi-
tion from new companies that enter the market and 
existing airlines that can easily reprioritize capacity to 
scandinavia. changed customer behavior, and increas-
ing numbers of low cost carriers and existing airlines 
moving capacity to sas’ home market, may lead to 
intensifying competition. 
to meet, and prepare itself in relation to changed com-
petition, sas is streamlining its production platforms 
and differentiating the product offering with the aim of 
strengthening competitiveness.

2. employee risks
2.1 right skills
the covid-19 pandemic has placed the airline indus-
try in a vulnerable position. like other airlines, sas has 
been forced to make extensive use of temporary lay-
offs and substantially reduce its workforce during the 
year. despite the uncertain times, the challenge moving 
forward is to maintain high engagement internally and 
to retain competent employees that are critical to the 
successful operation of the business.
given the prevailing conditions for the company and the 
airline industry, there is a risk that sas will be unable 
to retain key personnel or recruit new employees with 
appropriate skills at a reasonable or competitive cost. 
furthermore, the airline industry as a whole and sas 
in particular are undergoing major structural changes, 
which set new requirements and challenges for sas 
and its compiled competence. to manage the above, 
sas runs regular employee and leadership programs 
based on its own employee and manager models, and 
works continuously with the succession order.

2.2 engagement
sas’ operates in a highly competitive market where it 
is essential to have the right capabilities throughout the 
business, and every individual at sas has an important 
role to play. it is also essential that sas provides oppor-
tunities for employees to grow and develop together 
with sas. 
sas’ employee culture is distinguished by strong 
engagement in and loyalty to sas and its customers. 
sas wants to create a company with an even stronger 
culture that focuses on customer experience, cost effi-
ciency and cross functional collaboration. sas achieves 
this through involvement and dialogue to ensure that all 
employees know how they contribute to sas’ goals and 
the shared successes.
sas continuously measures employee engagement 
and motivation. the system enables sas to check 
employee engagement on an ongoing basis. sas can 
clearly see how business-strategic decisions and oper-
ational challenges affect employees differently, and can 
thus implement the correct improvement measures 
more quickly.
sas also uses clear targets and employee influence 
in performance development, which aims to develop 
employee engagement and future leaders, and to boost 
sas’ continued attractiveness as an employer.
2.3 processes and systems
sas uses systems and processes for efficient person-
nel management and to support securing skills needs 
and the succession order. sas is gradually implement-
ing lean principles in its processes with clear action 
plans based on shared targets, which are categorized 
under sqdec (safety, quality, delivery, employees and 
cost), and which can be followed up across the entire 
operations. sas conducts a yearly analysis of internal 
skills with the aim of leveraging the greatest talents and 
making adjustments where improvements are needed. 
during the year, a new people platform was launched 
to support leaders with the task of developing and 
securing the company’s skills needs moving forward.
2.4 conflicts
historically, the airline industry has been severely 
affected by labor market disputes. through transparent 
and open dialogue with all labor unions and groups of 
employees, sas endeavors to increase understanding 
of the shared challenges and the need to secure more 
efficient operations and, thereby, a safe and stimulating 
work environment.
3. operating risks
3.1 incidents and accidents
safety work at sas has top priority. sas’ safety culture 
builds on the foundation comprised by the values, 
skills and experience of all employees throughout the 
organization.
the safety culture entails continuously striving to 
increase or improve safety by encouraging sas 
employees to actively learn, adapt and modify individ-
ual and organizational behavior to reduce exposure to 
risk.
sas’ management is well versed in the safety efforts at 
sas and is involved in daily safety activities. 
sas has a safety policy that is documented, communi-
cated and implemented in its operations.
sas has a longstanding and well-implemented safety 
management system (sms), which has received regu-
latory approval. sas also meets iata’s safety standard, 
iosa – iata operational safety audit, which certifies 
that operations meet the most stringent flight safety 
regulations in the market.
flight safety continues to be extremely high on a global 
basis and, statistically, the risk of an accident is very 
low. however, the aim of flight safety efforts is not 
to remain at these low percentages; it is to keep the 
total number of accidents at the same level despite an 
expected doubling in air travel until 2035.
historically, safety efforts have been based on minimiz-
ing the risk of a previous event recurring, by learning 
from previous incidents and accidents, and through 
conducting diligent investigations and analyses of inci-
dents and accidents to minimize the risk of recurrence. 
in addition to more traditional methods of preventing 
accidents and incidents through reactive measures 
to prevent recurrence, sas also has a modern safety 
management system (sms) that is also based on ana-
lyzing trends to thereby identify safety issues before 
they result in an incident or accident. the identification 
of potential incidents and accidents is one method of 
working proactively with flight safety. the work also 
entails learning from the risks at other departments, 
other airlines, etc., and implementing processes and 
procedures to ensure that serious accidents and inci-
dents do not occur.
the sms provides sas with the possibility of acting 
more proactively with its safety efforts, prioritiz-
ing effectively and ensuring the entire organization

sas annual and sustainability report, fiscal year 2020
promotes passengers’, employees’ and the company’s 
safety.
all of the operating platforms used by sas are required 
to be iosa certified and hold a european traffic license. 
to ensure corresponding safety levels at the wet-lease 
companies that together with our own flight operations 
comprise the operational platforms, sas has set the 
following requirements:
•  prior to contract, the operator’s safety efforts are 
analyzed;
•  monthly safety summaries and continuous deviation 
reports are sent regularly to sas management; 
• safety follow-up meetings are held quarterly;
•  sas conducts inspection flights and performs obser-
vations in simulator training sessions;
• annual audits are carried out by sas; and
•  together with our business partners, seminars are 
conducted that showcase separate areas and share 
sas’ experience.
sas only initiates code-share collaboration with other 
airlines that have iosa certification or that have sub-
mitted to a comparable audit.
safety activities and risk levels in fiscal year 2020
in fiscal year 2020, sas has continuously monitored 
and measured daily risk levels in flight operations, 
ground operations, technical maintenance and aviation 
security in a hierarchical system of objective safety per-
formance indicators.
to aid follow-up of flight safety on a departmental basis 
and for the various operational platforms, sas uses an 
operational flight safety tool known as enplore. this 
tool has improved the capacity for identifying trends 
and correlations, which in turn leads to sas dealing 
more proactively with safety-related risks.
the trend was stable during fy 2020, and the number 
of medium-level events in relation to the number of 
flights was on a par with preceding years.

low: events that occurred where the remaining safety margin was extremely effective. nor-
mal monitoring is the only action required. 
medium: events that occurred where the remaining safety margin was limited. risk evalua-
tion plus appropriate actions were adopted for continued operations. 
high: events that occurred where the safety margins were minimal or ineffective. this 
group includes more serious events (such as engine failure during takeoff). such incidents 
must be investigated immediately to identify whether they are isolated incidents and do not 
affect continued airline operations.
3.2 suppliers
dependence on external suppliers across all opera-
tions is increasing in pace with changes in the airline 
industry and development of the operating model 
at sas. this applies equally to operations such as 
ground handling and wet-leasing, and to administrative 
functions such as customer service and accounting. 
sas conducts continual reviews of its supplier base, 
identifying the most operation-critical suppliers. sas 
has an established steering model that clarifies respon-
sibilities, risks and areas for improvement, as well as 
how any deviations should be managed. responsibility 
for ongoing follow-up of critical suppliers has been 
centralized and standardized. all suppliers to sas must 
meet requirements for sustainability and social respon-
sibility in line with sas’ supplier code of conduct. this 
is checked during procurement.
3.3 competitive costs and efficiency
for profitable long-term operations, sas must have a 
competitive cost structure and be highly efficient. sas 
therefore implemented major structural cost-reducing 
measures and realized efficiency enhancements of sek 
6.7 billion between 2013 and 2019. in fiscal year 2020, 
sas launched a new efficiency program of sek 4.0 bil-
lion to be implemented during 2020–2022 to thereby 
adapt costs in line with the expected lower demand in 
the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. once the mea-
sures have been implemented, sas will be a more flex-
ible and productive airline. however, sas will continue 
to implement further efficiency measures beyond 2022 
and the aircraft order that will create a single-type fleet 
by 2023 will provide further opportunities for sas to 
enhance its operational efficiency. 
4. sustainability risks
sas has integrated its sustainability work into its man-
agement system, which has structured processes for 
mitigating and managing all risks and possibilities in 
the field of sustainability. 
4.1 environmental directives and requirements
different laws and regulations impose requirements for 
reduced climate and environmental impact, including 
through restrictions on noise levels and greenhouse 
gas emissions. all laws and regulations in the field of 
the environment and the climate are handled by sas’ 
management system which, as regards the environ-
ment, is iso 14001:2015 certified.

sas annual and sustainability report, fiscal year 2020
sas works continuously on sustainability issues to 
ensure compliance with national and international 
requirements. sas measures factors such as its 
eco-efficiency by measuring total and relative carbon 
emissions. the long-term reduction in emissions is 
based on the renewal of the aircraft fleet, ongoing effi-
ciency efforts and the increased blend-in of biofuel. 
4.2 anticorruption
during the year, sas conducted a number of activities 
to prevent potential risks that may exist. this includes, 
for example, training programs for prioritized employee 
groups and control measures aimed at addressing the 
requirement that all employees observe the sas code 
of conduct as well as applicable laws. 
4.3 human rights
sas is a major purchaser of products and services 
from a large number of subcontractors. sas affiliates 
itself with the un global compact, placing a number 
of requirements that all subcontractors share sas’ 
perception and requirements regarding human rights, 
for example. sas requires that employees at subcon-
tractors have proper market-based employment terms 
and the right to organize into unions. sas prioritizes 
subcontractors that share the basic principles of the 
un global compact. 
5. legal and political risks 
5.1 political and regulatory risks
sas and the airline industry in general are exposed to 
various types of political and regulatory decisions, in 
our home markets and abroad, that can significantly 
impact operations and sas’ economy both posi-
tively and negatively. sas monitors developments in 
the political arena and, through active dialogue and 
negotiations with public agencies and organizations, 
strives to influence development both individually and 
through national and international industry bodies. 
aviation taxes and infrastructure fees 
some countries have introduced national excise taxes 
on air travel. while the taxes are often called environ-
mental taxes, they have no connection with any cli-
mate-impacting emissions and provide no channeling 
effect. sas has exacting climate ambitions and goals, 
and acts at an international level to promote a global 
emissions cost that does not distort competition, or 
adversely impact the economy or defer real solutions to 
some future time. 
increased charges linked to airport infrastructure, air 
traffic control and safety negatively impact profitabil-
ity. the capacity of our suppliers to adapt in the short 
term to lower production in combination with financial 
support from the owners is critical if airlines and the 
aviation industry as a whole are to avoid further impact.
brexit
on 24 december 2020, the european commission and 
the uk government signed a new trade and coopera-
tion agreement. the agreement applies from 1 january 
2021. the new conditions affect companies with opera-
tions and interests in the uk market.
the new agreement also includes an air traffic agree-
ment that ensures that air transport between the eu 
and the uk will continue as before. the agreement will 
undergo legal review and translation into the languages 
of the member states during the first months of 2021.  
minor details will be adjusted during this process and 
sas is monitoring developments and adapting its pro-
cedures and administration to fit. 
5.2 fraud and other crime 
sas may be exposed to crimes that can have both an 
economic and intangible impact. a substantial portion 
of sas’ ticket sales are conducted online using credit 
cards, which entails a risk of credit card fraud and other 
cybercrimes. if credit card details and other personal 
information pertaining to sas’ customers should fall 
into the wrong hands as a result of, for example, hack-
ing in conjunction with ticket sales, there is a risk that 
this could harm customer confidence in sas. moreover, 
there is a risk that payments are made for sas tick-
ets with credit cards that have been acquired through 
fraud or other criminal means, which entail that sas is 
held liable to repay such payments to the cardholder or 
credit card company. 
sas analyzes these risks on an ongoing basis and 
ensures that internal controls and procedures are in 
place to identify and prevent potential crime and fraud.
5.3 legal and insurance risks
sas flies and operates in many different countries, 
which means that sas has to comply with a large 
number of laws and regulations. the breadth of 
sas’ operations and the large number of contractual 
relations mean that sas is, and may be in the future, 
involved in legal processes and arbitration proce-
dures as either plaintiff or defendant. sas may also 
be exposed to crimes that can have both an economic 
and intangible impact. at 31 october 2020, sas was 
involved in a number of legal processes, the most 
important of which are described in more detail on 
page 38.

sas annual and sustainability report, fiscal year 2020
sas’ legal division ensures compliance with relevant 
laws and rules, conducts training and establishes 
internal policies, processes and rules including the 
sas code of conduct, which establishes what ethi-
cal rules and guidelines all employees in sas are to 
observe. sas continuously monitors how changes in 
laws and regulations impact operations at sas and 
implements new or updated procedures, guidelines, 
etc. contractual risks in relation to external parties are 
minimized through legal counseling and participation 
in contractual processes. sas has insurance cover for 
its operations and personnel to protect the company 
financially from unforeseen events and risks. 
6. financial risks
sas is exposed to various types of financial risks. all 
risk management is performed centrally pursuant to 
the financial policy adopted by the board. 
financial risks pertaining to changes in exchange 
rates, interest rates and fuel prices, are hedged with 
derivatives, which aim to counter short-term negative 
fluctuations and provide scope for adapting operations 
to longer-term changes in levels. another aim of sas’ 
hedging strategy is to enable sas to act quickly when 
changes in exchange rates, interest rates and fuel 
prices are advantageous. more information is available 
in note 26. 
6.1 liquidity risk and refinancing
the cash flow from sas’ airline operations follows clear 
seasonal trends. since passenger revenue is recog-
nized when sas or another airline provides the trans-
portation, this means that seasonal variations impact 
cash flow and earnings differently. sas also has several 
different financial instruments issued, as well as 72 
aircraft on operating leases and 32 aircraft on wet lease 
contracts that are continually maturing. 
the target is a financial preparedness of at least 25% 
of fixed costs. sas prepares a rolling liquidity forecast 
that is used as a basis to ensure that financial pre-
paredness is maintained and to identify refinancing 
needs. sas uses bank loans, bonds, subordinated 
loans, hybrid bonds and leasing as sources of funding. 
sas is in continual discussion with banks and finan-
ciers regarding refinancing of sas’ loan and leas-
ing maturities. as a result of covid-19, financial 
preparedness was negatively impacted in the fiscal 
year. however, despite the above, the recapitalization 
initiative completed at the end of the fiscal year contrib-
uted to a positive development for the key ratio during 
the year. at 31 october 2020, financial preparedness 
amounted to 67% (38).
6.2 exchange rates
transaction risk arises from exchange-rate changes 
that impact the size of commercial revenue and costs 
and thus sas’ operating income. as a consequence of 
aircraft and jet fuel being priced in usd and of interna-
tional operations, sas is considerably exposed to price 
changes in several currencies. the usd is sas’ great-
est deficit currency, and nok is sas’ greatest surplus 
currency. 
in fiscal year 2020, the sek strengthened 7% against 
the usd, which was largely attributable to the shrink-
ing difference between the fed’s and the riksbank’s 
key interest rates.  however, the exchange rate fluctu-
ated widely over the year and had a net negative impact 
on sas’ revenue and costs of msek -30 (-1,060), 
excluding the revaluation effects of lease liabilities. 
norges bank, the central bank of norway, has also low-
ered the interest rate, thereby narrowing the rate gap 
to the riksbank’s policy rate, which largely explains the 
11% strengthening in the sek against the nok. over 
the year, the sek/nok exchange rate had a net neg-
ative effect on sas’ revenue and costs of msek -545 
(81).
currency exposure is managed through continuously 
hedging 40–80% of sas’ surplus and deficit curren-
cies based on a 12-month rolling liquidity forecast. 
by hedging the usd and nok, sas has postponed the 
negative effects of the exchange-rate changes. 
the exchange-rate trend had a negative impact on 
sas’ revenue of msek 1,008 as well as a positive effect 
on operating expenses of msek 404 in fy 2020. the 
change from translation of working capital and cur-
rency hedges amounted to msek 531.  the restate-
ment of financial items amounted to msek 737. the net 
effect on sas’ income before tax from the changes in 
the exchange rates and the effects from hedging were 
positive, with msek 664 (-593).
at 31 october 2020, sas’ hedging ratio totaled 40% 
of its anticipated usd deficit for fy 2021. in terms of 
the nok, 45% of the anticipated surplus for the next 
12 months was hedged. hedging is mainly performed 
through currency forward contracts to prevent earn-
ings-related revaluation effects pertaining to financial 
assets and liabilities. sas’ usd denominated loans are 
hedged against the sek to reduce currency risk in the 
loan portfolio.

currency risk for aircraft investments
sas uses currency forwards to hedge part of the order 
value for aircraft it has on order to limit the currency 
risk. any currency forwards outstanding are terminated 
on delivery under leases, both operating leases and 
jolco (japanese leases with purchasing options). sas 
has currency hedged a portion (four) of its remaining 
aircraft order for eight airbus a350 aircraft.  
6.3 interest rates
the airline industry is capital-intensive and on the 
closing date, sas had msek 14,992 (11,283) in inter-
est-bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities, which 
exposes sas to interest-rate changes. 
financial policy at sas regulates the proportion 
between floating and fixed-interest rates with the 
objective that gross financial debt has a tenor of three 
years with a permitted interval of 1–5 years. the 
average fixed-interest period for gross financial debt, 
including the hybrid bonds, was 2.9 years (3.2) as of 
october 2020. 
6.4 jet-fuel price and emission rights
jet-fuel price
jet-fuel costs comprise the single largest expense item 
for sas and in fiscal year 2020 amounted to around 
19% (21) of sas’ operating expenses (including leases, 
depreciation and amortization). sas hedges jet-fuel 
costs to counter short-term negative fluctuations. 
sas’ policy for jet-fuel hedging states that jet fuel 
should be hedged at an interval of 40–80% of antici-
pated volumes for the coming 12 months. the policy 
also allows hedging of up to 50% of the anticipated 
volumes for the period, 13–18 months. under the cur-
rent uncertain and volatile market conditions sas may 
come to deviate from the policy. 
in fy 2020, market prices for jet fuel were on average 
34% lower than the preceding fiscal year. at the start 
of the fiscal year, the jet-fuel price was about usd 
620/tonne but fell drastically in march down to usd 
180/tonne in may, as a result of covid-19. at the end 
of fiscal year, the jet-fuel price closed at usd 320/
tonne. the lower jet-fuel price meant that jet-fuel costs, 
adjusted for currency and volume effects, decreased 
msek 686 or by 7% of the total jet-fuel costs year-on-
year. hedge effects had a negative impact of msek 
1,456 year-on-year, of which msek 1,370 related to 
hedge relationships that have been discontinued as 
they have ceased to meet the qualification criteria.
ahead of fiscal year 2021, sas has hedged 48% of 
expected jet-fuel consumption.

1) sas’ current hedging contracts for jet fuel at the end of the fiscal year have been taken 
into account.
the jet-fuel cost in the statement of income does not include usd currency hedging effects. 
these effects are recognized under “other” in other operating expenses, note 4, since 
currency hedging is performed separately and is not linked specifically to its jet-fuel pur-
chases. 
emission rights 
in fiscal year 2020, sas’ emission rights expenses in 
the european eu-ets emissions trading scheme totaled 
msek 4 (247). the relatively low expense resulted from 
significantly lower production and emissions. 
sas hedges emission rights for the expected shortfall 
to reduce financial exposure. ahead of fy 2021, sas 
has fully hedged the expense for the forecast need for 
emission rights.

6.5 counterparty losses
sas is exposed to counterparty losses through credits, 
lease agreements and guarantees to external parties. 
this exposure is governed by sas’ financial policy. no 
counterparty loss of any significance had any impact 
on sas in the fiscal year. net impairment of accounts 
receivable and recovered accounts receivable, as well 
as the impairment of other current receivables, had an 
earnings impact of msek -35 (-22) in fiscal year 2020. 
financial policy at sas regulates how and in what 
manner sas should act to reduce the risk of counter-
party losses. sas invests cash and cash equivalents 
in instruments with good liquidity or short maturity 
with credit ratings not lower than a3/p1 according to 
moody’s, or a- according to standard & poor’s. 
7. it
7.1 operational reliability and dependability
sas is increasingly dependent on its own and its 
suppliers’ it systems and procedures for efficient and 
secure operation of its website, reservation system, 
departure control, online bookings and revenue 
system, among other items. such systems are often 
vulnerable to and can be disrupted or harmed by, for 
example, internal faults, sabotage, cyber-related fraud, 
computer viruses, software errors, physical damage or 
other events outside of sas’ and its suppliers’ con-
trol. disruptions could stem from configuration errors 
during upgrades or maintenance operations, and by 
the operational disruption of systems following the 
upgrade of applications. 
sas is also dependent on it and secure information 
flows in all parts of its operations, and through trans-
parent processes and continual updates, sas secures 
the confidentiality, correctness, accessibility and trace-
ability of the information. this is also governed by a 
number of policies and safety solutions. 
7.2 cybercrime
like numerous other companies, sas is exposed to 
various types of attacks on its it system on a daily 
basis. moreover, all of sas’ services and products are 
available online and are therefore subject to ongoing 
attempts at cyber-related fraud. cybercrime organiza-
tions also target sas’ it systems, which contain critical 
information about sas’ transport operations, planning 
and passengers. there is always a risk that sas’ cyber 
security measures might prove inadequate or inap-
propriate for the purpose of preventing all attempts to 
attack its it system. the degree to which any extended 
or serious disruption to sas’ it system could impact 
sas is uncertain and comprises a significant risk for 
sas’ operations and financial performance.
continuous improvement of sas’ capabilities for 
proactive identification and prevention of potential 
cybercrime through training, processes and automated 
tools has, however, enabled sas to prevent any serious 
negative impact to operations. 
8. other events
8.1 extraordinary events
airline companies are impacted by extraordinary 
events around the world, such as natural disasters, 
terror attacks, conflicts and epidemics. 
the covid-19 pandemic hit the airline industry and 
sas resulting in a considerable negative impact on 
passenger numbers and revenue for the company. 
as part of efforts to meet the negative consequences, 
sas completed a recapitalization to restore equity and 
strengthen liquidity. sas also revised its business plan 
to align the company with a lower demand market and 
launched a transformation program of sek 4 billion in 
further efficiency enhancements.
8.2 brand and reputation
in fiscal year 2020, sas carried approximately 12.6 
million travelers. demand for sas’ services could be 
negatively affected if confidence in sas and/or the air-
line industry should decrease.
sas continuously monitors the confidence trend 
for sas and the industry and works strategically to 
strengthen the sas brand and reputation. sas has 
established media and information policies aimed 
at ensuring that all information pertaining to sas is 
correct and accurate. if inaccurate rumors are spread 
about sas or if information is provided incorrectly, sas 
endeavors to follow up and correct errors to minimize 
any negative impact on sas’ general rating and posi-
tion in the market.

that exceeds the share’s quotient value. the compa-
ny’s board has the right to reduce the share capital 
by redeeming all class c shares. if such a decision is 
taken, class c shareholders are obligated to redeem 
all of their class c shares for an amount correspond-
ing to the quotient value. the redemption amount is 
to be paid immediately. class c shares held as trea-
sury shares by the company will, on demand by the 
board, be eligible for conversion to common shares. 
thereafter, the conversion is to be registered with 
the swedish companies registration office without 
delay and is effective when it has been registered with 
the register of companies and noted in the central 
securities depository register.
protection of sas’ air traffic rights in the  
articles of association 
for aviation policy reasons, sas’ articles of association 
authorize, in part, the mandatory redemption of 
common shares by means of a reduction of share 
capital and, in part, should redemption not be possible 
or be adjudged inadequate, an option to issue sub-
ordinated shares for subscription with the support of 
previously issued warrants.  
a precondition for these actions is an assessment by 
the company’s board that a direct threat exists against 
the air traffic rights of the company or any of its sub-
sidiaries when the company or its subsidiaries infringe 
or risk infringing provisions on ownership and control 
in bilateral aviation agreements or in laws or regula-
tions pertaining to permits for air traffic in the eu/eea. 
furthermore, for aviation policy reasons, the articles of 
association contain certain suitability and qualification 
requirements for board members to ensure that the 
board will at all times have the composition it needs to 
ensure that the company and its subsidiaries are able 
to retain their air traffic rights. these requirements 
if traffic rights are threatened sas can:
•  mandatorily redeem common shares
•  issue subordinated shares

sas’ corporate governance structure
there are no subordinated shares or class c shares 
issued or outstanding. common shares and subordi-
nated shares entitle the holders to one vote each. each 
class c share entitles the holder to one-tenth of a vote. 
the maximum number of common shares and subordi-
nated shares that may be issued is limited to a number 
that corresponds with 100% of the company’s share 
capital. the maximum number of class c shares that 
may be issued is limited to 5% of the share capital. the 
common shares provide shareholders the rights set 
out in the swedish companies act and the articles of 
association. 
subordinated shares provide shareholders the right to 
participate in and vote at the company’s shareholders’ 
meetings. subordinated shares do not entitle share-
holders to dividends or participation in bonus issues. if 
subordinated shares are redeemed or the company is 
dissolved and its assets distributed, holders of subordi-
nated shares are treated as holders of common shares 
and receive an equal share in the company’s assets, 
although not at an amount higher than the quotient 
value of the subordinated shares index-adjusted from 
the first date of registration of the subordinated shares 
until the date of the payment of the redemption amount 
or the date of the distribution with an interest-rate 
factor corresponding to stibor 90 days plus two per-
centage points. for more information on subordinated 
shares, see note 22. the share price performance of 
the common share is presented on page 27. 
class c shares do not entitle the holder to dividends. 
if the company is dissolved, class c shares entitle the 
holder to equal parts of the company’s assets as the 
company’s common shares, however not for an amount

include citizenship, domicile and knowledge and expe-
rience of the social, business and cultural conditions 
prevailing in the scandinavian countries. 
beyond these requirements and the regulations 
contained in the articles of association, there are no 
restrictions or voting rules pertaining to the appoint-
ment or removal of board members. 
mandatory redemption
if the board assesses that there is a direct threat to the 
company’s traffic rights, it may decide to mandatorily 
redeem a sufficient number of common shares not 
owned by shareholders domiciled in denmark, norway 
or sweden along with common shares that are con-
trolled, directly or indirectly, by a person or company 
outside of these three countries, so as to ensure con-
tinued scandinavian ownership and control. primarily, 
such mandatory redemption of common shares is 
performed on shares owned or controlled by a person 
or company outside the eu/eea. prior to redemption, 
the shareholders are given an opportunity to sell their 
common shares voluntarily within a prescribed period. 
redemptions are made subsequently without refund to 
the shareholder since the reduction is to be transferred 
to the company’s statutory reserve. 
subordinated shares
should the board deem the action of redeeming 
common shares not possible or inadequate, the 
issued warrants may be used to issue subordinated 
shares in such number so as to safeguard continued 
scandinavian ownership and control. however, any 
such issue of subordinated shares may only take place 
following a resolution by the general shareholders’ 
meeting approved by at least half of the votes cast at 
the meeting. subscription for subordinated shares 
through the issued warrants may only be performed 
to the extent necessary, as assessed by the board, to 
eliminate the aforementioned threat. as soon as the 
aforementioned threat ceases to exist, the board shall 
ensure that the subordinated shares thus issued are 
redeemed.
ownership and control
on 10 november 2020, sas ab had a total of 125,897 
shareholders. the major shareholders are the swedish 
and danish governments, who together represent 
43.6% of the votes. more information about the share 
and the ownership structure is available on pages 27 
and 28 in the sas annual report fiscal year 2020. 
no restrictions exist in the articles of association con-
cerning the voting rights of shareholders at sharehold-
ers’ meetings and, pursuant to the swedish companies 
act, shareholders may vote for the entire number of 
shares they own or represent by proxy. nor are there 
any special plans, such as employee-benefit plans or 
the like, through which company or group employees 
own shares with restricted voting rights. sas ab has 
no knowledge of any agreements between sharehold-
ers that would restrict the capacity of shareholders to 
vote at a shareholders’ meeting or their right to freely 
transfer such shares. 
 
impact of the recapitalization plan 
on corporate governance
the sas recapitalization plan has been implemented 
based on the approval of the european commission 
pursuant to the applicable rules for state aid. the 
approval includes the requirements contained in 
the commission temporary framework for state 
aid measures to support the economy in the current 
covid-19 outbreak which include, inter alia, a ban on 
dividends, restriction of sas’ ability to carry out acqui-
sitions and a requirement for unchanged remuneration 
to senior executives. these requirements will be eased 
when the aid has been repaid.1
effects of a public takeover bid
sas is currently party to a number of agreements in 
which the counterparties are entitled to terminate the 
agreement, in the event of changes in the majority 
stake or control of the company.  
a. nomination committee
the nomination committee represents shareholders 
of sas and is appointed by the agm and tasked with 
preparing the meeting’s resolutions on nomination and 
remuneration issues, as well as matters of procedure 
for the next nomination committee. an instruction for 
the nomination committee was adopted in conjunction 
with the 2020 agm. 
the nomination committee is tasked with making 
proposals for the election of the chairman of the agm, 
the number of board members and directors’ fees, 
broken down among the chairman, vice chairman, 
other board members and any remuneration for work 
on board committees, election of board members 
and chairman of the board, election of the company’s 
auditors, auditors’ fees and the nomination committee 
ahead of the next agm.
1)  the requirements pursuant to the approval by the european commission are described 
in more detail on pages 63–64 of the prospectus published by sas pertaining to the 
recapitalization plan on 30 september 2020.

issues discussed in the nomination committee 
since the agm 2020, the nomination committee has 
evaluated the board’s work, qualifications and com-
position. diversity, breadth and the gender balance 
have also been discussed. since the 2018 agm, 
the chairman of the board has participated on the 
committee, and the result of the evaluation of the 
board is made available to the committee. 
at least one meeting with the board and the group ceo 
must be held before the committee submits its recom-
mendations to the agm. 
the committee’s recommendations are published in 
the notice calling the agm, on the company’s website 
and at the agm. committee members received no fees 
or other remuneration from sas for their work on the 
nomination committee. 
when required for carrying out its assignment, the 
committee utilizes recruitment consultants and other 
outside consultants, with sas defraying the cost.  
 b. auditors
the auditors are elected by the agm and tasked with 
scrutinizing the company’s financial reporting and the 
administration of the company by the board and the 
president. an election was conducted to appoint an 
auditor at the 2020 agm, whereby kpmg was elected 
for the period until the end of the 2021 agm. the audi-
tor in charge is tomas gerhardsson. 
on three occasions during fiscal year 2020, the auditor 
in charge met with the board, presenting the program 
for auditing work and reporting observations from the 
audit.
the auditor also met with the audit committee on six 
occasions. on one occasion during the fiscal year, the 
board met with the company’s auditor without the 
presence of the president or any other representative 
of the company management.
kpmg submits an auditors’ report for sas ab, the 
group and an overwhelming majority of the subsidiar-
ies. over the past year, in addition to its auditing work, 
kpmg has performed advisory services for sas group 
companies in auditing-related areas as outlined in the 
table below. for more information about the auditors’ 
fees in fy 2020, see note 37.

c. shareholders’ meeting
the shareholders’ meeting is the highest deci-
sion-making body at sas. at shareholders’ meetings 
of sas ab, one common share is equal to one vote with 
no restrictions on the number of votes any one share-
holder is entitled to cast at such a meeting. 
the shareholders’ meeting may be held in stockholm, 
solna or in sigtuna. notice convening the agm is 
issued no earlier than six and no later than four weeks 
prior to the meeting. notice is published in daily news-
papers and in post- och inrikes tidningar in sweden, 
and announced in press releases as well as published 
on the company’s website. sas also e-mails notices to 
shareholders who have requested this service via the 
company’s website: www.sasgroup.net. 
in fiscal year 2020, the board convened the agm on 12 
march 2020 and the extraordinary general meeting on 
22 september 2020.
the articles of association contain no special provi-
sions regarding the election and discharge of board 
members or regarding changes to the articles of 
association. the extraordinary general meeting held 
on 22 september 2020 authorized the board to, on one 
or more occasions and up until the next agm, decide 
to increase sas’ share capital through the new issue 
of common shares, with or without disapplication of 
the preferential rights of shareholders, to be paid for in 
cash or by offset. the authorization was exercised by 
the board on 23 september 2020 as part of the imple-
mentation of sas’ recapitalization plan and will not be 
exercised for any other purpose. as per 31 october

are regarded by the nomination committee as being 
independent of the company and company manage-
ment. moreover, all board members are deemed to be 
independent in relation to major shareholders at 31 
october 2020. 
sas ab meets the requirements of the code regarding 
board independence vis-à-vis the company, company 
management and the company’s major shareholders. 
the nomination committee applies rule 4.1 of the code 
and believes that the code’s requirements for diversity, 
breadth and an even gender balance improved in accor-
dance with the committee’s ambition of achieving an 
equal gender balance on the board of directors. 
to streamline and enhance the work of the board, there 
are two committees: 
• the remuneration committee
• the audit committee
the members of these committees are appointed 
by the board. the main duty of the committees is to 
prepare issues for decision by the board. these com-
mittees do not imply any delegation of the board’s 
legal responsibilities. reports to the board on issues 
discussed at committee meetings are either in writing 
or given verbally at the following board meeting. 
the work on each committee follows written instruc-
tions and a formal work plan stipulated by the board. 
the general counsel of sas serves as the secretary to 
the audit committee. minutes of committee meetings 
are provided to all board members. remuneration for 
work on board committees is determined by the agm. 
d. board of directors
the board’s work is governed by the swedish 
companies act, the articles of association, the code 
and the formal work plan adopted by the board each 
year. the board is ultimately responsible for sas’ 
operations. this also includes risk management, 
regulatory compliance and internal control at sas. 
the board members are elected by the agm for the 
period until the next agm has been held. the articles 
of association stipulate that the board of directors 
should consist of six to eight members elected by the 
shareholders’ meeting. following the 2020 agm, the 
board comprised eight elected members. in addition, 
the board consisted of three employee representatives, 
each with two personal deputies. 
the employee representatives are appointed by the 
sas employee groups in denmark, norway and 
sweden in line with governing legislation and spe-
cial agreements. deputies attend board meetings 
only in the absence of an ordinary member. except 
for employee representatives, no board member is 
employed by sas ab or any other company in the sas 
group. the elected board members are appointed for 
the period until the end of the next agm. no regulation 
exists that limits the period of time a board member 
can serve in that capacity. the experience of the board 
members and their independence in relation the 
owners of the company are disclosed on pages 59–60. 
the president and other senior executives in the com-
pany attended board meetings to make presentations 
and the company’s general counsel served as the 
board’s secretary.

the board’s work fiscal year 2020
the board’s work follows a yearly agenda with regular 
business items as well as special topics. the formal 
work plan regulates the division of the board’s work 
between the board and its committees and among the 
board, its chairman and the president. working closely 
with the president, the chairman of the board monitors 
the company’s performance, plans board meetings, 
takes responsibility for ensuring that the other mem-
bers of the board always receive high-quality informa-
tion about the group’s finances and performance, and 
ensures that the board evaluates its work and that of 
the president each year. 
the formal work plan also contains provisions for meet-
ing the board’s needs for information and financial 
reporting on an ongoing basis as well as instructions 
for the president and the company’s board commit-
tees. this process is evaluated each year, including the 
work of the board. evaluation of the board is carried out 
by way of an annual survey that is compiled and then 
discussed by the board. 
the board appoints from among its own members 
the members of the board’s two committees: the 
remuneration committee and the audit committee. 
between november 2019 and october 2020, the 
board held 26 minuted board meetings, including a 
statutory meeting and four by correspondence in addi-
tion to several informal meetings.
the president and other senior executives in the com-
pany attended board meetings to make presentations 
and the company’s general counsel served as the 
board’s secretary.

guidelines for remuneration to  
senior executives 
the 2020 agm established updated guidelines for 
remuneration to senior executives, which are detailed 
below. no amendments to the guidelines for remunera-
tion to senior executives are proposed for resolution at 
the 2021 agm.
the board of directors proposes guidelines for remu-
neration to the president and other members of group 
management. the guidelines also encompass any 
remuneration to board members, other than directors’ 
fees. the guidelines apply to remuneration agreed after 
the 2021 agm and amendments to agreed remuner-
ation made thereafter. the guidelines do not apply to 
remuneration resolved by the general meeting. for 
employments governed by rules other than swedish, 
pension benefits and other benefits may be duly 
adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or estab-
lished local practice, taking into account, to the extent 
possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.
how the guidelines advance the company’s business 
strategy, long-term interests and sustainability
successful implementation of the company’s business 
strategy and safeguarding the company’s long-term 
interests, including its sustainability, require the com-
pany to recruit and retain highly qualified employees. in 
order to do so, sas must offer competitive total remu-
neration, which these guidelines enable. total remu-
neration should be on market terms and competitive 
and relate to responsibility and authority.
for information about the company’s business strategy, 
see the sas website (https://www.sasgroup.net/en/
strategic-priorities/).

pension and other benefits. the general meeting can 
also, irrespective of these guidelines, resolve on share 
and share-price based remuneration among other 
things.
fixed salary
the fixed salary consists of fixed cash salary. the fixed 
salary reflects the position’s requirements with respect to 
qualifications, responsibilities, complexity and the manner 
in which it serves to reach the business objectives. the 
fixed salary also reflects the performance of the executive 
and can thus be both individual and differentiated.
variable salary
in addition to fixed salary, senior executives reporting to 
the president may, under separate agreements, receive 
variable salary when fulfilling agreed performance crite-
ria, provided that their fixed salaries are frozen for review 
for a certain period after payment of the variable salary. 
any variable salary consists of an annual variable cash 
salary and may amount to a maximum of 20% of the 
fixed annual salary. criteria fulfillment for awarding vari-
able salary must be measured over a period of one year.  
the variable salary is linked to one or several predeter-
mined and measurable criteria, which can be financial, 
such as ebt, cask and pask, or non-financial, such 
as co2 emissions, flight safety, employee engagement 
and customer satisfaction. less than 30% of the vari-
able cash remuneration depends on non-financial cri-
teria. by linking the remuneration to senior executives 
to the company’s earnings as well as sustainability, the 
criteria contribute to the company’s business strategy, 
long-term interests and competitiveness.
 
the extent to which the criteria for awarding variable 
remuneration have been satisfied is determined when 
the measurement period has ended. for financial 
targets, the evaluation is based on the latest financial 
information made public by the company.
 
the terms for variable remuneration are designed so 
that the board of directors, under exceptional financial 
conditions, may limit or refuse to pay variable remuner-
ation if such a measure is deemed reasonable 
further variable cash remuneration may be awarded 
in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such 
extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and 
only made on an individual basis, either for the purpose 
of recruiting or retaining executives, or as remunera-
tion for extraordinary performance beyond the indi-
vidual’s ordinary tasks. such remuneration may not 
exceed an amount corresponding to 20% of the fixed 
annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once 
each year per individual. any resolution on such remu-
neration is taken by the board of directors based on a 
proposal from the remuneration committee.
pension
for the president, pension benefits, including health 
insurance, are defined-contribution with premiums not 
exceeding 40% of the fixed annual salary. for other 
members of group management, pension benefits, 
including health insurance, are defined-contribution 
unless the executive is encompassed by a defined-ben-
efit pension under mandatory collective agreement 
provisions. premiums for defined-contribution pen-
sions are not to exceed 30% of the fixed annual salary. 
variable remuneration qualifies for pension benefits 
to the extent required by mandatory collective agree-
ment provisions applicable to the executive (applies 
to sweden and defined-contribution pension). in such 
case, the premiums for defined-contribution pensions 
may not exceed 36% of the fixed annual salary as a 
result of pension provisions for variable salary.
other benefits
other benefits, which may include, for example, com-
pany car, travel benefits and health insurance, are on 
market terms and only constitute a limited part of the 
total remuneration. premiums and other costs associ-
ated with such benefits may amount to a maximum of 
10% of the fixed annual salary.
termination of employment
for the president and other members of group 
management, the notice period is six months in case of 
termination by the executive. in case of termination by 
the company the maximum notice period is 12 months. 
in case of termination by the company, severance pay 
is payable in an amount corresponding to a maxi-
mum of one year’s fixed salary less any remuneration 
received from new employments or assignments.
additionally, remuneration is payable for any non-com-
pete undertakings. such remuneration compensates 
for loss of income and is only paid in so far as the pre-
viously employed executive is not entitled to severance 
pay. the remuneration is based on the fixed salary at 
the time of termination of employment and amounts to 
not more than 60% of the fixed salary at the time of ter-
mination of employment, unless otherwise provided by 
mandatory collective agreement provisions, and is paid 
during the time the non-compete undertaking applies, 
however not for more than 18 months following termi-
nation of employment.

terms for these services (including services rendered by 
a company wholly owned by a board member) is paid, 
provided that such services contribute to the implemen-
tation of sas’ business strategy and long-term interests, 
including its sustainability. such consultant’s fee may, 
for each board member, in no case exceed the annual 
director’s fee.
salary and employment conditions for employees
in the preparation of the board of directors’ proposal 
for these remuneration guidelines, salary and employ-
ment conditions for employees of the company have 
been taken into account by including information on the 
employees’ total income, the components of the remu-
neration and increase and growth rate over time, in the 
remuneration committee’s and the board of directors’ 
basis of decision when evaluating whether the guide-
lines and the limitations set out therein are reasonable. 
preparation and decision-making process
the board of directors has established a remuneration 
committee. the committee’s duties include preparing 
principles for remuneration to group management and 
the board of directors’ decisions to propose guidelines 
for remuneration to senior executives. the board of 
directors prepares proposals for new guidelines at least 
every fourth year, and submits it to the agm for resolu-
tion. these guidelines apply until new guidelines have 
been adopted by the general meeting. the remuneration 
committee also monitors and evaluates programs for 
variable remuneration to group management, the appli-
cation of the guidelines to senior executives as well as 
the current remuneration structures and compensation 
levels in the company. remuneration to the president is 
decided by the board of directors in line with approved 
policies following preparation and recommendation 
by the remuneration committee. remuneration to 
other senior executives is decided by the president in 
line with approved policies and after consultation with 
the remuneration committee. the members of the 
remuneration committee are independent in relation 
to the company and group management. the president 
and other members of group management do not partic-
ipate in the board of directors’ discussions and decisions 
on remuneration-related matters that pertain to them.
derogation from these guidelines
the board may decide to derogate from these guide-
lines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is 
special cause and such a derogation is necessary to 
safeguard the company’s long-term interests, includ-
ing its sustainability, or to ensure the company’s 
financial viability. as stated above, the remuneration 
committee’s duties include preparing the board of 
directors’ decisions on remuneration matters, includ-
ing decisions to derogate from these guidelines. 
g. president and group management
the board appoints the president of sas ab, who is 
also group ceo. the board has delegated respon-
sibility for the day-to-day administration of sas to 
the president. each year, an instruction defining the 
division of duties between the board and the president 
is determined by the board who also evaluate the work 
performed by the president. the board’s instructions 
to the president contain detailed rules governing the 
president’s authority and obligations. 
the president liaises, works closely, and has regular 
meetings with the chairman to discuss the operations 
and performance of sas, and to plan board meetings. 
to enable the board to monitor the financial position of 
sas on an ongoing basis, the president makes monthly 
reports to the board. 
in fy 2020, group management comprised seven 
members, including the president. the composition 
and functions of the group management are shown on 
pages 61–62. 
group management is not a corporate body in the 
sense of swedish limited company law and as a collegial 
management body has no legal liability vis-à-vis the 
board and shareholders. only the president reports to 
the board. group management normally holds minuted 
meetings every week. these meetings are chaired by 
the president, who reaches decisions after consulting 
with the other members of group management. 
the main business areas of sas that are not themselves 
a separate legal entity are led by group management 
through representatives for the respective business area. 
group management’s management and control of 
operations are based on guidelines and policies regard-
ing financial management and follow-up, communi-
cation issues, human resources, legal issues, brands, 
business ethics and environmental matters. 
internal control – financial reporting 
sas applies coso, the internationally recognized 
framework for internal control, to describe and evaluate 
the group’s control structure.

report by the board 
of directors
  report by the 
 
  board of directors     
management and employees, and is designed to pro-
vide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
external reporting. the board is ultimately responsible 
for internal control. five areas that jointly form the basis 
of a sound control structure are described below. 
control environment
the control environment comprises the basis for 
internal control and includes the culture in which sas 
communicates and acts. the group’s ambition is that 
its values — reliability, openness, care and value-cre-
ation — will permeate the organization and the internal 
control environment. 
all actions, internal as well as external, are to reflect 
these basic values. the sas group’s code of conduct 
describes the desired approach in various situations, 
including a structure for reporting deviations from 
the desired approach. information concerning gover-
nance of the group is available for all employees on 
the group’s intranet. these documents describe sas’ 
control philosophy, control model and entities as well 
as the companies’ roles and responsibilities, owner 
requirements, overall monitoring, internal business 
relationships and the allocation of tasks.
risk assessment
each year, company management produces a risk 
assessment that encompasses all operations and is 
based on the targets of those operations. the risk 
assessment is presented to the audit committee and 
reviewed continuously throughout the year. 
with regard to financial reporting, an assessment of 
significant risks in relation to major balance sheet and 
income items is carried out annually. this assessment 
grades the risks concerning financial reporting, and 
critical areas are identified. 
furthermore, sas’ internal audit carries out an annual 
risk assessment that forms the basis of future years’ 
audit plans. both the risk assessment and the audit 
plan are presented to company management and the 
audit committee.
control activities
control activities are carried out at different levels within 
sas to manage risks and ensure the reliability of finan-
cial reporting. these key controls have been compiled 
and described in relation to each process as part of the 
sas internal control framework. the processes covered 
by the framework include general governance pro-
cesses, accounting process, revenue process, purchas-
ing process, payroll process, asset management pro-
cess and controls related to it. the framework is subject 
to an annual review based on the updated risk assess-
ment concerning risks related to financial reporting. 
sas’ internal audit did not conduct any audits during 
fiscal year 2020 due to the covid-19 situation.
information and communication
sas aims for information and communication paths 
pertaining to the internal control of financial reporting 
to be known and appropriate. all policies and guidelines 
in the financial areas are on the intranet, under the sas 
group financial guide. sas’ accounting policies as well 
as any changes are always communicated by direct 
dispatch and at regular meetings with those responsible 
for financial matters in the entities and subsidiaries. 
all entities and subsidiaries submit a monthly report 
on their activities, including their financial status and 
performance. to ensure that the external information 
is correct and complete, an ir/information policy has 
been adopted by the sas board. sas’ published external 
reports are based on reporting from all legal entities in 
accordance with a standardized reporting procedure. 
regularly reported financial information includes the 
annual report, interim reports, monthly traffic reports, 
press releases, presentations and telephone confer-
ences focused on financial analysts and investors, 
and meetings with the capital markets in sweden and 
abroad. the above information is also available on the 
sas website www.sasgroup.net. 
monitoring
internal audits at sas have been outsourced. the audits 
carried out by internal audit are based on an annual 
internal audit plan and are mainly focused on operational 
risk areas. however, the internal audit plan also covers 
processes that impact financial reporting and the risk of 
irregularities, improper favoritism of another party at the 
company’s expense, and the risk of loss or embezzle-
ment. the annual internal audit plan is approved by the 
audit committee and the sas board. 
monitoring and continuous evaluation of compliance with 
policies and guidelines as well as monitoring reported 
deficiencies are conducted regularly. in connection with 
monitoring action plans for noted deficiencies in control 
activities and their control targets, these measures are 
tested as is their compliance. recommendations from 
the external and internal audits and the status of ongo-
ing measures are compiled and presented to group 
management and the audit committee. financial report-
ing is discussed at each board meeting and at meetings 
of the audit committee.

sas annual and sustainability report, fiscal year 2020
board of directors
the board is responsible for the organization and 
administration of sas, for ensuring proper control of 
its accounting and other financial circumstances as 
well as for appointing and removing the president. 
all board members elected by the shareholders’ 
meeting are independent of the company and com-
pany management. the 2020 agm adopted the 
nomination committee’s recommendation for re-elec-
tion of carsten dilling, monica caneman, lars-johan 
jarnheimer, dag mejdell, sanna suvanto-harsaae, liv 
fiksdahl, oscar stege unger and kay kratky. carsten 
dilling was elected chairman of the board. 
the composition of the board is based on the fact that 
sas operates in a market subject to significant pres-
sure for change and intense competition and, not least, 
the considerable impact of covid-19. given these 
conditions, the nomination committee is of the opinion 
that continuity on the board is of particular impor-
tance. with its experience of sas and previous action 
programs, the nomination committee deemed the 
board to be particularly suited to provide the compa-
ny’s management the necessary support in the current 
situation. 
the nomination committee’s opinion was that the 
code’s requirements for diversity, breadth and an even 
gender balance increased through the nomination 
committee’s proposal. 
no share convertibles or options have been issued to 
the board of sas ab.

comments on the cash-flow statement
cash flow from operating activities before changes in 
working capital amounted to msek -3,431 (2,305). 
adjustment for other non-cash items, etc., primarily 
pertained to revaluation of lease liabilities, the earnings 
effect from valuation of financial instruments and 
provisions for restructuring costs.
the change in working capital amounted to msek 
-1,680 (1,013). it was primarily operating liabilities 
and unearned transportation liability in particular that 
decreased during the year.
aircraft acquisitions during the year amounted to 
msek 5,908 (3,071), and comprised delivery payments 
for three new airbus a320neo and four new airbus 
a350 aircraft. moreover, aircraft investments included 
msek 472 (1,725) in capitalized expenditure for air-
craft maintenance and aircraft modifications.
one of the delivered airbus a320neo aircraft was 
divested during the year through a sale and leaseback 
arrangement. 
the recapitalization completed at the end of the year 
had a positive impact of msek 11,910 on cash. loans 
raised amounted to msek 11,210 and loan and lease 
liability repayments totaled msek 7,602.
in all, the sas group’s cash and cash equivalents 
increased msek 1,472 (-993) during the fiscal year, 
whereupon cash and cash equivalents amounted to 
msek 10,231 (8,763).

note 1 significant accounting policies
general
sas ab (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the 
“group”) provide transportation services.
the core business of the group is operating passenger flights on an 
extensive nordic and international route network. the group’s three main op-
erational hubs in copenhagen, oslo and stockholm form the backbone of its 
flight network. in addition to passenger flights, the group provides air cargo 
and other aviation services at selected airports in the group’s route network. 
sas ab is a swedish public limited company registered in stockholm and 
the address of its head office is frösundaviks allé 1, solna, stockholm. sas ab 
is the parent company of the sas group.
the consolidated financial statements for sas ab have been prepared 
in accordance with the annual accounts act, recommendation rfr 1 — 
supplementary accounting rules for corporate groups, and the eu-approved 
international financial reporting standards (ifrs) and interpretations issued 
by the international financial reporting interpretations committee (ifric) 
that apply for fiscal years starting 1 november 2019. these standards have 
been consistently applied to all periods presented in the consolidated finan-
cial statements. the financial statements have been prepared on a cost basis, 
except for the remeasurement of financial assets and liabilities. the principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
accounting estimates and assumptions  
in the financial statements
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires 
management to perform estimates and assumptions that influence the 
application of the accounting policies and the carrying amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenue and expenses. actual outcomes may differ from these 
estimates and assumptions.
the estimates and assumptions are regularly reviewed. changes in 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the change is made if the 
change affects only that period, or in the period in which the change is made 
and future periods if the change affects both the current and future periods. 
for more information, see “critical accounting estimates and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty” in this note.
new and amended standards and interpretations  
applicable for fiscal year 2020
from 1 november 2019, sas has adopted the new standard ifrs 16 leases, 
using the modified retrospective approach, which entails that comparative 
figures for earlier periods have not been restated. ifrs 16 replaces the 
previous standard, ias 17 leases.  the table below illustrates the impact of 
the implementation of ifrs 16 on equity and other balance sheet items at the 
transition date of 1 november 2019. more information on the application of 
ifrs 16 within the group is provided later in this note. no material amend-
ments occurred in ifrs that affected the group.
impact on consolidated balance sheet
 the lease liability is recognized at an amount corresponding to the present 
value of future lease payments for the leased assets. as a result of sas' transi-
tion approach, all right-of-use assets were measured on the transition date at 
an amount equal to the lease liability. adjustments to the right-of-use assets 
were made for prepaid lease expenses recognized at 31 october 2019 and the 
initial estimate of restoration costs for the leased assets. the initial adoption 
of ifrs 16 had no impact on equity. the table below shows the transition 
impact on 1 november 2019 on the consolidated balance sheet.
the main types of assets leased by sas are aircraft, properties and 
ground handling equipment. on the transition date, sek 13.4 billion of the 
right-of-use assets relates to aircraft including engines, sek 2.8 billion relates 
to properties and sek 0.5 billion relates to ground handling equipment. a 
major impact from applying ifrs 16 is that sas is exposed to exchange-rate 
fluctuations. most of the right-of-use assets are denominated in sek, but the 
corresponding lease liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. lease 
liabilities relating to aircraft are denominated in usd, while properties and 
ground handling equipment mainly are denominated in sek, nok and dkk. as 
aircraft represent approximately 80% of the lease liabilities on the transition 
date, the currency exposure from recalculating usd liabilities into sek is 
significant. 
from 1 november, sas has adjusted the hedging policy for foreign curren-
cy to better manage this risk.

impact on consolidated statement of income 
sas' income statement is highly impacted by ifrs 16. the lease expenses 
previously recognized in profit or loss are replaced by a depreciation expense 
on the right-of-use asset and an interest expense for the lease liability. the 
right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis. interest expenses 
relating to the lease liabilities are at their highest at the beginning of the lease 
term and decrease as the lease liabilities are paid down. when applying ias 
17 in previous years, operating lease expenses for aircraft, properties and 
ground handling equipment were expensed over the lease term, primarily on 
a straight-line basis, and recognized in ebit as lease expenses for aircraft and 
other operating expenses. given this change in pattern of expenses where 
more expenses, due to the interest component, are recognized earlier in the 
lease term, ifrs 16 (excluding currency revaluations) had a negative impact 
on sas' results in the first twelve months of fiscal year 2020. however due 
to the effect of currency revaluations, the net impact on income before tax 
(ebt) was a positive msek 261. over the lease term, the expenses following 
the adoption of ifrs 16 are equal to the expenses reported under ias 17. the 
table below shows the impact from ifrs 16 on the consolidated statement of 
income for fiscal year 2020.

impact on consolidated cash-flow statement
the classification in sas' cash-flow statement has changed with the introduc-
tion of ifrs 16. previously, all lease payments were presented in operating 
activities. following the adoption of ifrs 16, principal repayments on lease 
liabilities are presented in financing activities. payments for the interest 
portion of lease liabilities are presented within operating activities. thus 
cash flow from operating activities is positively impacted by ifrs 16, with the 
corresponding decrease in cash flow from financing activities. since ifrs 16 
does not impact the cash payments between sas and the lessors, the net 
effect on cash flow is zero.

impact on key figures
as ifrs 16 has a significant impact on the income statement and balance 
sheet, sas has reviewed the key figures to ensure their continued relevance. 
following sas’ transition approach, financial reporting published by sas 
during fy 2020 did not include restated comparative information for fy 2019. 
the table below shows the impact from ifrs 16 on the key figures that have 
been calculated on closing balances.

change in presentation – consolidated statement of income
with the adoption of ifrs 16, the group has made some changes to improve 
the presentation of the consolidated statement of income. previously, lease 
expenses for aircraft was presented on a separate line in the income state-
ment. following ifrs 16, this expense is no longer material to the group, so 
starting 1 november 2019, lease expenses for aircraft is presented as other 
external expenses and specified in note 4 in this report. fuel expenses and 
air traffic charges were previously presented as other external expenses, but 
starting 1 november 2019, these expenses are presented as separate line 
items in the income statement. since these expenses continue to be reported 
within operating income (ebit), the change in presentation has a net zero 
effect on operating income (ebit). the carrying amounts for the comparative 
year, fiscal year 2019, have been reclassified. see more details in the table 
below.
compensation for delays or cancellations
the ifrs interpretation committee (ifric, ic) published an agenda decision 
in september 2019 regarding compensation for delays or cancellations (ifrs 
15). the ic concluded in its decision that customer compensation for delays 
or cancellations is a variable consideration in the contract. therefore, it should 
be recognized as an adjustment to revenue. previously and in fy 2019, sas 
has accounted for customer compensation under other operating expenses. 
in accordance with the ic’s decision, sas has analyzed the effects and has 
reclassified customer compensation for delays and cancellations from oper-
ating expenses to revenue, in accordance with the ic’s agenda decision. the

principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the 
parent company and the entities over which controlling influence is exercised 
by the group. the group controls a company when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its participation in the company and is able to 
affect those returns through its influence over the company.
entities in which the group has an ownership interest of at least 20% and no 
more than 50%, or where the group has significant influence by other means 
but cannot exercise controlling influence, are affiliated companies. affiliated 
companies are accounted for using the equity method.
the earnings of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the 
group’s earnings from the effective date of control. the separate net assets, 
both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiaries are consolidated 
into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the group as at the 
effective date of control. the earnings of subsidiaries disposed of during the fis-
cal year are included in the group’s earnings up to the effective date of disposal.
non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of 
equity. the group’s earnings and components in other comprehensive income 
are attributable to the parent company’s owners and to the non-controlling 
interests. all intra-group transactions, balance-sheet items, revenue and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
business combinations
acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the 
purchase method. the cost of the business combination is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values (at the acquisition date when controlling influence 
is achieved) of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity shares issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
acquisition-related expenses are recognized in profit or loss when they are 
incurred. the cost also includes fair value at the acquisition date for the assets 
or liabilities that arise from any agreement governing a contingent consider-
ation. contingent considerations are classified either as equity or financial 
liabilities. amounts classified as financial liabilities are remeasured each 
period at fair value, and any remeasurement gains or losses are recognized in 
profit or loss.
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
qualify for recognition under ifrs 3 – business combinations are recognized 
at fair value on the acquisition date.
in business combinations where the sum of the cost, any non-controlling 
interests and fair value at the acquisition date for previously held equity ex-
ceeds fair value at the acquisition date for identifiable acquired net assets, the 
difference is recognized as goodwill in the balance sheet. following a review 
of the difference, any negative difference is recognized directly in profit or 
loss as a gain from a bargain purchase.
non-controlling interests
changes in the parent company’s share in a subsidiary that do not lead to a 
loss of controlling influence are recognized as equity transactions (in other 
words, as transactions with the group’s owner). any difference between the 
sum by which the non-controlling interests has been adjusted and the fair 
value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and 
distributed to the parent company’s owners.
loss of controlling influence
when the parent company loses controlling influence of a subsidiary, the 
divestment gain or loss is calculated as the difference between: 
•  the sum of the fair value for the consideration received and the fair value of 
any remaining holdings, and  
•  the previously recognized values of the subsidiary’s assets (including 
goodwill) and liabilities as well as any non-controlling interest.
investments in affiliated companies
affiliated companies comprise all companies where the group exercises 
significant but not controlling influence, which generally applies for sharehold-
ings representing 20–50% of the votes. affiliated companies are accounted 
for using the equity method.
the earnings of affiliated companies are accounted for based upon the 
group’s proportional ownership of the earnings of these affiliates. any losses 
arising from affiliated companies are recorded in the consolidated financial 
statements until the investment in such affiliated companies is impaired to 
zero. thereafter, losses are only accounted for to the extent that the group is 
committed to providing financial support to such affiliated companies.
the carrying amount of investments in affiliated companies represents the 
cost of each investment, including goodwill, the share of retained earnings 
following acquisition and any other changes in equity. the carrying amount 
of investments in affiliated companies is reviewed on a regular basis and if 
any decline in value has occurred, it is impaired in the period in which this 
occurred.
profits and losses from transactions with affiliated companies are eliminat-
ed in proportion to the group’s interest in these affiliated companies.
segment reporting
the group’s operations are reported as one operating segment, which is 
consistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision maker 
(codm), which is defined as sas group management.
geographic information about revenue  
from external customers and assets
traffic revenue from domestic services in denmark, norway and sweden is 
allocated to domestic. traffic between the three countries is allocated to 
intra-scandinavian. other traffic revenues are allocated to the geographical 
area where the destination is located. other revenues are allocated to a 
geographical area based on the customer’s geographical location relating, for 
example, to goods exported to a customer in another country or, alternatively, 
the geographical location where the service is performed. 
assets broken down by geographic area do not include the group’s aircraft 
or prepayments for tangible fixed assets. since aircraft are utilized in a flexible 
manner across the route network, there is no justifiable basis for allocating 
aircraft.
foreign currency translation
the individual financial statements of the entities in the group are measured 
in the functional currency of the entities, i.e., the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which they operate.
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are remeasured at the exchange rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates. at each closing date, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the closing-date 
exchange rates. non-monetary items carried at fair value denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date fair value 
was determined. non-monetary items that are measured in terms of cost in a 
foreign currency are not translated.
exchange differences arising from translation are recognized as a gain 
or loss in the period in which they arise, except for exchange differences on 
transactions entered into to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries and 
exchange differences relating to monetary items receivable from or payable 
to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to 
occur and, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation. these 
differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.
for the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the 
assets and liabilities of the group’s foreign operations are translated at the 
closing-date exchange rates. revenue and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period, provided that exchange rates do not 
fluctuate substantially in the period. in the latter case, the exchange rate on 
the transaction date is applied. any translation differences are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.
the exchange rates applied in the translation of the financial statements 
for consolidation purposes are as follows:

hensive income (fvtoci) or fair value through profit and loss (fvtpl). the 
classification of financial assets depends on the characteristics of the asset 
and the business model in which it is held.
the fair value of a financial asset is generally determined by reference to 
official market quotes. when market quotes are not available, the fair value is 
determined using generally accepted valuation methods, such as discounted 
future cash flows based on observable market inputs.
amortized cost is calculated using the effective-interest method, where 
any premiums or discounts and directly attributable expenses and revenue 
are capitalized over the contract period using the effective interest rate. the 
effective interest rate is the rate that yields the instrument’s cost when calcu-
lating the present value of future cash flows.  
other financial assets at amortized cost  
financial assets are classified as recognized at amortized cost if the contrac-
tual terms give rise to payments that are solely payments of principal and of 
interest on the principal amount outstanding, and the financial asset is held 
in a business model aimed at holding financial assets to collect contractual 
cash flows. with the exception of derivatives, all of the group’s financial assets 
are recognized at amortized cost through application of the effective-interest 
method. for subsequent periods, the assets are measured at amortized cost 
reduced with impairment provisions.
impairment of financial assets
the group’s financial assets measured at amortized cost are assessed for 
impairment based on expected credit losses (ecls). provisions for accounts 
receivable are always based on lifetime ecls. if there is no expectation of col-
lection, the full asset value is written off. losses and write offs are recognized 
as expenses in the income statement.
derivatives and hedge accounting
the group uses derivatives to manage exposures related to fluctuations 
in interest rates, exchange rates and fuel prices. the derivatives used are 
mainly recognized pursuant to the rules for hedge accounting in ifrs 9. the 
group’s hedge instruments are designated as fair-value hedges and cash-flow 
hedges. derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting requirements are 
remeasured on an ongoing basis at fvtpl. derivatives with positive values 
are recognized as current assets in the consolidated balance sheet, and deriv-
atives with negative values are recognized as current liabilities.
for fair-value hedges, the effective and ineffective portions of the change 
in fair value of the derivative is recognized in net income for the year, together 
with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. 
when hedging projected cash flows, the effective portion of the change in 
fair value of the derivative outstanding is recognized in other comprehensive 
income until the underlying transaction is reflected in net income for the year, 
whereupon any deferred hedging gains or losses are restored in net income for 
the year. the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative used 
to hedge cash flow is recognized in net income for the year. should hedged fu-
ture transactions result in non-financial assets or liabilities, the gains and loss-
es are included in the cost of the assets or liabilities upon initial recognition.
for measurement of effectiveness, an overall assessment is conducted of 
whether or not the hedging relationship is effective. the initial time value is 
treated as a cost for the hedging strategy and changes in the time value are 
recognized in other comprehensive income. 
financial liabilities 
financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, are initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective-interest method.
accounts payable
accounts payable are expected to have short terms and are therefore cate-
gorized as short-term liabilities where the interest effect is negligible. the 
liabilities are carried at nominal amounts with no discounts.
borrowings
long-term borrowings, i.e., liabilities with a tenor longer than one year, consist 
of interest-bearing liabilities to banks and credit institutions as well as bond 
issues. short-term borrowings comprise the current portion of interest-bear-
ing long-term borrowings, i.e., the portion of the loans that is to be amortized 
in the coming fiscal years, as well as other current interest-bearing liabilities 
with a remaining tenor of less than one year.
borrowings are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and 
thereafter at amortized cost using the effective-interest method. 
hybrid bonds
in october 2020, the msek 1,500 hybrid bond was exchanged for shares 
at 90% of par value. new hybrid bonds were issued in october 2020 to the 
governments of denmark and sweden for a total amount of msek 6,000. in 
october 2020, msek 2,250 of bond debt was converted into hybrid bonds 
with a par value of msek 1,615 and the remaining amount was exchanged for 
shares.
as all of the hybrid bonds are perpetual and since sas controls the pay-
ment of interest and principal in the instruments, the bonds are classified as 
equity instruments in their entirety according to ias 32. transaction costs and 
interest attributable to the hybrid bonds are recognized directly in sharehold-
ers’ equity. 
tangible fixed assets
tangible fixed assets are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any impairment. these assets are depreciated to their estimated residual 
values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. as aircraft 
components have varying useful lives, the group has separated the compo-
nents for depreciation purposes. costs for routine aircraft maintenance as 
well as repair costs are expensed as incurred. extensive modifications such as 
the obligatory major overhauls of engines and improvements to fixed assets 
are capitalized and depreciated together with the asset to which the work 
is related over its remaining useful life. investments in leased premises are 
amortized over their estimated useful lives, but not over a period exceeding 
the remaining lease period for leased premises.
income from the sale or disposal of a tangible fixed asset is calculated as 
the difference between the net realizable value and the carrying amount. the 
gain or loss that arises is recognized in profit or loss.
depreciation is based on the following estimated periods of useful life:
asset class
depreciation
aircraft 
20 years1 
spare equipment and spare parts 
20 years1
engine components (average) 
8 years2 
workshop and aircraft servicing equipment 
5–10 years 
other equipment and vehicles 
3–5 years 
buildings 
5–50 years
1) estimated residual value after a useful life of 20 years is 10%.
2) depreciation is based on the engines’ use.
leases, accounting policies fy 2020
ifrs 16 – leases 
from 1 november 2019, sas has adopted the new standard ifrs 16 leases, 
using the modified retrospective approach. ifrs 16 replaces the previous stan-
dard, ias 17 leases. the previous classification of each lease as either an op-
erating lease or a finance lease will be replaced by a model whereby the lessee 
recognizes an asset (a right-of-use asset) and a financial liability in the balance 
sheet. the financial liability is recognized at an amount corresponding to the 
present value of future lease payments for a leased asset. as a result of sas’ 
transition approach, all right-of-use assets are on transition initially measured at 
an amount equal to the financial lease liability at the transition date plus prepaid 
lease expenses recognized at 31 october 2019. the lease expense previously 
recognized in profit or loss is replaced by an expense for depreciation of the 
right-of-use asset and an interest expense for the financial liability. 
impact on balance sheet and income statement
the main types of assets leased by sas are, in order of materiality, aircraft, 
properties and ground handling equipment. aircraft, including engines, 
represent approximately 80% of the right-of-use assets recorded at the 
transition date. the remaining part is mainly split between properties (~17%) 
and ground handling equipment (~3%).
at 1 november 2019, sas’ assets increased msek 16,718 due to the 
recognition of right-of-use assets. lease liabilities and liabilities relating to 
restoration costs increased with the same amount. adjustments have been 
made for netting of prepaid lease expenses against lease liabilities. initial 
application of ifrs 16 had no impact on shareholders’ equity on the transition, 
since the change in assets corresponds to the change in liabilities.
a major impact from applying ifrs 16 is that sas is exposed to ex-
change-rate fluctuations. most of the right-of-use assets are denominated in 
sek, whereas the corresponding lease liabilities are denominated in foreign 
currencies. lease liabilities relating to aircraft are denominated in usd, while

properties and ground handling equipment mainly are denominated in sek, 
nok and dkk. as aircraft represent approximately 80% of the liabilities, the 
currency exposure from restating usd liabilities into sek is significant.
in sas’ income statement, right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis. interest expenses relating to the lease liabilities are at their 
highest at the beginning of the lease term and decrease as the lease liability 
is paid down. 
sas’ accounting policy for ifrs 16
sas applies ifrs 16 for all leases. ifrs 16 permits exceptions for short-term 
leases and where the underlying asset is of low value (<tusd 5). short-term 
leases are leases that at the commencement date have a lease term of 12 
months or less and do not include a purchase option. lease payments relating 
to short-term leases or low value leases will be recorded in the income state-
ment over the lease term, primarily on a straight-line basis and recognized in 
ebit as lease expenses.
aircraft
lease term
the lease term used for aircraft lease agreements is normally the non-cancel-
lable period stated in the lease agreement. some lease agreements contain 
extension options or options to purchase the asset, and options are taken into 
consideration in the lease term if the group is reasonably certain to exercise 
these options. the group does not generally include options in the lease term, 
since there is a significant uncertainty as to whether they will be exercised. 
closer to the end of the lease term and the relevant option, the group has 
a better understanding of whether it is beneficial to start negotiations to 
keep the aircraft for an extended period. if the group decides to use an 
extension option, or an option to purchase the asset, the lease liability will be 
remeasured. other facts indicating that an option could be used are major 
modifications of the aircraft, such as a cabin facelift. 
discount rate
at the transition date the group has used the practical expedients in ifrs 16, 
where a single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reason-
ably similar characteristics. the rate used is the average borrowing rate for 
asset-backed aircraft financing at 1 november 2019 (4.04%). for new leases, 
the group has chosen to apply the interest rate implicit in the lease. aircraft 
lease agreements do not clearly define the implicit interest rate as defined by 
ifrs 16. since the fair values of the aircraft are provided by third parties, sas 
has decided to calculate the interest rate to be used for discounting the lease 
liabilities based on fair values available for the aircraft. the rate is calculated 
per contract. the rate implicit in the lease is defined as the rate that causes 
the sum of the present value of lease payments and the present value of the 
residual value of the underlying asset at the end of the lease to equal the fair 
value of the underlying asset.
sale & leaseback
sometimes sas sells an aircraft to a lessor and leases back that asset 
from the lessor. in each transaction the group determines if the transfer to 
the lessor qualifies as a sale according to ifrs 15. if the lease agreement 
between sas and the lessor includes an option to buy back the aircraft, 
the initial transfer of the asset to sas does not generally qualify as a sale. 
in that situation, the group continues to record the aircraft as owned in the 
balance sheet with the corresponding financial liability applying ifrs 9. if the 
transfer qualifies as a sale, sas applies the sale and leaseback rules in ifrs 
16, whereby the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback is measured at 
the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the 
right of use retained by sas. this means that only part of any gain/loss that 
relates to the transfer of the aircraft is recognized in profit or loss.
costs for restoring the asset
sas has an obligation to return the leased aircraft and their engines according 
to redelivery conditions specified in the lease agreement. if the condition of 
the aircraft and its engines, at the time of redelivery, differs from the agreed 
redelivery condition, the group needs to settle the difference in cash to the 
lessor or maintain the aircraft and its engines so that it meets the agreed 
conditions.
under ifrs 16, sas has divided the maintenance costs into two main 
groups: costs incurred independent of the usage of the aircraft and costs 
incurred dependent on the usage of the aircraft.
costs incurred independent of the usage of the aircraft are included in the 
right-of-use asset and provisions at the commencement date. these costs 
include the final check and painting required on return of the aircraft.
for costs incurred dependent on the usage of leased aircraft, sas makes 
ongoing provisions related to the use. please see detailed information in the 
section “critical accounting estimates and key sources of estimation uncer-
tainty” in note 1. maintenance costs for owned aircraft are capitalized and 
depreciated together with the asset to which the work is related. see more 
information in the section “tangible fixed assets” in note 1.
wet lease
sas wet leases aircraft capacity from external operators. until 1 novem-
ber 2019, the costs associated with these lease arrangements have been 
allocated between lease expenses for aircraft, for the actual aircraft capacity, 
and other operating expenses for wet-lease costs. ifrs 16 states that for a 
contract that is, or contains, a lease, an entity shall account for each lease 
component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease compo-
nents of the contract, unless the entity applies a practical expedient in ifrs 
16. the group accounts for each lease component separately from non-lease 
components. the consideration in the contract that has been allocated to the 
aircraft has been done based on the relative stand-alone price of the aircraft 
and the aggregate stand-alone price of the wet-lease services.
the lease term used for wet leased aircraft is the non-cancellable period 
stated in the lease agreements. some contracts contain options, but they 
have not been included since there is a significant uncertainty to whether they 
will be exercised. 
there is no material return obligation relating to the wet leased aircraft.
properties
lease term
the lease term used for property lease contracts is the non-cancellable 
period stated in the lease agreements. options to extend the lease term are 
not included, since there is a significant uncertainty as to whether they will be 
exercised.
discount rate
for property leases, the following discount rates are used:
• for lease agreements with fixed interest rates, sas applies its average 
financing cost as the rate to be used for discounting the lease liabilities 
(2.46–6.86%). the average financing cost is calculated as the relevant 
swap rate for the maturity of the contract plus sas’ average credit spread. 
• for lease agreements with floating interest rates, sas applies the sum of 
the credit spread defined in the contract plus the relevant swap rate for the 
maturity of the contract as the rate to be used for discounting lease liabil-
ities. if the spread in the contract is unknown, sas’ average credit spread 
will be applied as the spread. 
costs for restoring the asset
there is no material return obligation relating to the leased properties.
ground handling equipment
lease term
the lease term used for ground handling equipment lease contracts is nor-
mally the non-cancellable period stated in the lease agreements. some lease 
agreements contain extension options, and they have been included if the 
group’s assessment is that the options will be exercised.
lease and non-lease components
as mentioned above, an entity shall account for each lease component within 
the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract, 
unless the entity applies a practical expedient in ifrs 16. the group will 
account for each lease component separately from non-lease components 
based on the relative stand-alone price for the lease assets.
discount rate
the following discount rates are used with leases for ground handling equipment:
• for lease agreements with fixed interest rates, sas applies its average 
financing cost as the rate to be used for discounting the lease liabilities 
(2.85–5.21%). the average financing cost is calculated as the relevant 
swap rate for the maturity of the contract plus sas’ average credit spread. 
• for lease agreements with floating interest rates, sas applies the sum of 
the credit spread defined in the contract plus the relevant swap rate for the 
maturity of the contract as the rate to be used for discounting lease liabil-
ities. if the spread in the contract is unknown, sas’ average credit spread 
will be applied as the spread.

other assets
lease contracts that individually, or by asset class, are not material to the 
group have been excluded from the right-of-use asset and lease liability. 
these contracts include leases for vehicles, smaller it equipment and office 
equipment.
temporary simplification rule for rent concessions
sas applies the iasb amendments to ifrs 16 in regards to rent concessions 
that simplify how a lessee accounts for rent concessions that are a direct 
consequence of covid-19. in applying the practical expedient, changes in 
lease payments in rent concessions ending on or before 30 june 2021 are not 
treated as a modification. the practical expedient has not had any effect on 
sas’ profit or loss in the period.
the group as lessor 
rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. 
leases, accounting policies fy 2019
prior to 1 november 2019, sas applied ias 17 – leases. the following policies 
have been applied for fiscal year 2019:
sas has entered into finance and operating leases. lease contracts where 
the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of the 
asset to sas are recognized as finance leases. all other lease contracts are 
classified as operating leases.
the group as lessee 
finance leases – at the beginning of the lease term, finance leases are recog-
nized at the lower of the fair value of the lease’s asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. the corresponding liability to the lessor is in-
cluded in the balance sheet under other loans. lease payments are apportioned 
between financial expenses and reduction of the lease commitment so that a 
constant rate of interest is recognized on the remaining balance of the liability. 
the useful life of the asset corresponds to the group’s policy for owned assets.
sale and leaseback agreements are classified according to the above-men-
tioned principles for finance and operating leases. gains on the sale and 
leaseback of property and equipment that gave rise to finance leases are 
deferred and allocated over the lease term. if a sale and leaseback transaction 
results in an operating lease, and it is clear that the transaction is implement-
ed at fair value, the group recognizes any profit or loss immediately.
operating leases – fees payable under operating leases are charged to 
income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are 
also distributed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
sas’ production model, which is based on smaller flows and regional traffic 
being flown by business partners, wet leases aircraft capacity from external 
operators. the lease agreements are classified as operating leases and the 
costs are allocated between lease expenses for aircraft, for the actual aircraft 
capacity and other operating expenses for wet-lease costs. 
 
the group as lessor 
rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the relevant lease. initial direct costs incurred in negotiating 
and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
intangible assets
intangible assets comprise goodwill and capitalized expenses for systems 
development. the group is not engaged in any research and development 
(r&d) activity. 
intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet when: 
• an identifiable, non-monetary asset exists,
•  it is probable that the future financial advantages that can be attributed to 
the asset will accrue to the company, and
• the cost of the asset can be calculated in a reliable manner.
goodwill is recognized in the balance sheet as an intangible asset at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. goodwill represents the excess value over 
the fair value of the group’s share of identifiable acquired net assets at the 
acquisition date, of the cost of an acquisition, any non-controlling interests 
and fair value at the acquisition date or earlier shareholdings.
gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the remaining carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. goodwill is assessed as 
having an indefinite useful life. goodwill is allocated to the smallest possible 
cash-generating unit (cgu) and the carrying amount is tested at least once 
a year for any impairment. however, testing for impairment takes place more 
frequently if there are indications that a loss in value has occurred. a dis-
counted cash-flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cgu 
and compares the carrying value of assets of the cgu with their recoverable 
amount. these cash flows are discounted at rates that the group estimates to 
be the risk-affected weighted average cost of capital (wacc) for the particular 
businesses. any impairment is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
development costs that do not meet the criteria specified above, regarding 
when intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet, are expensed in 
the period they arise. costs for systems development are recognized as an 
asset provided that they meet the criteria specified above. capitalized devel-
opment costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 
life of the asset, which amounts to between three and 15 years. amortization 
of capitalized it system costs is included in the depreciation/amortization 
item in the statement of income.
emission rights
any emission rights received from the respective countries’ government 
agencies, without the need for payment of any consideration, are recognized 
at their nominal amounts, which in practice means that the intangible asset 
and the prepaid income are valued at zero. any emission rights purchased 
for own uses are recognized as intangible assets under current assets at cost 
after impairment. a provision is recognized in the balance sheet commen-
surate to the extent that emission rights used correspond to emission rights 
held. this provision is measured at the cost of the emission rights held. the 
provision is measured at the current market price with a corresponding cost 
in the statement of income commensurate to the extent emission rights used 
exceed the amount of emission rights held.
impairment of tangible, intangible and right-of-
use assets with determinable useful lives
the group continuously evaluates whether any indications exist of a need for 
impairment of any tangible and intangible assets with determinable useful 
lives to identify any potential need for impairment. if any such indication is 
identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated (or as part of the 
cgu to which it belongs) to determine the extent of any impairment loss. the 
recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s fair value less selling 
costs and the value in use (viu). if the estimated recoverable amount of the 
asset (or the cgu) is lower than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or the cgu) is impaired. the recoverable amount is determined 
based on the type of asset. 
at each balance-sheet date, a review is conducted to assess for indica-
tions that any earlier impairment losses no longer exist or have improved. 
when such indications exist, the recoverable amount is recalculated and the 
carrying amount is increased to the lower of the recoverable amount and the 
carrying amount that the asset would have had if the previous impairment had 
not taken place.
inventories and expendable spare parts
inventories and expendable spare parts are carried at the lower of cost or net 
realizable value. cost is calculated using the weighted average cost.
provisions and contingent liabilities
provisions are reported when the group identifies legal or informal com-
mitments as a result of historic events, where the outcome is probable, and 
where the financial resources required to settle these commitments can be 
estimated with reasonable certainty.
a restructuring obligation is considered to have arisen and a provision 
for the obligation is recognized when the group has adopted a detailed and 
formal restructuring plan. the plan must have been communicated to affected 
parties and have been commenced or publicly announced.
remuneration of employees
pensions
the group has various pension plans for its employees. these vary consid-
erably due to different legislation and agreements on occupational pension 
systems in the individual countries. previously, most personnel pension plans 
in scandinavia were defined-benefit plans. in november 2012, new collective 
agreements were signed with aircraft crew. among other things, the new 
agreements mean that the defined-benefit pension plans were, largely, re-
placed with defined-contribution pension plans effective as of the first quarter 
of fiscal year 2014.

for pension plans where the employer has accepted responsibility for a de-
fined contribution, the obligation to employees ceases when the contractual 
premiums have been paid. where defined-benefit pensions have been agreed, 
the commitments do not cease until the contractual pensions have been 
paid. the liability or asset recognized in the balance sheet for defined-benefit 
pension plans is the current value of the defined-benefit obligation at the 
end of the reporting period after deduction of the fair value of plan assets. 
the defined-benefit plan obligation is calculated each year by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. pension costs for the year 
for defined-benefit pension plans comprise the present value of the current 
service cost plus net interest, which is calculated using the discount rate on 
the defined-benefit pension liability or pension assets, and recognized as a 
personnel expense in ebit. all deviations in estimates are immediately recog-
nized in other comprehensive income.
termination benefits
termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before 
the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary 
redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognizes severance 
pay when such an obligation exists according to employment contracts or for 
termination as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
long-term incentive plan
at 12 march 2020, the annual general meeting in sas resolved in line with 
the board’s proposal to implement a long-term incentive plan for all full-time 
and part-time sas employees (with the exception of group management). 
the incentive plan has not had any accounting impact as the performance 
condition (roic) has not been met.
revenue recognition
the recognition of contractual revenue from customers follows a five-step 
model that requires revenue to be recognized when control over goods and 
services are transferred to the customer. all of the group’s customer contracts 
have been analyzed using the five-step model. the performance obligations 
identified are fulfilled at a defined point in time. 
passenger revenue
when sas or another airline provides the transportation, in other words the 
flight, the group meets its performance obligation toward the customer and 
the passenger revenue is recognized in the statement of income. during the 
period from the sale of an airline ticket until the completion of the flight, airline 
tickets sold are recognized as a short-term unearned transportation liability in 
the consolidated balance sheet. the group assesses the estimated unearned 
transportation liability on an ongoing basis. more information is available 
under “other traffic revenue.”
rebooking fees, that is fees for changing the time or destination of a 
booked airline ticket, are recognized as revenue in conjunction with the actual 
flight taking place. 
charter revenue
sas has charter flight agreements with certain customers. as with passenger 
revenue, the group discharges its performance obligation to the customer 
when transportation has been provided. accordingly, charter revenue is 
recognized in the statement of income when the transportation has been 
provided.
mail and freight revenue
the group provides cargo services on both passenger planes and commercial 
cargo flights. the performance obligation to the customer is discharged in 
conjunction with the provision of transportation. accordingly, mail and freight 
revenue is recognized in the statement of income when the transportation 
has been provided.
other traffic revenue
other traffic revenue mainly includes preseating, excess baggage, unused 
tickets and revenue adjustments. preseating and excess baggage are 
examples of ancillary revenue that are closely linked to air travel. these are 
recognized as revenue in conjunction with the actual flight.
the group prepares monthly assessments of unutilized airline tickets. 
unutilized and expired tickets are recognized as other traffic revenue based 
on historic usage data for unutilized tickets for the last 24 months. any 
differences between previous months’ assessments and actual outcomes are 
recognized in the statement of income.
the group periodically evaluates the estimated short-term unearned 
transportation liability and records any resulting adjustments in other traffic 
revenue in the period in which the assessments are completed. these adjust-
ments relate primarily to refunds, exchanges, transactions with other airlines 
and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the 
sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price.
other operating revenue
other operating revenue mainly includes revenue from in-flight sales, ground 
handling services, technical maintenance and sales of eurobonus points.
in-flight sales are recognized as revenue in conjunction with the actual sale. 
revenue from the performance of ground handling services and technical 
maintenance is recognized when the services are performed. 
sales of eurobonus points to credit card partners are recognized as 
revenue in the same period that eurobonus members use their credit cards 
and a eurobonus liability arises in the consolidated balance sheet. further 
information on the eurobonus liability follows.
loyalty program – eurobonus
membership in the group’s eurobonus loyalty program enables customers 
to earn bonus points when they fly, rent a car, stay at a certain hotel, use a 
eurobonus credit card, and when making purchases at the eurobonus store or 
other selected stores.
eurobonus members primarily earn points through purchasing airline 
tickets or when using a eurobonus credit card. as customers earn points, the 
eurobonus liability increases in the consolidated balance sheet together with 
a corresponding decrease in revenue. the portion of the price allocated to the 
eurobonus liability is measured at the stand-alone price of the points relative 
to the stand-alone price for the service or goods on which the points were 
earned, for example airline tickets. when the points are used by eurobonus 
members, the liability on the consolidated balance sheet decreases together 
with a corresponding increase in revenue. accordingly, used eurobonus 
points are recognized as revenue when the service or goods for which the 
points are used are transferred to the eurobonus member.
contract assets and liabilities
ifrs 15 has introduced the terms “contract assets” and “contract liabilities.” 
the group presents contracts in the balance sheet as contract liabilities or 
contract assets depending on the relationship between the group’s perfor-
mance and the customers’ payments at the reporting date. accrued income 
is included under contractual assets, since the group meets the performance 
requirement prior to receiving payment from customers. the unearned 
transportation liability and the loyalty program are recognized as contract lia-
bilities since payments are received from customers before the performance 
obligation is discharged by the group. information about the discharge of per-
formance obligations can be found earlier in this section under the headings 
“passenger revenue” and “loyalty program – eurobonus.”
as before, the unearned transportation liability is presented on a separate 
line in the consolidated balance sheet, while the loyalty program is presented 
under other liabilities (long-term). refer to note 25 for disclosures by the 
group pertaining to contract assets and liabilities. 
 
government grants and contracts 
some of the legal units in the sas group received support for temporary 
reductions in the workforce as a result of covid-19 from the governments of 
denmark, norway and sweden during the fiscal year. in accordance with ias 
20, state grants are reported in the statement of income when there is rea-
sonable assurance that the company will fulfill the conditions associated with 
the grants and that the grants will be received. government grants have been 
reported as a reduction to personnel expenses in the periods for which the 
grant is intended to compensate for a total of msek 788. sas has also applied 
for support from the danish, swedish and norwegian states regarding com-
pensation for fixed costs and msek 589 has been reported as a reduction of 
other external expenses. aside from this, the norwegian state has purchased 
capacity from sas and other carriers in norway on a commercial basis in 
order to maintain air services within norway, which amounts to msek 625.
borrowing expenses
borrowing expenses that arise in operations are expensed in the period 
in which they are incurred. borrowing expenses on aircraft pre-delivery 
payments (pdps) are capitalized as part of the process of obtaining qualified 
production resources. if a decision is made to sell and lease back an asset, 
capitalization of interest expense ceases. amortization of capitalized borrow-
ing expenses commences when aircraft are put into service, as per the main 
principle for aircraft.

taxes
current tax for the period is based on net income for the period, adjusted for 
non-tax-deductible costs and non-taxable income. the current tax is calculat-
ed on the basis of tax rates applying on the closing date.
deferred tax is recognized according to the balance sheet method whereby 
temporary differences, differences between the recognized and fiscal value 
of assets or liabilities, result in a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability. 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences liable to 
tax, while deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent it is probable that a 
taxable surplus will be created against which the deductible temporary differ-
ence can be utilized or before the right to utilize the loss carryforward is lost.
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences at-
tributable to investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies except in cases 
where the group can control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences, 
and it is probable that such reversal will not take place in the foreseeable future.
deferred tax is estimated on the basis of the tax rates and fiscal regulations 
that have been decided or announced as of the closing date. deferred tax is 
expensed, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other com-
prehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized net if the 
items pertain to the same tax authority.
critical accounting estimates and  
key sources of estimation uncertainty
the preparation of financial statements and application of accounting policies 
are often based on management’s assessments, or on estimates and assump-
tions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. these estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered 
relevant. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which the change is made if 
the change affects only that period, or in the period in which the change is made 
and future periods if the change affects both the current and future periods.
below is an overall description of the accounting policies affected by such 
estimates or assumptions that are expected to have the most substantial im-
pact on the group’s reported earnings and financial position. for information 
about the carrying amount on the closing date, see the balance sheet with 
accompanying notes.
estimated useful lives of tangible fixed assets  
the group management periodically reviews the appropriateness of the useful 
lives of its tangible fixed assets. the review is based on the current condition 
of the assets, the estimated period during which they will continue to bring 
economic benefit to the group, historic information on similar assets and 
industry trends.
any changes in the useful life of property and equipment are recognized 
prospectively in profit or loss.
impairment of assets
the group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets are impaired. in making the impair-
ment assessment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are 
allocated to an appropriate cgu.
management is required to make certain assumptions in estimating the 
value of the assets, including the timing and value of cash flows to be gener-
ated from the assets. the cash-flow projections are based on reasonable as-
sumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the set of economic 
conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset and are 
based on the most recent financial plan that management has approved. due 
to its subjective nature, these estimates will likely differ from future actual 
results of operations and cash flows, and any such difference may result in 
impairment in future periods.
pensions
pension assumptions are an important element in the actuarial methods used 
to measure pension commitments and value assets, and can significantly 
affect the recognized pension obligation, pension assets and the annual 
pension cost. the most critical assumptions are the discount rate, inflation 
and expected salary adjustments. 
the measurement to be applied under ias 19 when measuring defined-ben-
efit plans is known as the projected unit credit method. this method requires 
several assumptions (actuarial parameters) for calculating the present value 
of the defined-benefit obligation. actuarial assumptions comprise both demo-
graphic and financial assumptions. since assumptions must be neutral and 
mutually compatible, they should be neither imprudent nor overly conserva-
tive. they should reflect the economic relationships between factors such as 
inflation, rates of salary increase, the return on plan assets and discount rates. 
this means that they should be realistic, based on known financial relations 
and reflect sas’ best assessment of the factors that will determine the ultimate 
cost of providing post-employment benefits, that is pension costs. 
in calculating pension obligations, the current service cost and return on 
plan assets, locally set parameters are applied in the respective countries on 
the basis of the local market situation and expected future trends. this means 
that the parameters are based on market expectations at the end of the report-
ing period regarding the time period in which the obligation will be settled.
the discount rate has been determined on the basis of market yields on 
high-quality corporate bonds (preferably mortgage bonds with a minimum 
aa rating). the tenor of the bonds reflects the estimated timing and size of 
pension payments (duration) as well as the currencies these payments are 
expected to be made in.
other financial assumptions are based on anticipated developments during 
the term of the obligation. the assessment of future salary adjustments cor-
responds to the assumed rate of inflation in the respective countries and life 
expectancies are set under dus14 for sweden and k2018 for norway, refer to 
note 15 for additional information.
the interest expense on the obligation and the expected return on plan 
assets are reported as “net interest,” which is calculated using the discount 
rate. sas classifies this net interest as a personnel expense and recognizes 
the net interest expense in profit or loss.
deviations can arise if the discount rate changes (a lower discount rate 
increases the present value of the pension liability and the annual pension 
cost), or if actual inflation levels, salary adjustments and life expectancies de-
viate from the group’s assumptions. any change in these assumptions could 
potentially result in a significant change to the pension assets, obligations and 
pension costs in future periods.
during the year, the discount rate was lowered for all countries with the 
exception of denmark, which retained the same discount rate. during the fis-
cal year, the inflation assumption was lowered for the swedish pension plans 
from 1.9% to 1.5%. the total impact, primarily from changed discount rates 
and inflation, entailed a positive impact on other comprehensive income of 
sek 0.2 billion. the return on plan assets has been higher than the discount 
rate, which entailed a positive impact on other comprehensive income of sek 
0.4 billion. moreover, a positive item of sek 0.2 billion was recognized under 
the item experience gains/losses and was mainly attributable to the reduction 
in the number of active people during the year.
sensitivity to changes in individual parameters can be estimated as follows: 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate of interest has approxi-
mately a sek 3.2 billion impact on the obligation and a one percentage point 
change in the inflation assumption has an impact of about sek 3.0 billion. 
deferred taxes
the group recognizes deferred tax assets at each balance-sheet date to 
the extent that it is probable that they will be utilized in future periods. this 
determination is based on estimates of future profitability. a change in these 
estimates could result in a decrease in deferred tax assets in future periods 
for assets that are currently recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. 
in estimating levels of future profitability, historical results of operations 
in recent years are considered and, if necessary, the implementation of 
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future profitability 
are considered. if future profitability is less than the amount calculated in 
determining the deferred tax asset, then a decrease in deferred tax assets 
will be required, with a corresponding charge in profit or loss, except in cases 
where it is related to items recognized directly in equity. if future profitability 
exceeds the level that has been assumed in calculating deferred tax assets, 
an additional deferred tax asset can be recognized, with a corresponding 
credit in profit or loss, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from a 
business combination.
a change in these estimates could also result in the impairment of deferred 
tax assets in future periods for assets that are currently recognized in the 
balance sheet.

assumption regarding right-of-use assets – aircraft
sas makes ongoing provisions related to use for undertakings arising in con-
nection with aircraft leasing. the undertakings primarily pertain to engines, 
but also include landing gear, air frames and apus. the financial impact is 
complex to assess as it depends on a large number of factors. since provisions 
are made on an ongoing basis for larger mandatory overhauls of engines, 
landing gear, air frames and apus, the risk of a return having a material impact 
on the group’s earnings is reduced. 
hybrid bonds
as all of the hybrid bonds are perpetual and since sas controls the payment 
of interest and principal in the instruments, the bonds are classified as equity 
instruments in their entirety according to ias 32. 
litigations
the group is involved in litigations and other claims in the ordinary course of 
its business activities. management judgment is required in determining the 
likelihood of the outcome. the actual effects of the outcome could differ from 
the management’s estimate, which would impact the group’s earnings (see 
also, the report by the board of directors: legal issues).
new and amended standards and interpretations  
that have not entered force and have not been  
adopted early by the group
no material new and amended standards, agenda decisions and interpre-
tations have been issued for the accounting of the group for fiscal years 
beginning on or after 1 november 2020.
parent company’s accounting policies
the parent company has prepared its financial statements according to the 
swedish annual accounts act and the swedish financial reporting board’s 
recommendation rfr 2 accounting for legal entities as well as applicable 
statements from the swedish financial reporting board. under rfr 2, the 
parent company, in preparing the annual financial statements for the legal en-
tity, applies all eu-approved ifrss and statements insofar as this is possible 
within the framework of the swedish annual accounts act and the swedish 
pension obligations vesting act and with respect to the connection between 
accounting and taxation. the recommendations specify which exceptions and 
additions are to be made from and to ifrs.
the differences between the group’s and the 
parent company’s accounting policies are listed 
below: 
pensions: current pension premiums are recognized as an expense. 
shares in subsidiaries and affiliated companies: recognized at cost. 
acquisition-related expenses for subsidiaries, which are expensed in the 
consolidated financial statements, are included as part of the cost for holdings 
in subsidiaries. 
other shares and participations: recognized at cost.

salaries, remuneration and social security

the sas group’s total payroll expenses amounted to msek 8,252 (9,495), of 
which social security expenses comprised msek 1,132 (1,324) and pensions 
msek 859 (875).
salaries, remuneration and social security expenses included restructuring 
costs of msek 324 (230).
during fiscal year 2020, sas has used temporary lay-offs extensively in 
those countries where state support or furlough rules have applied, primarily 
denmark, norway and sweden. where the support for temporary lay-offs 
has entailed sas defraying the payroll expenses and receiving state support, 
the support has not been deducted from the payroll expenses in the table 
below, which has resulted in the cost per fte increasing dramatically when 
comparing the fiscal years. only when the lay-off rules have entailed a direct 
reduction in salaries is this reflected in a lower payroll expense.
moreover, sas made around 5,000 redundancies in fiscal year 2020, the 
majority of which received their final salary in fy 2020, depending on their 
notice period.

determined by the annual general shareholders’ meeting (agm), which also 
approves the policies applied for the remuneration of senior executives.
board of directors
at the agm of sas ab on 12 march 2020, fees were set for the remuneration 
of board members and for work on board committees as follows: 
board chairman
tsek 630
board first vice chairman
tsek 420
other board members (9)
tsek 320 per member

tsek 100
other members of audit committee (2)

tsek 80
other members of remuneration committee (1)
tsek 27
the board of sas ab decided in favor of a 20% reduction in fees as a support 
measure due to the decline in revenue brought on by covid-19.
with the exception of the employee representatives and their deputies, no 
board member was employed by the sas group in fiscal year 2020. no board 
member not employed by the sas group received any remuneration or ben-
efit from any sas group companies beyond customary airline-industry travel 
benefits and the fees received for board and committee duties. 
policies
the following remuneration policies adopted by the 2020 agm have been 
applied in fiscal year 2020 in regard to senior executives in the sas group. 
in this connection, senior executives refers to the president and the other 
members of the sas group management. 
total remuneration should be market-based and competitive and relate to 
responsibility and authority. remuneration consists of fixed salary, variable 
remuneration by separate agreement, and other benefits and pension. the 
guidelines apply for employment contracts agreed after the 2020 agm and 
amendments to existing employment contracts made thereafter. 
remuneration of senior executives is to consist of a fixed annual cash 
salary, which reflects the position’s requirements with respect to qualifica-
tions, responsibilities, complexity and the manner in which it serves to reach 
the business objectives. the fixed salary also reflects the performance of the 
executive and can thus be both individual and differentiated. in addition to 
fixed salary, senior executives reporting to the president may, by separate 
agreement, receive variable salary (annual incentive systems) when fulfilling 
decided performance criteria, on condition that their fixed salaries are 
frozen for review for a specific period after payment of variable salary. any 
variable salary consists of an annual variable cash salary and may amount to 
a maximum of 20% of the fixed annual salary. criteria fulfillment for awarding 
variable salary must be measured over a period of one year. 
other benefits, including company car, travel benefits and health 
insurance, are market-based and only constitute a limited part of the total 
remuneration. premiums and other costs associated with such benefits may 
amount to a maximum of 10% of the fixed annual salary.

for the president, pension benefits, including health insurance, are 
defined-contribution with premiums not exceeding 40% of the fixed annual 
salary. for other members of group management, pension benefits, including 
health insurance, are defined-contribution unless the executive is encom-
passed by a defined-benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement 
provisions. premiums for defined-contribution pensions are not to exceed 
30% of the fixed annual salary. variable remuneration qualifies for pension 
benefits to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement provisions 
applicable to the executive (applies to sweden and defined-contribution 
pension). in such case, the premiums for defined-contribution pensions are 
not to exceed 36% of the fixed annual salary as a result of pension provisions 
for variable salary. 
for the president and other members of group management, the notice 
period is six months in case of termination by the executive. in case of 
termination by the company the maximum notice period is 12 months. in 
case of termination by the company, severance pay is payable in an amount 
corresponding to a maximum of one year’s fixed salary less any remuneration 
received by the executive from new employments or assignments. 
the board can depart from the guidelines if, in an individual case, particular 
reasons exist for so doing.
limitations to the application of remuneration 
policies resulting from the recapitalization 
pursuant to the european commission decision dated 14 august 2020, and 
until such time as 75% of the government-subscribed instruments as part 
of the recapitalization completed in october 2020 have been redeemed or 
sold, the senior executives are not entitled to increased salaries. moreover, no 
variable compensation will be paid to senior executives.
 in the event of any outcome from future ais (annual incentives systems) 
to senior executives pursuant to the company’s remuneration policies, the 
ais remuneration will be reserved and not distributed until such time as 75% 
of the government-subscribed instruments as part of the recapitalization 
completed in october 2020 have been redeemed or sold.
president and ceo
president and ceo rickard gustafson has the following remuneration compo-
nents in his employment contract: 
•  an annual salary, which is not normally subject to an annual salary review. 
the annual salary was last revised after a decision by the board in decem-
ber 2019 whereupon it amounted to tsek 13,091. as with other senior 
executives, his salary was reduced 20% over the first three months of the 
pandemic (march–may), resulting in an annual salary in fiscal year 2020 of 
tsek 12,332. 
•  a defined-contribution pension plan where 40% of the fixed salary is paid 
as premiums to an agreed pension insurance. the retirement age is 65.   
•   other benefits include company car, travel benefits, health insurance and 
group life insurance.
•   the notice period is six months in the event the president resigns and 12 
months if the termination of employment is by sas ab. severance pay for 
the president in the event employment is terminated by sas ab for reasons 
other than material breach of contract, gross neglect of his duties as presi-
dent or criminal acts against the sas group is payable in an amount equiva-
lent to 12 months of salary. should new employment be obtained within 12 
months of employment ending, the severance pay awarded is reduced by an 
amount corresponding to the remuneration received from the new position. 
other senior executives
the remaining current members of group management have defined-contri-
bution pension plans where a pension provision of up to 30% of fixed base 
salary is made. the retirement age is 65 for all of the current members of the 
group management. 
the notice period is six months in the event that the senior executive 
resigns and 12 months if employment is terminated by sas ab. severance 
pay is payable to the senior executives in the event employment is terminated 
by sas ab for reasons other than material breach of contract, gross neglect 
of the senior executive’s duties or criminal acts against the sas group in an 
amount equivalent to 12 months’ salary, with offsetting against income from 
any other appointment or engagement. severance pay is also payable on the 
resignation of a senior executive when the responsibilities or authorities of 
the senior executive are materially changed through organizational changes. 
however, severance pay in the above case is not payable if the senior execu-
tive is offered another relevant position in the sas group.     
senior executives at sas and executives in charge of subsidiaries voluntari-
ly accepted a 20% pay decrease over the first three months of the pandemic 
(march–may) in fiscal year 2020 as a support measure due to the decline in 
revenue brought on by covid-19. 
other
for other standard managerial contracts at the sas group, total remuneration 
must be market-based and competitive and must be in relation to responsibil-
ity and authority.
in fiscal year 2020, total remuneration comprised fixed salary, other bene-
fits and pension. some 30 managers have participated in an annual incentive 
system for 2020. as a result of the negative financial impact of covid-19, 
payments amounted to sek 0. 
moreover, a variable remuneration model was introduced for manage-
ment and employees in the sales organization in 2013. the variable salary 
component is based on outcomes in relation to predetermined individual sales 
targets that are set in a target contract and is capped at two months’ salary.
discussion and decision-making process
the issue of the directors’ fees is discussed by the nomination committee, 
which consists of representatives elected at the agm. the nomination com-
mittee presents its proposal concerning directors’ fees to the shareholders’ 
meeting for resolution.
the board of directors has established a remuneration committee. the 
committee’s duties include preparing principles for remuneration to group 
management and the board of directors’ decisions to propose guidelines for 
remuneration to senior executives. the board of directors prepares proposals 
for new guidelines at least every fourth year, and submits it to the agm for 
resolution. these guidelines apply until new guidelines have been adopted by 
the general meeting. the remuneration committee also monitors and evalu-
ates programs for variable remuneration to group management, the applica-
tion of the guidelines to senior executives as well as the current remuneration 
structures and compensation levels in the company. remuneration to the 
president is decided by the board of directors in line with approved policies 
following preparation and recommendation by the remuneration commit-
tee. remuneration to other senior executives is decided by the president 
in line with approved policies and after consultation with the remuneration 
committee. the members of the remuneration committee are independent 
in relation to the company and group management. the president and other 
members of group management do not participate in the board of directors’ 
discussions and decisions on remuneration-related matters that pertain to 
them.
the remuneration committee held three minuted meetings in fiscal year 
2020.

on the closing date the group had unutilized loss carryforwards of just less 
than msek 16,000 (8,000). based on these loss carryforwards, the group 
recognized a deferred tax asset of msek 2,132 (1,684). deferred tax assets 
are recognized to the extent that there are factors indicating that taxable 
profits will be created. the assessment of the respective group companies’ fu-
ture profit performance is based on earnings reported in recent years as well 
as improved profitability prospects. of recognized loss carryforwards totaling 
msek 2,132, msek 673 pertains to operations in denmark, msek 257 to nor-
way, msek 1,086 to sweden and msek 116 to ireland. for loss carryforwards 
with a corresponding tax value amounting to msek 1,259 (14), no deferred 
tax asset is recognized due to uncertainty as regards future profit earnings. 
there are no expiration dates for the loss carryforwards.
deferred tax liabilities mainly pertain to fixed assets, where fiscal values 
are lower than accounting values. in the future, a temporary difference per-
taining to a fixed asset will change when the carrying amount and fiscal value 
matches or, alternatively, when the fixed asset is divested and a higher taxable 
gain arises. pensions also give rise to deferred tax liabilities, since accounting 
and fiscal values are treated differently. sas has chosen to recognize deferred 
tax net in the balance sheet as there is a legal right to offset at the same time 
as there is a strong legal connection between the deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities.
no provision has been made for deferred tax on temporary differences 
relating to non-distributed profits in subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
since these profits will not be distributed within the foreseeable future, or al-
ternatively a distribution can be made without the profits being subject to tax.

testing for impairment of intangible assets  
the value of the group’s intangible assets has been estimated through 
comparison with the recoverable amount, which is based on the group’s 
cash-generating value in use based on five-years’ cash flow in the group’s 
business plan. a growth rate of +1.0% (+1.0) and a cost trend of -7.6% (-0.7) 
have been adopted for the period beyond the plan period. 
the projected cash flows are based on assumptions regarding volume 
trends, unit revenue, operating margins and discount rates, which have been 
established by the management based on historical experience and market 
data. the policies applied in the above assessment are unchanged from the 
assessment in fiscal year 2019. the discount rate has been estimated based 
on a weighted capital cost of 9.6% (9.99) before tax, and of 8.4% (8.7) after 
tax. to support the impairment tests performed on goodwill in the group, a 
comprehensive analysis was performed of the sensitivity in the variables used 
in the model. a weakening of any of the significant assumptions included in 
the business plans or a weakening of the annual growth rate in revenue and 
operating margins beyond the plan period, or an increase in the discount 
rate that, individually, is reasonably probable, shows that a margin still exists 
between the recoverable amount and carrying amount. management there-
fore determined that there was no need for impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets at the close of october 2020.

sas recognizes aircraft in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets or as 
right-of-use assets. leases defined in accordance with ifrs 16 are entered in 
the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (see note 13).  in cases where sas 
acquires aircraft to thereafter sell and lease back, and where it is (essentially) 
certain that the asset will be bought back at the end of the period, the related 
liability that arises is treated as a financial liability pursuant to ifrs 9 and the 
asset is treated as a tangible asset pursuant to ias 16.
contractual purchase commitments
the group had the following commitments relating to future acquisition of 
tangible fixed assets. at 31 october 2020, contracted orders amounted to 
35 airbus a320neo and four airbus a350-900 aircraft with delivery between 
2020 and 2025 amounting to a total future purchase commitment, including 
spares, of musd 2,140. at the closing date, other purchase commitments 
totaled msek 16 (5). sas has also entered into contracts for four a320neo 
and two a321lr aircraft that will be leased. 
1) the insured value of aircraft at 31 october 2020 amounted to msek 48,775. this includes the insured value of leased aircraft in the amount of msek 29,963.
2) modifications of leased aircraft are included in planned residual value in the amount of msek 160 (190).
3) at 31 october 2020, aircraft depreciation and impairment amounted to msek -2,697 (-1,642) and included impairment of msek -1,040 (-93) pertaining to aircraft under phase-out, see also note 5.

as of 1 november, sas has reported leases in accordance with ifrs 16 leases and the previous standard, ias 17 leases, was replaced. the previous classifica-
tion of each lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease has been replaced by a model whereby the lessee recognizes an asset (a right-of-use asset) and 
an interest-bearing lease liability in the balance sheet. in conjunction with the transition to ifrs 16, sas reported a carrying amount for right-of-use-assets of 
msek 16,718 as per 1 november. for information on sas’ interest-bearing lease liabilities, see notes 24 and 32.
new contracts during the year with terms longer than 12 months are recognized under the line item “new contracts” and mainly comprised leases for 11 new 
a320neo and one a321lr aircraft. lease modifications mainly pertain to wet-lease contracts where adjustments to the contract term have been made during 
the year. impairment for the year encompassed eight aircraft (four 737-800, three 737-700 and one a330 aircraft), which were written down to zero.

defined-benefit pension plans
previously, most personnel pension plans in scandinavia were defined-benefit 
plans. in november 2012, new collective agreements were signed with aircraft 
crew in scandinavia. among other things, the new agreements mean that 
the defined-benefit pension plans were, largely, replaced with defined-con-
tribution pension plans effective as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. 
defined-contribution pension plans are currently in place for the majority 
of personnel in denmark and norway, and in sweden for aircraft crew, 
younger salaried employees and personnel covered by the saf-lo collective 
agreement. the majority of the remaining defined-benefit pension plans are 
secured through insurance companies in the respective countries. in sweden, 
pension plans are mainly placed with alecta and euroben, in denmark with 
danica and in norway with dnb. a substantial portion of sas employees in 
sweden continue to be covered by an itp pension reinsured by alecta (the 
alecta plan). premiums for defined-benefit retirement pensions are individual 
and depend, inter alia, on the insured party’s age, salary and previously vested 
pension rights. expected fees in fiscal year 2021 for defined-benefit pension 
plans under the alecta plan are expected to amount to about msek 35. the 
collective consolidation level comprises the market value of alecta’s assets as 
a percentage of insurance undertakings estimated pursuant to alecta’s actu-
arial assumptions, which do not comply with ias 19. collective consolidation, 
in the form of a collective consolidation level, is normally permitted to range 
between 125% and 175%. if alecta’s collective consolidation level falls below 
125% or exceeds 175%, actions must be taken to create conditions enabling 
changes in the present value of  
defined-benefit plan obligations

the consolidation level to revert to the normal interval. alecta’s surplus can be 
allocated to the policy holders or the insured parties if the collective consoli-
dation level exceeds 175%. however, alecta applies reductions in premiums 
to avoid an excessive surplus arising. at the end of the fiscal year, alecta’s sur-
plus in the form of the consolidated collective consolidation level was 144% 
(142). according to a statement by the swedish financial reporting board, 
ufr 10, this constitutes a multi-employer defined-benefit plan and enterpris-
es covered by a multi-employer pension plan classified as defined-benefit 
must account for their proportional share of the plan’s obligations, plan assets 
and costs in the same way as for any other defined-benefit plan. sas is provid-
ed with information that enables sas to report its proportional allocated share 
of the alecta plan’s commitments, plan assets and costs in accordance with 
ias 19 rules regarding defined-benefit pension plans. sas therefore reports 
net defined-benefit assets since the future economic benefits are available to 
sas in the form of future reductions in premiums, cover for future pension 
indexing or a cash refund.
ias 19 – employee benefits entails that all deviations in estimates are to 
be immediately recognized in other comprehensive income. furthermore, 
the discount rate on the defined-benefit plan obligation or pension asset 
is calculated net, and this net interest expense is recognized by sas as a 
personnel expense in profit or loss. sas reports special payroll tax in line with 
the rules in ias 19, which means that those actuarial assumptions made in the 
calculation of defined-benefit pension plans must also include taxes payable 
on pension benefits. 
as per 31 october 2020, the remaining pension plans in sweden reported 
a surplus of just over sek 2.7 billion and, accordingly, special payroll tax was 
recognized for the surplus. at 31 october 2020, special payroll tax totaled 
about sek 0.7 billion (0.5).

during the year, the discount rate was lowered for all countries with the ex-
ception of denmark, which retained the same discount rate. during the fiscal 
year, the inflation assumption was lowered for the swedish pension plans 
from 1.9% to 1.5%. the total impact, primarily from changed discount rates 
and inflation, entailed a positive impact on other comprehensive income of 
sek 0.2 billion. the return on plan assets has been higher than the discount 
rate, which entailed a positive impact on other comprehensive income of sek 
0.4 billion. moreover, a positive item of sek 0.2 billion was recognized under 
the item experience gains/losses and was mainly attributable to the reduction 
in the number of active people during the year.
actuarial assumptions
the measurement to be applied under ias 19 when measuring defined-ben-
efit plans is known as the projected unit credit method. this method requires 
several assumptions (actuarial parameters) for calculating the present value 
of the defined-benefit obligation. actuarial assumptions comprise both demo-
graphic and financial assumptions. since assumptions must be neutral and 
mutually compatible, they should be neither imprudent nor overly conserva-
tive. they should reflect the economic relationships between factors such as 
inflation, rates of salary increase, the return on plan assets and discount rates. 
this means that they should be realistic, based on known financial relations 
and reflect sas’ best assessment of the factors that will determine the ulti-
mate cost of providing post-employment benefits, that is pension costs.
in calculating pension obligations, the current service cost and return on 
plan assets, locally set parameters are applied in the respective countries 
on the basis of the local market situation and expected future trends. this 
means that the parameters are based on market expectations at the end of 
the reporting period regarding the time period in which the obligation will be 
settled.
the discount rate has been determined on the basis of market yields on 
high-quality corporate bonds (preferably mortgage bonds with a minimum 
aa rating). the tenor of the bonds reflects the estimated timing and size of 
pension payments (duration) as well as the currencies these payments are 
expected to be made in.
other financial assumptions are based on anticipated developments during 
the term of the obligation. the assessment of future salary adjustments cor-
responds to the assumed rate of inflation in the respective countries and life 
expectancies are set under dus14 (dus14) for sweden and k2018 (k2018) 
for norway.

note 22 shareholders’ equity
share capital
sas ab has three classes of shares: common shares, subordinated shares 
and class c shares.
at 31 october 2020, there were 7,260,062,410 common shares issued 
with a quotient value of about sek 1.19, representing a registered share 
capital of sek 8,645,046,807.5. a further issue of common shares was 
completed after the end of the fiscal year. at 30 november 2020, there were 
7,266,039,292 common shares issued with a quotient value of about sek 
1.19, representing a registered share capital of sek 8,649,529,469.
there are no subordinated shares or class c shares issued or outstanding. 
common shares and subordinated shares entitle the holders to one vote each. 
each class c share entitles the holder to one-tenth of a vote.
the maximum number of common shares and subordinated shares that may 
be issued is limited to a number that corresponds with 100% of the company’s 
share capital. the maximum number of class c shares that may be issued is 
limited to 5% of the share capital. the common shares provide shareholders 
the rights set out in the swedish companies act and the articles of association. 
subordinated shares provide shareholders the right to participate in and vote 
at the company’s shareholders’ meetings. subordinated shares do not entitle 
shareholders to dividends or participation in bonus issues. if subordinated 
shares are redeemed or the company is dissolved and its assets distributed, 
holders of subordinated shares are treated as holders of common shares and 
receive an equal share in the company’s assets, although not at an amount 
higher than the quotient value of the subordinated shares index-adjusted from 
the first date of registration of the subordinated shares until the date of the 
payment of the redemption amount or the date of the distribution with an inter-
est-rate factor corresponding to stibor 90 days plus two percentage points.
class c shares do not entitle the holder to dividends. if the company is dis-
solved, class c shares entitle the holder to equal parts of the company’s assets 
as the company’s common shares, however not for an amount that exceeds 
the share’s quotient value. the company’s board has the right to reduce the 
share capital by redeeming all class c shares. if such a decision is taken, class 
c shareholders are obligated to redeem all of their class c shares for an amount 
corresponding to the quotient value. the redemption amount is to be paid 
immediately. class c shares held as treasury shares by the company will, on 
demand by the board, be eligible for conversion to common shares. thereafter, 
the conversion is to be registered with the swedish companies registration 
office without delay and is effective when it has been registered with the reg-
ister of companies and noted in the central securities depository register.
to ensure that the ownership circumstances of the company comply with 
the requirements stipulated in bilateral air traffic agreements or in laws or 
regulations pertaining to the state of air traffic in the eea, the board is enti-
tled, pursuant to the articles of association, to make a decision on mandatory 
redemption of shares held by shareholders outside of scandinavia without 
refund to affected shareholders. where such a redemption is not possible or 
where the board finds it inadequate and following approval by a shareholders’ 
meeting supported by not less than half of the votes cast, the issued warrants 
may be used to issue subordinated shares to scandinavian shareholders to 
dilute the non-scandinavian shareholdings to the requisite level to ensure 
compliance with the aforementioned regulations.

subordinated loans
a subordinated loan of mchf 200 was issued during fiscal year 1986. there is no set maturity date for this loan. the 
interest rate is fixed for ten-year periods and amounts to 0.625% from january 2016. sas has an exclusive right to 
cancel this loan every fifth year. when the loan is canceled in connection with an interest-rate reset, sas is entitled 
to repay the loan at 100% of its nominal value. if it is canceled five years after an interest-rate reset, the loan must be 
repaid at 102.5% of the nominal value.
in previous years, sas repurchased mchf 73 of the bonds, after which the balance of the loan is mchf 127 (127), 
with a countervalue of msek 1,237 (1,240). 
the bond is listed on the basel stock exchange, geneva stock exchange and swiss exchange. on the closing date, 
its total market value (including credit risk) amounted to mchf 29 (47), with a countervalue of msek 278 (461). fair 
value has been established entirely by the use of official price quotes.
increases every two years until the eighth year. no further increase in the margin applies after the eighth year. the state 
hybrid bonds are subordinated and only senior to the share capital. 
the hybrid bond carries a floating coupon of 6m stibor plus a margin of 440 bps for the first year. after the first 
year, the margin increases in steps until the 11th year. no further increase in the margin applies after the 11th year. 
all of the hybrid bonds are perpetual and sas controls the payment of interest and principal in the instruments.
retained earnings
encompass net income for the year and profits earned in the parent company and its group companies. retained 
earnings also includes revaluations related to post-employment benefits.
dividend policy
at 31 october 2020, sas ab had one share class listed. sas’ overriding goal is to create shareholder value. dividends 
require a resolution by a shareholders’ meeting, and that sas ab has distributable earnings. dividends to holders of 
common shares can only be distributed when value is created through sas’ roic exceeding its wacc. the group’s 
financial position, earnings, expected performance, investment requirements and relevant economic conditions should 
also be taken into account. the dividend should take into account any restrictions applying to the group’s right to 
distribute dividends to shareholders1). the dividend policy endeavors to achieve long-term sustainable dividends.
1)  over the fiscal year, sas has received various forms of covid-19 pandemic-related state aid, which are conditional on sas not distribut-
ing funds to shareholders. the european commission’s approval of the aid encompassed by sas’ recapitalization plan includes, inter 
alia, such a prohibition on distributing dividends to shareholders, which ceases to apply once the instruments signed by the states under 
sas’ recapitalization plan have been fully redeemed or sold.
bonds
in may 2001, a meur 1,000 european medium-term note program was established. the emtn program makes it 
possible for the group to issue bonds with fixed or floating interest rates in any currency. on the closing date, the sas 
group’s issued bonds amounted to msek 517 (3,063). a specification of individual bond loans is provided below:

the group leases aircraft, properties and ground handling equipment for which the present values of contractual lease 
commitments have been reported as interest-bearing liabilities. the terms of the above contracts extend for 1–12 
years and are subject to various conditions, such as linking to different indices as well as interest rates. lease liabilities 
are denominated in the following currencies: usd (msek 14,009), sek (msek 1,209), nok (msek 889), dkk (msek 
482) and other currencies (msek 15). for more information about assets leased by the group (right-of-use assets), see 
note 13. 
amortization of lease liabilities amounted to msek 3,082 for the year and the interest expense on lease liabilities 
was msek 691 for the year. remeasurement of currencies in lease liabilities had a positive impact on earnings of msek 
730 for the year. during the year, the group had rental costs linked to short-term contracts and variable fees as well as 
for low value assets amounting to msek 147. in fiscal year 2019, rental costs amounted to msek 4,684 and subletting 
amounted to msek 87.
note 25  contract assets and liabilities
the group has identified contract assets, which are recognized as accrued income, refer to note 20. the identified 
contract assets pertain mainly to cargo revenue and eurobonus points sold that have yet to be invoiced to customers. 
the group has identified the following contract liabilities:
31 oct  
2020
31 oct  
2019
unearned transportation liability
5,346
6,049
loyalty program
1,999
1,926
the unearned transportation liability and the loyalty program are recognized as contract liabilities since payments are 
received from customers before the performance obligation is discharged by the group. information about the dis-
charge of performance obligations can be found in note 1 under the headings “passenger revenue” and “eurobonus.” 
the unearned transportation liability was msek 5,346 (6,049) at 31 october. future, unmet, performance obliga-
tions are expected to be essentially discharged in the 12 months following 31 october 2020. during the year, msek 
3,750 (5,476) of the year’s opening liability was recognized in revenue.
the liability pertaining to the eurobonus loyalty program was msek 1,999 (1,926) at 31 october. eurobonus points 
earned are valid for five years. since uncertainty exists in terms of when the eurobonus points will be used, the whole 
liability is recognized as long-term. the group’s assessment is that approximately one sixth of the eurobonus points 
will be used and recognized as revenue within 12 months of 31 october 2020 and the remainder at a declining rate 
over future years. during the year, msek 341 (538) of the year’s opening liability was recognized in revenue.
note 26  financial risk management and financial derivatives
the sas group is exposed to various types of financial risks. all risk management is handled centrally and in ac-
cordance with the policies set by the board. the sas group uses derivative instruments as part of its financial risk 
management to limit its fuel, currency and interest-rate exposure.
fuel price risk
the sas group is exposed to changes in jet-fuel prices. exposure is handled by continuously hedging 40–80% of the 
forecast fuel consumption for the coming 12 months. under the current uncertain and volatile market conditions sas 
may come to deviate from the policy. the main financial derivatives used for hedging jet fuel are options and swaps. as 
of 31 october 2020, the group had signed derivative agreements covering approximately 48% of the group’s forecast 
jet-fuel requirement for november 2020–october 2021. in november 2019–october 2020, jet-fuel-related costs 
accounted for 19% of the group’s operating expenses, compared with 21% in november 2018–october 2019.
currency risk
the sas group has currency exposure to both transaction risk and translation risk.
transaction risk arises when flows in foreign currencies are exposed to currency fluctuations. to manage the trans-
action risk to which the sas group is exposed, the projected commercial currency flows are hedged using currency 
derivatives. according to the financial policy, the hedge level must be 40–80% of a 12-month rolling liquidity forecast. 
future contracted aircraft purchases denominated in usd can be hedged by up to 80% of the contracted amount. 
additionally, future aircraft sales can be hedged with currency derivatives and loans in usd in an amount up to 80% 
of the carrying amounts of the aircraft fleet. as of 31 october 2020, the group had signed agreements for derivatives 
covering approximately 47% of the group’s forecast commercial currency exposure for november 2020–october 2021. 
translation risk arises during conversion of balance-sheet items in foreign currencies due to currency fluctuations. 
to limit translation risk, the policy is to keep the financial net debt mainly in the presentation currency of the respective 
subsidiary. with the introduction of ifrs 16, future leasing payments are recognized as an asset (right-of-use asset) 
and a financial lease liability. most of the right-of-use assets are denominated in sek but the corresponding lease liabili-
ties are denominated in foreign currencies, mainly usd.  the currency exposure from recalculating usd lease liabilities 
into sek is significant. forecasted future usd revenue is hedged using the external usd denominated lease liabilities 
as hedging instruments to manage a specific portion of this risk.
interest-rate risk
the sas group is exposed to interest-rate risk when the market value of the financial net debt (interest-bearing assets 
and liabilities) is affected by movements in the yield curve (market interest rates at different maturities). group borrow-
ing includes loans at both fixed and floating interest rates. to manage the interest-rate risk, interest-rate derivatives 
are used to change the fixed-interest term of the underlying gross financial debt. the target of current policy is for the 
average fixed-interest term of the gross financial debt to correspond to 3 years, with a permitted interval of 1–5 years. 
in addition, the development of the gross financial debt for the forthcoming 12 months and contracted future aircraft 
purchases is taken into consideration. at 31 october 2020, the average fixed-interest term including the hybrid bonds 
was 2.9 years (3.3).

financial derivatives
different types of currency derivatives, such as currency forward contracts, currency swap contracts and currency options, are used to manage currency 
exposure. furthermore, interest-rate exposure is managed by different types of interest-rate derivatives such as forward rate agreements (fras), futures, 
interest-rate swap contracts and currency interest-rate swap contracts. the group holds interest-rate derivatives that are exposed to libor. these will not be 
affected by the ongoing ibor reform, since these interest-rate swap contracts will expire prior to the reform entering force. as of 31 october 2020, the fair value 
of the sas group’s derivative instruments outstanding totaled msek -786 (-660), broken down according to the table below.

as of the balance-sheet date, fair value is consistent with carrying amounts. 
the fair value is the amount received or paid if outstanding financial 
instruments are sold on the closing date. derivatives not subject to hedge 
accounting are classified as financial instruments at fvtpl. volume outstand-
ing means the nominal amount of derivative contracts expressed in absolute 
terms.
the total carrying amount for the group’s derivative financial instruments is 
presented in the balance-sheet items in the table to the right.  
offsetting of financial derivatives
to reduce credit risks for bank receivables related to derivatives, sas has 
entered into netting agreements, under isda agreements, signed with all of 
its counterparties. 
the information in the following table includes financial assets and liabili-
ties that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar 
agreements that cover financial instruments.

sensitivity analysis, revaluation effect on closing date
the sensitivity analysis concerning fuel price shows the immediate revaluation effect of a 10% parallel shift in the price curve for fuel derivatives.
the sensitivity analysis concerning currency shows the immediate revaluation effect on the closing date for cashflow hedges, accounts receivable and 
accounts payable of a 10% strengthening or weakening of the swedish krona against all currencies the sas group is exposed to. in addition to the revaluation 
effect, a 1% weakening of the usd against the sek would have a positive impact of about msek 100 on the sas group’s net financial items based on lease liabili-
ties of around musd 1,600. a 1% strengthening of the usd against the sek would have the corresponding negative effect on net financial items.
the sensitivity analysis for market interest rates shows the immediate revaluation effect on the closing date for interest-rate derivatives and short-term invest-
ments with a 1-percentage-point parallel shift in the yield curve. beyond the revaluation effect, the sas group’s net interest for the november 2020–october 
2021 period is affected by around msek 14 (58) if short-term market rates rise by 1 percentage point. however, if short-term market rates fall by 1 percentage 
point the corresponding negative effect on net interest is msek -14 (-58). the estimate also includes interest-rate derivatives.

hedge-accounted derivatives, cash-flow hedge
hedging of aircraft
the hedging of future contracted aircraft purchases/sales represents hedging 
transactions since it is the payment flow in foreign currency during a future 
purchase/sale that is hedged using the cash-flow method. the loans and the 
currency forward contracts included in hedging relationships are translated 
at the relevant closing rate and the change that is calculated as effective is 
recognized in other comprehensive income. as of 31 october 2020, the ac-
cumulated currency effect on cash-flow-hedged loans and derivatives relating 
to future aircraft purchases and sales was recognized after tax in the hedging 
reserve in equity in the amount of msek 599 (812).
commercial flows
currency derivatives are used to manage the transaction risk relating to 
projected commercial flows. these currency derivatives represent hedging 
transactions according to the cash-flow method and their accounting policies 
are matched with those of the underlying liquidity projection. provided that 
the effectiveness of the hedges can be demonstrated, the accumulated 
change in market value of each hedging transaction is recognized in equity 
until it is recycled to the statement of income as a cost/revenue. as of 31 
october 2020, the accumulated currency effect of these cash-flow-hedged 
currency derivatives was recognized after tax in the hedging reserve in equity 
in the amount of msek 61 (29). 
certain forecasted future usd revenue is hedged using the external usd 
denominated lease liabilities as hedging instruments. changes in the usd/
sek spot rate for the designated part of the usd denominated lease liability 
are recognized in other comprehensive income and reported as a separate 
component (cash-flow hedge reserve) in equity. when the hedged expected 
cash flows impact profit or loss as revenue, the corresponding part of the 
cash-flow hedge reserve is reclassified from other comprehensive income 
to profit or loss. as of 31 october 2020, the accumulated currency effect of 
these cash-flow-hedged derivatives was recognized after tax in the hedging 
reserve in equity in the amount of msek 371 (0). 
interest-rate derivatives
when the sas group borrows at floating interest rates and changes its 
interest-rate exposure by entering into interest-rate swap contracts, whereby 
floating interest is received and fixed interest is paid, the hedging relationship 
is classified as a cash-flow hedge. when hedge accounting is applied, the 
effective portion of the change in value of the hedge instrument is recognized 
in other comprehensive income. the terms of the interest-rate derivatives 
used for hedging transactions are matched with those of the individual loans. 
on the closing date 31 october 2020, the accumulated effect on these cash-
flow-hedged interest-rate derivatives was recognized after tax in the hedging 
reserve in equity in the amount of msek -593 (-515).
fuel derivatives
fuel derivatives are used to manage the price risk relating to jet fuel. these 
derivatives represent hedging transactions according to the cash-flow meth-
od and their accounting policies are matched with those of the underlying 
forecast jet-fuel requirement. as of 31 october 2020, the accumulated effect 
on these cash-flow-hedged fuel derivatives was recognized after tax in the 
hedging reserve in equity in the amount of msek -429 (-143). 
altogether, msek 11 (235) was recognized before tax in the hedging 
reserve in equity at 31 october 2020, and is expected to affect the statement 
of income in the following years as per the following table:

other derivatives not subject to hedge accounting are remeasured on an 
ongoing basis and recognized at fair value through profit or loss. nor are 
interest-rate derivatives that cannot be linked to specific borrowing subject to

credit risk
the group’s financial transactions give rise to exposure to credit risk vis-à-vis 
the financial counterparties. credit risk or counterparty risk pertains to the 
risk of loss if a counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations. the 
financial policy prescribes that transactions may only be entered into with 
counterparties with high credit ratings, defined as category a3/p-1 or better 
according to moody’s or alternatively a-/a-1 according to standard & poor’s.
limits are set for each counterparty and are continuously revised. to 
further reduce counterparty risks, isda agreements (netting agreements) 
are signed with most counterparties. 99% of the credit-related exposure is 
geographically concentrated in the nordic countries. the breakdown of the 
remaining credit exposure is 0% in the rest of europe and 1% in the rest of the 
world. the maximum credit exposure for derivative instruments is matched by 
carrying amounts/fair values, see the above table under the heading financial 
derivatives. for cash and cash equivalents, the size of the credit risk is the 
carrying amount and is distributed as follows:

under other long-term receivables, credit risk is allocated between financial 
institutions, external aircraft lessors, external aircraft operators and various 
property companies. the same regulations as those defined above for 
financial counterparties apply for financial institutions. with regard to external 
aircraft lessors, the majority of claims consist of pledged collateral for leasing 
fees as well as costs for return requirements. since the cost of meeting the 
return requirements largely relates to those costs incurred dependent on the 
usage of the aircraft, the credit-related exposure is substantially neutralized. 
the payments structure in agreements with external aircraft operators is 
designed so that sas group’s receivables in the form of pledged collateral are 
often or always lower than the current liabilities/expenses of the sas group to 
these external operators.    
in relation to the sas group’s accounts receivable, the credit risk is spread 
over a large number of customers including private individuals and companies 
in various industries. credit information is required for credit sales with the 
aim of minimizing the risk of bad debt losses and is based on intra-group 
information on payment history supplemented with credit and business 
information from external sources.
the maximum credit risk for the sas group accords with the carrying 
amounts of financial assets according to the categorization table.  
liquidity and borrowing risk
liquidity and borrowing risks refer to the risk that sufficient liquidity is not 
available when required, and that refinancing of matured loans will be costly 
or problematic.
the target is for financial preparedness to amount to a minimum of 25% of 
the sas group’s fixed costs. the financial preparedness equals cash and cash 
equivalents plus total unutilized credit facilities. as of 31 october 2020, finan-
cial preparedness amounted to msek 11,421 (11,372), with cash and cash 
equivalents amounting to msek 10,231 (8,473) and unutilized credit facilities 
totaling msek 1,190 (2,899) or 67% (38) of the group’s fixed costs. the sas 
group’s cash and cash equivalents are held in instruments with good liquidity 
or short maturity with a credit rating of no lower than a3/p-1 according to 
moody’s or a-/a-1 according to standard & poor’s.
the following tables show remaining contractual terms for sas’ financial 
liabilities and assets excluding operations for sale. the figures shown are 
contractual undiscounted cash flows. the tables show the contracted date 
when sas is liable to pay or receive, and includes both interest and nominal 
amounts. future interest flows at variable rates are estimated using the 
current interest rate on the closing date, which means the amounts may differ. 
in addition to the cash flow in the tables, the annual interest rate on hybrid 
bonds amounts to approximately msek 274.
as of 31 october 2020, the group’s interest-bearing liabilities amounted to 
msek 31,596 (11,283); 0% (0) of the interest-bearing liabilities have financial 
key ratio covenants for cash flow, debt/equity and liquidity. the term of the 
interest-bearing gross debt amounted to approximately 4.7 years (3.3) at year 
end, excluding the subordinated loan of mchf 127 and hybrid bonds of msek 
7,615 which run without stipulated maturity.

measurement at fair value
under ifrs 7, disclosures pertaining to financial instruments measured at fair 
value in the balance sheet are to be provided if the method for establishing 
fair value utilizes a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels. the levels 
reflect the extent to which fair value is based on observable market data or 
own assumptions. below is a description of the different levels for determining 
fair value.
level 1
financial instruments for which fair value is based on observable (unadjusted) 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. a market 
is considered active if quoted prices from an exchange, bank, pricing service 
(such as thomson reuters) or supervisory body are readily and regularly 
available and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring arm’s 
length market transactions.
this category includes mainly standardized derivatives where the quoted 
price is used in the valuation. 
level 2
financial instruments for which fair value is based on models that utilize 
observable data for the asset or liability other than the quoted prices included 
within level 1, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from 
prices).
examples of observable data in level 2 is data that can serve as a basis for 
assessing prices, such as market interest rates and yield curves.
this category includes mainly certificates and non-standard derivative in-
struments (interest-rate, currency and fuel swaps as well as currency and fuel 
options) not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined using 
valuation techniques based essentially on observable market data.
level 3
financial instruments for which fair value is based on valuation models, 
whereby significant input is based on unobservable data.
the sas group currently has no financial assets and liabilities where the 
valuation is essentially based on unobservable data.
determination of fair value — valuation 
 techniques
other holdings of securities 
the balance-sheet item “other participations” msek 9 (9) comprises share-
holdings that are not affiliated companies or subsidiaries.
the entire balance-sheet item is measured at cost because its fair value 
cannot be reliably measured as a justifiable expense. for this reason, the bal-
ance-sheet item “other holdings of securities” is not included in the following 
table “financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.”
interest-rate derivatives
interest-rate swaps: the fair value of interest-rate swaps is determined by 
discounting estimated future cash flows. discounting takes place on the basis 
of yield curves based in turn on market rates prevailing at the closing date.
futures: standardized futures contracts with daily settlement. fair value is 
thus determined by daily “mark-to-market” valuation.
forward rate agreement, (fra): the fair value of otc fras is determined 
by discounting estimated future cash flows. discounting takes place on the 
basis of yield curves based in turn on market rates prevailing at the closing 
date. standardized fras with cash settlement are measured at fair value 
using quoted bid and ask rates at year end for an fra with a corresponding 
term to maturity.
currency derivatives
currency swaps: the fair value of currency swaps is determined by discount-
ing estimated future cash flows in each currency and interest rate. discount-
ing is based on yield curves on the closing date. translation of the currency 
component is based on exchange rates prevailing at the closing date.
currency options: the fair value of options is determined by application of 
the black and scholes valuation model, a recognized and accepted valuation 
model in financial markets. the model is based primarily on observable data 
such as spot price, exercise price, term to maturity, interest rate, volatility, etc.
fuel derivatives
fuel options: the fair value of fuel options is determined by application of the 
black and scholes valuation model. the model is based primarily on observ-
able data such as the fuel swap curve, exercise price, term to maturity, interest

restructuring
the restructuring provisions are attributable to the cost cutting and efficiency 
measures initiated in the last few years. these measures entail radical chang-
es and simplification of operations, and will generate a reduction in unit cost. 
in addition to restructuring provisions for personnel, the reserve also 
comprises provisions for property costs. 
the long-term portion of the restructuring reserve will be fully utilized 
within five years.
the provision for restructuring costs includes no reversed unutilized 
amounts.
loyalty program
through membership in the group’s loyalty program, eurobonus, customers 
can earn bonus points by flying with sas and/or other star alliance compa-
nies as well as from purchases made from other business partners, such as 
car rental and credit card companies.
the allocation of loyalty points is viewed as a separate identifiable transac-
tion when purchasing airline tickets. the portion of the ticket price allocated to 
loyalty points is measured at the relative stand-alone price for the points and is 
not recognized as revenue until the period in which the obligation is met.
the amount for utilized provisions includes a revaluation of the eurobonus 
points liability. during recent years, previous estimates of fair value per point 
category have been adjusted downwards driven by continued price reduc-
tions, changes in eurobonus rules and withdrawal patterns.
eurobonus points earned are valid for five years.
in accordance with ifrs 15, the eurobonus liability was reclassified in 
november 2018 from provisions to other non-current liabilities as a contract 
liability.
undertakings pertaining to aircraft under 
 operating leases
sas makes ongoing provisions for undertakings related to aircraft leasing. 
the undertakings primarily pertain to engines, but also include landing gear, 
air frames and apus. the long-term portion pertains primarily to a large 
number of undertakings with an average duration of around four years. the 
longest undertaking extends for just less than ten years.

the group is involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the 
ordinary course of business. these claims relate to, but are not limited to, the 
group’s business practices, employment matters, and tax matters. provisions 
have been recognized for such matters in accordance with probable and 
quantifiable loss risks. on the basis of information currently available, those 
issues not requiring any provisions will not have any material adverse effect 
on the group’s earnings, nor will they be recognized as contingent liabilities. 
however, litigation is inherently unpredictable and, even though the provi-
sions were assessed as adequate and/or that the group has valid defenses 
in these matters, unfavorable results could occur. this could have a material 
adverse effect on the group’s earnings in future accounting periods. for more 
information see the report by the board of directors on page 43.

note 41 earnings per share
earnings per common share are calculated as net income for the period attributable to parent company shareholders 
less preference-share dividends and hybrid bond expenses in relation to 439,109,783 (382,582,551) common shares 
outstanding. the calculation of earnings per share before and after dilution is based on the following earnings and 
number of common shares. in 2014, a convertible bond was issued, which gave rise to a potential dilution effect. all 
preference shares were redeemed in december 2018 and the convertible note was repaid in april 2019. in october 
2020, the number of common shares increased 6,877,479,859 through a new share issue. in november 2020, a further 
5,976,822 shares were registered from the issue of new shares. the total number of shares after new issues in 2020 
amounted to 7,266,039,292, refer to note 22.

auditors’ report
to the annual meeting of the shareholders of sas ab, corporate registration number 556606-8499
report on the annual accounts  
and consolidated accounts
opinions
we have audited the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts of sas ab for the financial year 2019-11-01— 
2020-10-31, except for the corporate governance 
statement on pages 48–62. the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts of the company are included on 
pages 29–109 in this document. 
in our opinion, the annual accounts have been pre-
pared in accordance with the annual accounts act, 
and present fairly, in all material respects, the finan-
cial position of the parent company as of october 31, 
2020 and its financial performance and cash flow for 
the year then ended in accordance with the annual 
accounts act. the consolidated accounts have been 
prepared in accordance with the annual accounts act 
and present fairly, in all material respects, the finan-
cial position of the group as of october 31, 2020 and 
their financial performance and cash flow for the year 
then ended in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (ifrs), as adopted by the eu, and 
the annual accounts act. our opinions do not cover the 
corporate governance statement on pages 48–62. the 
statutory administration report is consistent with the 
other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts.
we therefore recommend that the general meeting of 
shareholders adopts the income statement and bal-
ance sheet for the parent company and the group.
our opinions in this report on the the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts are consistent with the con-
tent of the additional report that has been submitted to 
the parent company’s audit committee in accordance 
with the audit regulation (537/2014) article 11. 
basis for our opinions
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isa) and generally 
accepted auditing standards in sweden. our respon-
sibilities under those standards are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities section. we are 
independent of the parent company and the group in 
accordance with professional ethics for accountants in 
sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical respon-
sibilities in accordance with these requirements.this 
includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and 
belief, no prohibited services referred to in the audit 
regulation (537/2014) article 5.1 have been provided 
to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent 
company or its controlled companies within the eu.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions.
key audit matters
key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in 
our professional judgment, were of most significance 
in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts of the current period. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a sep-
arate opinion on these matters.

response in the audit
the group accounts for passenger revenue of msek 13,943 for the financial 
year 2019/20, and liabilities for unearned transportation revenue of msek 
5,346 and for the customer loyalty program of msek 1,999 as at october 31, 
2020. the covid-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to its 
spread, including government measures and travel restrictions, have resulted 
in significant disruption to sas’ operations including reduced revenue, can-
celled flights and refunded tickets.
passenger revenue is accounted for as a liability from the point of sale until 
commencement of the air transport for the passenger. upon departure of the 
air transport, revenue is recognized in the income statement. additionally, 
tickets that subsequent to the scheduled flight date, have been assessed to 
expire before utilization by a passenger are recorded as revenue. based on 
historical outcomes and seasonality, a regular assessment is performed to 
estimate the value of tickets, for which the scheduled flight date has passed, 
that will expire before utilization. the recognition of revenue relating to the 
estimate for expired tickets results in a corresponding reduction of the 
unearned transportation revenue liability.  
furthermore, the group has a customer loyalty program, eurobonus. points 
earned by program members are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet 
until they are redeemed or have expired. the value of the liability is derived by 
the number of points held by members and the estimated fair value per point 
adjusted for the estimated future expiration rates. points that are estimated to 
expire prior to redemption are recognized as revenue, with a corresponding 
reduction to the customer loyalty program liability.
the recognition of revenue and movements in contract liabilities associated 
with expired tickets and the customer loyalty program is based on a number of 
inherently complex assumptions. volatility or inaccuracies in determining 
these assumptions may have significant impact on the group’s results and 
financial position.
in our audit, we have assessed the risks of the processes relating to the 
accounting for passenger revenue, unearned transportation revenue, and the 
customer loyalty program. we have evaluated the design and implementation 
of internal controls relating to the relevant estimates and the interfacing of 
systems to derive the data used in these estimates.
we have assessed the reasonableness of the models utilized by the group to 
develop these estimates and their impact on the associated accounts. this 
assessment includes the validation of the data utilized as a basis for each esti-
mate and the accuracy of the underlying calculations. 
for the estimate of the fair value of customer loyalty program points before 
consideration of the estimated expiry, we examined the key inputs used to cal-
culate the value by comparing historical usage patterns and observable 
market values such as comparable airfares. for assumptions regarding future 
ticket expiration and customer loyalty program point expiration, we assessed 
the group’s accuracy in forecasting by comparing previous estimates to actual 
outcomes. we evaluated these assumptions against historical trends, and 
future expectations. we have also agreed the final estimates to the corre-
sponding income statement and balance sheet accounts.
we have also assessed the disclosures for passenger revenue and related con-
tract liabilities included in the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts.

the carrying value of aircraft in the group amounted to msek 15,546 as at 
october 31, 2020, and the provision for major maintenance costs of leased 
aircraft and engines amounted to msek 2,995. as a result of the covid-19 
pandemic, a large part of the aircraft fleet has been grounded and an acceler-
ated phase out of older aircraft has resulted in impairment charges totalling 
msek 1,040.
the group’s aircraft are divided into various components and with an esti-
mated end of life residual value. engines are depreciated based on utilization 
and major maintenance costs for the various components are capitalized and 
depreciated until the next scheduled mandatory major maintenance occasion. 
for major maintenance costs of leased aircraft and engines, provisions are 
made on a continuous basis which are utilized when the major maintenance is 
carried out or the aircraft is returned.
the group’s estimations of useful lives, residual values and major mainte-
nance costs for engines and other aircraft components are complex in nature. 
changes in the basis for these assumptions and estimates may have a signifi-
cant impact on the group’s results and financial position.
in our audit, we have evaluated the design and implementation of internal 
controls associated with the determination and calculation of component 
depreciation and maintenance provisions. this includes the development 
and monitoring of flight hours and flight cycles for engine components.
we have assessed the reasonableness of assumptions made for useful 
lives, components and residual values regarding aircraft and reconciled 
these assumptions against carrying values of aircraft components and 
associated depreciation recorded in the income statement.
to assess the completeness and accuracy of provisions for major mainte-
nance for leased aircraft, we have evaluated the group’s calculations and 
related accounting on a sample basis through inspection of lease agree-
ments, market values, flight cycles and flight hours. 
we have also assessed the disclosures for aircraft and provisions for major 
maintenance costs of leased aircraft included in the annual accounts and 
the consolidated accounts.
carrying values of aircraft and provisions for major maintenance costs of leased aircraft

accounts for detailed information and description of the matter.
description of key audit matter
response in the audit
the group adopted ifrs 16 leases from november 1, 2019, which had a sig-
nificant impact on the financial statements. as at october 31, 2020, the group 
accounts for right of use assets of msek 17,264 and related leasing liabilities 
of msek 16,604. as the group adopted the modified retroactive method, no 
adjustments were made to prior periods.
in accordance with ifrs 16, the present value of future lease payments is 
reported as a right of use asset in the balance sheet with a corresponding 
leasing liability. in the income statement, leasing costs have been replaced by 
depreciation of right of use assets and interest expenses attributable to 
leasing liabilities.
ifrs 16 stipulates that the group needs to make assumptions and assess-
ments when determining, for example, interest rates and leasing periods that 
are used when discounting leasing payments in each contract. as a large part 
of the leasing liabilities are denominated in currencies other than sek, there is 
a significant currency exposure which is partially hedged, which also entails 
certain assumptions and assessments to be made. 
changes in these assumptions and assessments may have a significant 
impact on the group’s results and financial position.
in our audit, we have evaluated the group’s first time adoption of the 
accounting for leases under the new standard.
we have also evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls 
for the reporting of right of use assets and leasing liabilities as well as 
related depreciation, interest expenses and currency revaluations.
we have assessed the reasonableness of assumptions relating to discount 
rates, leasing periods and any contract modifications and have on a sample 
basis reconciled these assumptions as well as underlying lease payments 
against underlying agreements and recalculated actual reported values.
furthermore, we have evaluated the group’s revaluation of leasing liabilities 
in foreign currencies including the effect of hedge accounting, where appli-
cable, as well as the related accounting in the income statement or other 
comprehensive income.
we have also assessed the disclosures for leases included in the annual 
accounts and the consolidated accounts.

description of key audit matter
response in the audit
as a result of the negative financial impact from covid-19, the board of direc-
tors in sas ab resolved on a recapitalization plan that was approved by the 
extraordinary general meeting in september 2020.
in the end of october, this recapitalization plan which included issuance of 
shares and hybrid bonds totalling msek 12,000 was completed. further-
more, certain previously outstanding bonds have also been converted into 
equity instruments, entailing a further strengthening of equity of msek 
2,250, before transaction costs.
the group intends to use the net proceeds to strenghen its capital structure, 
and to create a financial preparedness to meet the effects from of continued 
weak demand for air travel, changed passenger patterns and other external 
factors. as described in the report by the board of directors, the board of 
directors assessment is that the liquidity position is sufficient for at least the 
next twelve-month period.
in our audit, we have evaluated the accounting of the share and hybrid 
bond issues and related transaction costs based on applicable accounting 
standards.
we have inspected the board minutes, bond terms and conditions, bank 
statements, registration certificates, calculations and assumptions made 
in the various transactions and reconciled these against reported amounts. 
we have also reviewed and evaluated the group’s liquidity forecast for the 
next twelve months.
we have also assessed the disclosures for these transactions included 
in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as well as the board 
of directors’ assessment of the sufficiency of the liquidity position in the 
report by board of directors.
completed recapitalization including issuance of shares and hybrid bonds
see the statement of changes in equity and note 22 and accounting principles on page 73 in the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts for detailed information and description of the matter.
other information than the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts 
this document also contains other information than 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is 
found on pages 1-28 and 116-148. the other informa-
tion comprises also of the remuneration report which 
is expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor’s report. the board of directors and the 
chief executive officer are responsible for this other 
information. 
our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts does not cover this other information and 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
regarding this other information.
in connection with our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the 
information identified above and consider whether the 
information is materially inconsistent with the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts. in this procedure 
we also take into account our knowledge otherwise 
obtained in the audit and assess whether the informa-
tion otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
if we, based on the work performed concerning this 
information, conclude that there is a material misstate-
ment of this other information, we are required to report 
that fact. we have nothing to report in this regard.
responsibilities of the board of directors and the 
chief executive officer
the board of directors and the chief executive officer 
are responsible for the preparation of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts and that they 
give a fair presentation in accordance with the annual 
accounts act and, concerning the consolidated 
accounts, in accordance with ifrs as adopted by the 
eu. the board of directors and the chief executive 
officer are also responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts the board of directors and the chief executive 
officer are responsible for the assessment of the compa-
ny’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
they disclose, as applicable, matters related to going con-
cern and using the going concern basis of accounting. the 
going concern basis of accounting is however not applied 
if the board of directors and the chief executive officer 
intend to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
the audit committee shall, without prejudice to the board 
of director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among 
other things oversee the company’s financial reporting 
process.
auditor’s responsibility
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinions. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and generally accepted 
auditing standards in sweden will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional scepti-
cism throughout the audit. we also:
• 
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement

of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appro-
priate to provide a basis for our opinions. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten-
tional omissions, misrepresentations, or the over-
ride of internal control.
• 
 obtain an understanding of the company’s internal 
control relevant to our audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s inter-
nal control.
• 
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting esti-
mates and related disclosures made by the board of 
directors and the chief executive officer.
• 
 conclude on the appropriateness of the board of 
directors’ and the chief executive officer’s, use of 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. we 
also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the company’s and the 
group’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts. our conclu-
sions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future 
events or conditions may cause a company and a 
group to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, including the disclosures, and whether 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• 
 obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the group to express 
an opinion on the consolidated accounts. we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our opinions.
we must inform the board of directors of, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. we 
must also inform of significant audit findings during our 
audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identified. 
we must also provide the board of directors with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to com-
municate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our inde-
pendence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with the board of 
directors, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts, including the most import-
ant assessed risks for material misstatement, and are 
therefore the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes disclosure about the matter.
report on other legal and regulatory 
requirements
opinions
in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts, we have also audited the 
administration of the board of directors and the chief 
executive officer of sas ab for the financial year 
 2019-11-01—2020-10-31 and the proposed appropri-
ations of the company’s profit or loss.
we recommend to the general meeting of shareholders 
that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the 
proposal in the statutory administration report and that 
the members of the board of directors and the chief 
executive officer be discharged from liability for the 
financial year.
basis for opinions
we conducted the audit in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in sweden. our respon-
sibilities under those standards are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities section. we are 
independent of the parent company and the group in 
accordance with professional ethics for accountants in 
sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical respon-
sibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinions.
responsibilities of the board of directors and the 
chief executive officer 
the board of directors is responsible for the proposal 
for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. at 
the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment

of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the 
requirements which the company’s and the group’s 
type of operations, size and risks place on the size of 
the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consoli-
dation requirements, liquidity and position in general.
the board of directors is responsible for the company’s 
organization and the administration of the company’s 
affairs. this includes among other things continuous 
assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial 
situation and ensuring that the company’s organiza-
tion is designed so that the accounting, management 
of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise 
are controlled in a reassuring manner. 
the chief executive officer shall manage the ongoing 
administration according to the board of directors’ 
guidelines and instructions and among other matters 
take measures that are necessary to fulfill the compa-
ny’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the 
management of assets in a reassuring manner.
auditor’s responsibility 
our objective concerning the audit of the administra-
tion, and thereby our opinion about discharge from 
liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a 
reasonable degree of assurance whether any member 
of the board of directors or the chief executive officer 
in any material respect:
•  has undertaken any action or been guilty of any 
omission which can give rise to liability to the com-
pany, or
• 
 in any other way has acted in contravention of the 
companies act, the annual accounts act or the 
articles of association.
our objective concerning the audit of the proposed 
appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and 
thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with rea-
sonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in 
accordance with the companies act.
reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with generally accepted auditing standards in sweden 
will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise 
to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropri-
ations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accor-
dance with the companies act.
as part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in sweden, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism through-
out the audit. the examination of the administration and 
the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit 
or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. 
additional audit procedures performed are based on 
our professional judgment with starting point in risk and 
materiality. this means that we focus the examination on 
such actions, areas and relationships that are material 
for the operations and where deviations and violations 
would have particular importance for the company’s 
situation. we examine and test decisions undertaken, 
support for decisions, actions taken and other circum-
stances that are relevant to our opinion concerning 
discharge from liability. as a basis for our opinion on the 
board of directors’ proposed appropriations of the com-
pany’s profit or loss we examined whether the proposal 
is in accordance with the companies act. 
the auditor’s examination of the corporate 
 governance statement
the board of directors is responsible for that the corporate 
governance statement on pages 48-62 has been prepared 
in accordance with the annual accounts act.
our examination of the corporate governance statement 
is conducted in accordance with far´s auditing stan-
dard revu 16 the auditor´s examination of the corporate 
governance statement. this means that our examination 
of the corporate governance statement is different and 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with international standards on auditing and 
generally accepted auditing standards in sweden. we 
believe that the examination has provided us with suffi-
cient basis for our opinions. 
a corporate governance statement has been prepared. 
disclosures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the 
second paragraph points 2-6 of the annual accounts 
act and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph 
the same law are consistent with the other parts of the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in 
accordance with the annual accounts act.

sustainability
sas, together with the whole aviation indus-
try has been heavily impacted by the conse-
quences of the covid-19 pandemic. however, 
our work to promote the transition to more 
sustainable air travel remains a prioritized and 
existential topic for sas. 
by aiming for global leadership in sustainable aviation, 
we want to be at the forefront of the transition toward 
a net-zero carbon society. sas has been working to 
reduce the environmental impact of its operations 
for many years and our progress has been disclosed 
in external verified reports since 1996. during the 
year, sas decided to accelerate its efforts to reduce 
emissions. our goal to reduce total co2 emissions by 
25% (compared to 2005 levels) is now to be reached in 
2025, five years earlier than planned.
financial, environmental and social 
responsibility 
for sas, sustainable development means a simulta-
neous focus on financial, environmental and social 
responsibility. in many ways, our work on sustainabil-
ity issues increases our value and competitiveness, by 
using resources more efficiently and minimizing risks. 
for example, aircraft fuel efficiency, optimizing passen-
ger and freight capacity reduces fuel consumption as 
well as costs. there is also a strong financial incentive 
to reduce sick leave.

un sustainable development goals
the sustainable development goals (sdgs), or global goals for 
sustainable development, are a collection of 17 global goals set by 
the united nations general assembly in 2015. they involve meeting a 
broad range of global development targets by 2030. the goals encour-
age businesses to consider how they can best contribute to overcom-
ing global challenges related to economic, social and environmental 
sustainability.
our most relevant sdgs 
as we aim for global leadership in sustainable aviation, we focus on 
reducing our climate impact, promoting resource efficiency and creat-
ing an attractive workplace. four of the sdgs are closely aligned to our 
sustainability agenda.
with our determined commitment, documented activ-
ities and results, we strive to reduce our impact on 
the climate and the environment, and to take care of 
our customers, employees and society at large. this 
enables us to minimize sustainability-related risks and 
draw on potential opportunities – to avoid unnecessary 
costs, realize financial savings and differentiate our-
selves from the competition. 
the transition to more sustainable air travel is an exis-
tential topic for sas and we believe that sustainable 
development means continuous improvements in all 
relevant areas of sustainability. we have a well-defined 
process for continuously reviewing which topics are 
the most relevant and material in terms of sustainabil-
ity. the process involves engaging with internal and 
external stakeholders and is based on international 
guidelines such as the gri, the un global compact, 
the un sustainable development goals, global trends, 
the media, stakeholder dialogues, and our own assess-
ments of risks and opportunities. 
based on our most recent materiality analysis, the 
 following topics remain the most material for sas and 
its stakeholders:
our sustainability focus areas
environment
• emissions
• waste
• noise
business
• business ethics and anti-corruption
• sustainability in the supply chain
the materiality analysis also identifies ‘sustainability 
communication’ and ‘customer satisfaction’ as areas 
of significant importance to sas and its stakeholders. 
we actively communicate on sustainability issues in 
a transparent manner with our stakeholders, includ-
ing the publication of our annual and sustainability 
report. customers increasingly demand more sustain-
able products and it is an essential part of our product 
responsibility to provide products that are more sus-
tainable, thus increasing customer satisfaction. 
our most material topic  
– greenhouse gas emissions
based on our materiality analysis, our most important 
environmental impact is emissions from the consump-
tion of fossil fuels. aircraft operations account for over 
99%¹ of our greenhouse gas emissions. we therefore 
focus on promoting aircraft efficiency and the tran-
sition to sustainable aviation fuels (saf) in our iso 
14001 environmental management system.
our focus areas to reduce emissions:
• increased energy efficiency
• sustainable aviation fuels & emerging technologies
• sustainable products & services
sdg 5 – gender equality
goal 5 promotes gender equality and the empowerment of all women 
and girls. sas contributes toward this goal by encouraging gender 
equality and diversity through its recruitment policy and annual people 
review.
sdg 8 – decent work and economic growth
goal 8 promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic 
growth, productive employment and decent work for all. sas provides 
fair working conditions for all its employees, partners and suppliers.
sdg 12 – responsible consumption and production
goal 12 promotes sustainable consumption and production patterns. 
sas works continuously with its product development and efficiency 
improvements in order to reduce its climate and environmental 
impacts.
sdg 13 – climate action
goal 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change. sas works 
proactively to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by focusing on 
reducing emissions from its aircraft operations.

our flight operations including regional production partners, and the providers of exter-
nal services capable of delivering statistics.

sas management system
sustainability is a vital part of our business and is 
integrated into the sas management system. the 
system encompasses all activities at sas and is 
based on airline operational standards, our own and 
shared environmental and sustainability policies, the 
code of conduct, the un global compact, the un 
sustainability development goals, eu taxonomy, lean 
and iso 14001. the system provides guidelines for the 
ongoing cycle of planning, implementation and evalua-
tion, as well as the improvement of processes and activ-
ities to meet operational and sustainability targets. sas 
also has control mechanisms with allocated follow-up 
systems and resources in order to ensure compliance 
with applicable international and national legislation. 
our approach to environmental responsibility involves 
complying with all relevant legislation and minimizing 
our absolute as well as relative greenhouse gas emis-
sions and other environmental impacts.
both the sas environmental policy and the sas 
sustainability policy are approved by group 
management and apply to all sas employees, prod-
ucts and services. the policies, together with goals 
and strategies, are reviewed annually at the iso 14001 
management review by group management. activities 
are followed up within the management system and 
reported weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually accord-
ing to specific needs.
the sas environmental management system has been 
certified according to iso 14001 throughout the com-
pany since 2010. the iso standard is a key part of how 
we work with our environmental goals.
code of conduct
the board of directors has issued the code of conduct 
to summarize and clarify sas, stated priorities, prom-
ises, policies and other regulations. the code applies 
to all employees regardless of role or type of employ-
ment. to highlight the code’s importance, an exten-
sive training program supports the implementation of 
the code and all personnel regularly participate. the 
code is available at www.sasgroup.net. there are also 
clear rules and structures for reporting and addressing 
suspected violations through the management system 
or the sas whistle-blower function. the code’s whis-
tle-blower function was used on three occasions in fy 
2020. all cases have been closed.
 
risk management
sas has a precautionary risk management approach 
and the work is focused on minimizing sustainability- 
related risks and capturing potential opportunities. the 
risks and opportunities are assessed and strategically 
dealt with within the management system and are inte-
grated into our comprehensive risk management. risk 
control measures are crucial to managing risks.
the un sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) are a collection of 
17 goals set by the united nations 
general assembly in 2015 to reach 
a broad range of targets by 2030. 
sas works to manage risks and certain opportunities 
that offer tangible business potential. one example 
is our work with mitigating environmental impacts 
through our certified environmental management 
system. the system provides us with operational 
control and the capacity to quickly deal with changing 
business environment requirements. read more in the 
risk management section on pages 39-46. 
sas annually discloses its risks and opportunities 
related to climate change to cdp. risks and opportu-
nities are related to our possibilities to conduct aircraft 
operations in a changing climate, transition activities 
and customer perception regarding sas as a more 
sustainable alternative for fast and efficient travel over 
longer distances. the cdp disclosure and result (b in 
2020) is available on www.cdp.net.

environmental sustainability
sas is determined to reduce its greenhouse gas emis-
sions. to drive our environmental work, we have set 
comprehensive and ambitious short and long-term 
environmental goals. during the year, we decided to 
accelerate efforts to reduce our emissions and our 
target to reduce total co2 emissions 25% (compared 
to 2005 levels) is now to be reached in 2025 instead 
of 2030. the 2025 goal will be achieved by finalizing 
the ongoing fleet renewal, up to 10% usage of saf (or 
other equivalent measures) and other efficiency meas-
ures described later in the chapter. we have identified 
the possibility to achieve a potential reduction of up 
to 50% in total co2 emissions by 2030 (compared to 
2005), if the prerequsites are right and a supportive 
regulatory framework is put in place.
our environmental goals
to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to drive 
our environ mental work, we have set comprehensive and 
ambitious short- and long-term environmental goals. 
2025 goal
• 25% lower total co2 emissions compared with 2005 
(absolute emissions)
 
2030 goals
• sustainable aviation fuel equivalent to sas domestic 
production (on average 18% the last 5 years)
• 50% noise reduction compared with 2010
• 100% sustainable materials in sas customer offering
• 100% recycling where possible
2050 goal
• >50% lower total co2 emissions compared with 
2005 (absolute emissions and more ambitious than 
iata ambition)
industry emissions goals
sas intends to be part of a long-term sustainable 
society and support the international air transport 
association (iata) ambition that it will be possible to fly 
commercially without material climate impact by 2050. 
the iata and the airline industry have agreed on the 
following joint targets:
• improved fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5%  
annually from 2009 to 2020
• carbon-neutral growth from 2020
• 50% reduction in greenhouse co2 emissions by 
2050, compared with 2005 levels
source: www.enviro.aero
the un aviation organization, the international civil 
aviation organization (icao), has decided on a global 
market-based measure for implementation by 2021 
– the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for 
international aviation (corsia). the key elements of 
a global solution should not distort competition and 
should incorporate the un’s cbdr principles (common 
but differentiated responsibility). carbon-neutral 
growth is going to be achieved through corsia. at 
present, we are prepared to fulfill reporting obliga-
tions for our emissions. based on the structure of the 
scheme, we cannot estimate an annual cost yet. due to 
covid-19 and the dramatic decline in air travel during 
2020, icao has decided to apply 2019 levels as a base-
line for corsia and exclude 2020 from the baseline 
calculation.
sas is fully committed to reaching the iata targets 
and our fuel efficiency has improved by approximately 
2% each year since 2010. we will realize these targets

greenhouse gas emissions, scope 1
what are our relative and absolute emissions?
absolute emissions refer to our total quantity of emissions (often measured 
in tonnes co2). 
relative emissions refer to emissions per production unit (e.g. gram co2 
per tonne kilometer, gram co2 per passenger kilometer, gram co2 per cargo 
tonne kilometer or gram co2 per available seat kilometer ).

through a combination of new technology, sustainable 
aviation fuels, new energy sources, more efficient air 
traffic management and coordinated action to improve 
the infrastructure as well as the conditions under which 
air transport operates. see page 122 onwards for more 
details on how we are actively working to reduce our 
emissions.
our greenhouse gas emissions
in fy 2020, our absolute co2 emissions from aircraft 
operations decreased 57.2% compared with the pre-
vious year. the vast majority of the reduction was due 
to reduced traffic as a consequence to the covid-19 
pandemic. 
our co2 emissions per passenger kilometer increased 
to 111 grams (95) as a consequence of the significantly 
lower cabin factor as a result of the dramatic reduction 
in demand from mid-march 2020. 
however, the energy efficiency per available seat kilo-
meter improved 5.3% compared with last year due to 
the continued introduction of more efficient aircraft 
and primarily usage of the most efficient aircraft in the 
reduced traffic program. 
during fy 2020, sas used approximately 670 tonnes 
sustainable aviation fuel. the usage is derived from 
the customer saf upgrade ancillary service and the 
norwegian blend-in obligation introduced 1 january 
2020.
since 2005, our total emissions in fy 2020 have 
decreased 57.6%, while production measured in tonne 
kilo meter has been reduced 58.1%.

•  flights shorter than 500 km were responsible for 
18% of emissions, flights between 500 and 800 km 
for 11%, flights between 800 and 3,000 km for 31%, 
and flights longer than 3,000 km for 39%.
•  domestic flights were responsible for 20% prior 
to covid-19 and, during the pandemic, for 42% of 
emissions, and international flights for the remainder.

non-co2 emissions
in regard to greenhouse gas emissions, sas has 
chosen to disclose different emissions separately in 
this report and the emission calculator is available on 
our web pages. most emission calculators used in the 
market calculate an estimated co2 equivalent (co2e) 
based on different multipliers to include non-co2 emis-
sions. sas has chosen not to do so, because consen-
sus is lacking among among scientists and experts, on 
how to calculate nox, particles and water vapor emis-
sions to co2e. sas supports multiple initiatives aiming 
to reduce the effect of the non-co2 emissions in daily 
operations as well as develop a more advanced calcu-
lation methodology. in general, it can be noted that the 
current fleet renewal, and the technology choices made 
by sas, contribute to a greater relative reduction of 
non-co2 emissions than co2 emissions.  
our focus areas to reduce emissions 
sas environmental programs include the following 
emission-related areas, which are all described in more 
detail below:
• increased energy efficiency
•  sustainable aviation fuel (saf) & emerging 
technologies
• sustainable products & services
due to the covid-19 pandemic, various administrative 
functions of sas, as well as counterparts at exter-
nal stakeholders, were short-term laid off at different 
levels. this has affected some ongoing processes but 
will not affect long-term ambitions and targets.
increased energy efficiency
fleet renewal 
continuous fleet renewal is a vital part of our efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our air-
craft operations. our strategy is to ensure long-term 
profitability through a well-balanced fleet plan. over 
the years, we have continuously renewed our fleet by 
replacing less efficient aircraft with more efficient ones.
the aircraft we use are either owned, leased or wet-
leased. owned and leased aircraft are operated by sas 
scandinavia or sas ireland. wet-leased aircraft are 
operated by a number of regional production partners 
using regional jets and turboprop aircraft. 
through a constructive dialogue with airbus, we have 
managed to defer delivery of new aircraft not needed in 
the short-term. these deferrals are important as they 
reduce our capital expenditure for 2021–2024 and 
better align deliveries of new aircraft with the expected 
return in demand. we are still committed to achieving 
a single-type fleet operation by 2023, based on new 
airbus aircraft that will provide lower fuel consump-
tion and reduced maintenance costs compared with 
our current fleet composition. furthermore, we have 
made progress on our ambitious sustainability goals 
by accelerating the phase-out of older and less fuel-ef-
ficient aircraft. in the 140–200 seat range, we will 
operate a single-type aircraft fleet when all a320neo 
aircraft are delivered. based on performance data, the 
a320neo aircraft shows a substantial improvement in 
fuel consumption and noise emissions. the a320neo 
has 15–18% lower fuel consumption on a typical short-
haul flight compared with the previous generation, the 
a320ceo.

during the year, we received 13 a320neo, four a350 
and one a321lr aircraft and concurrently phased out 
15 older aircraft. by 31 october 2020, we had received 
41 of the 80 a320neo, and four of the eight a350 
aircraft ordered in total. at year end, the sas fleet con-
sisted of 135 aircraft (12 long-haul aircraft, 95 short-
haul aircraft and 28 aircraft flown by regional produc-
tion partners). the average age of the entire aircraft 
fleet was 9.0 years at year end.
right sizing
sas offers an extensive network of destinations and 
routes for different passenger volumes, which requires 
an aircraft fleet of different sizes and ranges. with our 
regional production partners, we can optimize our 
schedule and aircraft size to optimally meet demand, 
particularly on regional routes with relatively low 
demand. this unique capacity to switch aircraft size 
to meet demand enables us to optimize our fuel use 
and emissions per seat kilometer. we also draw on our 
extensive experience to constantly drive efficient air-
craft planning.
fuel efficiency program
we have a comprehensive long-term fuel saving pro-
gram integrated into our operations. an important 
aspect of increasing fuel efficiency is to ensure that all 
employees in sas airline operations have the prereq-
uisites and knowledge to promote fuel efficiency. key 
functions are those responsible for network planning, 
products and services as well as those employees 
involved in aircraft operations.
ongoing activities include optimizing operating proce-
dures and support systems to promote fuel efficiency. 
any change must maintain the highest level of flight 
safety standards and balance fuel efficiency with other 
operational costs, such as maintenance costs and air-
space charges.
airspace and european network 
over the past 20 years, sas has worked with various 
stakeholders and made numerous investments to 
enable and prepare for the introduction of a more effi-
cient european air traffic control system. the responsi-
bility to implement this important transformation, lies 
with authorities. 
collaboration with aircraft and engine 
manufacturers
through ongoing environmental work, we engage 
with various aircraft and engine manufacturers, pro-
ducers of interiors and other aircraft installations. 
environmental performance and criteria are integrated 
into all decision-making procurement processes for 
new aircraft and regional production partners.
sustainable aviation fuel (saf)  
& emerging technologies
for over a decade, we have worked on various activities 
to promote the development of alternative and more 
sustainable aviation fuels (saf), such as biofuels. it 
is essential that low-carbon jet fuels are commercial-
ized in order to meet our own and the airline industry’s 
environmental and climate objectives, and to secure 
alternatives to fossil fuels that are expected to become 
scarcer and potentially more expensive in the future.
sas continues to ask for saf quotes in all jet-fuel ten-
ders in order to indicate that we are prepared to pur-
chase biofuel if the sustainability criteria are in place and 
the price is competitive. sas is involved in a number of 
national and international projects, forums and networks 
to accelerate the commercialization of saf production 
in scandinavia. these include the iata/atag biofuel 
network, rise, safug, nisa, fossil free aviation 2045, 
preem, klimapartnerskabet and other scandinavian 
interest organizations. there are different production 
pathways certified and many more on their way to 
potentially being certified. our strategy is to support the 
progress of already certified pathways and to be involved 
in projects and initiatives working with the most realistic 
and implementable pathways to potential certification 
within a realistic time frame. 
our main sustainability criteria for biofuels is that the 
production is sustainable in the long-term, does not 
compete with food production or access to potable 
water, does not harm biodiversity and uses as little land 
area as possible. according to the iata, depending on 
the production method, saf can reduce lifecycle co2 
emissions by up to 80%.
from 2020, norwegian fuel suppliers are required to 
blend in 0.5% saf on all flights fueled in norway.
there is an ongoing process to introduce a saf man-
date in sweden. the suggestion is to introduce the 
system during 2021 and start with an approximate 
blend in of 1%. 
future lower emission aircraft
there are several development projects ongoing aimed 
at commercializing future low emission aircraft in a 
time frame of 5 to 15 years. when developing more 
efficient aircraft there are several development areas, 
such as improved aerodynamics,  weight reductions, 
and further improved or new propulsion solutions.

during the year, new propulsion solutions were in 
focus. there are many different possible solutions, for 
example next-generation jet turbine engines using 
traditional jet fuel or saf, jet turbines converted to use 
hydrogen and electric engines with battery or hydro-
gen fuel cells as energy storage. every solution has its 
opportunities and challenges, and we anticipate many 
different solutions commercialized over time. 
the ongoing projects among smaller producers are tar-
geting the 10-15 seat market with a one- to two-hour 
flight range before 2030 and the major aircraft manu-
facturers are expecting to commercialize 100-150 seat 
aircraft with a typical short-haul range in the market 
before 2040. 
sas and airbus signed a memorandum of understand-
ing in 2019 with the aim of accelerating the develop-
ment of a 100-seat aircraft with technology enabling 
full-electric, hybrid or hydrogen propulsion during the 
2030s. within the agreement, sas and airbus cover 
different topics connected to the commercialization of 
the technology, such as sas, business needs, charging 
capabilities, operational possibilities and boundaries, 
etc. in october 2020, airbus launched its 'zeroe' con-
cept and our work continues as planned.
sas puts a lot of effort into its engagement with airbus 
and strongly supports the development of various initi-
atives within this area. we strongly believe that we will 
experience a major technology shift during the 2030s 
with the commercialization of several full-electric, 
hybrid or hydrogen aircraft.
sas also participates in the nordic network for 
electric aviation (nea, a network that aims to address 
the prerequisites for commercialization of electric 
aircraft in the nordic region). the network is managed 
by rise, with participants heart aerospace, swedavia, 
avinor and other nordic airlines.
other environmental topics
emissions of ozone-depleting substances 
airlines must submit annual reports on their use, con-
sumption, leakage and storage of halon to the author-
ities. in fy 2020, there where no instances reported 
where halon was used as a fire safety precaution.
emissions calculations and co2 offsetting
carbon offsetting options for customers have been 
available since 2006. in our emissions calculator, which 
is available on www.sasgroup.net, greenhouse gas 
emission calculations are provided for sas flights. we 
carbon offset all sas tickets for eurobonus members, 
youth travel with sas and our own staff tickets. for fy 
2020, these offsets resulted in 0,7 million tonnes of 
co2, or 43% of the passenger-related co2 emissions. 
the offsetting is conducted through the purchase of 
emission reducing mechanisms connected to third-
party renewable energy projects in asia. 
glycol, diesel and petrol consumption
glycol is used when deicing aircraft. we reduced our 
usage of glycol to 1,431 thousands liters (2,807) in fy 
2020. 
sas uses vehicles to provide maintenance and 
ground-related services at airports, and follow airport 
regulations promoting the switch to vehicles with lower 
environmental impact. at our main bases, all vehicles 
are leased, with contracts and fuel consumption con-
tinuously followed up. sas cargo also monitors co2 
emissions per cargo tonne kilometer from its subcon-
tracted ground trucking operations. 
some spillages were reported in conjunction with 
ground handling during the year. these were properly 
managed according to procedures.
emissions from energy consumption in buildings
we continuously work to reduce energy consumption. 
during fy 2020, we upgraded the lights in our hang-
ars and hangar service center in oslo to led lighting, 
which has already been completed at arlanda and 
kastrup. our energy consumption decreased due to 
more effective lighting but also to less building floor 
space being used. this is mainly due to the substantial 
reduction of our own operations in recent years.

noise
aircraft noise is perceived to be the most material 
impact for local airport stakeholders. there are strict 
regulations in place along flight paths that are close to 
residential areas. during fy 2020, noise emissions at 
take-off decreased 4% and 14% compared to 2010. 
this is due to the introduction of newer and quieter 
aircraft.
sas received a few noise violation reports in fy 2020. 
the number of breaches has declined in recent years 
as a result of the procurement of quieter aircraft and 
improvement initiatives, such as specific flight simula-
tor training scenarios flying to and from airports with 
strict noise regulations.
waste
we work continuously to improve the recycling of 
onboard waste, although this is challenging as waste 
must be handled in accordance with different national 
legislation. the legislation often implies a treatment 
that does not enable sorting or recycling. we do how-
ever recycle aluminum cans at all our scandinavian 
base stations. all disposal of waste is taken care of by 
third-party suppliers. waste from our offices, ground 
services and technical maintenance is measured and 
divided into sorted, unsorted and hazardous waste.
due to the covid-19 pandemic, operations were dra-
matically reduced and in april the serving of all food 
onboard was put on hold and our lounges were closed. 
this resulted in zero food waste, both from our onboard 
catering and lounge service.

environmental regulations and compliance
besides improving resource efficiency and environ-
mental performance, our sustainability work ensures 
that sas operations comply with all applicable environ-
ment-related laws and regulations. no severe incidents 
breaching any environmental permits were reported in 
fy 2020.
environment-related costs
in fy 2020, sas external environment-related user 
charges and travel taxes amounted to msek 627 
(1,807). these charges and travel taxes comprised 
environment-related travel taxes and user charges that 
are sometimes associated with the environmental per-
formance of aircraft and are included in landing fees. 
our environmental taxes in sweden and in norway 
amounted to msek 271 (1,099).
the aviation industry pays for its co2 emissions within 
the eu through the european union emission trading 
scheme (eu-ets), which is an established mar-
ket-based measure. sas expensed emission rights 
related to the eu-ets amounting to msek 4 (247) in 
fy 2020. from 1 january 2021, sas also reports co2 
emissions to corsia. 
we believe that market-based measures should not 
distort competition but should address emission 
reduction targets and create incentives for continuous 
improvement. sas has supported the development of a 
global, market-based solution for airline emissions for 
many years.
sas fully supports the polluter pays principle and 
takes responsibility for its emissions. however, we 
oppose the swedish and norwegian taxes that don't 
address the actual co2 emissions and are in addition 
to eu-ets or the soon to be introduced corsia. the 
result can be seen as a way of implementing economic 
measures, but lacks incentives to reduce co2 emis-
sions. for example, a passenger onboard an a320neo 
aircraft with 50% saf pays the same tax as a passen-
ger onboard an aircraft two generations older, despite 
having approximately 65% lower emissions. 
environment-related liabilities
sas has no known major environment-related liabilities 
or contingent liabilities, such as contaminated land. 
environment-related investments
according to sas guidelines, our investments are to 
be both environmentally and economically sound. this 
contributes to our profitability and helps ensure we can 
meet future environmental requirements.
during fy 2020, no significant environment-related 
investments were conducted. this is because our 
preferred solution is leasing, rather than investing in 
aircraft, vehicles, computers, etc.

sustainable products & services 
during the first two quarters of the year we success-
fully moved toward our goals: 100% recycling and 
100% sustainable product and services by 2030. 
we continuously develop our products and services 
to make them as sustainable as possible in terms of 
resources and materials with a lifecycle perspective. 
due to the covid-19 pandemic, operations have been 
dramatically reduced after mid-march, but sustainabil-
ity remains an important focus in our daily business.
the safety of passengers and employees is always our 
highest priority and because of the covid-19 outbreak, 
additional measures were introduced to ensure safety 
and well-being onboard. we introduced mandatory 
facemasks, safety processes and a safety kit for all staff 
onboard.
in october, we re-started the serving of food onboard, 
starting with a reduced service on flights over 80 min-
utes from denmark. we also opened our lounges with a 
limited food supply. our ambitious sustainability goals 
remain, and we continue to develop more sustainable 
product and services onboard and in our lounges, to be 
introduced as traffic slowly increases.

our approach to employees
as an employer, our responsibility is to ensure decent 
working conditions in the work environments within 
our operations, mainly in the nordic region. sas is 
also responsible for providing personal and profes-
sional development opportunities. the sas work 
environment policy, leadership policy, personnel 
policy and diversity policy apply to all employees at 
sas. group management is ultimately responsible for 
the policies. the policies are reviewed annually, and 
activities are followed up on within the management 
system and reported weekly, monthly, quarterly or 
annually according to specific needs.
we have a zero-tolerance policy toward all forms of 
harassment and work continually to counteract harass-
ment through various activities. this is regulated by our 
code of conduct, and web-based training in the code 
is mandatory for all employees. 
redundancies and cooperation with labor unions
with the new market reality that has come with the 
covid-19 outbreak, sas is adapting and reshaping 
how to plan and navigate short-term as well as taking 
into account the uncertainties surrounding the over-
all future of the aviation industry. unfortunately, we 
were forced to redundencies in our organization and 
we understand the impact this has had on the lives of 
our employees. the workforce has been adjusted and 
redundancies of 5,000 full-time positions were car-
ried out to match the anticipated future demand. this 
meant a reduction of approximately 1,900 positions in 
sweden, 1,300 in norway, 1,700 in denmark and 100 
in all other countries. the redundancies in fy 2020 
were handled through negotiations with labor unions in 
compliance with national laws and agreements.
day-to-day collaboration with labor unions is mainly 
carried out on a national level with unions that have col-
lective agreements with sas. collaborations take place 
within the framework of national laws and agreements 
affecting the unit concerned. sas conducted negotia-
tions and discussions with all unions during fy 2020.
employee representatives from the scandinavian 
countries sit on the sas group board of directors. 
employees elect representatives from units in the 
group’s scandinavian operations. sas employees are 
covered by collective bargaining agreements, with the 
main exception of a few specialists and senior execu-
tives at group level.
diversity and equal opportunities
the sas diversity policy promotes equal treatment of 
all employees and job applicants. our work with equal 
opportunities includes promoting diversity and equality 
in all its forms. in fy 2020, the gender distribution at 
sas was 37% women and 63% men. 
at sas, there is a traditional split between female-dom-
inated roles and male-dominated roles. pilots (4% 
women), and technicians and aircraft maintenance 
staff (5% women) are traditionally male-dominated, 
while cabin crew (78% women), check-in and gate 
personnel at the airports (63% women) are typically 
female-dominated. 
as of october 31, 2020, sas group management com-
prised 29% women, the sas board of directors com-
prised 38% women and sas cargo board of directors 
comprised 40% women.
sas works actively to promote equality in traditional 
gender dominated roles and in management by 
encouraging gender equality and diversity through 
our recruitment policy and annual people reviews. sas 
recruitment policy states that the best candidate for 
a particular position is chosen, with the sas diversity 
aims in mind.

training
in fy 2020, sas employees attended approximately 
350,000 hours of training (excluding in-air training 
hours), which equates to an average of 43 hours per 
employee. the decrease in training hours was due 
to covid-19. flight crews, technical and operational 
ground staff are covered by a number of license and 
competency requirements from eu-ops, and the iata 
through the iosa (iata operational safety audit).

company health services
our health services or health and work environment 
(hwe) function that support the entire organiza-
tion, offers services through in-house or outsourced 
resources including therapists, stress and rehabilita-
tion experts, ergonomic specialists and engineers. the 
function also offers special services, including aviation 
medicine, stress management, follow-up on sick leave, 
health profiles, ergonomics, and advice in handling 
chemicals. investments are made throughout the 
organization into various health-promoting activities 
both in the workplace and during leisure time. during 
the covid-19 pandemic, many employees have been 
working from home according to recommendations 
and quarantine restrictions from authorities. sas was 
well prepared regarding digital solutions, but as for 
many other companies in this situation, it resulted in 
new challenges regarding the work environment.
sick leave
sick leave is a significant expense for society that can 
be caused by physical and mental illness. our calcu-
lation for sick leave costs amounted to approximately 
msek 153 (218) in fy 2020. sas works actively to 
prevent short- and long-term sick leave.
a standardized reporting method is implemented 
for all three scandinavian countries, and sick leave is 
reported according to swedish legislation. managers, 
supported by hr, conduct early follow-ups with sick 
employees, which have reduced long-term absence. 
for crew, special sick leave follow-up teams work in 
close collaboration with external occupational health 
and aeromedical specialists. early contact with employ-
ees and support for medical health care and rehabilita-
tion programs shorten periods of illness.
when short-term sick leave is reported, employees 
are offered medical advice from nurses. in cases of 
frequent short-term sick leave, sas requires a "first 
day doctor’s note". temporary workplaces and spe-
cial work schedules are offered for better and faster 
rehabilitation.
during fy 2020, total sick leave at sas decreased to 
4.2% (5.7%). long-term sick leave, more than 14 days, 
accounted for 3.0% (3.8%) of the total sick leave at 
sas.
occupational accidents
the number of occupational accidents leading to 
absence at sas was nine in fy 2020. the decrease 
during fy2020 was mainly due to reduced workload, 
improved processes for systematic follow-up, educa-
tional activities and clarification of definition in collabo-
ration with safety representatives, supervisors, hr and 
labor-management joint safety committees that cover 
all employees in each country.
ground handling has the highest frequency of occupa-
tional accidents within sas. examples of occupational 
accidents include crushing, falling and in some cases 
involving vehicles in connection with baggage handling.

business ethics and anti-corruption
our management approach is to take an active stance 
against all forms of corruption and anti-competitive 
behavior.
the sas code of conduct, legal policy, and sas anti-
bribery policy are applicable to everyone who acts on 
behalf of sas group. the sas board of directors has 
the overall responsibility for implementing the code 
of conduct and monitoring compliance. compliance is 
monitored throughout the management system and 
through internal audits.
regulations relating to bribery and other improper 
actions are particularly strict. an example is the ongoing 
"competition law compliance program" that covers all 
entities within sas. the program addresses the most 
material risks related to corruption and employees that 
are exposed to corruption risks in their daily work. 
sustainability in our supply chain
we have close to 5,000 suppliers that provide products 
and services. the supply chain is centered around air-
craft operations and the associated services. it includes:
• aircraft and engine manufacturers
• airport and air navigation service providers
• fuel suppliers
• catering suppliers
• it suppliers
• technical maintenance suppliers
• regional production partners
• financial services 
sdg 12 – responsible  
consumption and production
goal 12 promotes sustainable consumption and 
production patterns. sas works continuously with its 
product development and efficiency improvements in 
order to reduce its climate and environmental impacts.
suppliers are primarily situated in the geographical 
areas where sas routes are flown. in line with our oper-
ational model, we are increasingly outsourcing ground 
handling, regional production partners, customer ser-
vices and accounting functions to external suppliers. 
supply chain responsibility
the sas supplier code of conduct and the sas 
purchasing policy cover all purchasing activities 
within sas. group management is responsible for 
the purchasing policy, which is reviewed annually. 
activities are followed up within the management 
system and reported weekly, monthly, quarterly or 
annually according to specific needs.
supply chain governance
our established governance model clarifies supply chain 
responsibilities, risks and improvement areas as well as 
how potential deviations are handled. the responsibility 
for continuously following up with our critical suppli-
ers is centralized and standardized. all sas suppliers 
are required to meet our high prioritized sustainability 
and social responsibility requirements, our purchasing 
policy, and the general terms and conditions of the un 
global compact and other specific sustainability require-
ments. sustainability is highlighted as an evaluation 
criterion in all sas sourcing governance.
the criteria depend on the type of product or service and 
where it is produced, but may include energy efficiency, 
waste handling, collective agreements, human rights, 
child labor, etc. criteria are reviewed and managed in the 
procurement phase and during the agreement period.
stakeholder dialogue
we have a long tradition of ongoing dialogue and coop-
eration with a wide range of stakeholders and involve-
ment in community-related issues. 
sas prioritizes close collaboration with customers, 
authorities, suppliers and airports to create conditions 
to develop solutions for improved sustainability perfor-
mance. sas also engages in dialogue with parties that 
want knowledge, drive change or support sas in dif-
ferent ways, i.e. employees, partners, experts, ngos, 
organizations, researchers, etc.
we see stakeholder dialogue as an opportunity to initi-
ate engagement on relevant topics and to gain input to 
further develop the sas customer offering and sustain-
ability agenda. as an effort to create a greater under-
standing of the aviation industry, we also participate in 
various industry and employee organizations.

product responsibility
we take responsibility for maintaining the highest 
standards of product responsibility and follow strict 
policies as well as applicable legislation concerning 
health and safety, environmental impact, it security 
and food safety. we also have a responsibility to deliver 
products and services that are reliable and are pro-
duced under decent conditions. the sas quality policy 
is applicable to all sas products and services, it is over-
seen and annually reviewed by group management. 
activities are followed up within the management 
system and reported weekly, monthly, quarterly, or 
annually according to their specific needs.
flight safety is highly regulated, and sas is regularly 
audited by external parties. the relevant authorities 
review working conditions for airline personnel regard-
ing areas such as working hours, which help to pro-
mote flight safety.
punctuality and regularity are crucial aspects to deliver 
passenger transport on time and as planned. sas 
works continuously to monitor and improve punctuality 
and regularity, which is highly valued by sas custom-
ers. punctuality is also of high importance for reducing 
emissions.
it security and integrity are increasingly important, and 
sas has an extensive program to ensure the high level 
of it security required. we also comply with the eu 
general data protection regulation (gdpr) legislation.
sas contributes to economic development
our operations benefit society by directly and indirectly 
creating economic value and social welfare in the coun-
tries and communities where we operate.
air bridges for medical supply
sas contributed with transport via air freight to 
bring essential medicine and medical equipment to 
scandinavia during the pandemic.
supporting society
during temporary layoffs, committed employees 
engaged in relieving the strained healthcare sector,
assisting in carrying out public covid-19 tests and vol-
unteering as substitute teachers in elementary
schools.
preparedness for air ambulance operations
sas has a commercial agreement with the swedish 
government to make two specially equipped boeing 
737s available as air ambulances within the framework 
of the swedish national air medevac (snam) in the 
event of a national emergency. a similar agreement 
exists with the norwegian armed forces under which 
sas is to make a remodeled ambulance service 737-
700 available for medical evacuation within 24 hours, 
and a second aircraft within 48 hours if necessary.
christmas flight
every december since 1985, we have supported the 
norwegian "christmas flight". the christmas flight 
is an aid campaign carried out by sas employees 
together with volunteers, who throughout the year 
collect goods and contributions from various partner 
companies and private individuals. we provide an air-
craft with full operational support, while pilots and crew 
volunteer in their free time, and fuel is sponsored by 
a fuel supplier. due to covid-19 no flight were con-
ducted in december 2020.

we promote significant direct economic benefits as an 
employer and a purchaser of goods and services. in 
fy 2020, sas paid wages and salaries totaling msek 
8,252 which included social security expenses of 
msek 1,132 and pensions of msek 859. sas aims to 
achieve market pay for all employee groups.
sas creates economic value by providing the nec-
essary infrastructure to enable smooth passenger 
journeys and cargo transport to, from and within 
scandinavia. air transport pays the costs for the 
infrastructure it needs to operate, such as airports, air 
traffic control and security. in fy 2020, these costs 
amounted to msek 3,461 for scandinavian airlines. of 
these costs, scandinavian airlines paid msek 591 in 
security-related costs.
community support
sas supports social initiatives that are mainly related to 
our airline operations. some initiatives that took place 
during the year were due to the extraordinary situation 
surrounding the covid-19 pandemic.
repatriation flights
to bring home stranded citizens from countries such as 
peru, brazil and pakistan, sas carried out repatriation 
flights on behalf of the scandinavian authorities.
securing infrastructure
sas maintain scandinavian connectivity, especially on 
domestic destinations and secure critical infrastructure 
for travelers and cargo.

sas – u-assist
u-assist is a non-profit initiative launched by sas 
employees in 1979. it is run voluntarily by our employ-
ees, and as a section in the internal sas club, it is 
supported by sas. the main focus is to help children in 
developing countries to get a better life through various 
projects in different countries. during fy 2020, due 
to the closedown of schools, u-assist has focused on 
helping the children and their families with an out-
reach program carried out by local helpers, offering 
food packages and soap together with information on 
hygiene.  approximately 95% of the funds raised by 
u-assist goes directly to the projects, leaving only 5% 
for administration costs.

the sustainability reporting in sas annual 
and sustainability reports, has been subject 
to third-party review since 1996. the report 
describes the company’s most essential envi-
ronmental and societal aspects during fiscal 
year 2020 from 1 november 2019, to  
31 october 2020.
about this report
the annual and sustainability report has been pre-
pared in accordance with the gri standards: core 
option. the un global compact, un sustainability 
development goals, iso 14001 and cdp were also 
taken into consideration in the preparation of this 
report. the sustainability part of this report has been 
prepared following the sas accounting policies for 
sustainability reporting.
in accordance with the swedish annual accounts act, 
sas has prepared a statutory sustainability report,
which has been incorporated into the annual and 
sustainability report fy 2020, separate from the 
report by the board of directors, on pages 116-137. 
the auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustaina-
bility report is included on pages 138-139. 
this annual and sustainability report is a key part 
of our commitment to communicate transparently 
with stakeholders. the 2019 materiality analysis was 
reviewed and updated in 2020 and "sustainability 
communication" was still identified as an area of great 
importance to sas and its stakeholders.

external review: material sustainability information 
and eu-ets
all material sustainability information in the annual and 
sustainability report for fy 2020 has been reviewed 
by kpmg. the auditor’s assurance report can be found 
on pages 138–139.
kpmg has verified the reporting systems regarding 
corsia and the eu trading scheme for emission allow-
ances for flights under the sk flight number.
external initiatives
sas has been a member of the un global compact 
since 2003 and participates in the nordic network. 
one criterion for publishing company information on 
the global compact website is an annual update – the 
communication on progress (cop). the most recent 
sas information update was completed in june 2020. 
the un global compact is a pivotal component of the 
sas code of conduct and the requirements imposed 
on the company’s suppliers.
we have also chosen to use the un sustainable 
development goals (sdgs) as a tool to structure our 
strategic sustainability agenda. see pages 118–119 for 
more on our approach to the sdgs.
examples of organizations related to sustainability 
issues where sas is a member:
•  member of the nordic initiative sustainable aviation.
• member of nordic ceos for a sustainable future.

accounting policies for sustainability reporting fiscal 
year 2020
‘sas’ or ‘the sas group’ is used throughout the report 
when referring to our overall operations.
for fy 2020, sas reports its general sustainability 
results divided into the segments:
•  scandinavian airlines comprises all operations in the 
sas consortium, including sas cargo group (scg).
• sas ground handling (sgh).

for environmental responsibility, sas strives to 
distinguish between airline and ground operations. 
accordingly, the following distinctions have been made:
•  airline operations with an sk flight number. scope 1
•  ground handling in sas ground handling (sgh). 
sgh conducts ground handling for sas and other 
customers, such as other airlines. scope 1.
•  technical maintenance in sas maintenance 
production. sas maintenance production conduct 
technical maintenance primarily for sas but also for 
other customers, such as other airlines. scope 1.
•  freight and mail services within sas cargo group 
a/s (scg). scope 1.
• facilities owned or leased by sas. scope 2.
the sas legal structure is presented on page 48.
monitoring sustainability-related data
we monitor relevant sustainability key performance 
indicators (kpis) on an ongoing basis. sas uses var-
ious parts of the lean methodology and follow-ups 
of these kpis are conducted within the management 
system and reported weekly, monthly, quarterly or 
annually according to specific needs.
as preparation for external sustainability reporting, 
there are data collection processes in the management 
system covering all areas of the sas sustainability 
agenda.
scope of the sustainability work
the goal of the annual and sustainability report is to 
disclose all information necessary to provide the reader 
with a comprehensive overview of our environmental, 
societal, and financial responsibilities. 
the ultimate responsibility for our sustainability 
aspects, and their integration in operational activi-
ties, lies with group management. the annual and 
sustainability report is approved by sas group board 
of directors and sas group management before 
publication. the sas group board of directors submit-
ted the annual and sustainability report fy 2019 in 
january 2020.
limitations
the main principle for sustainability reporting is that all 
units and companies controlled by sas are accounted 
for. this means that sustainability-related data for 
divested companies owned by sas during the period 
is reported wherever possible. the same account-
ing policies as for financial information in the annual 
report are intended to be used for information in the 
sustainability report.
sas has a number of production indicators (such as 
passenger kilometers and tonne kilometers). there 
are differences between the annual report and the 
sustainability report with regards to the disclosure of 
the number of passenger kilometers. the annual report 
uses revenue passenger kilometers (rpk) where paying 
passengers are included, while the sustainability report 
uses passenger kilometers (pk) where all passengers 
(including non revenue) are included.
standard definitions for environmental and societal 
data have been applied throughout sas. none of the 
limitations are considered to have any substantial 
significance.
changes in accounting policies and calculating 
principles 
none.
principles for reporting and calculating external 
and other environment related costs 
where possible, environment-related costs are based 
on information directly from the accounting system. 
when this has not been possible, for example, for cal-
culations of certain charges and taxes that are included 
in landing charges, estimates were used based on the 
number of passengers to a certain destination and the 
charge or tax per passenger.
principles for reporting and calculating 
 environmental data 
reported environmental information is based on the 
following calculations and/or factors:
• distance, based on wgs84 great circle distance 
(gcd) calculations between airport reference points 
as defined in national aeronautical information 
publication (aips).
• passenger weight for pk calculations uses 100 kg for 
any person with hand luggage and checked luggage 
transported. this does not include active crew.
• cargo and mail, actual weight is used.
• fuel density (kg per liter): 
– jet a/a-11: actual density or 0.8 
– diesel: 0.84 
– petrol: 0.73 
– heating oil: 0.84
• co2 factor (per weight unit of fuel): 
– jet a/a-11: 3.15 
– diesel: 3.17

co2 emissions per passenger kilometer  
and cargo tonne kilometer – scope 1
sas has chosen to apply a calculation method to divide 
the amount of fuel used for passenger and cargo trans-
port before dividing the amount by passenger or cargo 
tonne-kilometer. the method is based on the iata 
carbon calculator tool. the assumption is that fuel 
usage is proportional to weight. passenger fuel usage 
is the ratio of total passenger weight to total weight 
multiplied by the total fuel used. the remainder is allo-
cated to cargo transport.
total passenger
fuel usage
=
(total passenger weight/
total weight) 
x
total fuel used
where, total weight
=
total passenger weight
+
total freight/cargo weight
total passenger 
weight (kg)
=
(number of seats x 50 kg)
+
(number of passengers x 100 kg)
the calculation method allocates 50 kg per seat as a 
prerequisite for passenger transport and the same 
weight per passenger as used in all other calculations 
applied within the industry.
for cases when flights were conducted without pas-
sengers or freight/cargo transport, all co2 emissions 
were allocated as passenger transport. this may 
include training flights, positioning flights between 
scheduled flights, and flights to/from maintenance, 
etc. the reason for this changed calculation method 
is to achieve more precise co2 emissions per produc-
tion unit calculations. the previous calculation method 
essentially involved double accounting, with emissions 
per passenger kilometer including the fuel used for 
freight/cargo transport and vice versa. 
 
co2 emissions per available seat kilometer – scope 1
in order to calculate the co2 emissions for each avail-
able seat, the assumption is that each seat is occupied 
by one passenger which corresponds to 100 kg. the 
metric is calculated by dividing the total co2 emissions 
with the total available tonne kilometer and then multi-
plied with 0.1 (i.e. 100 kg or 0.1 tonne).
principles for reporting and calculating  
employee data
the following principles for calculating and reporting 
societal data have been used.
occupational accidents (h value)
frequency of occupational accidents (h value) is 
 calculated using the following formula:
no. of occupational accidents with a minimum 
of one day absence x 1,000,000
total number of performed working hours per year
number of employees
in this report, the number of employees is based on the 
number of persons during the month of october and sick 
leave statistics calculated for the fiscal year. the statistics 
include employees with a budgeted or actual schedule 
and/or who were sick during the period. employees hired 
outside scandinavia are included in the disclosure as 
denmark.
sick leave
sick leave is reported as the number of days sick in 
relation to the number of employees multiplied by the 
number of calendar days. for sick leave, absence due 
to sick children is excluded. long-term sick leave (more 
than 14 days) is reported as a percentage of the total 
sick leave.

auditor’s limited assurance report on sas ab sustainability report and 
statement regarding the statutory sustainability report
to sas ab, corp. id. 556606-8499
introduction
we have been engaged by the board of directors and 
the chief executive officer of sas ab to undertake a 
limited assurance engagement of sas ab sustainability 
report for the financial year 2019-11-01 – 2020-10-31. 
sas ab has defined the scope of the sustainability 
report that also is the statutory sustainability report 
on page 2 in this document.
responsibilities of the board of directors 
and the chief executive officer 
the board of directors and the chief executive officer 
are responsible for the preparation of the sustainability 
report including the statutory sustainability report 
in accordance with applicable criteria and the annual 
accounts act respectively. the criteria are defined on 
page 132 in the sustainability report, and are part of 
the sustainability reporting standards published by 
gri (the global reporting initiative), that are applica-
ble to the sustainability report, as well as the account-
ing and calculation principles that the company has 
developed. this responsibility also includes the internal 
control relevant to the preparation of a sustainability 
report that is free from material misstatements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
auditor’s responsibility 
our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
sustainability report based on the limited assurance 
procedures we have performed and to express an 
opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report. 
our assignment is limited to the historical information 
that is presented and does not cover future-oriented 
information.
we conducted our limited assurance engagement in 
accordance with isae 3000 assurance engagements 
other than audits or reviews of financial information. 
a limited assurance engagement consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the prepa-
ration of the sustainability report, and applying analyti-
cal and other limited assurance procedures. our exami-
nation regarding the statutory sustainability report has 
been conducted in accordance with far’s accounting 
standard revr12 the auditor’s opinion regarding the 
statutory sustainability report. a limited assurance 
engagement and an examination according to revr 12 
is different and substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with international standards 
on auditing and generally accepted auditing standards 
in sweden. 
the firm applies isqc 1 (international standard on 
quality control) and accordingly maintains a compre-
hensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethi-
cal requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements. we are independ-
ent of sas ab in accordance with professional ethics 
for accountants in sweden and have otherwise fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
the limited assurance procedures performed and the 
examination according to revr 12 do not enable us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
the conclusion based on a limited assurance engage-
ment and an examination according to revr 12 does 
not provide the same level of assurance as a conclusion 
based on an audit.

our procedures are based on the criteria defined by 
the board of directors and chief executive officer as 
described above. we consider these criteria suitable for 
the preparation of the sustainability report. 
we believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions below. 
conclusions
based on the limited assurance procedures performed, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the sustainability report is not prepared, 
in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria 
defined by the board of directors and chief executive 
officer. 
a statutory sustainability report has been prepared.

1)  as a consequence of the group’s fiscal year changing to 1 november–31 october, fiscal year 2012 was shortened to the period 1 january–31 october. yield-based key figures are calculated based on income items for a 12-month period.
2)  sas calculates various alternative performance measures (apms) that complement the metrics defined in the applicable rules for financial reporting. the apms facilitate comparison between different periods and are used for internal analysis of the business’s performance, 
 development and financial position, and are therefore deemed to provide valuable information to external stakeholders, such as investors, analysts, rating agencies and others. for definitions, refer to the definitions & concepts section. a list of the apms deemed of sufficient 
 material importance to specify is available at www.sasgroup.net under investor relations.
3) the key ratios for 2020 are inclusive of ifrs 16. the key ratios from last year are based on financial statements excluding ifrs 16 and have not been restated. 
4) key ratios calculated according to another definition as per 31 october 2020. previous years’ key figures have not been restated.  
the apms are calculated using averages of the qualifying periods’ balance-sheet items. until 2019, the return on invested capital, adjusted equity/assets ratio and adjusted debt/equity ratio were calculated using capitalized leasing costs, net, whereby operational leasing 
 commitments for aircraft were taken into consideration.

per day at a given airport, with regard 
to the aircraft types the airline uses 
at that airport. the weighted noise 
contour defines the area in km2 that 
is subjected to a noise footprint of 
85 db(a) or more in connection with 
take-off.
