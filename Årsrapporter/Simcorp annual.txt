the merged business unit emea comprises 
sale of simcorp dimension, simcorp coric, 
and simcorp gain across europe, middle east, 
and africa, where simcorp entered south af-
rica in 2020. despite the impact of covid-19, 
the business unit performed satisfactorily 
with total revenue increasing by 2% compared 
with 2019. the growth was primarily driven 
by strong additional license sales, including 
a new business partnership with state street 
bank international gmbh providing a fully 
integrated, front-to-back investment out-
sourcing solution for insurance firms in emea. 
four new simcorp dimension clients were 
signed in 2020, while one client canceled its 
contract, bringing the total number of clients 
up to 150. the new client wins and the order 
intake from additional licenses increased the 
value of the total installed simcorp dimension 
license base by eur 15m, reaching eur 674m.
in the north american business unit, which 
now also includes the region’s sales of  
simcorp coric and simcorp gain, total rev-
enue increased by 10% compared with 2019. 
the revenue was primarily driven by new license 
sales, professional services sales, and hosting 
revenue. four new simcorp dimension clients 
were signed, while two simcorp dimension 
clients canceled their contracts, bringing the 
total number of clients up to 37, equaling 
an estimated market share of 7% in north 
america. three out of the four new license 
deals signed in 2020 are based on simcorp’s 
as a service (hosted) offering. in addition, 
five new standalone simcorp coric clients, 
and one together with simcorp dimension, 
were signed in 2020. total installed simcorp 
dimension license base was eur 136m at the 
end of 2020. 
simcorp sofia, continuing as a separate busi-
ness unit, has developed above expectations 
in 2020. simcorp sofia delivered total revenue 
growth of 3%, driven by a continued strong 
performance of additional license sales to 
existing clients. one new simcorp sofia client 
was signed in 2020, while two clients canceled 
their contracts, bringing the total number of 
simcorp sofia clients to 42. 
in apac, the business unit, which now also 
includes the sales of simcorp coric and 
simcorp gain in the region, total revenue decli- 
ned by 31% compared with 2019. the decline 
was mainly driven by exceptionally high sales 
in 2019, which included a large deal in south 
korea and the revenue recognition of a large 
deal signed in 2018. four new simcorp 
dimension clients were signed in 2020, of 
which two are based on simcorp’s as a service 
(hosted) offering, while two clients canceled 
their contracts. with the two net new simcorp 
dimension clients added in 2020, simcorp 
serves 19 simcorp dimension clients in the 
apac region, corresponding to an estimated 
market share of 11%. the total value of the 
installed simcorp dimension license base was 
eur 66m at the end of 2020. simcorp serves 
two standalone simcorp coric clients and two 
standalone simcorp gain clients in apac.

a resilient and vastly adaptable business 
model together with flexible, digital savvy 
staff have kept simcorp on a good track 
during an unprecedented year. 
while people, processes, and technology 
have all been challenged across our industry, 
simcorp’s innovative solution delivery and 
business continuity have been largely uninter-
rupted through a time of significant market 
volatility. high adaptability to virtual collabo-
ration among our clients and employees has 
enabled us to continue doing business and 
many clients have gone live or done upgrades 
with assistance from simcorp staff working 
100% remotely. this is the ultimate test of 
resilience, and we are grateful to our loyal 
clients and committed employees who have 
made this possible.
strategy confirmed  
and transformation ongoing 
during 2020, the board of directors has 
confirmed the strategic direction, priorities, 
and imperatives as launched in 2019. 
guided by our strategy, we have started our 
transition to become a true everything as a 
service company based on our cloud journey. 
throughout the year, we have seen solid 
proof-points of transition progress, as many 
of our new clients have signed as a service 
agreements, and several existing clients have 
migrated from on-premise to cloud-based as a 
service setups. 
a steep increase in virtual collaboration 
during covid-19 has fast-tracked the need 
for digitalization both at our clients and at 
simcorp, with the majority of staff working 
from home. our move to the cloud is further 
validated by this trend. cloud computing can 
help accelerate our digital transformation and 
offers a boost to innovation by empowering 
us to leverage new technologies like machine 
learning and high-performance computing.
sustainability and accountabilitly
leveraging cloud and new technologies is 
a key enabler of sustainability, which is a 
main focus for simcorp. reducing our co₂ 
emission, expanding support for our clients’ 
esg investments, creating a truly diverse and 
inclusive workplace, and ensuring meaning 
in work constitute our current sustainability 
priorities. 
we believe that our employees and who we are 
as a company put us in a strong position to set 
ambitious sustainability targets, and we hold 
ourselves accountable for meeting these goals.
building an ecosystem of partners 
on an open platform
a strong focus on building strategic part-
nerships, most recently with state street, is 
part of our strategic imperative ‘ecosystem 
enabled innovation’. the goal is to strengthen 
our capacity and ability to innovate and offer 
our clients optionality across their operations 
and the investment lifecycle, by leveraging an 
external ecosystem of partners.
alongside a number of new partnerships in 
2020, solid r&d investments have enabled us 
to further strengthen our offering, spanning 
from additional standard platform solutions 
shortening time to value for our clients, to new 
capabilities within datacare meeting demands 
for more holistic managed data services. 
simcorp has also signed its first north 
american client development partner for 
coric digital portal, a state-of-the-art client 
reporting saas portal built on microsoft 
azure, which offers simcorp clients a next- 
generation self-service portal with digital 
insights and engagement analytics. 
supporting clients without  
the constraint of borders 
in 2020, we announced the merger of 
 simcorp’s european market units, central 
europe, southern europe, and uk/northern 
europe/middle east, into one integrated 
emea unit. the move is designed to support 
our clients by developing closer collaboration 
across borders and achieving greater scale 
and agility in key business functions. 
the high increase in virtual collaboration across  
all geographies during covid-19 has proved 
to provide even bigger benefits to our entire  
client base than an internal merger can genera- 
te. we will make sure we continue to leverage 
these positive experiences post-covid-19.
 
distribution of profit
according to our profit distribution policy, we 
intend to pay dividends of at least 40% of the 
annual net profit and use additional cash to 
buy treasury shares depending on other cash 
requirements. in 2020, we paid a dividend 
of eur 39.9m, equal to dkk 7.50 per share, 
peter schÜtze
chairman of the board of directors
klaus holse
chief executive officer
and acquired treasury shares for eur 10m. 
based on the financial performance in 2020, 
the board of directors intends to propose to 
shareholders at the agm a dividend of eur 
40.1m, equal to dkk 7.50 per share, for the 
financial year 2020. furthermore, we plan 
to initiate a new share buyback program, 
acquiring treasury shares for a forecast 
amount of eur 40m in 2021, split into two 
programs of eur 20m each. 
thank you
staying on track to sustained long-term 
growth and successfully meeting the challeng-
es of covid-19 has been fully dependent on 
our highly capable and committed employees, 
and we would like to thank everyone at 
simcorp for your true dedication, agility, and 
relentless efforts. based on a passion to never 
let a client down, every single employee has 
lived the culture of our company captured in 
“the 4cs”, by being capable, collaborative, and 
curious, while demonstrating courage.
our appreciation also goes to our sharehold-
ers and business partners for their trust and 
co-operation. last but not least, we extend 
our gratitude to our loyal clients, new as well 
as existing ones, who have demonstrated 
great flexibility and adaptability to stay in 
close contact during these challenging times 
and continue to place their business with 
simcorp.

vision and strategy
driven by our passion to create value for our clients as their 
trusted business partner and opening up our native front-to-back, 
multi-asset, platform to an ecosystem of partners, we are strongly 
positioned to sustain long-term growth and profitability.
in 2019, we presented our new strategy, 
outlining how we are entering a new phase 
in the evolution of simcorp, through which 
we are transforming simcorp to become a 
software-enabled service company. the past 
year has demonstrated the robustness of 
our business model as we have successfully 
continued this transformation during a time 
of unprecedented challenges and volatility. 
a robust business model
simcorp’s highly transparent business model 
builds on four main revenue drivers: software 
licenses; software updates and support; 
professional services; and hosting and other 
fees. these revenue drivers derive from our 
investments in our four best-in-class product 
offerings: simcorp dimension®; simcorp 
coric®; simcorp gain™, and simcorp 
sofia™, along with third-party products and 
partnerships.
to ensure that these offerings are always 
up-to-date and at the forefront of the 
industry’s needs, we invest around 20% of 
annual revenue back into r&d, which togeth-
er with the native integrated, muti-asset 
and front-to-back nature of our platform 
simcorp dimension differentiate our value 
proposition compared with the competition.
while adding to the solidity of our business 
model and reducing operational risk, the 
flexibility and scalability of our solutions 
result in long-lasting client relationships, as 
they allow our mutual engagement to de-
velop and grow over time. during covid-19, 
we have continued our strong focus on 
constantly nurturing our client relationships 
through virtual meetings, workshops, and 
training programs. the strength of these 
relationships and a resilient operating model 
have enabled us to continue carrying out 
implementations, software updates and 
support activities, client-driven development 
programs, and professional services opera-
tions. approximately 90% of our annual 
revenue is derived from existing clients and 
more than 50% is recurring.

strategic 
imperatives
our strategy will continue supporting and 
evolving our business model, empowering 
us to keep growing our engagement with 
existing clients and attracting new clients.
strategic imperatives
during the past year, we have been guided by 
three strategic imperatives that are forming 
our overall strategic journey, with our cloud 
transformation as the underlying key enabler. 
in 2020, we have made solid progress on the 
execution of these imperatives, while gaining 
a deeper and broader understanding of the 
key steps we need to take on our journey 
towards becoming a software-enabled service 
company. 
take customer experience leadership 
we are already seeing early signs that 
elevating and working systematically with 
customer experience has the potential to 
become a real competitive differentiator 
and source of significant value creation to 
simcorp. we have transformed our go-to-
market and engagement model, supported 
by an organizational setup based on client 
lifecycle needs and with clear accountabilities 
for driving client success. 
deliver everything as a service
the trend towards clients wanting to buy and 
consume everything as a service is continuing 
with growing momentum. we want to seize 
this opportunity and make it easy, flexible, 
cost-effective and highly valuable for clients 
to consume our technology solutions.
moreover, we want to leverage our developing 
service capabilities to capture a significantly 
larger share of our clients’ overall it spend.
we have now gained some experience with 
what it means to operate managed services 
and will continue our journey towards becom-
ing, at least partially, an operations company 
with a multi-delivery mode capability. 
 offer ecosystem enabled innovation 
our industry is becoming gradually more
ecosystem-driven and we want to secure 
simcorp’s long-term sustainability by 
transforming into a platform business offering 
buy-side firms end-to-end digitalization of 
their investment life cycle needs. this implies 
building out an ecosystem of connected 
partners with complementary capabilities 
who leverage the simcorp platform as a key 
gateway to the market.
we plan to accelerate the development of 
commercial partnerships with third-party 
solution providers as a lever to innovate 
and scale our business, while offering more 
value-creating optionality to our clients. in 
addition, we will continue to build alliances 
with various capital markets infrastructure 
providers, such as custodians, to strengthen 
our platform value proposition and access 
market segments we are not able to reach as 
effectively directly. 
cloud technology transformation 
a foundation in the long term to realizing our 
strategic imperatives is our cloud technology 
transformation. becoming ‘cloud-based’ is 
a multi-year endeavor and the license to 
operate and compete in the future, as it is 
the basis for delivering software as a service, 
cost-effectively scaling our operations, and 
driving ecosystem enabled innovation.

strategic priorities and long-term ambition
status and update
we have focused strongly on progressing our 
strategic priorities for 2020, and as two of 
these, standard platform and simcorp gain, 
have now achieved scale, we will discontinue 
them as separate strategic priorities. in their 
place, we have added coric digital portal and 
datacare to our priorities for 2021, in line with 
our transformation towards becoming an 
everything as a service company.
while our cloud technology transformation 
remains the foundation for our strategic 
imperatives, we will continue to focus our 
efforts on achieving front office market 
leadership and sustaining the momentum of 
our alternative investments offering. 
long-term ambition 
based on evolving client needs, the current 
business environment, and a successful execu-
tion of our updated strategy, simcorp is well 
positioned to deliver on its financial ambition 
of long-term, double-digit, annual revenue 
growth and gradually improved profitability 
margin, with the inevitable fluctuations in reve-
nue growth and profitability margin caused by 
the timing of orders and investments.
2020 status of achievements
2021 goals and focus
front office market leadership
front office market leadership
during 2020, we further strengthened our 
position as a leading global front office solu-
tion provider, with several key clients choos-
ing our front office across north america, 
emea and apac. 
the solution has been further opened up to 
3rd party applications via additional applica-
tion programming interfaces (apis) allow-
ing for a wider set of analytics and greater 
automation. 
to meet our clients’ concern about pressure 
on market liquidity, we have made several 
product enhancements, which will allow cli-
ents to make more out of the current market 
situation, the inventory they hold, and poten-
tial investment opportunities.
during 2021, we will continue focusing on 
partnerships, automation, and interoperabil-
ity within a front office ecosystem, allowing 
clients to embed their own innovation and 
resulting analytics to facilitate both invest-
ment and trading decision making. those 
organizations who operate at scale will be 
able to further automate processes, while 
those who wish to differentiate themselves 
can embed their own intellectual property 
into the decision making processes. 
we envisage that during 2021, we will strike 
further strategic alliances with firms offering 
solutions and analytics to completement 
those offered by simcorp.
cloud lift
cloud offer
in 2020, we made good progress on the 
cloud lift to move simcorp dimension from 
a 2-tier to a 3-tier architecture, a journey 
that will continue into 2022. the 3-tier 
architecture will allow us to offer high-scale 
public apis, better resource utilization, and 
increased security. most important, however, 
will be the capability to integrate bi-direc-
tionally with cloud services. the cloud lift is 
a required step in transforming simcorp into 
an everything as a service company and to 
open up our platform for ecosystem-enabled 
innovation. 
furthermore, we have come far in building 
simcorp dimension as a service on public 
cloud (microsoft azure), to be launched 
early 2021.
in 2021, we will focus on bringing new cloud-
based services to market and launching 
simcorp dimension as a service on public 
cloud (microsoft azure) as part of our trans-
formation towards delivering everything as 
a service. 
we will further increase the connectivity of 
our open ecosystem with even more apis 
giving easy access to simcorp dimension, 
on premise and in the cloud. we will contin-
ue our work on providing additional cloud-
based functionality for fast, scalable, and 
cost-effective calculations for performance 
measurements, reporting, and historical data 
analysis.
in parallel, we will continue our cloud lift 
and re-architecture of simcorp dimension, 
continuing into 2022.

alternative investments excellence
alternative investments excellence
while adding advanced analytics and com-
pliance capabilities to our core offering, in 
2020, we made a breakthrough with stream-
lining alternatives investments transaction 
processing, leveraging advanced machine 
learning technology. 
through our partnership with alkymi, 
we are able to automate the processing 
of various pdfs and bring alternatives 
closer to traditional asset classes with 
straight-through-processing. also, a solution 
has been initiated to handle alternatives 
illiquidity, pacing plans, and forecasting. 
overall, more than 50 clients have adopt-
ed one or more of simcorp’s solutions for 
alternatives, since the launch of our fully 
integrated alternative investments offering, 
confirming the market buy-in for our value 
proposition of an integrated front-to-back 
cross-asset ibor and abor. 
in 2021, as alternatives remain a priority for 
asset managers, we will continue our strate-
gic investment in the area, and support our 
clients on the simcorp dimension platform 
by further transforming and simplifying the 
handling of alternative investments, and con-
tinue to deliver unique integrated outcomes 
for two main areas: 
firstly, we will streamline data processing, 
building on the 2020 breakthrough, and 
expand the coverage of data and documents 
handled with automation, allowing clients to 
fully own the data processing value chain. 
secondly, we will continue the journey on 
strategically forecasting and monitoring al-
ternatives exposure in a cross-asset portfolio, 
with a first set of offers brought to the mar-
ket. based on these expansions, we expect to 
continue increasing the adoption of our core 
and innovative alternatives offer across our 
existing client base.
expand standard platform
coric engage
in 2020, we continued the investment in our 
standard platform offering, including new ar-
eas of our solutions to both new and existing 
clients. furthermore, we expanded the usage 
and coverage of our business process frame-
work with additional ip and tools to help our 
clients efficiently capture the full value of 
simcorp dimension.
in 2021, our standard platform solutions will 
be fully integrated in our offerings across 
simcorp’s business and serve as a basic ap-
proach to all our cloud offerings, ultimately 
as the foundation for all deliveries when sim-
corp has transformed to an everything as a 
service company. hence, standard platform 
will be retired as a separate strategic priority. 
in 2021, we will launch our offer for digital 
client communications, coric digital portal, 
providing interactive data and document 
access to clients and their investors.  
delivered as a cloud native solution, the offer 
is fully automated, dynamically scaling to 
meet user demand.
furthermore, we will continue to add func-
tionality such as user analytics tools, which 
provide insights on client interests and 
usage, allowing asset managers to better 
understand the client base and respond 
proactively to their concerns and driving a 
better customer experience.  
simcorp gain & datacare
datacare
in 2020, we successfully built out and so-
lidified our datacare offer, adding four new 
datacare clients, so the total is now five, of 
which three are fully live and operational, 
and a very mature pipeline for 2021. this 
significant achievement is based on a very 
strong service design and a high degree of 
process integration across all teams deliver-
ing the datacare service.
following the acquisition of aim software, 
simcorp gain is now integrated into sim-
corp’s standard development and global 
support processes, and we have grown 
capacity in this area. hence the product 
becomes a part of normal business and is 
retired as a separate strategic priority.
main focus in 2021 will be to further auto-
mate and improve our operational processes 
in order to create scale as well as the build 
out of the data advisory pillar of our data-
care service to institutionalize the continu-
ous generation of business know-how and 
its operationalization through the service. 
this will substantially support us in being 
able to grow with the business needs of our 
clients and continue to add value.

targets 2021
in 2021, simcorp expects revenue growth in local currencies 
of between 6% and 11%, with an ebit margin measured in local 
currencies of between 24.5%  and 27.5%. 
market developments
although the volume of deals available in 
the coming year is always difficult to predict, 
simcorp’s market performance over recent 
years, and its highly competitive integrated 
front-to-back, multi-asset, investment manage- 
ment solutions make the company well- 
positioned for increasing its market share in 
2021.
on a macroeconomic level, simcorp regards 
the underlying trends for 2021 as slightly 
negative to its business, due to the continued 
challenges caused by the covid-19 pandemic 
and political turmoil. simcorp expects 
covid-19 restrictions to be maintained until 
planned vaccine programs have been success-
fully implemented across its markets. in the 
short term, this is expected to lead to some 
hesitancy in clients’ decision making, thereby 
causing longer sales processes. hence, it 
is assumed that h1 2021 will be impacted 
by covid-19 restrictions, while h2 2021 is 
expected to be less impacted as the world 
returns to more normal working conditions.
on the other hand, gauging the input from 
our clients and global financial outlook reports 
of consultancies and other experts, one key 
topic emerges: the need to replace legacy 
platforms with more efficient, tech-driven, 
automated operating models. covid-19 
has clearly augmented this need and the 
persisting demand for lower cost, better 
data, a more digitized customer experience, 
and regulatory compliance. according to 
mckinsey, the covid-19 pandemic has leaped 
forward the tech/digitalization agenda by five 
years.  
with its consistent high investments in cloud 
transformation and cloud-based offerings, and 
further development of its service offerings, 
simcorp is strongly positioned to meet the 
accelerating need for tech-driven operating 
models, with solutions that fully address the 
top priorities of the investment management 
industry for 2021, including:
• cost savings and cost-efficient automated    
     operations
• cost-effective regulatory compliance
• scalable operating platforms to support 
     growth
• improved, digitized client servicing
• risk management 
• everything as a service
simcorp also expects to continue to benefit 
from cross-selling between its core offering 
simcorp dimension and its two integrated 
solutions for client reporting and data 
management.
revenue and profit  
outlook for 2021
simcorp’s ambition is to generate long-term, 
double-digit, annual revenue growth, and to 
gradually improve our profitability margin, 
recognizing inevitable fluctuations in both 
revenue growth and profitability margin from 
year to year due to timing of orders and 
investments. 
based on the current business environment, 
the current pipeline, simcorp’s market 
position, and planned investments, the 
expectations for 2021 are to grow revenue in 
local currencies between 6% and 11%, and to  
generate an ebit margin measured in local 
currencies of between 24.5% and 27.5%.

simcorp changed its licensing model in 2016, 
from a perpetual license model to a sub-
scription-based model. this applies to initial 
simcorp dimension licenses only, as existing 
clients have already acquired the right to 
use simcorp dimension under the perpetual 
license model and thereby can continue 
buying additional licenses under the perpetual 
model. some existing clients, however, might 
choose to convert from a perpetual model to 
a subscription-based model.
according to ifrs 15, subscription-based 
license revenue will be recognized in the year 
of sale, provided that no functionality gaps 
or unmet acceptance criteria exist. revenue 
recognition is similar for subscription-based 
and perpetual licenses, although the subscrip-
tion-based license fees are discounted to net 
present value. the cash flow from a subscrip-
tion-based contract will, however, be received 
over the contract period resulting in income 
recognition before cash is received and 
increasing contract assets on the statement of 
financial position.
conversions from perpetual to subscrip-
tion-based licenses are expected to be 
lower in 2021 compared with 2020, having 
an estimated 2%-points negative impact on 
revenue growth. to partly offset the impact 
of fewer conversions, renewals of existing 
contracts are expected to be higher in 2021 
compared with 2020, having an estimated 
1%-point positive impact on revenue growth. 
in total, conversions and renewals are expect-
ed to have an estimated negative impact on 
the revenue growth of 1%-point and estimated 
0.7%-points negative impact on ebit margin, 
which is included in the guidance.
software updates and support revenue is 
estimated to be at the same level in 2021 as in 
2020, as growth from new agreements with 
initial and existing clients, and small price 
increases due to low inflation, are expected to 
be offset by conversions and cancellations of 
existing contracts. 
simcorp offers simcorp dimension as a ser-
vice (scdaas) to clients who prefer a hosted 
delivery model. simcorp passes through the 
related costs to third-party it-infrastructure 
providers at marginal profits, which means 
that its scdaas offering has a dilutive impact 
on ebit margins. in 2021, the pass-through 
of hosting is expected to impact revenue 
growth positively by around 1%-points and to 
have a negative impact on the ebit margin of 
0.5%-points, which is included in the guidance.
based on the exchange rates prevailing at 
the end of january 2021, simcorp estimates 
reported revenue to be negatively impacted 
from currency fluctuations by around 1.2% 
and reported ebit margin to be negatively 
impacted from currency fluctuations by 
around 0.1%-points. 
for 2021, simcorp expects a group effective 
tax rate of between 23% and 25% compared 
with a realized effective tax rate of 24.0% in 
2020.
for 2021, simcorp expects a cash conversion 
of between 70% and 80% compared with a 
realized cash conversion of 104% in 2020. the 
lower expected free cash flow is due to the 
negative impact of increased contract assets 
following expected higher license revenue, 
postponed payments of income taxes and 
social charges offered under government 
covid-19 related support schemes, and a 
one-off payment in 2021 following a change 
in the danish holiday act.  cash conversion is 
defined as free cash flow divided by profit for 
the year. 
income will vary considerably from one 
reporting period to the next as the timing of 
license sales by nature varies.

covid-19
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic created 
unprecedented challenges for individuals, 
businesses, and society. since the outbreak 
of the pandemic, simcorp has followed its 
development closely, both globally and locally, 
ensuring that the necessary precautions 
have been taken. at group level, simcorp’s 
covid-19 crisis management task force, 
established right at the beginning of the out-
while we have been able to work effective 
remotely, we have experienced some hesitan- 
cy in clients’ decision making, thereby caus- 
ing longer sales processes in 2020. during the 
covid-19 crisis, we have been cost-conscious, 
but also invested in our future. 
a steep increase in virtual collaboration 
during covid-19 has fast-tracked the need 
for digitalization both at our clients and at 
simcorp, looking ahead, we will continue to 
make large investments in digitalization and 
technology, which will also be crucial in a 
post-covid-19 environment, in order to keep 
ensuring the well-being of our employees and 
to better serve our clients.
financial expectations and  
results 2020
in the 2019 annual report, simcorp announced 
2020 expectations for revenue growth meas- 
ured in local currencies of between 5% and 
10% and an ebit margin measured in local cur- 
rencies of between 24.0% and 27.0%. extra 
investments in cloud lift and the integration 
of simcorp gain were expected to impact the 
ebit margin negatively in 2020 by approxi-
mately 2%-points and 1%-point, respectively.
on march 18, 2020, simcorp suspended its 
guidance for 2020 as a consequence of the 
covid-19 pandemic. 
based on the assumption that the global indu- 
stry would return to more normal working 
conditions after the holiday break in july and 
august, but with some expected delays in 
signing deals, simcorp revised its guidance 
for 2020 on may 18, 2020, with expected 
revenue growth measured in local currencies 
of between minus 5% and plus 5%, and an 
ebit margin measured in local currencies of 
between 22.0% and 27.0%. 
on december 11, 2020, simcorp upgraded 
its revenue expectations measured in local 
currencies to be between minus 2% and 
plus 4% and ebit margin expectations to 
be between 25.0% and 28.0% measured in 
local currencies. the upgraded expectations 
were caused by a combination of a strategic 
expansion of an agreement with state street 
bank, which included a conversion from the 
existing perpetual license agreement to a 
new subscription-based license agreement, 
longer sales cycles due to covid-19, as well 
as a successful execution of cost containment 
measures. 
the development in financial guidance and 
the realized financial results can be seen in the 
table to the left.
order intake and order book
in 2020, total license order intake of eur 
115.1m was an increase of eur 15.4m com-
pared with 2019. the increase was primarily 
due to higher order intake for datacare of 
eur 12.9m compared with an order intake 
of eur 2.0m in 2019 and higher order intake 
for  simcorp dimension orders related to 
simcorp’s client-driven development (cdd) 
program of eur 5.8m compared with an 
order intake of eur 2.8m in 2019. compared 
with 2019, the order intake for simcorp 
dimension, excluding cdd, increased slightly 
from eur 77.1m in 2019 to eur 79.2m in 2020. 
the order intake for simcorp coric was eur 
8.6m compared with eur 10.6m in 2019. for

6.1m compared with eur 5.2m in 2019, and 
simcorp gain had an order intake of eur 
2.5m compared with 2.0m in 2019.
simcorp dimension license solutions were 
sold to 17 new clients in 2020, all on subscrip-
tion-based terms, with a total order inflow of 
eur 20.5m, compared with sales to 17 new 
clients in 2019 with a total order inflow of eur 
36.9m. the average size of initial simcorp 
dimension license deals decreased from eur 
3.1m in 2019 to eur 1.7m in 2020. 
the 12 simcorp dimension initial license orders 
in 2020 were well distributed across simcorp’s 
growth and mature markets. four initial license 
orders were signed in the designated growth 
market north america, three of which were 
selected as a service (hosted) solutions. four 
initial license orders were signed in emea, one 
of which was selected as a service (hosted) 
solution. also, four initial license orders were 
signed in apac, two of which were selected as 
a service (hosted) solutions.
simcorp coric sold five new standalone 
solutions and one solution as part of a new 
simcorp dimension deal, one of which was 
selected as a service (hosted) solution. all 
six simcorp coric solutions sold in 2020 
were signed in north america. in 2020, four 
simcorp datacare solutions were sold to 
existing simcorp dimension clients or as part 
of a new simcorp dimension deal. 
additional license sales were significantly 
higher than last year. the most notable 
additional license sale was the large strategic 
agreement referred to above with simcorp’s 
existing client, state street bank international 
gmbh. the agreement sees simcorp and 
state street bank form a business partnership 
to provide a premier, fully integrated, front-
to-back investment outsourcing solution for 
insurance firms in emea. the expansion of the 
engagement with state street bank interna-
tional gmbh includes a conversion from the 
existing perpetual license agreement to a new 
subscription-based license agreement.
the additional order intake increased by eur 
18.1m from five clients, including state street 
bank, converting their perpetual contracts 
to subscription-based license contracts. for 
the five clients converting in 2020, the annual 
subscription-based payments will be eur 
0.4m higher than the software updates and 
support fees under the perpetual contracts 
the order book includes order book for 
simcorp dimension client-driven develop-
ment (cdd) of eur 13.9m (december 31, 2019: 
eur 17.0m), simcorp dimension, excluding 
cdd of eur 22.3m (december 31, 2019: eur 
15.8m), simcorp coric contracts of eur 3.0m 
(december 31, 2019: eur 1.9m), simcorp 
sofia contracts of eur 1.5m (december 31, 
2019: eur 0.8.), simcorp gain contracts of 
eur 0.2m (december 31, 2019: eur 0.8m.) 
and sftr contracts of eur 1.4m (december 
31, 2019: eur 0.0m.). the order book is a 
consequence of income recognition being 
deferred until certain conditions are fulfilled 
fulfilled or subscription services revenue 
recognized over the contract period.
the total value of the installed simcorp 
dimension license base increased by 1.4% to 
eur 877m. adjusted for currency effect the 
increase was 3.6%. measured as a percentage 
of the total value of the installed simcorp 
dimension license base, the additional license 
sales were 6.7% in 2020 compared with 5.0% 
in 2019. the total value of the installed license 
base for simcorp dimension clients who have an 
installed license base above eur 2m accounted 
for 91% of the value of the total installed license 
base compared with 92% in 2019. 
the share of subscription-based license agree-
ments in the installed simcorp dimension 
license base increased from 23% at the end 
of 2019 to 28% at the end of 2020. in total, 
70 (equivalent to 34%) out of 206 simcorp 
dimension clients are on subscription-based 
license agreements, while the remaining 136 
simcorp dimension clients are on a perpetual 
license agreements most standalone simcorp 
due to the sale of additional functionality 
in connection with the conversions, but the 
annual software updates and support fees 
will be eur 3.0m lower, as the subscription 
license revenue under ifrs 15 is recognized 
on contract completion. 
in comparison, additional order intake increased 
by eur 10.8m due to three conversions in 
2019, resulting in annual software updates and 
support fees being decreased by eur 1.6m.
total order book increased by eur 17.9m from 
january 1, 2020 to eur 56.1m at december 31, 
2020, primarily due to the launch of the data-
care solution, which accounted for eur 12.0m 
of the increase from eur 1.8m at december 31, 
2019 to eur 13.8m at december 31, 2020.

coric and simcorp sofia clients are on 
subscription-based license agreements.
at year-end 2020, the average length of 
subscription-based license agreements at 
signing was around six years for simcorp 
dimension, around five years for simcorp 
coric, around five years for simcorp gain, and 
approximately one year for simcorp sofia. 
the remaining average length before renewal 
was 4.8 years for simcorp dimension, 2.9 
years for simcorp coric, 3.1 years for simcorp 
gain, and less than one year for simcorp sofia 
as most agreements are renewed annually at 
the beginning of the year.
total contract value outstanding, excluding as 
a service offerings, at december 31, 2020 was 
around eur 336m, of which around eur 69m 
is payable in 2021. 
five clients canceled simcorp dimension 
contracts in 2020. two simcorp coric, seven 
simcorp gain, and two small simcorp sofia 
licenses were canceled. the annual software 
updates and support fee for the canceled 
contracts amounted to eur 3.0m, equivalent 
to 0.7%-points of 2020 revenue compared 
with eur 2.6m in 2019, equivalent to 0.6%- 
points of 2019 revenue.
income statement 2020
 
revenue
simcorp derives revenue from four primary 
sources: license fees, software updates and 
support fees, fees from professional services, 
and hosting and other fees. license fees 
comprise initial sales to new clients and 
additional sales to existing clients. 
simcorp generated revenue of eur 456.0m 
in 2020 compared with eur 454.5m in 2019, 
equivalent to an increase of 0.3%. exchange 
rate fluctuations for the period had a negative 
impact on revenue of 1.1%. measured in local 
currencies, revenue thus increased by 1.4%. 
the acquisition of aim software accounted for 
1.5%-points, and measured in local currencies, 
the organic growth thus declined by 0.1%. 
the impact of currency fluctuations and 
the acquisition of aim software on revenue 
growth is shown to the right on this page.
total license fee recognized from initial 
licenses to new clients and additional licenses 
to existing clients was eur 91.6m, a decrease 
of eur 14.2m, or 13.4%, compared with 2019. 
currency fluctuations impacted total license 
fee negatively by 1.3%. measured in local curren- 
cies, the decrease was 12.1%, and the under-
lying organic revenue change in total license 
fee was a decline of 13.5% in 2020, reflecting a 
1.4%-point positive impact from the acquisition 
of aim software. license fee for 2020 included 
revenue interest of eur 2.3m related to the 
financing element in contract assets (2019: eur 
2.1m). in total, the reported total license fee 
revenue accounted for 20.1% of the group’s 
total revenue compared with 23.3% in 2019.
license fee from initial sales decreased 
by 59.0% from eur 54.6m in 2019 to eur 
22.4m in 2020. currency fluctuation impacted 
license fee from initial sales negatively by 1.8%. 
the decrease in license fee from new sales 
was caused by revenue recognition of smaller 
deals than in 2019. 
license fee from additional sales – consisting 
of additional regular license sales to existing 
clients, renewals of subscription-based 
licenses, and conversion of perpetual licenses 
to subscription-based licenses – increased by 
15.2% from eur 51.2m in 2019 to eur 69.2m in 
2020. currency fluctuations impacted license 
fee from additional sales negatively by 0.7% 
and the acquisition of aim software increased 
license fee from additional sales by 3.0%. the 
underlying organic growth was 33.0%.
in 2020, additional regular license sales 
accounted for 55% (2019: 57%) of the 
total additional license sales, conversions 
accounted for 27% (2018: 24%), while renewals 
management report

financial statements of simcorp a/s
simcorp annual report 2020  |  financial review 2020    20
accounted for the remaining 18% (2019: 19%), 
of which approximately 8%-points related to 
simcorp sofia renewals, 4%-points related to 
simcorp coric renewals, 3%-points related to 
simcorp dimension renewals, and 3%-points 
related to simcorp gain renewals. 
software updates and support revenue 
increased by 5.4% from eur 167.5m last 
year to eur 176.6m with the completion and 
implementation of new client installations 
and new functionality to existing clients. 
currency fluctuations decreased the software 
updates and support revenue by 0.6%, and 
the acquisition of aim software increased the 
software updates and support revenue by 
1.2%. consequently, organic growth for 2020 
in software updates and support revenue was 
4.8%. software updates and support revenue 
accounted for 38.7% of total revenue com-
pared with 36.8% in 2019. license agreements 
signed in 2020 will increase annual software 
updates and support revenue by around eur 
8m once fully implemented (2019: eur 9m), 
while canceled contracts in 2020 and conver-
sions from perpetual to subscription-based 
licenses will decrease annual software updates 
and support revenue by around eur 6.0m 
(2019: eur 4.2m).
fees from professional services increased 
by 1.0% from eur 153.2m last year to eur 
154.7m. currency fluctuations decreased the 
professional services revenue by 1.2%, while 
the acquisition of aim software increased the 
professional services revenue by 1.6%. conse-
quently, organic growth in profesional services 
revenue was 0.6%. fees from professional 
services accounted for 33.9% of total revenue 
in 2020 compared with 33.7% in 2019.
hosting and other fees increased from eur 
28.1m in 2019 to eur 33.1m, due to adding 
more clients on a hosted as a service solution 
and growth in selling third-party products. in 
2020, we added six new simcorp dimension 
and one new simcorp coric as a service clients, 
bringing the total number of clients on a hosted 
solution to 28, comprising 16 clients in north 
america, nine in emea, and three in apac. 
revenue distribution
the ten largest clients generated 25% (2019: 
23%) of simcorp’s total revenue. in 2020, the  
largest client accounted for 5.5% (2019: 4.4%) 
of the revenue.
simcorp business model is evolving more 
and more from a software solution model 
towards a service delivery model. simcorp 
will therefore commence reporting annual 
recurring revenue (arr) on a quarterly ba-
sis. in 2020, the arr was eur 250.9m, which 
was equivalent to 55.0% of total revenue. in 
2019, the arr was eur 220.9m, which was 
equivalent to 48.6% of total revenue. the arr 
growth in 2020 was 13.6% in eur, and 14.4% 
in local currencies.
simcorp entered 2021 with signed revenue 
for the full year of eur 289.2m – an increase 
of eur 10.4m or 4% compared with the 
beginning of 2020.
in 2020, simcorp achieved a top-line growth 
in its north american business unit of 10% and 
in its emea business unit of 2%, while revenue 
in its business unit in apac declined by 31% 
in tough comparison with an extraordinary 
perfomance in 2019. the simcorp sofia

costs
total operating costs (including depreciation 
and amortization) increased by 1.6% from 
eur 327.2m in 2019 to eur 332.5m. currency 
fluctuations reduced the total operating costs 
by 0.6%. measured in local currencies and 
adjusted for the impact of the acquisition of 
aim software of 2.8%, the organic operating 
costs decreased by 0.6% compared with 2019. 
the organic decrease in operating costs 
was primarily a result of the cost reduction 
measures taken in early march 2020 after the 
covid-19 breakout. the measures included 
travel restrictions, cancellations of confer-
ences and events, hiring freeze on non-critical 
positions, and postponement of planned 
salary increases from january 1 to july 1, 2020 
for all employees, and to january 1, 2021 for 
the group management committee.  at the 
same time, simcorp remains committed to 
continue investing in its products, people, and 
strategic priorities, including cloud lift and 
other research and development priorities, 
to realize its long-term growth ambitions. 
consequently, research and development 
costs increased organically by 8.1% in 2020, 
while all other cost lines declined organically. 
the average number of full-time employees 
increased by 137 or 8% from 1,703 in 2019 to 
1,840 in 2020 (of which 68 employees are 
related to the acquisition of aim software). 
the number of employees (headcount) was 
1,901 at the end of 2020 compared with 
1,871 at the end of 2019, an increase of 30 
employees.

simcorp annual report 2020  |  risk management    24
risk management
as simcorp operates in a continually changing and 
volatile business environment, its board of directors 
and management regard it as essential that its risk 
exposure is thoroughly monitored and controlled 
on an ongoing basis, applying a framework of risk 
policies and risk  mitigating procedures.
for further details on procedures of simcorp’s 
risk management, see pages 12-13 in its 
corporate governance guidelines.
simcorp’s business involves commercial and 
financial risks, which could have a negative 
impact on the company’s future activities 
and results. to manage risk, principal factors 
categorized as potential risks are system-
atically monitored, analyzed, and managed. 
overall, simcorp’s management believes the 
company is prepared to mitigate its potential 
risk challenges.
  
risk analysis
an enterprise risk management 
process is applied to identify relevant 
gross risks in simcorp’s major units.
risk evalution
simcorp management continually 
monitor risk development in the 
simcorp group.
risk control 
the audit and risk committee 
carries out an analysis of the  
ongoing process for identifying and 
reporting risks.
risk management

  markets and clients
risk category
 
risk mitigation
responding timely to investment management market 
trends is critical to simcorp’s ability to stay competi-
tive. failing to spot these trends represents a risk.
competitors’ expansion of service-offerings 
and distribution could also endanger simcorp’s 
market-leading position. new local requirements 
or legislation may also influence the demand for 
simcorp’s offerings.
with 40% of simcorp’s client base belonging 
to the top 100 global investment managers, losing 
one of these or their default on payment could have 
a substantial impact on simcorp’s revenue and 
profitability.
through extensive ongoing market research and 
industry analysis, simcorp keeps abreast of trends and 
movements in the global financial markets.
its close and longstanding client relationships allow 
simcorp to anticipate and respond to new preferences 
and requirements. in addition, simcorp actively 
monitors contracts to manage risks.
although 40% of simcorp’s clients are among the 
top 100 global investment managers, the simcorp 
group has no client with revenue of more than 5.5% 
(2019: 4.4%) of total revenue.
  political and pandemic risks 
risk category
 
risk mitigation
with offices and sales across the world, simcorp is 
from time to time affected by geopolitical uncertainties 
and unrest.
further, since 2007, simcorp has had a development 
unit based in the ukraine.
with the uk leaving the eu, changing business 
conditions in the uk pose a risk for simcorp’s local 
operations.
with the close down of countries due to pandemic 
such as covid-19, terror, war etc. ensuring simcorp’s 
product offering, sales and service efforts are 
operating as close to normal as possible is crucial.
political and economic unrest in countries and regions 
where simcorp operates or plans to operate is mon-
itored and fully considered when making operational 
and strategic decisions.
due to the political situation in the ukraine, simcorp 
monitors the situation in that country. the ukrainian 
office is based outside of kiev and, so far, simcorp has 
not seen any substantial risk associated with operating 
in the country.
simcorp monitors the impact of brexit. the uk’s 
contribution to the simcorp group’s revenue is less 
than 3% of total revenue.
simcorp’s business model has previously proved to 
be strong during crises when the impact has been low. 
structured sales reviews, the ability to do remote 
demonstrations and implementations, as well as our 
standard platform initiative are in place to mitigate 
the risk of discontinuity to the daily operation of the 
business.

  regulatory issues and fiscal policies
risk category
 
risk mitigation
protecting simcorp’s long-term business interests is 
vital to its continued operations. this includes legal risk 
that may impact simcorp’s business.
simcorp believes contractual risk as well as legal 
risk related to regulatory requirements are critical. 
failure to meet or implement regulatory requirements 
in a timely fashion with respect to, for instance, data 
protection, confidentiality agreements, ipr, corruption 
and fraud constitutes a risk.
simcorp is subject to tax and fiscal policies in the 
countries in which the group operates. changes to 
local policies may affect simcorp’s tax and fiscal 
position.
due to the nature of simcorp’s operations, the 
company is exposed to changes in currency exchange 
rates.
the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr) 
applied from may 2018 with the objective to give 
citizens back control of their personal data. failure to 
comply with gdpr represents a risk.
simcorp ensures that all contracts entered into 
are carefully worded. simcorp’s due diligence and 
procurement processes, as well as the ‘guideline for 
good business behavior’ established for all employees 
and suppliers, ensure that the company’s value-based 
principles are adhered to, including safeguarding 
against corruption.
simcorp’s group finance department manages the 
company’s currency and financial exposures pursuant 
to the treasury policy approved by the board of 
directors, and is required to keep the overall currency 
and financial exposure within defined limits.
furthermore, group finance ensures that, in 
line with the tax policy, simcorp is at all times tax 
compliant in the countries in which simcorp conducts 
business.
simcorp has implemented a number of business 
procedures and controls to have transparency of 
individual activities and an overview of financial 
exposure.
simcorp’s group legal and compliance department 
ensures and monitors gdpr compliance
  product innovation and quality
risk category
 
risk mitigation
product innovation, improved technical infrastructure, 
and enhanced technical capabilities are fundamental to 
meeting new system requirements in the market. being 
unable to deliver those elements in a timely fashion 
could potentially mean that simcorp’s product and 
services would end up as legacy offerings.
simcorp’s ability to offer clients the best software 
with the highest possible configurability and flexibility 
is paramount.
inadequate quality control and testing prior to the 
release of new software versions could increase the 
risk of reduced client satisfaction and loyalty.
to enable optimal use of resources, lower the total 
cost of operations (tco), ease upgrade, and make 
cloud benefits available for our clients in an efficient 
manner, we need simcorp dimension to operate in a 
3-tier deployment model, on premises, in private, and 
in the public cloud. the 3-tier deployment model is 
the first step in our cloud lift and is paramount for this 
transition. the main risk associated with the transition 
is the lack of necessary development capacity or 
capabilities.
quarterly, simcorp offers updated versions of simcorp 
dimension, including enhanced system functionality 
and technical infrastructure based on a systematic 
prioritization of client and market requirements. a 
best-practice agile development method enables quick 
adaptation to changes in market and client demands. 
this also shortens the extensive control and testing 
period prior to new version releases, securing an even 
better software quality.
simcorp continually raises and follows up on 
internal quality targets and has been able to reduce the 
number of errors in new software releases.
to prepare for our transition to cloud, we have 
first laid out the technical needs, ensured feasibility, 
done extensive estimation, and established burndown 
measurements. in addition, we have increased our 
efforts to meet staff needs in all our locations, and 
we are engaging with subcontractors to increase our 
capacity for this peak period.
in 2020, we made good progress on the cloud lift 
to move simcorp dimension from a 2-tier to a 3-tier 
architecture, a journey that will continue into 2022.
  people and corporate culture 
risk category
 
risk mitigation
simcorp’s business is based on specialized expertise 
and innovation. it is imperative that simcorp continues 
to attract, develop, and retain the most skilled 
employees and management talent. failure to do so 
constitutes a risk to the group.
moreover, it is considered a genuine risk to sim-
corp’s long-term position, if the company’s corporate 
values do not continue to serve as a core basis for 
business execution and development.
simcorp recognizes and values the uniqueness of 
every individual, and we will continue to invest in our 
people. not embracing a diverse and inclusive culture 
possesses a risk of not attracting the right people.
to ensure simcorp’s ability to attract talented em-
ployees, an ‘employer value proposition’ program is in 
place to strengthen the company’s employer brand by 
increasing the awareness of what simcorp has to offer 
new employees. to retain talent in simcorp, mentoring 
and leadership training programs are in place.
substantial resources allocated to training and 
development programs ensure the strengthening of 
professional and personal skills across the organization.
to ensure simcorp’s business is conducted in accor- 
dance with corporate values, a guideline for good busi- 
ness behavior for all employees and suppliers has been 
established, and annual online training is conducted. 
in addition, simcorp has established a whistleblower 
system as a means of increasing focus on transparency 
and enabling reporting on suspected irregularities in 
the business.
we want to build an inclusive culture, boost diverse 
talent, and increase female leadership. our ambition is 
to put diversity into play, to ensure different perspec-
tives can come together, and that all voices are heard.
  solutions and services
risk category
 
risk mitigation
after going live with the solution, the most apparent 
risk is possible breach of service level agreements, 
security requirements, or other committed standards.
implementation projects not priced correctly or 
not having a clear scope, pose a risk of significant 
cost overruns, as well as causing delivery risk to be 
transferred to simcorp.
offering simcorp dimension as a service introduces 
operational risks of running clients’ operational it en-
vironments. this in turn exposes simcorp to potential 
financial and reputational risks should operations be 
negatively impacted by errors or downtime.
related services are provided by simcorp and 
subcontractors engaged by simcorp. if simcorp fails 
to balance the requirements of clients and agreements 
with these subcontractors, simcorp risks impairing the 
clients’ businesses as well as its own.
simcorp professional services apply a global delivery 
model leveraging a standard methodology based on 
industry best practices and standard components. 
this approach gives existing and new clients a lean and 
efficient solution-delivery service, driving increased 
quality and value, while reducing risk and cost for small 
and large projects alike. it is key for simcorp to provide 
standardized end-to-end serviced solutions, both 
during implementation and after clients have gone live.
simcorp has established various measures to 
control both external and internal risk to the provision 
of full-service packages. externally, a due diligence 
process is conducted on each subcontractor to 
ensure it meets simcorp’s requirements; financially, 
organizationally, and product-wise. internally, a clear 
description and overview of each delivery component 
allows for a clear segregation of duties.
simcorp’s consultants undergo regular training to 
maintain and develop the required knowledge and 
experience in relation to the operational services.
larger complex implementation contracts are 
evaluated, approved, and monitored using a group 
standard.

  it risk
risk category
 
risk mitigation
as a software company with a core business based 
on modern information technology, simcorp’s failure 
to adequately protect itself against it risk, represents 
a particular risk. cybercrime including unauthorized 
access to simcorp’s network and data could endanger 
applications as well as the infrastructure and the 
technical environment stored on simcorp’s network. 
the same goes for virus attacks and theft of code and 
know-how which could also entail prolonged system 
breakdowns impairing productivity and potentially 
rendering simcorp unable to service its clients.
simcorp currently delivers simcorp dimension as 
a service (hosted) for 27 clients, operating the clients’ 
systems in a third-party hosted environment. any 
failure of the hosting provider could result in prolonged 
system breakdowns that would impair productivity and 
potentially render simcorp unable to service clients.
simcorp monitors its technical infrastructure to 
identify and minimize risk to the company’s production 
and operation. established procedures and solutions 
enable a quick restoration of critical business services.
simcorp upholds a high data security level and strict 
access control to the physical environment and data 
network.
controls are monitored and reviewed to optimize 
information security.
simcorp management and employees are regularly 
updated on new potential cybercrime threats and how 
to minimize the risk of phishing and hacking.
simcorp has a disaster recovery plan for restoring 
all critical business services and makes use of state-
of-the-art tracing software for detecting unintended 
access, or attempts, to simcorp’s network. the 
suppliers of this software are diligently screened, using 
both expert assessments of the product as well as 
in-house proof of concept.
simcorp regularly receives an isae 3402 type 
2 report on our third-party service providers, and 
the hosting providers have undergone substantial 
successful due diligence performed by simcorp and its 
external partners. furthermore, simcorp has back-to-
back agreements with its third-party service providers.
simcorp hosting services are audited annually by an 
external third party, who provides isae3402 and soc 
assurance reports. 
  financial reporting
risk category
 
risk mitigation
generally, financial reporting involves the risk of 
non-compliance with applicable regulations.
there is also a risk that internal controls may not 
detect or prevent significant errors and omissions in 
financial reporting.
simcorp’s business procedures and controls ensure 
compliance with financial reporting requirements. 
the full wording of simcorp management’s statutory 
responsibilities under section 107 b of the danish 
financial statements act is available on simcorp’s 
website: www.simcorp.com/corporate-governance.
the executive management board monitors 
compliance and provides the board of directors with 
relevant reports.

framework defined by applicable legislation, 
rules, and recommendations for listed compa- 
nies in denmark and by simcorp’s articles of

simcorp’s stakeholder  
relationships
simcorp’s overall management objective is to 
promote the long-term interests of the com-
pany, and thus of all stakeholders. achieving 
this objective assumes that simcorp estab-
lishes lasting and constructive relationships 
with the group’s primary stakeholders: clients, 
employees, shareholders, and society.
the work of the board of directors 
the board of directors (bod) is a collective 
body for promoting the long-term interests 
of the company. the bod has as its main 
three responsibilities to ensure: (i) that the 
company at all times has the right executive 
management board (emb); (ii) that the 
strategic direction of the company is set; and 
(iii) that the financial and managerial control 
of the group is conducted adequately.
composition and qualifications of
the board of directors, executive 
management board, and committees
the bod is constituted to ensure its indepen-
dence, adequate collective competences, and 
experiences within executive management 
disciplines related to global corporations, 
information technology, and business-to-busi-
ness sales and implementation of software, 
and to hold a sufficient number of members 
to enable an appropriate distribution of tasks 
and an effective decision-making process. as 
provided in the company’s articles of associa-
tion, simcorp’s bod consists of between four 
and eight members elected by the company’s 
shareholders in addition to members elected 
by and among the company’s employees. 
accordingly, following the annual general 
meeting (agm) 2020, the bod consists of 
six members shareholder-elected and three 
employee-elected members.
self-assessment
as part of its annual cycle activities, the 
bod carries out a self-assessment. in 2020, 
the evaluation was facilitated internally by 
the board, and comprised an evaluation 
of the work and contribution of the emb, 
the bod, the audit and risk committee, 
and the nomination and remuneration 
committee within the areas of strategy, 
finance, risk management, sales, organization, 
management, and operations. the bod also 
evaluated, whether the total number of 
management functions, including their level 
and complexity, taken on by each board 
member was appropriate.
it was concluded that the bod’s work is effec-
tive, that the members collectively contribute 
to the required areas of expertise, and that 
none of the directors is over-boarded.  
the bod also concluded that the diversity 
of the emb and the bod with regard to 
nationalities, educational backgrounds, gender, 
and age represented by its members is 
appropriate in light of the company’s strategy 
and markets.
finally, the bod concluded that simcorp 
complies with the danish corporate gover-
nance guidelines’ recommendation that at 
least half of the members elected by the agm 
are independent. 
at the agm 2021, the bod will propose susan 
standiford as a seventh shareholder-elected 
member of the bod, which will bring the 
number of  members of the underrepresented 
gender up to two of seven members. susan 
standiford brings extensive experience within 
software and technology from her leadership 
career at a number of international technolo-
gy companies.
risk management

ensuring that simcorp maintains appropriate

procedures to monitor, measure, and manage 
the company’s risks and that such procedures 
are firmly embedded in the company’s 
organization. as part of its risk management, 
the emb and the bpd have defined and 
described the most critical risks to simcorp 
and the related mitigating actions.  a more 
detailed description is provided in the section 
‘risk management’, pp 24-26. 
further, the company maintains a whistle- 
blower hotline, which is intended to enable 
reporting on suspected irregularities in the 
business. simcorp has engaged a third party, 
got ethics, who provides an internet-based 
reporting tool. reports sent through the whis-
tleblower hotline are electronically  submitted 
directly to the chairman of the audit and risk 
committee and another member of simcorp’s 
bod.

competence profile and composition of the 
bod, nomination of the bod and committee 
members, succession plans for the emb, 
remuneration packages and policies for 
the bod and emb, and other tasks on an 
ad-hoc basis as decided by the bod. the 
nomination and remuneration committee 
consists of four members elected by the bod 
on a one-year term by and among the bod.

agreements, the total severance pay during 
the notice period exceeds the recommended 
two years’ remuneration in the event of change 
of ownership as the severance payment is 
up to nine months, and the notice period is 
extended to 24 months for two executives and

audit and risk committee
in november 2020, the bod decided to  
formally make the audit committee respon-
sible for risk oversight and renamed the 
committee ‘the audit and risk committee’. 
the audit and risk committee is responsible 
for assisting the bod by monitoring sim-
corp’s financial reporting, its internal financial 
control and enterprise risks, as well as the 
quality, effectiveness, and independence 
of the external auditors for the simcorp 
group of companies. the audit and risk 
committee consists of four members elected 
on a one-year term by and among the bod. 
the audit and risk committee meets as 
often as it and its chairman deem necessary, 
however, as a minimum, the committee will 
meet four times a year at appropriate times 
in the reporting and audit cycle. in 2020, five 
meetings were held.
pursuant to the danish corporate governance 
recommendations, it is recommended that the 
majority of the members of the committee 
qualify as independent and the committee 
should possess the necessary financial 
expertise. the members of the audit and risk 
committee qualify, and are shown in the table 
on the left-hand side. see simcorp’s corporate 
governance guidelines for a full description of 
the audit and risk committee’s activities.

corporate social responsibility
statement on corporate social responsibility, 
cf. section 99 a of the danish financial 
statements act
   sustainability report 2020
          www2.simcorp.com/sustainabilityreport2020
corporate social responsibility (csr) in 
simcorp is firmly based on the group’s csr 
policy and overall approach to sustainability.
simcorp’s commitment to corporate sus- 
tainable development is based on combining 
financial performance with socially responsi- 
ble behavior and environmental awareness.
simcorp’s approach to csr is described in 
its policies and business behavior guidelines, 
including the company’s ‘corporate social 
responsibility policy’, ‘diversity and inclusion 
policy’, ‘guideline for good business 
behavior’, ‘remuneration guidelines’ and 
‘corporate governance guidelines’. these 
documents include guidelines on ethics, 
human rights, the environment, stakeholder 
engagement, governance, bribery, and 
anti-corruption that aim to maintain a 
professional and commercial relations with 
internal and external stakeholders based on 
mutual respect. 
    guideline for good 
business behavior
          www2.simcorp.com/ 
guidelineforgoodbusinessbehavior
    csr policy
         www2.simcorp.com/csrpolicy
simcorp joined the un global compact in 
2019 and commit to submitting an annual 
communication on progress (cop) concerning 
our implementation of its principles. simcorp’s 
contribution to specific targets related to un’s 
sustainable development goals and our results 
on a wide range of non-financial esg metrics 
are included in our sustainability report.
our cloud transformation, new technlogies, 
and people initiatives are key enablers of our 
focus on sustainability, which aims at reducing 
our co₂ emission, expanding support for 
our clients’ esg investments, creating a truly 
diverse and inclusive workplace, and ensuring 
meaning in work. 
travel and electricity and heat-related energy 
consumption are the key environmental 
factors affected by simcorp’s business 
model (see page 11). to reduce negative 
impact, simcorp promotes responsibility 
and increasing use of modern technologies 
across its business operations, simcorp’s 
travel policy guides employees to replace 
air travel with virtual meetings whenever 
possible, with a goal of reducing travel related 
co₂ emission by 50% compared with 2019. 
to track progress, we set kpis and provide 
metrics for key impact actvities as part of our 
sustainabilty report. 
due to the nature of its business model and 
its associated risks, simcorp does not have a 
specific human rights policy and our approach 
to human rights is outlined in our guideline 
for good business behavior that is also the 
foundation for our business relationships 
with suppliers. it is part of the procurement 
process that suppliers are requested to 
confirm adherence to a number of principles, 
including compliance with the un convention 
on child labor, article 32.1, and the respect 
for an equal status between the sexes and 
between persons of different races and 
religion. further, simcorp does not accept 
products and services which have directly 
or indirectly been designed, manufactured, 
produced, or procured in contravention 
of local environmental legislation or other 
legislation, or by means of corruption, bribery, 
or other fraudulent behavior. 
simcorp maintains high standards on 
confidentiality and protection of personal data, 
which is ensured through compliance with 
technical data security standards and 
processes, as well as ongoing education of the 
employees on how to handle data confidentially. 
a framework is in place to ensure that simcorp 
complies with the general data protection 
regulation (gdpr).
diversity
report on the underrepresented gender and 
diversity, cf. sections 99 b and 107 d of the 
danish financial statements act
   diversity report 2020
          www2.simcorp.com/diversityreport2020
as described in our diversity and inclusion 
policy, simcorp aims to promote diversity.
regarding gender diversity, it is our objective 
to develop female talent within the business 
and to increase the proportion of women at 
all management levels. to ensure a strong 
focus on female leadership, simcorp has set 
a target to increase the share of women in 
management positions to 34% by the end of 
2023. activities to reach this goal are de-
scribed in the diversity report 2020. the goal 
is based on a wish to strengthen the versatility 
and total competences across the business 
and to improve decision-making processes.
regarding gender diversity of the bod, it is 
the company’s target to have at least two 
shareholder-elected directors of the under-
represented gender, also corresponding to the 
share in general population in the industry. it is 
simcorp’s goal to reach the target in 2021 with 
the election of susan standiford to the bod.

simcorp annual report 2020  |  corporate governance  report    30
regarding gender diversity in the emb, 
simcorp has set a target for the group to con-
sist of minimum 25% women. when recruiting 
new emb members, gender, age, nationality 
and professional capabilities should be taken 
into account to ensure diversity. furthermore, 
the recruitment process should follow 
simcorp’s general guidelines on securing a 
diverse candidate field. 
at the end of 2020, people managers in 
simcorp comprised 69.6% (2019: 70.7%) men 
and 30.4% (2019: 29.3%) women. overall, 
simcorp’s staff comprised 67.7% (2019: 67.7%) 
men and 32.3% (2019: 32.3%) women.
as described in the previous section on self-as-
sessment of the emb and bod, the diversity of 
each with regard to educational background 
and nationalities is regarded as satisfactory.

dividends and share buyback
maintaining a sound liquidity buffer is vital to 
simcorp’s continued international expansion. 
management considers this objective will 
be achieved when the cash holdings and 
credit lines exceed 10% of the projected 
costs for the coming year. on this basis, the 
company intends to pay dividends of at least 
40% of the profit on ordinary activities after 
tax. additional cash will, unless other cash 
requirements are foreseen, be used to buy 
treasury shares. the purchase of treasury 
shares is expected to be carried out in com- 
pliance with the provisions of regulation no. 
596/2014 of the european parliament and 
of the council on market abuse (the market 
abuse regulation - mar) and delegated 
legislation under mar.
the board of directors has considered 
simcorp’s cash position and liquidity fore-
cast, and on the basis thereof, the board 
of directors intends to recommend to the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting 
that dividends of eur 40.1m, equal to dkk 
7.50 per share of dkk 1, be distributed for the 
financial year 2020. the dividends of eur 
40.1m are equivalent to 45.5% of group profit 
for the year and 43.7% of free cash flow in 
2020.
in order to be eligible for dividends, shares 
must be registered before march 24, 2021. the 
ex-dividend date is march 25, 2021. dividends 
for the financial year 2020 are expected to be 
paid on march 29, 2021.
based on the current cash position and 
business outlook, simcorp expects to initiate 
a share buyback program in 2021 for a fore-
casted amount of eur 40.0m. the program 
will be carried out in two half yearly buyback 
programs of eur 20.0m each during the 
period from the release of the annual report 
2020 to the end of 2021. the program will be 
carried out in compliance with the provisions 
of regulation no. 596/2014 of the european 
parliament and of the council on market 
abuse (the market abuse regulation - mar) 
and delegated legislation under mar.

to the shareholders of simcorp a/s
report on the audit of  
the financial statements
our opinion 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the group’s and the parent company’s 
financial position at 31 december 2020 and 
of the results of the group’s and the parent 
company’s operations and cash flows for the 
financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s 
long-form report to the audit committee 
and the board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and 
parent company financial statements of sim-
corp a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020 comprise income statement 
and statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of financial position, statement 
of changes in equity, cash flow statement 
and notes, including summary of significant 
accounting policies for the group as well as 
for the parent company. collectively referred 
to as the “financial statements”.
key audit matter
how our audit addressed  
the key audit matter
revenue recognition
the group and the parent company 
provide its products and services to clients 
in bundled packages as multi-element 
contracts, and recognition of revenue is 
subject to the inherent complexities in the 
software industry. 
   revenue is recognized when control 
is passed and if the revenue criteria for 
recognizing revenue over time or at a point 
of time have been met.
   we focused on this area due to the 
judgmental and complex nature of 
revenue recognition for multiple element 
arrangements that include identification of 
performance obligations in the contracts 
and allocation of the relative standalone 
selling prices to the identified performance 
obligations.
   further, we focused on presentation in the 
statement of financial position of contracts 
assets and revenue recognition for fixed fee 
and time and material projects due to the 
inherent estimation uncertainty.
   refer to note 2.1 ”revenue”, 2.2 “segment 
information”, 2.3 “future performance 
obligations and note 2.4 “contract balanc-
es” in the consolidated financial statements 
and note 2.1 ”revenue”, 2.2 ”future perfor-
mance obligations” and note 2.3 “contract 
balances” in the parent company financial 
statements.
we assessed the design and implementation 
of the controls over the group’s revenue 
cycle. we tested relevant controls including 
application controls and management’s 
review controls.
for revenue recognized we challenged 
and evaluated management’s assessment 
that customers has the ability to direct use 
and obtain substantially all benefits for the 
licenses transferred.  
   for revenue recognized point in time we 
challenged and evaluated management’s 
documentation for right to payment and 
that the licenses has been transferred and 
made available to the customer. for revenue 
recognized over time we challenged and 
evaluated management’s assessment that 
customers over time consumes and benefit 
from the services delivered.
   for multi-element contracts, we identified, 
challenged and evaluated management’s 
allocation of revenue to the specific per-
formance obligations in the contracts and 
assessed the allocation of the standalone 
selling prices to the performance obligations 
including rebates, discounts, allowances and 
inherent interests.
   we assessed the percentage of comple-
tion on specific fixed fee projects based 
on management reports, project estimates 
and interview of project managers. we 
also assessed the outcome of prior period 
estimates.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) 
and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accor-
dance with the international ethics standards 
board for accountants’ code of ethics for 
professional accountants (iesba code) and 
the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark. we have also fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with the 
iesba code. to the best of our knowledge 
and belief, prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) 
no 537/2014 were not provided.
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of simcorp 
a/s on 31 march 2014 for the financial year 
2014. we have been reappointed annually 
by shareholder resolution for a total period 
of uninterrupted engagement of 7 years 
including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
management report
consolidated financial statements

based on the work we have performed, in our 
view, management report is in accordance 
with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial state-
ments act. we did not identify any material 
misstatement in management report.
management’s responsibilities for the 
financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements and 
parent company financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements 
in the danish financial statements act, and for 
such internal control as management deter-
mines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as ap-
plicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate 
the group or the parent company, or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism through-
out the audit. we also: 
• identify and assess the risks of material  
 
 
misstatement of the financial statements,   
 
whether due to fraud or error, design  
 
 
and perform audit procedures responsive   
 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  
 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide  
 
a basis for our opinion. the risk of not  
 
detecting a material misstatement resulting 
 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting   
 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion,   
 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresen 
 
tations, or the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control  
 
relevant to the audit in order to design  
 
audit procedures that are appropriate in  
 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose  
 
of expressing an opinion on the effective- 
 
ness of the group’s and the parent  
 
company’s internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
 
policies used and the reasonableness of  
 
accounting estimates and related disclo- 
 
sures made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of man- 
 
agement’s use of the going concern basis  
 
of accounting and based on the audit evi- 
 
dence obtained, whether a material uncer- 
 
tainty exists related to events or conditions  
 
that may cast significant doubt on the  
 
group’s and the parent company’s  
 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we  
 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  
 
we are required to draw attention in our  
 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in  
 
the financial statements or, if such  
 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our  
 
opinion. our conclusions are based on the  
 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of  
 
our auditor’s report. however, future events  
 
or conditions may cause the group or the  
key audit matter
how our audit addressed  
the key audit matter
accounting for taxation
the group operates in a complex multina-
tional tax environment and there are open 
tax and transfer pricing cases with domestic 
and foreign tax authorities. 
    we focused on this area as the amounts 
involved are potentially material and the valua- 
tion of tax assets and liabilities are associa- 
ted with estimation uncertainty and judgement.
    refer to note 4.1 “income tax” and 4.2 
“deferred tax” in the consolidated financial 
statements as well as in the parent company 
financial statements.
in understanding and evaluating man-
agement’s judgement, we considered the 
status of recent and current tax author-
ity audits and enquiries, the outcome of 
previous claims, judgmental positions taken 
in tax returns and current year estimates 
and developments in the tax environment. 
   we used our own local and international 
tax specialists, evaluated the adequacy of 
management’s significant assumptions and 
read correspondence with tax authorities 
to assess the valuation of tax assets and 
liabilities.
reporting on management report
management is responsible for management 
report.
our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover management report, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
management report and, in doing so, consider 
whether management report is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether manage-
ment report includes the disclosures required 
by the danish financial statements act.

parent company to cease to continue as a  
 
going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure  
 
and content of the financial statements,  
 
including the disclosures, and whether the  
 
financial statements represent the under- 
 
lying transactions and events in a manner  
 
that achieves fair presentation.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit  
 
evidence regarding the financial infor- 
 
mation of the entities or business activities  
 
within the group to express an opinion on  
 
the consolidated financial statements. we 
 
are responsible for the direction, super- 
 
vision and performance of the group audit.  
 
we remain solely responsible for our audit  
 
opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be com-
municated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef 
regulation
as part of our audit of the financial state-
ments we performed procedures to express 
an opinion on whether the annual report of 
simcorp a/s for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 with the filename   
simcorp-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the 
commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic 
format (esef regulation) which includes 
requirements related to the preparation 
of the annual report in xhtml format and 
ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements.
management is responsible for preparing an 
annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation. this responsibility includes:
• the preparing of the annual report in  
 
xhtml format;
• the selection and application of appro - 
 
priate ixbrl tags, including extensions to  
 
the esef taxonomy and the anchoring  
 
thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all  
 
financial information required to be tagged  
 
using judgement where necessary;
• ensuring consistency between ixbrl tag- 
 
ged data and the consolidated financial  
 
statements presented in human-readable  
 
format; and
• for such internal control as management  
 
determines necessary to enable the prepa- 
 
ration of an annual report that is compliant  
 
with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable 
assurance on whether the annual report is 
prepared, in all material respects, in compli-
ance with the esef regulation based on the 
evidence we have obtained, and to issue a 
report that includes our opinion. the nature, 
timing and extent of procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material 
departures from the requirements set out in 
the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or 
error. the procedures include:
• testing whether the annual report is 
 
prepared in xhtml format;
• obtaining an understanding of the  
 
company’s ixbrl tagging process and of  
 
internal control over the tagging process;
• evaluating the completeness of the  
 
ixbrl tagging of the consolidated  
 
financial statements;
• evaluating the appropriateness of the  
 
company’s use of ixbrl elements selected  
 
from the esef taxonomy and the creation  
 
of extension elements where no suitable  
 
element in the esef taxonomy has been  
 
identified; 
• evaluating the use of anchoring of  
 
extension elements to elements in the  
 
esef taxonomy; and
• reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with  
 
the audited consolidated financial  
 
statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of simcorp 
a/s for the financial year 1 january to 
31 december 2020 with the file name 
simcorp-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation.

section 1
basis of preparation
this section provides an overview 
of the accounting policies and key 
accounting estimates. accounting 
policies, management judgments and 
sources of estimation uncertainty are 
presented together with other related 
disclosures in the notes that deal 
with the relevant subject. accounting 
policies, judgments and estimates that 
do not relate to a specific subject are 
presented in this section. 
accounting policies focus on the 
accounting choices within the 
framework of the prevailing ifrs and 
refrain from repeating the underlying 
promulgated ifrs guidance, unless 
considered particularly important to 
the understanding of a note’s content.
notes to the financial statements are 
grouped into seven sections with 
the aim of reducing complexity and 
improving the reader’s experience. the 
notes are organized into the following 
sections:
section 1 basis of preparation
section 2 revenue and clients
section 3 employees
section 4 tax 
section 5 invested capital
section 6 equity, capital structure   
 
and financing items
section 7 other disclosures
general
the annual report for the period january 1 – 
december 31, 2020, includes the consolidated 
financial statements of simcorp a/s (the 
parent) and its subsidiary undertakings (the 
group), as well as separate financial state-
ments for simcorp a/s. reference is made to 
page 97 for the parent’s specific accounting 
policies. simcorp a/s is incorporated and 
domiciled in denmark.
statement of compliance
the consolidated financial statements of the 
group have been prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as endorsed by the eu and require-
ments in the danish financial statements act.
on february 10, 2021 the board of directors 
and the executive management board consid-
ered and approved the annual report for 2020 
of simcorp a/s and the group. the annual 
report will be presented to the shareholders 
for approval at the annual general meeting to 
be held on march 24, 2021. the directors have 
the power to amend and reissue the financial 
statements.
presentation currency
the financial statements are presented in 
eur, rounded to the nearest eur 1,000. the 
functional currency of the parent is dkk. 
basis of measurement
the annual report has been prepared on a 
going concern basis and in accordance with 
the historical cost convention, except where 
ifrs explicitly requires use of other values.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared by including the financial 
statements of the parent and the subsidiaries, 
which have all been prepared in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies. sub-
sidiaries are entities controlled by the parent. 
control is established when simcorp a/s is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
on consolidation, intra-group income and 
expenses, shareholdings, balances, dividends 
and realized and unrealized gains and losses 
on intra-group transactions are eliminated. 
unrealized gains and losses on transactions 
with associates are eliminated in proportion to 
the group’s shares in the associates.
foreign currency translation
income and expenses and operating cash 
flows of foreign subsidiaries that use a 
functional currency other than the euro 
are translated at average rates of foreign 
exchange computed on a monthly basis. 
exchange rate differences resulting from 
foreign currency transactions as well as from 
the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currency, are recognized under 
financial income or financial expenses.
other operating income
other operating income consists of income of 
a secondary nature relative to the activities of 
the group, including gains on sale of intangi-
ble assets and property, plant and equipment 
and government grants. government grants 
relate to research and development funding in 
the united kingdom. 
as the grant is compensation for costs 
incurred it is recognized as other operating 
income in the period in which it is receivable. 
in 2020 the subsidiaries received circa eur 
200 thousand in covid-19 related government 
assistance as income tax and wage subsidy, 
and rent concessions. around eur 130 thou-
sand is reported as other operating income, 
the remaining was offset against expenses.
statement of comprehensive income
other comprehensive income consists 
of income and costs not included in the 
income statement, including exchange rate 
adjustments arising from the translation of 
foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements into 
presentation currency, and actuarial gains or 
losses on defined benefit pension plans.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement is presented accord-
ing to the indirect method commencing with 
the profit for the year. the cash flow statement 
shows how changes in items in the statement 
of financial position and income affect cash 
and cash equivalents.
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
at bank and in hand. cash flows in other 
currencies are translated into eur at the 
average exchange rate for the respective year.
1.1  accounting policies, estimates, and judgments
management report
consolidated financial statements
financial statements of simcorp a/s
simcorp annual report 2020  |  notes section 1    50
1.1  accounting policies, estimates, and judgments (continued)
cash from operating activities is assessed 
by converting income statement items from 
accrual to cash basis accounting. starting 
with net profit, non-cash items are reversed, 
and actual payments included. in addition, the 
change in working capital and contract assets 
is taken into consideration as it represents cash 
withheld in the statement of financial position. 
cash from investing activities are related 
to the sale and purchase of long-term 
investments, including subsidiaries, fixed, 
intangibles and financial assets.
materiality
the financial statements separately present 
items considered individually material. indi-
vidually immaterial items are aggregated with 
other items of similar nature in the statements 
or in the notes. specific disclosures required 
by ifrs are presented, unless the information 
is considered immaterial to the economic 
decision making of the users.
operating costs
operating costs are allocated into cost of 
sales, research and development, sales and 
marketing costs, and administrative expenses. 
cost of sales cover costs incurred to achieve 
the year’s revenue, including costs of deliver-
ing and implementing systems, hosting and 
infrastructure costs, third party costs, courses, 
and support. these primarily comprise sala-
ries, share-based payments, other employee 
costs, external implementation consultants, 
hosting fees and other third-party costs, 
depreciation and amortization, and indirect 
costs, such as technological infrastructure.
research and development costs comprise 
salaries, share-based payments, other 
employee related costs, depreciation and 
amortization, and other costs directly attribut-
able to the group’s research and development 
activities. research and development costs 
are expensed in the year in which they are 
incurred when they do not qualify for capital-
ization. for capitalization criteria see note 5.2.
sales and marketing costs comprise salaries, 
commissions, bonuses, share-based payments, 
and other sales employee related costs, travel 
and meeting expenses, marketing expenses, 
withholding taxes, depreciation and amortiza-
tion, and indirect costs such as technological 
infrastructure directly or indirectly attributable 
to the group’s sales and marketing activities.
administrative expenses comprise salaries, 
bonuses, share-based payments and other 
employee costs and expenses, office costs, 
depreciation and amortization, expected loss 
allowance, and indirect costs such as technolog-
ical infrastructure directly or indirectly attribut-
able to the group’s administrative activities.
accounting estimates and judgments
while applying the group’s accounting 
policies, in addition to estimations, manage-
ment makes other judgments that may impact 
the application of accounting policies and 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs, 
cash flows, and related disclosures at the date 
of the financial statements.
the estimates and judgments applied are based 
on assumptions which management believes 
to be reasonable, but which are inherently 
uncertain and unpredictable. such assumptions 
may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpect-
ed events or circumstances may arise.
in addition, the company is subject to risks 
and uncertainties encountered in the ordinary 
course of business that may cause actual 
results to deviate from the estimates. the 
notes to the financial statements contain 
information about the assumptions and the 
uncertainty of estimates at the statement of 
financial position date involving the risk of 
changes that could lead to adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within 
the upcoming financial year.
management considers the following to be key 
accounting estimates and assumptions used in 
the preparation of the financial statements:
revenue (note 2.1)
tax and deferred tax (section 4)
acquisition of enterprises (note 5.1)
impairment (note 5.2)
risk factors specific to the group are de-
scribed in the management report on pages 
24-26 and in note 6.2.
new financial reporting standards 
the group has applied the following stan-
dards and amendments for the first time in 
the reporting period starting january 1, 2020: 
- definition of material - amendments to ias 1
  and ias 8.
-  definition of a business - amendments to ifrs 3 
-  interest rate benchmark reform amendments 
to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7
-  revised conceptual framework for financial 
reporting
these amendments did not have any impact 
on the amounts recognized in prior periods 
and are not expected to significantly affect 
the current or future periods.
  
new financial reporting standards 
not yet adopted
certain new accounting standards and inter-
pretations have been published that are not 
mandatory for december 31, 2020 reporting 
periods and have not been early adopted by 
the group. these standards are not expected 
to have a material impact on the entity in the 
current or future reporting periods and on 
foreseeable future transactions.
ixbrl reporting
the 2020 annual report is prepared in the 
xhtml format which can be displayed in a 
standard browser in line with the new euro-
pean single electronic format (‘esef’). the 
primary statements are tagged using inline 
extensible business reporting language 
(ixbrl) and comply with the esef taxonomy. 
where a line item is not defined in the esef 
taxonomy, an extension has been created and 
anchored to elements in the esef taxonomy, 
except for extensions which are subtotals. 
the annual report submitted to the danish 
financial supervisory authority consists of 
the xhtml document together with certain 
technical files, all included in a file named 
simcorp-2020-12-31.zip.

section 2
revenue and clients
this section provides information 
related to contracts with clients. this 
includes information on how revenue 
is classified and recognized, segments 
and information about client related 
balances in the statement of financial 
position.
accounting policies which relate 
to a particular note to the income 
statement have been included within 
each individual note. in this section,  
the following notes are presented:
2.1 revenue
2.2 segment information
2.3 future performance obligations
2.4 contract balances
2.5 receivables 
revenue types 
revenue is mainly derived from license fees 
from new clients, license fees from additional 
sales to existing clients, software updates 
and support fees, professional services, and 
hosting and other fees. 
license fees can be derived from subscription 
or from perpetual license agreements. 
subscription agreements give the right to 
use the software for a determined period of 
time, which can be extended at the end of 
the initial term. standard perpetual software 
licenses provide clients with the right to use 
the software whilst the software updates and 
support contract remains in force. license 
fees also include revenue from client driven 
development agreements and standard 
platform offerings.
software updates and support fees relate to 
contracts made on perpetual and subscrip-
tion-based license terms. software updates 
and support fees include both initial license 
and additional license-based software updates 
and support fees. performance obligations 
include: unspecified future upgrades, mainte-
nance and helpline support. 
professional services agreements can  
include multiple performance obligations.  
the performance obligations are: imple-
mentation services, validation and testing 
services, simcorp dimension on-boarding  
and operating services. scdaas operating 
services occur when, in addition to hosting, 
simcorp undertakes the operation of the 
client’s system in a cloud-based environment.
the hosting offering provides the client with 
the infrastructure required to operate simcorp 
dimension. other fees include, for instance, 
training and education as well as third party 
products and software as service fees.
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
contract identification
contracts can include several components, in 
this situation, the total contract sum is allocat-
ed to the separate performance obligations 
for the purpose of revenue recognition. 
separate contracts with the same client are 
treated as one contract if entered into at or 
near the same time and economically interre-
lated. contracts closed more than 6 months 
apart are not considered to be entered at the 
same time.
in determining whether the various contracts 
are interrelated judgment is required. 
considerations include: whether the contracts 
were negotiated as a package with a single 
commercial objective, whether the amount of 
consideration on one contract is dependent 
on the performance of another contract, or 
if some or all offerings in the contract are a 
single performance obligation. 
additional agreements with existing clients 
can be a new contract or a modification to 
existing contracts. judgments making this 
determination consider: the presence of a 
connection between the new agreement and 
pre-existing contracts, whether subscription 
fees, license fees, software updates and 
support fees or services under the new 
agreement are highly interrelated with the 
subscription fees, license fees and software 
updates and support fees or services sold 
under prior agreements, and how the 
subscription fees, license fees and software

the new agreement are priced.
performance obligation 
 identification
contracts often include several components. 
license fees from new clients, license fees from 
additional sales to existing clients, software up-
dates and support fees, professional services, 
hosting, training, and third-party products 
constitute the main performance obligations. 
the fees allocated to the different performance 
obligations are recognized separately.
the only performance obligation related to 
license agreements has been identified as 
the right to use the software. the right to 
use software license is considered a separate 
performance obligation when it satisfies 
the following conditions: can be delivered 
separately from other services, can be 
installed by a third party, can be used without 
upgrades, and is functional without upgrades 
or technical support.
judgment is required in determining whether 
a component is considered a separate 
performance obligation, in particular, profes-
sional services and implementation activities. 
consideration is given as to whether the 
services significantly integrate, customize 
or modify the software or hosting offering. 
in general, implementation services and 
activities go beyond setup and qualify as a 
separate performance obligation. 
options to acquire additional components 
such as renewals or additional volumes 
require judgment in determining whether such 
options provide a material right to the client 
which the client would not receive without 
entering into that contract. in this judgment 
it is considered whether the options entitle 
the customer to a discount that exceeds the 
discount granted for the respective subscrip-
tions fees, license fees, software updates and 
support fees sold with the option.
transaction price
judgment is applied in determining the 
amount to which simcorp expects to be 
entitled in exchange for transferring licenses, 
and software updates and support to a 
customer.  
the consideration attributable to license 
fees in subscription-based agreements are 
discounted to net present value when the 
value of the financing element is deemed 
significant. if the period between licenses 
transfer, software updates and support and 
payment from the clients is a year or less no 
financing component is recognized. 
a hierarchy has been established to identify 
the standalone selling prices used to allocate 
the transaction price of a customer contract to 
the performance obligations in the contract.
where standalone selling prices for a perfor-
mance obligation are observable and reason-
ably consistent across customers, estimates 
are derived from simcorp’s pricing history. 
using this approach, professional services 
stand-alone value is determined based on the 
hourly billing rate for the relevant market unit. 
hosting services are assumed to be quoted 
to the client at their stand-alone value if it is 
equal to or above hosting costs.
where sales prices are not directly observable 
or are highly variable across customers, 
estimation techniques are applied, such as a 
cost-plus-margin approach. this approach is 
often applied to third party products.
if not renewable, with highly variable pricing, 
and no substantial direct costs to estimate 
based on a cost-plus margin approach, 
allocation is achieved by applying a residual 
approach. we use this technique in particular 
for license and software updates and support.
once the standalone price for other com-
ponents is estimated, an apportionment is 
applied to allocate the price between license 
and software updates and support after 
deducting other performance obligations 
from the total consideration as follows:

2.1 revenue (continued)
revenue recognition
revenue recognition requires an agreement 
with the client which creates enforceable 
rights and obligations between the parties, 
has commercial substance, and identifies 
payment terms. in addition, it must be 
probable that the consideration determined  
in the contract will be collected.
revenue is recognized when the client has 
obtained control of the license or service and 
has the ability to use and obtain substantially 
all the benefits from the license or service. 
simcorp has therefore assessed that the client 
obtains control of the license when all the 
following criteria are met: a binding contract is 
entered into; the license is delivered; and the 
client has the right to use it. license revenue 
is therefore generally recognized at that 
point-in-time. 
when the contract contains functionality gaps 
or requires client acceptance of functionality, 
the revenue recognition will be deferred 
until the time of delivery or acceptance. the 
consideration attributable to license fee in 
subscription-based agreements is discounted 
to net present value when the value of the 
financing element is deemed significant.
revenue from software updates and support 
agreements is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the contract period.
client-driven development entails direct coop-
eration between simcorp’s development team 
and the client for a client-defined software. 
such agreements are individually evaluated to 
determine if revenue is recognized at a point 
in time or over time. 
professional services fees are recognized 
based on work performed for time and 
material contracts. fixed fee agreements are 
recognized based on percentage of comple-
tion unless client acceptance is required. the 
percentage-of-completion method requires 
estimation of total revenue and the stage 
of completion. the assumptions, estimates, 
and uncertainties inherent in determining the 
stage of completion affect the timing and 
amounts of revenue recognized. changes in 
estimates of progress towards completion 
and of contract revenue and costs are 
accounted for as cumulative catch-up 
adjustments to the reported revenue for  
the applicable contract.
where simcorp stands ready to provide 
the service (such as access to e-learning 
and hosting operating services) revenue is 
recognized based on time elapsed – ratably 
over the period applicable. judgment is 
applied in determining which method to use. 
all the judgments and estimates mentioned 
above can significantly impact the timing and 
amount of revenue to be recognized.
the geographical distribution of revenue is 
based on the country in which the client is 
invoiced. significant countries are defined as

2.2 segment information
the group’s revenue arises primarily from the
sale of software licenses and related services, 
and updates and support to clients. the 
group’s operations are managed and orga-
nized into business units regularly reviewed 
by the executive management board, who 
is responsible for assessing the group’s 
performance and making resource allocation 
decisions. 
the sales organization comprises four 
business units. three business units have been 
identified based on countries that share the 
same market conditions and one is dedicated 
to sofia software. 
in addition, the research and development 
business unit is responsible for all software 
development, except for sofia. this segment 
derives revenue mainly from fees charged to 
other business units for the right to distribute 
simcorp dimension software, and broker fees.
finally, the group reports on corporate 
functions, which include shared services 
comprising administration, marketing, internal 
systems, global support and services division. 
these are managed on corporate level and 
costs are principally allocated and charged 
based on an allocation key for the segments. 
consulting and support are charged on an 
hourly basis. external revenue originates from 
courses to clients. 
in 2020, the former market units central 
europe, southern europe, and uk, northern 
europe and middle east (unm), were merged 
into one integrated emea unit. comparative 
disclosures have been restated with regards 
to this change. in addition, former business  
units coric and gain have been integrated into 
the remaining units and goodwill reallocated 
to research and development. comparative 
disclosures have also been restated with 
regards to this change. 
    accounting policies
the accounting policies of the reported seg-
ments are the same as the group’s described 
throughout the notes. segment reporting 
shows revenue and operating profit together 
with total assets that can be directly related to 
the individual segments. unallocated assets are 
headquarters’ assets, cash, and investments in 
associates. segment reporting is prepared in 
accordance with the group’s internal man-
agement reporting structure for performance 
management and resource allocation. 
segment income and costs consist of 
transactions between the segments. such 
transactions are made on market terms.
information about liabilities and additions to 
assets by segment are not regularly provided 
to the executive management board. 
simcorp does not provide segment revenue 
by revenue category as management believes 
it would significantly harm the group’s 
competitive position.

geographical allocation of fixed assets is 
based on the country in which economic 
benefits are derived from the asset. significant 
countries are defined as countries represent-
ing 5.0% or more of the group’s non-current 
assets.
non-current assets comprise intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment owned 
by the segment/country, even if the income 
is earned outside the segment/country that 
owns the asset. furthermore, they include 
non-current financial assets other than 
deferred tax assets.
2.3 future performance obligations
the amount of a customer contract’s trans-
action price that is allocated to the remaining 
performance obligations represents contract-
ed revenue that has not yet been recognized. 
including amounts recognized as contract 
liabilities and amounts that are contracted but 
not yet delivered.
the transaction price allocated to perfor-
mance obligations that are unsatisfied or 
partially unsatisfied as of december 31, 2020 
is eur 405.6m (2019: eur 327.1m). this 
amount mostly comprises obligations to 
provide software updates, agreements which 
require client acceptance of functionality, and 
support or hosting subscriptions and support, 
as the respective contracts typically have 
durations of multiple years.
management expects that eur 113.3m in 2020 
(2019: eur 102.2m) of the amount allocated 
to the future performance obligations as of 
december 31, 2020 will be recognized during 
2021. eur 228.6m (2019: eur 188.4m) is 
expected to be recognized as revenue within 
2 to 5 years. the remaining part is expected 
to be recognized as revenue after 5 years. 
the group applies the practical expedient in 
paragraph 121 of ifrs 15 and does not disclose 
information about remaining performance 
obligations that have original expected 
durations of one year or less.
    accounting estimates  
and judgments
this estimation is judgmental, as it needs to 
consider estimates of possible future contract 
modifications and the timing of satisfaction 
of performance obligations. the amount of 
transaction price allocated to the remaining 
performance obligations, and changes in this 
amount over time, are impacted by, among 
others, currency fluctuations and possible 
contract modifications. 
under the percentage-of-completion method 
used for fixed fee services agreements, 
recognition of profit is dependent upon the 
accuracy of a variety of estimates. such esti-
mates are based on various judgments with 
respect to multiple factors and are difficult 
to accurately determine until the project is 
significantly underway. due to uncertainties 
inherent in the estimation process, it is 
possible that the actual timing of completion 
may vary from estimates.

of transaction price and contract modifications), change in time frame for a right to consideration to become unconditional or for a performance obligation to be satisfied.
contract balances consist of client-related 
assets and liabilities. 
contract assets
contract assets relate to the group’s rights to 
consideration for software licensed to clients 
under subscription agreements with future 
payments, when that right is conditional on 
simcorp’s future performance. 
if the timing of payments specified in the 
contract provides the client with a significant 
financing benefit, the transaction price is 
adjusted to reflect this financing component. 
contract assets increased by eur 24.1m with 
subscription-based licenses adding 
eur 67.3m (2019: eur 84.5m) and finance 
income recognized eur 2.3m (2019: eur 
2.1m). these items exceeded deductions 
from foreign exchange, expected credit loss 
provision and adjustments of eur 7.6m (2019: 
eur 0.3m) and invoiced subscription-based 
license fees of eur 37.9m (2019: eur 23.1m). 
there were no additions from acquisitions in 
2020 (2019: eur 2.6m).
contract liabilities
when a client pays consideration in advance, 
or an amount of consideration is due con-
tractually before transferring of the license or 
service, then the amount received in advance 
is presented as a liability. 
contract liabilities represent mainly prepay-
ments from clients for unsatisfied or partially 
satisfied performance obligations in relation to 
licenses, software updates and support, and 
services. software updates and support and 
hosting billing generally occurs at periodic 
intervals (e.g. quarterly or yearly) prior to 
revenue recognition, resulting in liabilities.
the majority of license agreements are 
recognized as revenue in the year of sale. 
however, contracts with functionality gaps 
or acceptance criteria may have revenue 
recognition deferred, resulting in a contract 
liability when payment has occurred. 
contracts in progress relating to fixed fee 
professional services are measured at the 
estimated sales value of the proportion of 
the contract completed at the statement of 
financial position date. 
periodic fixed fees for subscription services, 
software updates and support services, and 
other multiperiod agreements are typically 
invoiced yearly or quarterly in advance. such 
fee prepayments account for the majority of 
our contract liability balance. 
fees based on actual transaction volumes for 
scdaas subscriptions and fees charged for 
non-periodical services are invoiced as the 
services are delivered. while payment terms 
and conditions vary by contract type and 
region, our terms typically require payment 
within 30 to 60 days.

1 adjustments include: reclassifications, cancellations, foreign exchange adjustments and cumulative catch-up adjustments (including those arising from change in measurement of progress).
2.4 contract balances (continued)
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
amounts invoiced on account in excess of 
work completed are included in prepayments 
under current liabilities.
contract assets from contracts with cus-
tomers are measured at amortized cost less 
expected credit losses. contract assets are 
within the scope of impairment requirements 
in ifrs 9. for contract assets the simplified 
approach is used, and the expected loss 
provision is measured at the estimate of the 
lifetime expected credit losses.
expected loss rates between 0.04% - 13.36% 
are applied (unchanged from 2019), based on 
average default rates by region as published 
by standard & poor. for additional informa-
tion refer to note 6.2 risk.
judgment is required in determining whether 
a right to consideration is conditional and 
thus qualifies as contract assets. estimates 
are made as to whether and to what extent 
subsequent concessions or payments may 
be granted to customers and whether the 
customer is expected to pay the contractual 
fees. in this judgment, trading history is 
considered both with the respective customer 
and more broadly.
incremental costs of obtaining 
customer contracts
the group expenses the incremental costs 
of obtaining a customer contract as incurred. 
the incremental costs of obtaining a customer 
contract primarily consist of sales commis-
sions earned by the sales force. commissions 
are typically related to the license fee 
which is recognized upfront upon delivery, 
consequently, we expense sales commissions 
concurrently with revenue recognition. 
costs to fulfill customer contracts
the group does not capitalize costs incurred 
to fulfil customer contracts. direct costs for 
custom development and standard platform 
are expensed as incurred.

    accounting policy
receivables are recognized when control over 
licenses or services, etc. is transferred to a 
client before the client pays consideration and 
the right to consideration is not conditional on 
simcorp’s future performance. 
trade receivables represent receivables which 
have been invoiced to clients and remain 
outstanding. accrued revenue consists mainly 
of revenue from the sale of perpetual software 
licenses and receivables from professional 
services contracts in progress which are yet to 
be invoiced. other receivables are mainly sales 
and payroll taxes.
trade receivables for performance obligations 
satisfied over time are recognized gradually, 
as the performance obligation is satisfied and 
in full once the invoice is due. 
receivables are initially recognized at fair 
value, and subsequently carried at amortized 
cost less expected loss allowance. expected 
loss allowance is recorded on a portfolio basis. 
the simplified approach is applied and on 
initial measurement of receivables, all credit 
losses expected during the lifetime of the 
receivables are considered.
additionally, allowances for individual 
receivables are recognized if there is objective 
evidence of credit impairment. account 
balances are written off either partially or in 
full if judged that the likelihood of recovery is 
remote. 
expected loss allowance and impairments are 
recognized in the income statement under 
operating expenses. no security has been 
received with respect to trade receivables.
for information about how the default risk for 
trade receivables is analysed and managed, 
how the loss rates for the provision matrix 
are determined, how credit impairment is 
determined and what the criteria for write offs 
are, see the section on credit risk in note 6.2.
no impairment was recognized for trade 
receivables in 2020 (2019: 7 thousand).                                                         
                                                                       
the group’s exposure to currency and credit 
risk for trade receivables is disclosed in note 
6.2 risk.

costs, share-based payments, vacation pay, 
and other benefits. 
    accounting policy
salaries, bonuses, pensions and social costs, 
share-based payments, vacation pay, and 
other benefits are recognized in the year in 
which the associated services are rendered  
by the employees.
management expects commissions paid to 
employees as a result of signing new client 
contracts to be recoverable. such commis-
sions are deferred and expensed when the 
related revenues are recognized. deferred 
commissions are presented under prepay-
ments in the statement of financial position.

the executive management board (emb) consists of four members. the fourth member of the emb joined on 
august 1, 2019, and 2019 therefore only includes five months remuneration for one member of the emb.
remuneration to the executive management 
board and board of directors is given below:
3.2 share based remuneration
simcorp’s board of directors has adopted an 
overall policy for remuneration and incentive 
programs. the policy has been approved by 
shareholders at the annual general meeting 
with the overall objective being to promote 
awareness of profitable growth and the 
group’s long-term goals.
    accounting policy
share-based payments comprise equity-set-
tled restricted stock units (rsus) issued to 
employees. the fair value of rsus is measured 
at the grant date, adjusted for estimated 
dividends and recognized in the income 
statement as employee cost over the vesting 
period. expenses are recognized as employee 
share-based payments and classified in the 
consolidated income statements according to 
the activities that the employees perform. the 
counter entry is recognized directly in equity. 
most of these awards are described in detail 
below. other share-based payment plans 
not described below, are, individually and in 
aggregate, immaterial to our consolidated 
financial statements.
assumptions are made in estimating the fair 
values for share-based payments, including 
number of rsus expected to vest and number 
of employees estimated to become entitled 
to rsus. 
upon resignation employees forgo all un-
vested rsus, these are reported as canceled. 
the number of the rsus is also adjusted 
when performance conditions are only partly 
met, such adjustments are reported under 
performance adjustments. all adjustments 
are recognized in the income statement as 
employee cost. 
in the 2020 financial year, eur 8.7m was 
charged to the income statement in respect of 
share-based remuneration: eur 7.7m relates 
to issued rsus, eur 0.7m relates to corporate 
bonus 2020 provision, and eur 0.2m relates 
to shares to the board of directors (2019: eur 
8.2m charged to the income statement, of 
which eur 6.5m from rsus, eur 1.4m from 
corporate bonus 2019 provision and eur 0.2m 
from shares to the board of directors).
as a result of the equity-settled share-based 
payments transactions, a commitment exists 
to grant simcorp shares to employees. 
simcorp meets these commitments using 
treasury shares to fulfil these obligations.
shares to the board of directors
members of the board of directors receive 
shares as a minor part of their overall 
remuneration. shares are granted subject to 
approval at the annual general meeting. 
in the financial year january 1 to december 
31, 2020, a cost of eur 248 thousand (2019: 
eur 242 thousand) was charged to the 
income statement in respect of this program. 
the company will allot 2,587 treasury shares 
after publication of the annual report 2020 
to members of simcorp’s board of directors 
(2019: 3,148 treasury shares).

3.2 share based remuneration (continued)
restricted stock units (rsus)
the group grants rsus to its employees and 
executive management board (emb) as part 
of its three incentive programs: long-term 
incentive program, corporate bonus, and 
special retention programs. the table which 
follows on the next page shows a summary of 
changes in the balance of outstanding rsus 
from january 1, 2019 to december 31, 2020. 
long-term incentive program
rsus are granted annually to members of 
the emb and key employees as part of the 
long-term incentive program. these vest 
three years after being granted subject to 
continuing employment and conditions with 
respect to average annual minimum business 
growth and net operating profit after tax 
for the three consecutive financial years, 
including the year of grant. if the two last 
conditions are only partially satisfied, the 
undertaking with respect to the number of 
shares transferred after three years is reduced 
(performance adjustment) and may possibly 
lapse completely. upon resignation employees 
forgo all unvested rsus. these are reported 
as canceled.
in 2020, 22,687 rsus were granted to 
executive management board (2019: 24,728), 
156 rsus were granted to employee elected 
members of the board of directors (2019: 
195) and 25,374 rsus were granted to 
other employees (2019: 32,483). fair value at 
grant date was eur 4.7m (2019: eur 4.7m), 
and eur 0.8m was charged to the income 
statement for 2020 (2019: eur 1.2m). 
corporate bonus program
the annual corporate bonus program is 
linked to two key financial metrics: business 
growth and group ebit. employees have the 
following options: receive the year’s corporate 
bonus in cash; or waive their corporate cash 
bonus and elect to receive rsus at a discount 
of 67%. based on the waived bonus amount, 
the company grants rsus to employees of 
the parent company and its foreign subsid-
iaries. one third of these rsus vest after one 
year, a further one third after two years, and 
the remaining third after three years, subject 
to continuing employment.
in 2020, the following 72,808 rsus were 
granted including 531 rsus to employee 
elected members of the board of directors. 
fair value at grant date was eur 7.1m (2019: 
eur 5.9m). eur 1.7m was charged to the 
income statement for 2020 (2019: eur 1.3m). 
in march 2021, the company will grant rsus 
as part of its corporate bonus program for 
2020. eur 1.4m was charged to the income 
statement in 2020 (2019: eur 1.4m). these  
are not included in the specification on the 
next page.
other incentive programs
rsus with particular vesting conditions are 
occasionally granted to key personnel upon 
hiring as a part of a sign-on agreement, special 
performance incentives, or similar incentives. 
a short description of particular vesting 
conditions is provided below. other share-
based payment plans not described below, 
are, individually and in aggregate, immaterial 
to our consolidated financial statements.
granted 2020 
during 2020, 1,954 rsus were granted to se-
nior employees in denmark, usa, france and 
switzerland as part of sign-on agreements 
and incentive programs. fair value at grant 
date was eur 0.2m. the rsus will vest after 
three years subject to continued employment 
and certain performance conditions for the 
financial years 2020 to 2022.  
vested 2020
in 2020, 26,532 rsus related to other incentive 
programs vested. 15,581 related to the perfor-
mance and retention program for the north 
american management team and 7,173 rsu’s 
granted to michael rosenvold in connection 
with his appointment as cfo in 2017, and 3,778 
to other senior employees.
canceled 2020 
3,826 rsu’s were canceled due to performance 
conditions not achieved.  
one incentive plan with 2,640 rsus was 
canceled due to the emea restructuring, and a 
new incentive plan will be entered into in 2021.
furthermore, 2,497 rsus were canceled 
related to the ltip rsu 2018 program covering 
the financial years 2018-2020 as a performance 
adjustment, as the achievement was 96.4% of 
targets.

the group has entered into pension and 
similar agreements with most employees. 
obligations relating to defined-contribution 
plans are recognized in the income statement 
in the period in which they are earned, 
and payments due are recognized in the 
statement of financial position under other 
payables.
for defined-benefit plans, the net present 
value is only calculated for those benefits 
earned to date by employees. the present 
value of future pension payments is estimated 
actuarially and shown net of the fair value of 
any plan assets in the statement of financial 
position as pension obligations.
differences between estimated pension assets 
and liabilities and their realized values are 
termed actuarial gains and losses. actuar-
ial gains and losses are recognized in the 
statement of other comprehensive income.
changes in benefits earned to date are actu-
arially calculated and expensed immediately 
when the employees have already earned the 
right to the changed benefits. otherwise, they 
are recognized in the income statement over 
the period during which the employees earn 
the right to the benefits.
    accounting estimates  
and judgments
for defined-benefit plans, annual actuarial 
calculations are made of the net present value 
of future benefits to be paid under the plan. 
the net present value is calculated based on 
assumptions of the future developments of 
salary, interest, inflation, and mortality rates. 
assumptions are assessed at reporting date 
and changes in these assumptions may 
significantly affect the liabilities and pension 
cost under defined benefit plans.
the pension obligations of the parent com-
pany and most foreign subsidiaries (all those 
with defined-contribution plans) are covered 
by insurance. for a few foreign subsidiaries     
(those with defined benefit plans), the 
pension obligations are not covered or only 
partly covered by insurance.
under defined-benefit plans, the employer is 
obliged to pay a defined benefit (for example 
a fixed percentage of an employee’s final 
salary) to the employee after retirement. un-
der a defined-benefit plan, the group carries 
the risk in respect of future developments in 
interest rates, inflation, mortality, or disability.

the plan entitles employees to defined future 
benefits. these primarily depend on number 
of years of service, salary level at retirement 
age, and the size of the national pension.
the actuarial assessments of assets and 
liabilities in the norwegian defined-benefit 
plan have been done by storebrand pensjon-
stjenester as (norway).
for the swiss defined-benefit plan, the 
actuarial assessments of assets and liabilities 
have been done by allea ltd (switzerland).
for the belgian defined-benefit plan, the 
actuarial assessments of assets and liabilities 
have been done by willis towers watson 
(belgium).
sensitivity analysis
significant actuarial assumptions for the 
determination of the pension benefit 
liability are discount rate and expected 
future remuneration increases. the sensitivity 
analysis below has been determined based 
on reasonable likely changes in assumptions 
occurring at the end of the period.
the analysis considers the single change 
shown in the table with all other assumptions 
assumed to remain unchanged. in practice, 
changes in one assumption may be accompa-
nied by offsetting changes in another assump-
tion (although this is not always the case).
the group expects to pay eur 694 thousand 
to the defined-benefit pension plans in 2021 
(2019: eur 558 thousand for the year 2020).
for defined-contribution plans, the employer 
is obliged to pay a defined contribution (for 
example a fixed percentage of an employee’s 
salary) to independent insurance companies.
for a defined-contribution plan, the group 
runs no risk in respect of future developments 
in interest rates, inflation, mortality, or disability.

1 includes re-establishment of rented premises and holiday allowances required by the danish holiday act. 
provisions used during the year relate mainly to the balance moved to current liabilities as amount to be paid in 2021 
in connection with the danish holiday act.
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
a provision is recognized when the group has 
a legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of the group’s resources will be required to 
settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation.
in valuing provisions, the costs estimated 
to settle the liability are discounted if such 
discounting would have a material effect on 
the measurement of the liability. a pre-tax 
discount rate is used that reflects the level 
of interest rates with the liability. changes 
in the discount element during the year are 
recognized as financial expenses. the present 
value of defined-benefit obligations and the 
related current service cost and past service 
cost were measured using the projected unit 
credit method.
anniversary bonuses
this provision results from the group’s com-
mitment of one month’s pay in connection 
with employees’ 25th and 40th anniversary.
termination indemnity
in italy, upon termination of employment for 
any reason, employers must pay a leaving 
indemnity (‘trattamento di fine rapporto’ or 
tfr). termination pay is calculated as 6.9% 
of each year’s annual salary, revalued on the 
basis of 75% of the inflation rate plus a fixed 
rate of 1.5% during the period of accrual, and 
is paid as a lump sum when the employees 
leaves or transferred to private pension fund. 
the cost is accrued on a monthly basis repre-
senting 1/13 of the annual cost per month.
pension
refer to note 3.3 pension and similar liabilities.
other 
other provisions contain, among others, the 
obligation to re-establish leased offices when 
the premises are vacated as well as holiday 
allowances required by the danish holiday act.
the present value of the re-establishment 
obligation is included in the cost of the 
property plant and equipment and depreciat-
ed accordingly. 
uncertainties exist with respect to pension 
obligation’s timing as well as timing and 
amount of re-establishment costs and 
termination indemnity. judgment is used to 
determine when and whether such obligations 
will crystallize.

4.1 income tax
tax
this section contains all relevant
disclosures and details regarding
corporate income tax recognized 
within the financial statements. the 
total tax on group profit for the year 
has decreased by eur 3.1m to eur 
27.8m compared with eur 30.9m in 
2019. income tax has decreased due to 
a lower profit compared with 2019.
the group’s effective tax rate has
decreased from 24.2% in 2019 to 24.0%
in 2020, primarily due to additional tax 
deductions on r&d expenses.
4.1 income tax
4.2 deferred tax
    accounting policy
the income tax for the year comprises current
and deferred tax, including adjustments to
prior years. tax is recognized in the income
statement, except to the extent it relates to
items recognized in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity.
the tax deduction on share-based 
remuneration for the year is recognized as 
taxable income in the income statement to 
the extent that the tax deduction is 
attributable to the share-based payment 
expenses recognized in the income statement. 
the value of the excess tax reduction, if any, is 
recognized directly in equity.

4.2 deferred tax 
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
deferred tax is calculated using the liability
method on all temporary differences between
the accounting and taxable values of 
assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are 
assessed yearly and recognized only to the 
extent that it is more likely than not that they 
can be utilized.
deferred tax assets, including the tax value
of tax losses carried forward, are recognized
as other non-current assets and measured
at the amount at which they are expected to
be realized. these are either offset against
deferred tax liability or against tax on future
earnings within the same legal entity or a
jointly taxed entity.
deferred tax is measured based on the tax
legislation and statutory tax rates in the
respective countries that will apply under
the legislation in force on the statement of
financial position date when the deferred tax
asset is expected to crystallize as current
tax. changes in deferred tax resulting from
changes in tax rates are recognized in the
income statement.
for jurisdictions where ifrs 15 is not 
applicable for tax purposes, the revenue 
is deferred, and the related income tax is 
recognized as deferred tax.
deferred tax reflects assessment of future
taxable income across all legal entities.
actual future taxes may deviate from these
estimates.
in some jurisdictions the tax treatment
related to the adoption of ifrs 15 is yet to
be determined, management assesses the
tax treatment for those legal entities yearly.
management assessed that, for those 
jurisdictions, the most likely outcome is a 
deferred income of subscription-based license 
fees for tax purposes, related income tax is 
thus recognized as deferred tax.
the uncertainty of the tax treatment of ifrs
15, to be classified as deferred tax, amounts to
approximately eur 25m (2019: 20m), related 
to parent company.
the group recognizes deferred tax assets
relating to losses carried forward, if 
management assesses that these can be 
offset against taxable income in the 
foreseeable future.

invested capital
this section comprises notes which 
offer a thorough understanding of the 
group’s non-current assets. additions in 
invested capital include separate asset 
acquisitions or business combinations. 
furthermore, in this section are 
disclosed all lease related disclosures, 
including liabilities.
additions to intangible assets amount-
ed to eur 0.6m in 2020 (2019: eur 
61.4m). the increase in 2020 relates 
to adjustments made to acquired 
goodwill and software. additions 
to property, plant, and equipment 
amounted to eur 5.9m in 2020 
(2019: eur 9.5m). additions in 2020 
comprise mainly lease extensions and 
purchase of equipment.
in this section, the following notes are 
presented:
5.1 acquisition of enterprises
5.2 intangible assets
5.3 property, plant, and equipment 
section 5
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
business combinations
newly acquired or newly established 
enterprises are recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements from the effective dates 
of acquisition.
the takeover method is applied for acquisi-
tions if the parent company gains control of 
the entity. identifiable assets, liabilities, and 
contingent liabilities in companies acquired 
are measured at their fair values at the dates 
of acquisition. identifiable intangible assets 
are recognized if they can be separated or 
arise from a contractual right. deferred tax is 
recognized on fair value adjustments.
any excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, 
and contingent liabilities acquired is recog-
nized as goodwill under intangible assets. 
in accounting for business combinations, 
judgment is required in determining whether 
an intangible asset is identifiable and should 
be recorded separately from goodwill. in 
addition, estimating the acquisition date fair 
values of the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed involves considerable 
judgment. 
measurements are based on information avail-
able on the acquisition date and are based on 
expectations and assumptions that have been 
deemed reasonable by management. 
these judgments, estimates, and assumptions 
can materially affect the financial position and 
profit for several reasons. such reasons include, 
but are not limited to: fair values assigned 
to assets subject to depreciation and amor-
tization affect the amounts of depreciation 
and amortization to be recorded in operating 
profit in the periods following the acquisition, 
subsequent negative changes in the estimated 
fair values of assets may result in additional 
expense from impairment charges, subsequent 
changes in the estimated fair values of 
liabilities and provisions may result in addi-
tional expense (if increasing the estimated fair 
value) or additional income (if decreasing the 
estimated fair value).
acquisition cost 
acquisition cost consists of the fair value of 
the purchase price of the enterprise acquired. 
the net aggregate value of identifiable assets 
and liabilities is measured in accordance with 
ifrs 3 business combinations.
transaction costs related to acquisitions are 
charged to the income statement as admin-
istration expenses at the time of acquisition. 
in 2020, no cost related to acquisition and 
integration was charged to the income 
statement (2019: 1.1m).
provisional values are used for initial recogni-
tion where there is uncertainty regarding the 
identification and measurement of acquired 
assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities 
at the date of acquisition. such provisional 
values can be adjusted or additional assets 
or liabilities included until 12 months after the 
acquisition date if new information is available 
regarding circumstances that existed at the 
time of acquisition and which would have af-
fected the fair value at the time of acquisition, 
had the information been known. thereafter, 
no adjustments are made to goodwill, and 
changes in estimates of contingent consid-
eration relating to business combinations are 
recognized in the income statement.
simcorp gain
on june 6, 2019, simcorp entered into an 
agreement to acquire 100% of the shares 
in aim holding sca and its subsidiaries 
(aim software – renamed simcorp gain) 
for an enterprise value of eur 60.0m. the 
acquisition became effective as of august 
1, 2019. the purchase price was adjusted 
upwards by eur 2.9m upon closing reflecting 
a higher value of net assets acquired. simcorp 
gain provides data management solutions 
to the buy-side community, helping financial 
institutions aggregate, master and report on 
their market data.

amortized.
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested 
for impairment at least annually. impairment 
losses are recognized directly in profit for the 
year and are not subsequently reversed.
other intangible assets
intangible assets with limited economic 
lives are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortization and impairment losses. intangi-
ble assets include proprietary and acquired 
software as well as client relationships. 
amortization is provided on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, which are as follows:
• software up to 10 years
• client relationships up to 20 years
proprietary software for resale
costs of development projects for software 
for resale are recognized as intangible assets 
where they are clearly defined and identi-
fiable, where there are sufficient resources 
to implement the projects, and where it is 
probable that identifiable future income or 
cost reductions will cover the development 
and future operating costs.
capitalized development costs comprise 
salaries plus overheads. overheads comprise 
staff costs, it, and communications and 
amortization. development costs comprise 
costs attributable to the group’s development 
functions, including salaries, and other 
employee costs and amortization.
to the extent that the development costs 
are not capitalized, they are recognized 
as research and development costs in the 
income statement.
acquired software
software acquired is measured at cost less 
accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses.
client relationships
acquisition related client relationships 
are initially recognized at fair value at the 
acquisition date and subsequently carried at 
cost less accumulated amortization and any 
accumulated impairment losses. the value of 
client relationships is amortized on a straight-
line basis, based on the estimated duration 
of the acquired relationship or other relevant 
period if deemed appropriate.
the carrying values of other intangible assets 
are reviewed annually for impairment to assess 
if there is an indication of impairment beyond 
what is expressed through normal amortization. 
if the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset is 
written down to the recoverable amount.

all intangible assets apart from goodwill are 
considered to have limited useful economic 
lives.
for the simcorp group, the measurement of 
intangible assets, including goodwill, could be 
affected by significant changes in judgment 
and assumptions underlying their calculation.
the estimated useful life reflects the period 
over which the group expects to derive 
economic benefit from intangible assets.
determination of the useful life of client 
relationships at up to 20 years and software at 
up to 10 years is based on estimates regarding 
the period over which such assets are expect-
ed to produce economic benefits to the group.
impairment test
goodwill is tested for impairment once a year, 
other intangible assets are tested when there 
is indication of impairment. no indication of 
impairment beyond what is expressed through 
normal amortization has been perceived in 
relation to software and client relationships.
when performing the impairment test, an 
assessment is made as to the ability of 
individual cash generating units (cgus) to 
generate sufficient positive net cash flow 
in the future to support the value of the 
unit - value in use. the discount rate used in 
determining the value in use is based on the 
weighted average cost of capital (wacc).
cash generating units are defined as the 
smallest group of identifiable assets which 
together generate incoming cash flow from 
continued operations. for simcorp sofia this 
has been defined as the business unit.       
simcorp gain and simcorp coric cash gener-
ating units’ goodwill were in 2020 reallocated 
due to restructuring within the group’s 
divisions. reallocation was done based on the 
relative value of the redefined cgu. previous 
year was adjusted accordingly. 
simcorp gain and simcorp coric have been 
integrated within the regional sales and 
marketing structure and into the research and 
development segment, previously covering 
exclusively simcorp dimension, but now also 
the product lines simcorp coric and simcorp 
gain.
the future cash flows are based on budgets 
and management’s estimates of expected de-
velopments over the next five years. revenue 
growth assumptions, ebit, and discount rate 
constitute the most material parameters in the 
calculations.
at december 31, 2020, the carrying amount 
of goodwill was tested for impairment. the 
expected performance of simcorp sofia was 
assessed for simcorp italiana s.r.l. in order 
to verify if sufficient to offset the carrying 
amount of the cash generating unit. the 
expected performance of simcorp dimension 
was assessed for simcorp coric and simcorp 
gain.
the impairment test at december 31, 2020 
showed no indication of impairment for 2020 
(2019: nil). management’s assessment is that 
currently no changes in key assumptions are 
reasonably likely to reduce the value in use 
below the carry value for any of the cash 
generating units. 
for simcorp sofia, the estimated growth rate 
is based on management’s expectations. for 
simcorp dimension, the expected growth rate 
is based on simcorp’s own market intelligence 
process, through which information is 
collected from all key markets to form the 
basis for future market growth expectations. 
the internal expectations are then verified 
against available market data from external 
resources, including global market intelligence 
and research companies.

5.3 property, plant, and equipment
the group chose to present right-of-use 
assets together with the underlying assets 
of the same nature which it owns. therefore, 
from january 1, 2020, property, plant and 
equipment includes right-of-use assets arising 
from lease agreements. 
    accounting policies  
property, plant, and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment. right-of-use assets 
are initially measured at cost consisting of 
the amount of the initial measurement of the 
leases liability, plus any lease payments made 
to the lessor at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received and the 
initial estimate of refurbishment costs and any 
initial directs costs incurred by simcorp as the 
lessee.
leasehold includes right of use assets related 
to the rental of premises as well as improve-
ments. the group leases land and buildings 
for its office space for three to ten years. 
technical equipment includes it and other 
equipment owned and leased.
other equipment includes leased cars and 
owned fixtures and fittings.
leases
the group leases vehicles and equipment with 
lease terms of three to five years. agreements 
might include options to purchase assets at 
the end of the contract term or guarantees 
in relation to the residual value of the leased 
asset at the end of the contract term. the use 
of vehicles and equipment is monitored and 
the estimated amount payable reassessed 
at the reporting date to remeasure lease 
liabilities and right-of-use assets.
none of the groups’ right-of-use assets meet 
the definition of investment property.
extension and termination options are includ-
ed in a number of property and equipment 
leases across the group. these are used to 
maximize operational flexibility in terms of 
managing the assets used in the group’s 
operations. the majority of extension and 
termination options held are exercisable only 
by the group and not by the respective lessor. 
the group assesses at the lease commence-
ment date whether it is reasonably certain to 
exercise such options and reassesses if there 
is a significant event.
additionally, some leases provide for addi-
tional payments based on changes to local 
price indices, these amounts are generally 
determined annually.
payments associated with short-term leases 
and leases of low-value assets are recognized 
on a straight-line basis as an expense in 
the income statement. short-term leases 
are leases with a term of 12 months or less. 
low-value assets comprise it-equipment and 
small items of office furniture.
lease liabilities arise from the adoption of 
ifrs 16. details on lease liabilities, amounts 
recognized in the income statement and 
statement of cash flow in relation to leases 
follow.

the basis of depreciation is calculated with 
due consideration to scrap value and any 
prior impairment write down. the estimated 
useful life and scrap value of each asset is 
determined at the date of acquisition and 
reassessed annually. when the scrap value 
equals the carrying amount of the asset, the 
asset ceases to be depreciated. any change in 
depreciation period or scrap value is recog-
nized as a change in accounting estimate.
impairment, depreciation, and amortization 
are recognized in cost of sales, research and 
development costs, sales and marketing costs, 
or administrative expenses.
property, plant, and equipment are depreciat-
ed on a straight-line basis over the estimated

section 6
equity, capital structure,  
and financing items
this section presents how simcorp 
manages its capital structure. sim-
corp’s capital structure management 
aims primarily to support business 
growth. it is the group’s policy that any 
excess capital present after 1) funding 
growth opportunities and 2) leaving 
remaining cash reserves that cover at 
least 10% of the following year’s cost, 
be returned to investors.
in this section, the following notes are 
presented:
6.1  equity, treasury shares,  
and dividends
6.2 risk
6.3 financial assets and liabilities
6.4 financial income and expenses
    accounting policy
treasury shares acquired by the parent 
company are recognized in the statement 
of financial position at zero value. dividends 
from such shares are recognized in equity.
on december 31, 2020, the share capital 
amounted to dkk 40,500,000 divided into 
40,500,000 shares (unchanged from 2019). 
the company’s shares are traded on nasdaq 
copenhagen in denominations of dkk 1. no 
shares confer any special rights upon any 
shareholder. no shares are subject to restric-
tions on transferability or voting rights.
the share capital may be increased in one or 
more issues by a total nominal amount of up 
to dkk 4,000,000 (4,000,000 shares of dkk 
1 nominal value) as directed by the board of 
directors with respect to time and terms. 
this authority is valid for a period of five 
years, expiring on march 1, 2022, and may be 
extended by the shareholders for one or more 
periods of up to five years at a time.
the capital increase may be affected by cash 
payment or otherwise. the capital increase 
may be affected without pre-emption rights 
to the company’s existing shareholders, if 
the shares are issued at market price or as 
consideration for the company’s acquisition 
of an existing operation or specific assets of a 
value that equals the value of the shares issued.
6.1 equity, treasury shares, and dividends
except for the cases specified in the 
preceding period, the company’s existing 
shareholders shall have a right to subscribe 
new shares proportionately to their existing 
holdings. the new shares shall be negotiable 
instruments, and no restrictions shall apply to 
the transferability of the shares. no share-
holders shall be under an obligation to have 
their shares redeemed in full or in part by the 
company or any other party.
unless danish legislation provides for a 
greater majority or unanimity, the adoption 
of resolutions regarding amendments to the 
company’s articles of association and the 
company’s dissolution or merger with another 
company requires a majority of not less than 
two thirds of all the votes cast as well as of 
the voting share capital represented at the rel-
evant general meeting, and that not less than 
50% of the share capital is represented at the 
general meeting. should less than 50% of the 
share capital be represented at the general 
meeting, and the resolution is adopted by not 
less than two thirds of the votes cast as well 
as of the voting share capital represented at 
the general meeting, another general meeting 
may be called within 14 days after the pre-
ceding general meeting. at the new general 
meeting, the resolution can be adopted by not 
less than two thirds of the votes cast as well 
as of the voting share capital represented at 
the general meeting. refer to pages 30 to 33 
for additional information.
treasury shares
the market value of treasury shares at 
december 31, 2020 was eur 103.0m (2019: 
eur 91.3m). the treasury shares are carried at 
eur 0.0m (2019: eur 0.0m) in the financial 
statements.
the board of directors has been authorized to 
let the company acquire treasury shares of up 
to a total nominal value of 10% of the com-
pany’s share capital, including the company’s 
current holding of treasury shares.
in 2020, simcorp a/s acquired 112,654 
treasury shares for eur 10.0m, at an average 
price of dkk 660.78 per share (2019: eur 
12.5m at an average price of dkk 617.86 per 
share).
in 2020, simcorp a/s delivered 163.686 
treasury shares as part of the share-based 
remuneration program for a nominal value of 
dkk 163.686 (2019: dkk 168,217) calculated 
at an average market price of dkk 731.05 per 
share (2019: dkk 575.42 per share), equal to 
a calculated price of eur 16.4m (2019: eur

capital management and dividends 
policy
the board of directors regularly assesses the 
need to adjust the capital structure, including 
the requirement for cash, credit facilities, and 
equity.
simcorp intends to pay dividends of at least 
40% of the group profit on ordinary activities 
after tax. in addition, the company buys 
treasury shares provided that it does not 
anticipate specific cash requirements.
in 2020, simcorp acquired eur 10.0m in 
simcorp shares as part of a share buyback 
program (2019: eur 12.5). in 2021, given there 
are no specific requirements for liquidity, 
simcorp expects to buy back shares with the 
intention to purchase shares for eur 40m 
in two half yearly buyback programs of eur 
20m each.
distribution of dividends to shareholders has 
no tax consequences for the company. 
the board of directors intends to recommend 
to the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting that dividends of approximately eur 
40.1m (2019: eur 39.9m), equal to dkk 7.50 
(2019: dkk 7.50) per 1 share, be distributed 
and that the company be authorized to 
acquire treasury shares for up to 10% of the 
company’s share capital.

due to the nature of its operations, invest-
ments, and financing, the group is exposed to 
changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
the group’s policy is to direct financial 
management towards the management of fi-
nancial risks related to operations and finance. 
the group’s financial risks are managed 
centrally by the group finance according to 
policies committed in writing and approved 
by the board of directors. the purpose is to 
ensure efficient liquidity management. excess 
liquidity is transferred to simcorp a/s which 
operates as the internal bank for the group.
the scope and nature of the group’s financial 
instruments appear from the income state-
ment and the statement of financial position 
in accordance with the accounting policies 
applied. this note provides information about 
factors that may influence amounts, time of 
payment, or reliability of future payments, 
where such information is not provided 
directly in the financial statements.
this note addresses only financial risks 
directly related to the group’s financial 
instruments as detailed in note 6.3 financial 
assets and liabilities.
the group’s most important operational and 
commercial risk factors are described in more 
detail on pages 24-26 of the annual report.
currency risk
currency risk is the risk that arises from 
changes in exchange rates and affects the 
group’s result. the group’s foreign subsid-
iaries are not severely impacted by foreign 
exchange fluctuations, as both income and 
costs are generally settled in the functional 
(local) currency of the individual entity and 
material cash balances are transferred to 
simcorp a/s.
the consolidated income statement is impact-
ed by changes in exchange rates. the results 
of foreign subsidiaries are translated from their 
functional currency to eur at the exchange 
rates ruling on the dates of underlying 
transactions. the average exchange rate for the 
month is used to reflect the transaction dates’ 
exchange rates. the table shows the change in 
average exchange rate for the main currencies 
impacting the group’s operating profit.
at the end of the reporting period the group‘s 
currency exposure (excluding translation 
exposure) based on the functional currencies 
of the individual group companies shows that

6.2 risk (continued)
the majority of the cross-currency exposure 
comes from the usd/sgd exchange rate: eur 
15.6m (2019: eur 13.7m) and the usd/gbp 
exchange rate: eur 8.2m (2019: eur 9.6m).  
based on the net exposure of the group, 
the hypothetical impact of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the profit before tax for the 
year and equity would be eur 1.6m for a 10% 
change in the usd/sgd exchange rate and 
eur 0.8m for a 10% change in the usd/gbp 
exchange rate (an appreciation of the usd in 
relation to the sgd and the gbp would have 
positive impact, a depreciation would have a 
negative impact).
the group’s foreign exchange management 
policy is to balance incoming and outgoing 
payments in local currency as much as 
possible and generally seek to ensure that an 
increasing number of contracts entered into 
are eur-denominated. when placing surplus 
funds, the group generally seeks to minimize 
its net exposure in individual currencies. in 
order to mitigate currency risk in relation to 
ukraine, simcorp is using usd for salaries in 
that country.
currency exposures from investments in sub-
sidiaries have not been hedged. the related 
exchange rate adjustments are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.
interest risk
the group’s interest rate risks are generally 
related to its bank deposits and revolving 
credit facilities. 
deposits
the group had cash deposits of eur 53.1m 
on december 31, 2020 (2019: eur 31.9m) 
carrying a variable rate of interest based on 
the money market rate. the effective rate of 
interest varies with the currency and, made 
up at the statement of financial position date, 
fluctuated between -0.5% and 0.0% in 2020 
(2019: -0.5% and 0.0%) for significant cash 
deposits.
debt
simcorp has a revolving committed credit 
facility of eur 40.0m expiring july 31, 2022 
and a seasonal credit facility of eur 30.0m 
covering the period from march 15 to septem-
ber 15, also expiring july 31, 2022. 
on december 31, 2020, there was no drawn 
on the credit  facilities, however eur 3.4m 
was utilized for various guarantees. the group 
had unused credit facilities in banks of eur 
36.6m.
simcorp’s cash flow is by nature impacted 
by the annual dividend, the seasonal credit 
facility is used to optimize the debt structure. 
see note 6.3 financial assets and liabilities for 
additional information.
sensitivity
exposure to interest risk arises from cash 
deposits, the revolving credit facility and 
seasonal facility. if interest rates increased by 
one percentage point, it would have a positive 
impact of eur 0.5m (2019: negative impact of 
eur 0.5m). 
a corresponding decrease in interest rates 
would have the opposite impact. the impact 
of change in interest levels on the equity of 
the group does not deviate significantly from 
the impact on the profit and loss for the year.
liquidity risk
group liquidity is managed by group treasury, 
with the objective of ensuring effective 
liquidity management by obtaining sufficient 
committed credit facilities to provide 
adequate financial resources. it is the group’s 
policy that cash reserves must exceed 10% 
of the coming year’s expected costs. cash 
reserve and expected cash flow for 2021 
are considered to be adequate to meet the 
obligations of the group as they fall due. 
cash reserve comprises cash and cash 
equivalent and unutilized credit facilities. the 
group aims to have sufficient cash reserves to 
allow it to continue to operate adequately in 
case of unforeseen fluctuations in cash.

region. two factors are therefore considered 
when estimating expected loss rates: the actu-
al credit loss experienced over the past seven 
years and a factor which reflects differences 
between economic conditions during the 
period over which the rates were collected, 
current conditions, and the group’s view of 
economic conditions over the expected life of 
the receivables.
accumulated average corporate default rates 
by region as published by standard & poor are 
used as proxy for probability of loss as these 
provide an indication on counterpart default 
risk by region of origin. higher expected loss 
rates are used for certain balances if individual 
assessment indicates a higher probability of 
default. initially, an expected loss rate from 
0.04% up to 2.89% (2019: 0.04% up to 2.89%) 
is applied for clients with investment grade 
rating depending on the length of the asset’s 
lifetime and location. for unrated clients and 
clients that do not have investment grade 
rating, an expected loss rate from 0.35% up to 
13.36% (2019: 0.35% up to 13.36%) is applied 
depending on the length of the asset’s lifetime 
and the client’s geographical location. a higher 
the group is not exposed to significant risks 
concerning individual clients or business part-
ners as clients are generally major investment 
managers in the financial sector. under the 
group’s policy for assuming credit risk, all 
major clients and other business partners are 
assessed prior to any contract being signed.
the group primarily enters into financial 
instruments and transactions with the group’s 
relationship banks. group treasury monitors 
the group’s gross credit exposure to banks 
and operates with individual limits on banks 
based on rating and access to netting of 
assets and liabilities.
receivables and contract assets 
in assessing expected credit loss of trade 
receivables and contract assets which 
comprises many small balances, the group 
uses an allowance matrix. expected loss rates 
are calculated separately for exposures in 
different segments based on common credit 
risk characteristics in relation to geographical 
rate might be applied to certain clients after 
individual assessment resulting in the weight-
ed average expected loss rates depicted on 
the credit risk exposure on receivables and 
contract assets table. 
if there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery, the gross carrying amount is 
written-off. indicators that there is no reason-
able expectation of recovery include, amongst 
others, the failure of a debtor to engage in 
repayment plan with the group, and a failure 
to make contractual payments for a period 
greater than three hundred and sixty days 
past due. 
no client represents more than 5.6% (2019: 
6.9%) of total receivables from clients.
expected timing of invoicing for the contract 
assets balance can be found in note 2.4.

6.3 financial assets and liabilities
    accounting policies,  
judgments and estimates
all financial assets and liabilities are measured 
at amortized cost. the carrying amount of 
these approximate fair value. financial assets 
which have been modified or renegotiated 
during the period are assessed individually for 
impairment. 
financial liabilities
financial liabilities comprise lease liabilities, 
borrowings, trade payables and other 
payables.
lease liabilities
lease liabilities arise from the adoption of 
ifrs 16. for additional information on lease 
liabilities refer to notes 5.3.
borrowings
debt is initially recognized at fair value less 
transaction cost. fair value does not materially 
differ from carrying amount since interest 
payable is close to current market rates.
a financial liability is derecognized when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
canceled or expires.  when an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability.
the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognized in the income state-
ment. after initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
changes in liabilities arising from financing 
activities in 2020 comprise withdrawals from 
the revolving credit facilities of eur 40.0m, 
interest cost of eur 0.2m and re-payment  
of eur 40.0m.
simcorp has access to: 1) a multi-currency 
committed revolving credit facility of eur 
40.0m expiring july 31, 2022, 2) a seasonal 
facility of eur 30.0m covering the period 
from march 15 to september 15 expiring july 
31, 2022. together, they are available for 
general corporate purposes of the group. 
on december 31, 2020, the group had a 
committed revolving credit facility of eur 
40m, of which eur 0.0m had been drawn and 
eur 3.4m used for guarantees.
trade payables and other payables
other payables include bonus and commis-
sion accruals, vacation pay obligations, payroll 
taxes and vat. payables are measured at cost. 
exposure to currency and liquidity risk for 
trade and other payables as well as borrow-
ings is disclosed in note 6.2. 
financial assets
financial assets comprise other financial 
assets, deposits, receivables and cash and 
cash equivalent. for additional information on 
receivables refer to note 2.5.
deposits are primarily related to the leasing 
of offices. security deposits which will not 
be returned within one year of the statement 
of financial position date are recognized as 
non-current assets. commitments which 
require a deposit will initially be recorded to 
the deposit asset account. if the deposit is 
not recovered, it is charged to the income 
statement. 
other financial assets comprise investments in 
shares of unlisted entities.

expected to have a significant effect on 
profit for the year and the assessment of the 
group’s financial position.
in 2019, simcorp reported contingent liability 
related to simcorp a/s and the so called 
“atp-ruling” related to possible vat exemp-
tion for certain pension services.
on july 22, 2020, the danish tax agency 
(skattestyrelsen) came to the final conclusion 
that simcorp’s products and services are 
subject to vat. 
on this basis, simcorp does not expect any 
contingent liability and therefore no effect on 
profit for the year and the assessment of the 
group’s financial position and accordingly, 
simcorp has not made a provision for this in 
its annual accounts 2020.

2.3 contract balances
contract balances consist of client-related 
assets and liabilities. 
contract assets relate to the parent rights to 
consideration for software licensed to clients 
under subscription agreements with future 
payments, when that right is conditional on 
simcorp’s future performance. 
contract liabilities represent mainly prepay-
ments from clients for unsatisfied or partially 
satisfied performance obligations in relation 
to licenses, software updates and support, 
and services. software updates and support 
and hosting billing generally occur at periodic 
intervals (e.g. quarterly or yearly) prior to 
revenue recognition, resulting in contract 
liabilities.
the majority of licenses agreements is 
revenue recognized in the year of sale. 
however, contracts with functionality gaps 
or acceptance criteria may have revenue 
recognition deferred, resulting in a contract 
liability when billing has occurred.
contracts in progress relating to fixed fee 
professional services are measured at the 
estimated sales value of the proportion of 
the contract completed at the statement of 
financial position date. amounts invoiced 
on account in excess of work completed 
are included in prepayments under current 
liabilities.
for accounting policies, estimates and 
judgments please refer to the consolidated 
financial statements note 2.4.
significant changes in contract assets and 
liabilities during the period are presented 
below.
contract assets are expected to be realized

returned within one year of the statement 
of financial position date are recognized as 
non-current assets. commitments which 
require a deposit will initially be recorded 
to the deposit asset account, if the deposit 
is not recovered it is charged to the income 
statement. 
other financial assets comprise investments in 
shares of unlisted entities.
financial liabilities
financial liabilities comprise lease liabilities of 
eur 23.9m (2019: eur 26.6m), borrowings 
of nil (2019: eur 20m), and trade payables 
and other payables of eur 32.6m (2019: eur 
24.2m).
lease liabilities
lease liabilities arise from the adoption of 
ifrs 16. for additional information refer to 
note 5.3

less transaction cost. fair value does not 
materially differ from carrying amount since 
interest payable is close to current market 
rates. for addition information on borrowings

statements.

other payables include bonus and commis-
sion accruals, vacation pay obligations, payroll
