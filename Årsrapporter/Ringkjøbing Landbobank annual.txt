dear shareholder
the coronavirus became the order of the day in 2020. the virus has had far-reaching impli-
cations for the entire population and denmark’s many businesses. our main focus in the 
past year has therefore been to support our customers and business partners – and natu-
rally to ensure safe working conditions for our employees.
in the spring we updated our strategy, just under two years after merging with nordjyske 
bank. we did this to harmonise the bank’s management structure and ensure that our bank 
rests	on	firm	and	future-proof	foundations.	we	also	confirmed	our	organic	growth	strategy.
we have spent 2020 implementing the strategy and adapting to market conditions. both low 
interest rates and low economic growth rates are likely to characterise the coming years.
we continue to be really well received by our customers. the level of customer satisfaction 
remains high and our image is good, which strong growth in new customers and good cus-
tomer	retention	confirm.	our	total	credit	intermediation	grew	by	5%	in	2020,	with	growth	of	
8%	in	mortgage	loans	and	2%	in	bank	loans.	this	growth	is	considered	highly	satisfactory,	
given the sector-wide decrease in total bank loans due to the coronavirus pandemic.
the stock market also responded positively to the bank’s development. the increase in the 
bank’s	share	price	and	the	dividend	paid	resulted	in	a	positive	return	of	10%	–	compared	to	
the	flatlining	danish	omx	copenhagen	banks	pi	index.
total	income	increased	by	3%	and	total	expenses	decreased	by	2%	and	we	were	thus	able	to	
reduce the bank’s rate of costs from 38 to 36. we consider it satisfactory that we have been 
able to realise the planned synergies in just over two years.
profit	for	the	year	before	tax	totalled	dkk	1,144	million,	equivalent	to	a	return	on	equity	of	
15%	p.a.	the	profit	is	just	over	dkk	100	million	less	than	2019,	partly	due	to	higher	impair-
ment charges for loans and partly due to negative value adjustments on the securities port-
folio.
distribution	of	half	of	the	net	profit	for	the	year	is	recommended	to	the	general	meeting.	this	
will be effected through a dividend of dkk 7 per share and a dkk 255 million share buy-back 
programme.
in recent years, we have worked to make our bank more sustainable and from 2020 the bank 
is carbon neutral. read more about this in the bank’s esg report where we also describe our 
efforts to modify the products offered to our customers. our support of and work with more 
than 1,400 associations, clubs and events are also very important to us.
we would like to thank our highly skilled employees who have made an extraordinary effort 
in	a	year	where	we	have	all	had	to	be	very	flexible	in	various	ways.	the	expertise,	loyalty	and	
indomitable spirit of our employees are an unsurpassed combination.
we believe that vaccines will enable reopening of society and that we will see normalisa-
tion in 2021. serving our existing customers and continuing the increase in new customer 
relationships	by	winning	additional	market	share	will	be	our	primary	tasks.	we	expect	profit	
before tax in the range dkk 1.1-1.3 billion.
finally we would like to thank our customers and you, our shareholders, for the strong sup-
port which the bank enjoys.

core earnings
core income
interest
net interest income was dkk 1,256 million in 2020 compared to dkk 1,173 million in 
2019,	an	increase	of	7%.	the	bank	is	highly	satisfied	with	this	development.
the	development	is	partly	attributable	to	a	2%	increase	in	lending	compared	to	the	end	
of 2019. the trend in lending was more volatile in 2020 than in previous years. lending 
thus	increased	by	approximately	dkk	700	million	in	the	first	quarter	of	2020,	fell	by	ap-
proximately dkk 900 million in the second quarter, and increased again by approximate-
ly dkk 200 million and approximately dkk 800 million in the third and fourth quarters 
respectively.
this development was caused by diverging circumstances. the bank’s business custo-
mers have drawn less on their lines of credit during the year, partly because they have 
reduced their inventories and debtors and partly because the payment deadlines for 
vat and taxes were extended. in the second half-year, businesses resumed paying vat 
and taxes. personal customers have also been cautious and paid off debt in 2020. the 
bank’s niche and wholesale loans developed positively in 2020 and the bank saw a large 
increase in customer numbers during the year.
a further reason for the positive trend in the net interest income is that the bank intro-
duced negative interest rates on business accounts in general in the fourth quarter of 
2019, on liquid deposited funds greater than dkk 2 million held by personal customers 
and on holdings in pension accounts with effect from 1 january 2020. during 2020, the 
bank lowered the threshold for negative interest twice and with effect from the begin-
ning of 2021, so it now stands at dkk 100,000.
in 2020, the bank incurred more interest expenses on non-preferred senior capital than 
in 2019, but in february and may 2020 respectively the bank carried out early redemp-
tion of two issues of subordinated capital, which reduced interest expenses on this type 
of capital in 2020.
fee, commission and foreign exchange income
fee, commission and foreign exchange income amounted to dkk 770 million in 2020, 
compared	to	dkk	785	million	in	2019.	the	trend	reflects	both	increases	and	decreases	
in the different income items.
the income items “securities trading”, “guarantee commission and mortgage credit 
commission etc.” and “foreign exchange income” have developed positively due to 
higher levels of activity. “asset management and custody accounts” are also marginally 
higher than in 2019. 
“loan	fees”	decreased	as	expected,	due	to	less	refinancing	activity	in	2020.	in	addition,	
income from “payment handling” decreased due to the implementation of harmonisa-
tion and restriction of payment fees within the eu. finally, “other fees and commission” 
decreased. this is partly because this item contained a large one-off payment in 2019 
and partly because the bank harmonised its non-life insurance activities in 2020. this

change has meant falling payments from the bank’s external business partner, but also

sector shares and other operating income
total earnings from banking sector shares amounted to dkk 151 million in 2020, which 
is slightly higher than in 2019, where earnings were dkk 145 million. the earnings derive 
primarily from returns on the bank’s ownership interests in dlr kredit, bankinvest (bi 
holding) and pras.
other operating income was dkk 2 million in 2020, in contrast to 2019, where this item 
totalled dkk 14 million, dkk 12 million of which was non-recurring income.
core income
total	core	income	increased	by	3%	from	dkk	2,116	million	in	2019	to	dkk	2,179	million	
in 2020. the bank considers the increase satisfactory.

expenses, depreciation and write-downs
total expenses including depreciation and write-downs on tangible assets amounted to 
dkk	788	million	in	2020,	compared	to	dkk	805	million	in	2019,	a	decrease	of	2%.
the positive development in costs is attributable to saved double expenses and initia-
tives taken during both 2019 and 2020.
the rate of costs was 36.2 in 2020, compared to 38.0 in 2019. 
we consider it highly satisfactory that our cost adjustment is in place as early as two 
years after the merger.
impairment charges for loans etc.
impairment charges for loans etc. represented an expense of dkk 223 million in 2020, 
compared to an expense of dkk 100 million in 2019. impairment charges thus amount-
ed	to	0.48%	of	the	total	loans	and	guarantees	at	the	end	of	2020,	compared	to	0.21%	the	
year before.
during 2020, the bank’s total account for impairment charges increased from dkk 2,032 
million	to	dkk	2,205	million	and	amounted	to	4.6%	of	the	bank’s	total	loans	and	guaran-
tees at the end of 2020. 
the bank’s expenditure for losses and impairment charges in 2020 was strongly in-
fl	uenced	by	the	outbreak	of	coronavirus	in	march	2020	and	the	resulting	economic	
impacts.	during	2020,	the	bank	intensifi	ed	its	follow-up	on	credits	in	selected	customer	
segments (selected on the basis of industry and credit rating). the bank notes that the 
great majority of its customers have handled the economic situation relating to the coro-
navirus in a way which so far has limited the need for new individual impairment charg-
es. in addition, our assessment is that the bank’s credit exposure to the most vulnerable 
industries is modest. however, the bank is still very uncertain about how the economy 
will develop in the coming quarters when the many state aid schemes are phased out

and because of the risk of an increased r number and continued lockdown. on the posi-
tive side is the current deployment of vaccines. 
in 2020 the picture in agriculture varied widely across the various production branches. 
crop growers and cattle farmers generally received reasonable prices and sound operat-
ing results are expected. for pig farmers the year started with high prices and generally 
very	satisfactory	earnings.	however,	this	picture	deteriorated	significantly	during	2020	
as a result of the combination of coronavirus and the outbreak of african swine fever in 
eastern germany. the outbreak of swine fever particularly hit the farmers producing and 
selling piglets to germany, whereas the effect on producers of fattening pigs is more 
moderate.	the	bank’s	total	impairment	ratio	for	pig	farmers	is	currently	23%.	loans	and	
guarantees	to	pig	farms	account	for	1.2%	of	the	bank’s	total	loans	and	guarantees.	
the situation for denmark’s mink farmers changed dramatically in 2020 as a result of 
the outbreak and mutant strains of the coronavirus. as a result the herds on all mink 
farms have been culled. in the bank’s judgment, the vast majority of our exposure to 
mink producers will be repaid when the producers receive the expected payments for 
their products and compensation payments. 
at the end of 2020, the eu and the united kingdom entered into a long-expected brexit 
agreement. the bank’s immediate judgment is that the agreement is positive for those 
of the bank’s business customers which are trading with great britain. elements in the 
trade agreement may, however, have a negative effect on a few businesses. several of 
the	bank’s	fisheries	customers	are	also	expected	to	be	negatively	affected	by	the	agreed	
cuts	in	fishing	quotas.	how	the	individual	skippers	will	be	compensated	is	still	uncertain,	
but	the	eu	has	apparently	allocated	funds	to	cushion	the	financial	consequences.	the	
bank’s	exposure	to	fisheries	amounted	to	1.8%	at	the	end	of	2020.
the quality of the bank’s personal customer portfolio developed positively in 2020, de-
spite the coronavirus. unemployment remains relatively low and the housing market has 
also developed positively, supported among other things by the continuing low interest 
rates. 
to	counter	the	financial	risk	resulting	from	the	coronavirus	pandemic	and	sector-
specific	events	and	risks,	the	bank	has	made	management	estimates.	these	estimates	
increased during 2020 from dkk 126 million to dkk 566 million at the end of 2020. 
the	bank	reviewed	all	significant	exposures	with	impairment	on	an	individual	basis	in	
the	second	quarter	of	2020,	to	ensure	they	are	classified	appropriately	in	accordance	
with ifrs 9. as a principal rule, exposures where the bank assesses full repayment to 
be the most probable scenario are placed in stage 2. the review resulted in migration 
of impairment charges from stage 3 to stage 2 and a reduction of dkk 175 million in 
individual impairment charges.

the	bank	places	great	emphasis	on	the	key	figure	“core	earnings	per	share”	and	how	it	
develops. over the period 2009 to 2019, the bank has been able to increase core earn-
ings per share each year. 
in 2020 core earnings per share decreased, partly due to of the increasing impairment 
charges and partly due to a recommendation from finance denmark and the govern-
ment in march 2020 meant that the expected number of shares was not bought under 
the share buy-back programme initiated in 2020.  
core earnings per share were thus dkk 40.2 in 2020 compared to dkk 41.4 in 2019, a 
decrease	of	3%.

result for the portfolio etc.
the result for the portfolio etc. including portfolio funding costs was negative by dkk 8 
million net for 2020. in 2019 the result for the portfolio etc. was positive by dkk 49 mil-
lion net. 
the development of the result for the portfolio was also very volatile in 2020. in march 
2020, the prices of danish mortgage credit bonds and shares fell and the credit spread 
of	corporate	bonds	widened.	this	was	attributable	to	the	turmoil	on	the	financial	mar-
kets	due	to	the	coronavirus	crisis.	in	the	first	quarter	of	2020,	the	result	for	the	portfolio	
was negative by dkk 70 million net. 
the markets recovered during the next three quarters and the total result for the portfo-
lio for the second to fourth quarters of 2020 was positive by dkk 62 million net.
amortisation and write-downs on intangible assets
the bank treats amortisation and write-downs on intangible assets as a special item. 
posting them to this item enhances the quality of equity and helps to reduce the deduc-
tion when computing total capital. amortisation and write-downs on intangible assets 
amounted to dkk 15 million in 2020, unchanged relative to 2019.

the	profit	before	tax	was	dkk	1,144	million,	equivalent	to	a	return	on	average	equity	of

the	net	profit	for	the	year	was	dkk	920	million,	equivalent	to	a	return	on	average	equity	
of	11.7%	p.a.	
on publication of the 2019 annual report, the bank announced its expectations for core 
earnings	for	2020	in	the	range	dkk	1,000-1,200	million	and	profit	before	tax	in	the	range	
dkk 950-1,250 million.
on 23 march 2020 the bank downwardly adjusted its expected results for 2020 to core 
earnings	in	the	range	dkk	900-1,100	million	and	profit	before	tax	in	the	range	800-1,100	
million as a result of the coronavirus crisis and the macroeconomic uncertainty aris-
ing from it, including decreasing prices of mortgage bonds, widening credit spreads of 
corporate bonds and expected higher impairment charges for loans.
on 6 october 2020 the bank announced an upward adjustment of its expectations for 
2020. the expectations for core earnings were upwardly adjusted to the dkk 1,000-
1,150	million	range	and	the	expectations	for	profit	before	tax	were	upwardly	adjusted	to	
the dkk 950-1,150 million range.
the	background	to	the	upward	adjustment	was	primarily	a	better	income	flow	than	pre-
viously	expected	including	from	a	continued	large	inflow	of	customers	and	a	high	level	
of activity. the capital loss on the bank’s bond portfolio had also been reduced.
core	earnings	stood	at	dkk	1,168	million	and	profit	before	tax	at	dkk	1,144	million,	both	
realised at the upper end of the upwardly adjusted expectations.

balance sheet items and contingent liabilities
the bank’s balance sheet total at the end of 2020 stood at dkk 54,862 million, com-
pared to dkk 52,941 million the year before.
deposits	including	pooled	schemes	increased	by	4%	in	2020:	from	dkk	38,128	million	
at the end of 2019 to dkk 39,639 million at the end of 2020. the bank’s loans increased 
by	2%:	from	dkk	35,465	million	at	the	end	of	2019	to	dkk	36,241	million	at	the	end	of	
2020.
equity increased from dkk 7,610 million at the end of 2019 to dkk 8,146 million at the 
end of 2020.
the bank’s contingent liabilities, including guarantees, at the end of the year amounted 
to dkk 9,812 million, compared to dkk 9,665 million at the end of 2019. 
credit intermediation 
in addition to the traditional bank loans shown on its balance sheet, the bank also ar-
ranges mortgage loans for both totalkredit and dlr kredit.
the	development	in	the	bank’s	total	credit	intermediation	is	positive	by	5%	compared	to

the item “shares, etc.” amounted to dkk 1,386 million at the end of 2020, with dkk 40

the bank’s total market risk within exposures to interest rate risk, listed shares etc. and 
foreign currency remains at a moderate level, and this policy will continue.
liquidity
the bank’s liquidity situation is good. the bank’s short-term funding with term to matu-
rity of less than 12 months thus amounts to dkk 1.4 billion, balanced by dkk 10.7 billion 
in short-term investments in danmarks nationalbank (the central bank of denmark) and 
in liquid tradable securities. 
the bank’s deposits (excluding pooled schemes) and equity exceeded its loans by dkk 
6.8	billion	and	these	two	items	therefore	more	than	fully	finance	the	loan	portfolio.	in	ad-
dition,	part	of	the	loan	portfolio	for	renewable	energy	projects	is	financed	back-to-back	
with kfw bankengruppe, which means that dkk 1.2 billion can be disregarded in terms 
of liquidity. 
in terms of liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), the bank must comply with the statutory 
requirement	of	at	least	100%.	on	31	december	2020,	the	bank’s	lcr	was	206%,	which	
thus met the statutory requirement by a good margin.
rating
the bank is rated by the international credit rating agency moody’s investors service.
in september 2020, ringkjøbing landbobank’s long-term bank deposit rating was 
upgraded from a1 to aa3. in addition, the bank’s long-term issuer rating was upgraded 
from a2 to a1.

as indicated in the chart below, the bank’s share has outperformed the index for banks 
(omx	copenhagen	banks	pi)	in	the	same	period.
strategy update
in	the	report	for	the	first	quarter	of	2020,	the	bank	announced	a	strategy	update.	overall,	
the bank will continue to have an organic growth strategy and has decided to implement 
a	number	of	initiatives	to	ensure	firm	and	future-proof	foundations	for	a	strong	and	com-
petitive	bank	in	west,	central	and	north	jutland,	for	the	benefit	of	the	customers.
the initiatives included harmonisation of the bank’s management structure, merging of 
branches and automation of the last cashier functions. 
since publication of the strategy update, the bank has been working on implementing it.
two area functions in north jutland have therefore been closed down and general man-
agers claus andersen and carl pedersen have taken over the direct management of the 
branch network in north jutland. the management structure has thus been harmonised 
throughout	the	bank,	resulting	in	a	flatter	organisation.	
the bank’s branch in nibe was merged with the branch in hasseris, the branches in 
sindal	and	hirtshals	were	merged	with	the	branch	in	hjørring	and	finally,	the	private	
banking branch in frederikshavn was combined with the private banking branch in 
aalborg. 
the automation of the last cashier functions has also been completed, which means 
that they were closed and replaced by automated teller machines (atms) where the 
customers can deposit and withdraw danish kroner and euros.
central production departments were also established during 2020 and there are now 
a total of three located in ringkøbing, nørresundby and frederikshavn respectively. the 
central production departments are responsible for preparing documents etc.

the bank also established customer service departments in 2020. the departments 
service personal customers whose advisory requirements are limited. 
the bank’s branch in holte moved to a new address in 2020 and the new domicile will 
help to ensure that the framework is in place for continuing the positive development 
which has characterised the branch in recent years.
the bank’s branch in aarhus was expanded in 2020 to serve personal customers. in 
the future, the branch will thus serve private banking clients, business customers and 
personal customers. the physical framework of the aarhus branch was enlarged at the 
beginning of 2021. in addition, the branch has been future-proofed and has the founda-
tion in place to continue its positive development.
we will continue to market the bank under two brands using “nordjyske bank” in north 
jutland and “ringkjøbing landbobank” in the rest of denmark. the bank’s branch in 
copenhagen has changed its name and will be branded under the name “ringkjøbing 
landbobank” going forward.
the work of implementing the many strategy update initiatives has been a high priority 
throughout the second to fourth quarters of 2020 and has required management focus.
with the work complete, the full focus in 2021 will be on a concentrated effort in the 
bank’s organic growth strategy.
to ensure that the framework is in place for this growth strategy, the bank’s manage-
ment	has	decided	to	proceed	with	the	plans	of	enlarging	the	head	office	in	ringkøbing	in	
the hope that building work can start during 2021 with commencement of use in 2022.
customer satisfaction and inflow
we are pleased to note that, measured on total customer satisfaction, of which image 
and	reputation	are	parameters,	the	bank	was	high	on	the	list	of	danish	financial	institu-
tions in 2020.
this was established in a voxmeter survey published in january 2021 which places the 
bank among the best measured in terms of total customer satisfaction. the voxmeter 
survey is by far the biggest in denmark and based on more than 60,000 respondents.
the high level of customer satisfaction and the bank’s image and reputation have con-
tributed to the continued highly satisfactory growth in new customers and good reten-
tion of customers in 2020, like in previous years.

the coronavirus pandemic
we see it as an important part of our task, during the coronavirus pandemic, to support 
our customers and business partners. 
since march we have therefore placed a strong emphasis on supporting our customers in 
a	difficult	time.	the	bank	has	carefully	studied	the	aid	packages	that	have	been	launched	
during 2020 and its business banking departments have worked at full capacity. 
business customer advisers have been in contact with the business customers to follow 
up on their circumstances and give them help and advice. the bank has also offered 
personal customers the possibility, at no charge, of deferring installments on loans.
the bank has also supported its suppliers, and local communities and associations, 
partly by paying bills before they fall due and as soon as possible after receiving them, 
and partly by offering clubs and associations sponsored by the bank advances on 
agreed sponsorships. the bank has also renewed a number of sponsorship agreements, 
in some cases without the possibility for the other party to provide an agreed service in 
return. 
in response to appeals from a number of mayors, the bank has also supported the local 
daily and weekly newspapers by placing full-page advertisements in them.
finally, the bank naturally implemented a range of measures to protect its employees 
and lessen the risk of transmission of the virus. 
in	connection	with	the	first	wave	of	coronavirus	in	spring	2020,	redesigned	it	worksta-
tions with video links were thus installed for all the bank’s employees, who were also 
offered training in the use of the microsoft teams application. 
in	addition,	the	layout	of	the	workstations	in	the	bank	has	been	modified	in	the	expecta-
tion that restrictions and recommendations will be in force for an extended period.
most customer meetings were held virtually in the second half of 2020 and employee 
travel activities were very limited throughout the year.
in early january 2021, the danish preparedness level was raised to tier 5 and the restric-
tions introduced in mid-december 2020 were extended. some of the bank’s employees 
are therefore working from home.  
in most cases, the pandemic has not affected our customers and business partners as 
severely as feared at the start of the pandemic. the bank is prepared for operating in a 
changing environment for a long time.
expected results and plans for 2021
core	earnings	were	dkk	1,168	million	and	profit	before	tax	was	dkk	1,144	million.
both realised results are thus at the upper end of the upwardly adjusted ranges of dkk 
1,000-1,150 million and dkk 950-1,150 million respectively for 2020.
2020 has been a historic year when the bank’s customers and employees, and danish 
society as a whole, were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
2020 was also the year when the bank launched a strategy update in the second quarter. 
implementing it has been a high priority since it was launched and the update and imple-
mentation also required great management focus throughout 2020.
pa g e  1 8  
r i n g k j Ø b i n g  l a n d b o b a n k  a / s
the implementation of most of the planned initiatives has been completed. the empha-
sis in 2021 will be on pursuing the bank’s organic growth strategy, under which it wishes 
to provide advice to existing customers on relevant bank products and to attract new 
customers and gain market shares.
from 2020, the bank is carbon neutral. the bank wants to be an active player in a sus-
tainable transition of society and will continue to offer products that further this process 
in the years to come. 
based on the above, the bank’s expectations for 2021 are as follows. 
total core income is expected to develop positively in 2021 as a result of an expected 
continued	inflow	of	customers	and	increase	in	the	business	volume.
a small increase in total expenses is expected in 2021 compared to the expenses in 
2020. the underlying rate of increase for the bank’s cost base is expected to be ap-
proximately	3%	p.a.,	but	the	initiatives	implemented	by	the	bank	in	2020	are	expected	
to neutralise a part of this increase. on this basis, the rate of costs is expected to be 
marginally lower.
impairment charges in 2021 are expected to be at a lower level than in 2020.
on the basis of the above, the bank expects core earnings for 2021 in the range dkk 
1,100-1,300	million	and	profit	before	tax	in	the	range	dkk	1,000-1,300	million.
accounting policies
the bank changed its accounting policies with effect from the beginning of 2020 be-
cause rules in the executive order on financial reports for credit institutions and invest-
ment firms etc., compatible with the provisions of ifrs 16 – leases, entered into force 
on 1 january 2020. 
the changes in the rules and policies mean that the lessee is no longer required to 
distinguish	between	finance	leasing	and	operating	leasing	for	accounting	purposes.	the	
lessee must recognise all leasing contracts, including leases, as lease assets represent-
ing the value of the right-of-use asset. on initial recognition the asset must be measured 
at the present value of the lease liability including costs and any prepayments. the pre-
sent value of the agreed lease payments must be recognised as a liability at the same 
time. assets leased on short-term contracts and low-value asset leases are exempt 
from the requirement for recognition of lease assets. 
the rule and policy changes thus resulted in an increase of dkk 21 million in the bank’s 
tangible	assets	and	debts	on	1	january	2020.	the	effect	on	operations	is	insignificant	
since the bank has only entered into a limited number of leasing agreements/leases, 
mainly for the premises accommodating a few of its branches. 
the accounting policies are otherwise unchanged relative to those in the submitted and 
audited 2019 annual report.
see “accounting policies etc.” in note 1 on page 72 for a detailed description.
events after the reporting period 
no events after 31 december 2020 are judged to have a material impact on the bank’s 
circumstances.

comments on the fourth quarter of 2020
core income
core income of dkk 566 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 is the highest ever realised 
by the bank.
net fee and commission income excluding securities trading increased compared to 
previous	quarters	and	reflect	a	high	level	of	activity	and	a	continued	increase	in	custom-
ers. 
the items “net interest income” and “foreign exchange income” also developed posi-
tively in the fourth quarter of 2020.
expenses 
expenses in the quarter totalled dkk 212 million, which meant that total expenses for 
2020	decreased	by	2%	relative	to	2019.
impairment charges for loans
impairment charges decreased in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the previous 
quarters and amounted to dkk 38 million in the fourth quarter.
the management estimate increased during the fourth quarter of 2020: from dkk 541 
million at the beginning of the quarter to dkk 566 million at the end of the quarter.
result for the portfolio
the result for the portfolio in the fourth quarter was positive by dkk 15 million, thus 
reducing	the	first	quarter’s	negative	result	for	the	portfolio,	similarly	to	the	second	and	
third quarters.

capital structure
profit distribution
the bank’s annual general meeting in march 2020 authorised the board of directors, in 
accordance with applicable law, to permit the bank to acquire its own shares to a total 
nominal	value	of	10%	of	the	bank’s	share	capital.
the board of directors subsequently acted on the authorisation and initiated a share 
buy-back programme of dkk 150 million (of an expected total buy-back programme of 
dkk	300	million	based	on	the	2019	profit)	under	the	safe	harbour	regulation,	for	cancel-
lation at a future general meeting. 
on 30 march 2020, the board of directors decided to suspend the share buy-back 
programme in progress, based on a joint statement of 23 march 2020 made by finance 
denmark and the government in light of the coronavirus outbreak. on 27 march 2020, 
160,600 shares of a total value of dkk 57.5 million had been bought back. following 
publication	of	the	interim	report	for	the	first	half	of	2020	and	the	danish	fsa’s	recom-
mendation of 26 june 2020, the board of directors decided not to buy back further 
shares or pay any dividends until the end of 2020. 
the annual general meeting further decided to cancel 433,475 of the bank's own shares. 
the	capital	reduction	was	finalised	in	may	2020.	
it is proposed to the general meeting in march 2021 that the 160,600 shares bought 
back	in	2020	be	finally	cancelled	in	connection	with	a	capital	reduction,	thus	reducing	
the number of shares in the bank from 29,228,321 to 29,067,721.
the bank’s actual share capital is thus dkk 29,067,721 in nom. dkk 1 shares, see be-
low.

further to the danish fsa’s announcement of 18 december 2020 on capital conserva-
tion, the bank has engaged in dialogue with the fsa regarding capital distribution in 
2021 based on the result for 2020.
based	on	this	dialogue,	the	board	of	directors	proposes	that	50%	of	the	net	profit	for	the	
year be distributed. 
the	board	proposes	a	dividend	of	dkk	7	per	share	for	the	2020	financial	year,	equiva-
lent to a total of dkk 205 million. a dividend of dkk 11 per share was paid for the 2019 
financial	year.
based on the dialogue, the board also intends to initiate a share buy-back programme 
totalling dkk 255 million, with the intention of cancelling the shares bought back under 
the programme at a future general meeting.

a n n u a l  r e p o r t  2 0 2 0

the share buy-back programme is effected in the period from 4 february to 30 july 2021 
provided that the general meeting, as in previous years, authorises the board of directors 
to acquire the bank’s own shares. 
the dkk 255 million share buy-back programme based on the 2020 result must be de-
ducted from the bank’s total capital which, seen in isolation, will mean a total reduction 
of the bank’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio by 0.7 percentage point calculated on 
the basis of the capital structure on 31 december 2020.
capital objectives and pay-out ratios
the management wants the bank’s general capitalisation to be such as will ensure 
sufficient	capital	for	future	growth	and	for	hedging	against	any	fluctuations	in	the	risks	
assumed by the bank.
based on these general objectives, the bank’s management in 2018 announced different 
capital targets. the board of directors has regularly reassessed the capital targets since 
they	were	first	announced.
at	the	beginning	of	2020,	the	countercyclical	capital	buffer	was	1.0%.	notice	had	been	
given during 2019 of additional 0.5 percentage point increases on 30 june 2020 and on 
31	december	2020,	so	that	the	buffer	would	be	2.0%	at	the	end	of	2020.	
the development described above was included in the bank’s capital target for the 
mrel capital ratio at the beginning of 2020. on 12 march 2020, the government re-
leased	the	countercyclical	buffer	in	light	of	the	uncertainties	on	the	financial	markets.	
this was subsequently maintained, most recently in an announcement from the minister 
for industry, business and financial affairs on 17 december 2020. 
after the countercyclical buffer was released, the board reassessed the capital targets 
and at the end of 2020, the capital targets specify that the common equity tier 1 capital 
ratio	must	be	at	least	13.5%,	the	total	capital	ratio	at	least	17%	and	the	mrel	capital	
ratio	for	covering	the	mrel	requirement	and	capital	buffers	at	least	23.5%.	
all	capital	targets	are	minimum	figures	that	must	be	met	at	the	end	of	the	year,	but	there	
may	be	fluctuations	in	the	capital	ratios	over	the	year.	
the	bank’s	long-term	intention	is	to	continue	the	policy	for	profit	distributions	practised	
in recent years. the policy has thus been characterised by stable dividends combined 
with share buy-back to adjust the capital structure regularly to the development in the 
bank’s total risk exposure amount and the bank’s future growth opportunities as envis-
aged by management.
the danish fsa’s announcement means that it is not possible to continue the bank’s 
profit	distribution	policy	with	respect	to	the	capital	distribution	in	2021	based	on	the	
2020 result. 
following the dialogue with the danish fsa, the maximum total capital pay-out ratio 
based	on	the	2020	result	is	50%.

current capital structure
the	bank’s	equity	at	the	beginning	of	2020	was	dkk	7,610	million.	the	profit	for	the	year	
must be added to this, while the dividend paid and the value of the bank’s own shares 
bought must be subtracted. after this, equity at the end of 2020 was dkk 8,146 million. 
in addition to the above, the bank’s capital ratios were affected by a number of circum-
stances during the year.
the bank carried out early redemption: of dkk 275 million of tier 2 capital in february 
2020;	and	of	tier	2	capital	equivalent	to	eur	50	million	in	may	2020.	refinancing	of	these	
two issues was already in place in the third quarter of 2019.
in june 2020, the european parliament adopted various rules on relaxation of capital 
requirements, which are described in detail on page 29.
in	addition,	the	european	parliament	introduced	a	new	five-year	phasing-in	period	for	
the dynamic component of the ifrs 9 transitional rules. this has meant that the bank 
can add back to its capital the difference between its current stage 1 and 2 impairment 
charges and the stage 1 and 2 impairment charges on 1 january 2020. the arrange-
ment’s positive effect on the bank’s capital ratios is therefore only temporary.
the bank thus uses both the static and the dynamic components of the ifrs 9 transi-
tional	rules,	including	the	simplified	approach	to	recalculation	of	capital	requirements.
the new phasing-in rules are also described in detail on page 29.
in addition, a build-up of capital has taken place in 2020 due to the suspended share 
buy-back programme and the lower, expected capital distribution for 2020.
the bank’s tier 1 capital ratio was 17.5 at the end of 2020, and the total capital ratio was 
21.1.

calculated without the above ifrs 9 transition programmes, the bank’s tier 1 capital 
ratio	was	16.0%	and	the	total	capital	ratio	20.1%	on	31	december	2020.
individual solvency requirement and capital buffers
ringkjøbing landbobank also focuses on its internally calculated individual solvency 
requirement,	defined	as	adequate	total	capital	as	a	percentage	of	the	bank’s	total	risk	
exposure amount.
adequate total capital is assessed and calculated, on the basis of an internal calcula-
tion model, as the amount which is appropriate to hedge against the bank’s current and 
future risks.
the bank calculates the individual solvency requirement using the 8+ model. this 
means the calculation method is based on 8 percentage points, plus any supplements 
calculated	for	customers	with	financial	problems,	and	others.	the	8+	model	thus	takes	
no account of the bank’s earnings and cost base and its robust business model.
despite this, the bank’s individual solvency requirement at the end of 2020 was calculat-
ed	at	9.3%,	which	is	unchanged	relative	to	2019.	the	capital	conservation	buffer	of	2.5%	
should	be	added	to	this,	while	the	countercyclical	buffer	is	currently	0%.
the	total	requirement	for	the	bank’s	total	capital	was	thus	11.8%	at	the	end	of	2020.	
compared with the actual total capital of dkk 8.8 billion, the capital buffer at the end of 
2020 was thus dkk 3.9 billion, equivalent to 9.3 percentage points.

for further information on the calculation of ringkjøbing landbobank’s individual 
solvency requirement, please see the bank’s solvency requirement report for the fourth 
quarter of 2020 on the bank’s website at the address: www.landbobanken.dk/solvency.
mrel requirement
in	december	2020,	the	bank	received	an	updated	mrel	requirement	of	17.9%	for	2021	
applicable already from 28 december 2020. in future, the capital buffers are not includ-
ed in the updated mrel requirement (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible 
liabilities which can be used to convert 
debt into share capital/bail-in).
the bank must always meet the current 
mrel requirement.
to comply with the mrel requirement, 
the bank had established funding meet-
ing the requirements for grandfathering 
of contractual senior funding by the end 
of 2017. dkk 1.0 billion of the funding 
could be included to meet the bank’s 
mrel requirement at the end of 2020 
and, in the period december 2018 to 
december 2020, the bank has issued 
non-preferred senior capital totalling 
dkk 1.3 billion.
the	bank’s	mrel	capital	ratio	was	26.7%	
at the end of 2020, which thus met both 
the mrel requirement at the end of 
2020	and	the	target	fixed	for	the	mrel	
capital ratio.
the excess cover for the mrel requirement at the end of 2020 was thus 8.8 percentage 
points.
the release of the countercyclical capital buffer in 2020, the subsequent adjustment 
of the bank’s target mrel capital ratio and the permanent positive effects on capital in 
2020 mean that the bank no longer requires the previously announced sum of approxi-
mately	dkk	750	million	per	year	to	finance	the	non-preferred	senior	capital	in	2020	and	
2021.	the	bank	is	also	not	expected	to	require	financing	for	non-preferred	senior	capital	
in 2022. despite this, the bank expects to make minor issues both in 2021 and 2022. 
the bank can issue non-preferred senior capital under its emtn programme, which 
gives	the	bank	a	high	degree	of	flexibility.

capital adequacy rules
the bank uses the following methods for the calculation of its total risk exposure 
amount as provided by the crd iv rules:
calculation of capital adequacy – methods used
• credit risk outside the trading portfolio 
standardised approach
• counterparty risk 
mark-to-market method
•	 credit	risk	reducing	method	–	financial	collateral	
comprehensive	method
• market risk 
standardised approach
• operational risk 
basic indicator method
as evident from the above, the bank uses the standardised method for calculation of 
its	credit	risk	and	thereby	the	total	risk	exposure	amount.	this	approach	uses	fixed	risk	
weightings.
the method means that the bank does not apply the same down-weighting of risks as 
those banks which apply one of the advanced methods.
on the other hand, the bank does not experience increasing risk weightings in periods 
of recession. relative to the advanced methods, use of the standardised method means 
that	there	is	significantly	greater	robustness	in	the	calculated	capital	ratios	and	less	
volatility in the total risk exposure amount.
as mentioned on page 26, various initiatives relaxing the capital requirements were 
introduced with effect from the end of june 2020.
in june 2020, the european parliament adopted amendments to the crr and crr ii 
regulations known as the “crr quick fix”, which were implemented at the end of june 
2020.	this	has	greatly	influenced	the	bank’s	capital	structure	in	2020.
a permanent change of the sme discount for the calculation of credit risk in accordance 
with the standardised method for smes has also positively affected the bank’s credit 
risk	exposure	since	the	end	of	june	2020.	the	sme	discount	was	previously	23.89%	of	
exposures	not	exceeding	eur	1.5	million.	the	discount	is	now	23.89%	for	the	part	of	the	
exposure	that	is	less	than	eur	2.5	million,	and	a	15%	discount	was	also	introduced	for	
the part of the exposure that exceeds eur 2.5 million.
in	addition,	a	new	five-year	phasing-in	period	for	the	dynamic	component	of	the	ifrs	9	
transitional rules was introduced. this has meant that the bank can add back to its capi-
tal the difference between its current stage 1 and 2 impairment charges and the stage 1 
and 2 impairment charges on 1 january 2020. 
provided the stage 1 and 2 impairment charges have increased since 1 january 2020, 
the bank can thus add back the increase in impairment charges less the effect on tax. 
the	add-back	is	100%	for	2020,	100%	for	2021,	75%	for	2022,	50%	for	2023,	25%	for	
2024	and	0%	for	2025.	the	arrangement’s	positive	effect	on	the	bank’s	capital	ratios	is	
therefore only temporary. 
the bank thus uses both the static and the dynamic components of the ifrs 9 transi-
tional	rules,	including	the	simplified	approach	to	recalculation	of	capital	requirements.

capital structure
in addition, in june 2020, the danish fsa terminated the possibility of down-weighting

risks and risk management
ringkjøbing	landbobank	is	exposed	to	various	financial	risks	in	its	operations,	includ-
ing	credit	risks,	market	risks	and	liquidity	risks.	there	are	also	a	number	of	non-financial	
risks,	including	the	risks	of	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism,	it	risk	and	
other operational risks.
the	credit	risk	is	defined	as	the	risk	that	payment	obligations	to	the	bank	have	to	be	
rated non-recoverable because the debtor is either unable or unwilling to pay at the 
agreed time.
the	market	risk	is	defined	as	the	risk	that	the	market	value	of	the	bank’s	assets	and	
liabilities	will	change	as	a	result	of	fluctuations	in	market	conditions.	the	bank’s	total	
market risk comprises interest rate risks, foreign currency risks, share price risks and 
property risks.
the	liquidity	risk	is	defined	as	the	risk	that	the	bank’s	cash	resources	prevent	it	from	
honouring its obligations.
the	non-financial	risk	of	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism	is	defined	as	the	
inherent	risk	that	the	bank	may	be	abused	for	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terror-
ism.	another	non-financial	risk	is	the	risk	of	non-compliance	with	financial	sanctions.
the	it	risk	is	defined	as	risks	associated	with	the	bank’s	systems	and	data,	the	integra-
tion and adequacy of the bank’s it systems, dependence on external factors, including 
subsuppliers, and with it risks associated with the bank’s organisation, including inef-
fective separation of functions.
other	operational	risks	are	those	entailing	other	direct	or	indirect	financial	losses	as	a	
result	of	flaws	in	internal	processes	and	systems,	human	error	or	external	events.
policies on risk-taking and management
the framework for the bank’s risk-taking is established by the board of directors, which 
has	adopted	a	policy	for	each	individual	risk	area	which	includes	a	definition	of	the	
bank’s	risk	profile	in	the	area.	the	board	reviews	and	reassesses	each	policy	at	least	
once a year in connection with its position on the bank’s general business model and 
risk	profile.
the bank’s general principle for risk-taking is only to take risks within a moderate risk 
profile	which	it	has	the	expertise	to	manage.
the board of directors’ review of the bank’s business model and associated policies 
for each individual risk area is based on various risk reports which are supplied to the 
board. 
the reports describe the various risks to which the bank is exposed, and give the board 
a	complete	picture	of	the	bank’s	general	risk	profile.	in	line	with	the	market	possibilities,	
the	board	then	assesses	whether	to	adjust	the	bank’s	business	model	and	risk	profile.	
the reports also act as a basis for a possible decision on adaptation of the policies in 
the various risk areas.
 
risks and risk management
pa g e  3 2  
r i n g k j Ø b i n g  l a n d b o b a n k  a / s
apart from the strategic risk management, there is ongoing central operational manage-
ment and monitoring of the bank’s risks in each area. this monitoring is reported to the 
bank’s general management and board of directors. the management function and the 
control and reporting functions are separate, and the work is performed by different 
central staff functions in the bank. 
the bank’s risk manager ensures full reporting of risks which provides a meaningful 
picture of the bank’s actual risk taking. in this context, the risk manager prepares a risk 
management report to the board of directors' risk committee.
the various types of risk are described in more detail below.
credit risks
credit risks on loans
over the years, ringkjøbing landbobank has developed to its present status as primar-
ily a local bank in west, central and north jutland while also operating within selected 
niches.
this development has been a part of the bank’s strategy, and the management notes 
with	satisfaction	that	the	bank	has	achieved	a	significant	loan	portfolio	diversified	
across industries, geographical areas and otherwise.
in general, ringkjøbing landbobank assumes credit risks on the basis of policy objec-
tives of striking the right balance between assumed risks and return gained by the bank 
and	keeping	the	bank’s	losses	below	the	level	of	losses	in	the	danish	financial	sector.
historically, ringkjøbing landbobank has always operated a sound credit policy, and its 
focus	will	remain	on	ensuring	efficient	management	and	monitoring	of	its	total	portfolio	
of loans via its central credit function.
the central credit function regularly reviews and follows up all large exposures. apart 
from this routine credit monitoring and management, the bank has developed a set of 
credit evaluation models which are used to assess the quality of the credit exposure. 
the models take various factors into account.
the personal customer models (for personal and small business customers) are based 
on information on the customer’s assets, debt gearing and disposable amount as well 
as a range of behavioural data.
the models for major business customers are based on information on the customer’s 
financial	standing	and	earning	capacity.
using these models, the bank’s judgment is that the credit quality for those of the bank’s 
loans and guarantees which have not been impaired has deteriorated marginally relative 
to the previous year. 
this	generally	reflects	a	continued	sound	danish	economy	with	low	unemployment	and	
continued favourable conditions for the bank’s niches. the coronavirus is a challenge 
to some industries, and although the bank is not severely exposed to particularly vulner-
able industries, the result is marginal deterioration of the bank’s credit quality. we refer 
to note 48 on page 98.

unutilised credit facilities and loan undertakings.
explanation: the percentage losses are computed as the actual net losses for the year before and after interest on the im-
paired part of loans as a percentage of total loans, guarantees, impairments for loans and provisions for guarantees. a minus 
in front of a percentage loss indicates a loss, while a positive percentage loss means that the interest on the impaired part of 
loans	was	greater	than	the	actual	net	losses	for	the	year.	all	the	above	figures	are	computed	exclusive	of	amounts	concerning	
reverse repo transactions and the national bank package i etc.
the 10-year average and the 34-year average are calculated as simple averages.
supplementary comments on actual net losses in 2018, 2019 and 2020: in connection with the merger in 2018, the two banks’ 
impairment policies for losses were harmonised. in 2018 this resulted in full and partial impairment losses on exposures 
taken over from nordjyske bank. this harmonisation continued to a lesser extent in 2019 and partly in 2020.
the above table documents the bank’s track record of sound credit policy. the local sec-
tion of the bank is run partly via branches in the bank’s core areas in west, central and 
north jutland.
the most important areas within the bank’s niche are a private banking concept cover-

credit risks on financial counterparties
exposure	to	financial	counterparties,	and	consequently	a	credit	risk,	including	a	settle-
ment risk, arises from the bank’s trading in securities, foreign currency and derivative 
financial	instruments,	its	loans	to	other	banks,	and	its	possession	of	bonds	and	payment	
handling.
the settlement risk is the risk that the bank will not receive payment or securities cor-
responding to the securities and/or payments which it had made and delivered in the 
context of trades in securities and/or currency.
the	bank’s	board	of	directors	grants	lines	for	credit	risks	and	settlement	risks	on	finan-
cial counterparties. when granting lines, account is taken of the individual counterparty’s 
risk	profile,	any	rating,	size,	and	financial	circumstances,	and	there	is	continuous	follow-
up of the lines which are granted. the bank also mitigates its settlement risk concerning 
clearing of foreign exchange via its membership of a clearing partnership (referred to as 
the cls partnership).
the bank has also entered into a number of csa agreements in connection with isda 
agreements which had been signed. the csa agreements contribute to reducing the 
credit	risk	for	either	the	bank	or	the	financial	counterparties	in	derivatives	contracts.	
whether	it	is	the	bank	or	the	financial	counterparty	(with	whom	the	individual	derivatives	
contract was signed) which is hedged depends on the market value of the derivatives in 
question.
the	bank’s	policy	is	to	keep	the	credit	risk	exposure	to	financial	counterparties	at	a	bal-
anced level relative to the bank’s size, and limit it to credit institutions with good credit 
quality.
receivables from central banks and credit institutions
one	of	the	major	items	of	credit	risk	exposure	to	financial	counterparties	is	receivables	
from central banks and credit institutions. the bank has assumed only a moderate risk 
on	this	item	and,	of	the	total	receivables	from	central	banks	and	credit	institutions,	99%	
is thus due within three months.
the bond portfolio
the	bank’s	bond	portfolio	is	another	major	item	involving	credit	risk	exposure	to	finan-
cial counterparties.
the majority of the bond portfolio consists of aaa-rated danish government and mort-
gage credit bonds. to this should be added a portfolio of corporate bonds etc. the cre-
dit quality of the bonds in the portfolio of corporate bonds etc. is good, but their market 
value can vary over time in connection with general changes in credit spreads in the 
market,	and	company-specific	circumstances	can	also	affect	the	value	of	these	bonds.

r i n g k j Ø b i n g  l a n d b o b a n k  a / s
market risks
the bank’s basic policy is to keep total market risks at a moderate level.
the bank has determined a concrete framework for each type of market risk, and the 
risk assessment includes the objective of a sensible and balanced relationship between 
risk and return.
the bank uses derivatives to hedge and manage the various market risk types if it 
wishes to reduce or eliminate the market risks which it has assumed. the bank has a 
mathematical/statistical model to compute market risks, in addition to more traditional 
methods. the model is used to compute value at risk (var), which is regularly reported 
to the bank’s management.
var is a measure of risk which describes the bank’s risk under normal market condi-
tions.
a separate var is calculated for interest rate, foreign exchange and listed share posi-
tions etc., and a total var is also calculated for all of the bank’s market risks consisting 
of interest rate, foreign exchange and listed share positions etc. this possibility of calcu-
lating a var for the bank’s market risks is one of the major advantages of the var model 
over more traditional measures of risk. the reader is referred to the section “value at 
risk”	below	for	the	specific	results	etc.	under	the	var	model.

a n n u a l  r e p o r t  2 0 2 0

interest rate risks
the bank’s lending and deposit activities and accounts with credit institutions are 
mostly	based	on	a	floating	rate.	however,	the	bank	also	has	certain	fixed-rate	financial	
assets and liabilities which are monitored continuously, and hedging transactions are 
entered into as needed, with a consequent reduction of the interest rate risk.
ringkjøbing landbobank’s policy is to maintain a moderate interest rate risk, so it does 
not assume high levels of exposure to movements in interest rates.
the bank’s securities department monitors and manages its interest rate risk daily. the 
bank’s accounts department checks that the limits for assumption of interest rate risk 
are observed, and reports to the bank’s board of directors and general management.
as	the	figure	shows,	the	bank	has	had	a	moderate	interest	rate	risk	over	the	last	five	
years, in accordance with its policy for this type of risk.
foreign exchange risks
the bank’s principal currency is the danish krone, but it has also entered into lending 
and deposit activities, owns securities, and has issued bonds and raised loans in other 
currencies.
the bank’s policy is to maintain a low foreign exchange risk, and the bank thus reduces 
ongoing positions in foreign currencies via hedging.
the bank’s foreign department manages its positions in foreign exchange daily, while 
the accounts department monitors compliance with limits and reports to the board of 
directors and general management.
as	in	previous	years,	the	bank’s	foreign	exchange	risk	in	2020	was	at	an	insignificant	
level.

share exposure
share price risks
the bank is co-owner of various sector companies via equity interests in bankinvest 
holding a/s, bokis a/s, dlr kredit a/s, letpension holding a/s, pras a/s and others. 
these holdings are comparable with the wholly owned subsidiaries of major banks, and 
the equity interests are thus not deemed to be a part of the bank’s share price risk. the 
bank also holds a small portfolio of listed shares etc.
the holding of shares etc. amounted to dkk 1,386 million at the end of the year, with 
dkk	40	million	in	listed	shares	and	investment	fund	certificates	and	dkk	1,346	million	in	
sector shares etc.
the bank’s policy is to maintain a moderate share price risk. the securities department 
undertakes the daily management of the bank’s share portfolio, while the accounts de-
partment monitors limits and reports to general management and the board of directors.
as	is	evident	from	the	figure	below,	the	bank’s	exposure	to	shares	(excluding	sector	and	
bond-based	investment	fund	certificates	etc.)	as	a	percentage	of	the	bank’s	equity	has	
been	in	accordance	with	the	bank’s	policy	for	this	type	of	risk	over	the	last	five	years.	
this documents the bank’s efforts to achieve its goal of maintaining a moderate risk on 
share prices.
property risks
the bank primarily intends to possess only properties for use in banking operations, and 
also to maintain low property risks.
the bank’s portfolio mainly consists of domicile properties to which investment proper-
ties should be added that are relatively modest relative to both the bank’s balance sheet

value at risk
the bank’s total var was dkk 13.7 million at the end of 2020. this sum is an expression 
of the maximum loss in a statistical perspective which the bank could risk losing with 
99%	probability	if	all	market	positions	were	retained	unchanged	for	a	period	of	ten	days.

* determined by the total var figure.
in	the	first	quarter	of	2020,	the	extraordinary	market	situation	arising	from	the	coronavi-
rus pandemic in march 2020 resulted in capital losses which lay outside the framework 
of	fluctuations	applied	by	the	bank’s	value	at	risk	model	with	99%	probability.	
this was not unnatural in a situation where market volatility exceeded historical market 
dynamics. the increased volatility has subsequently become part of the model’s under-
lying data.
as indicated in the table, the bank’s total var throughout 2020 varied from dkk 7.1 mil-
lion	to	dkk	21.1	million.	the	average	var	figure	was	dkk	14.9	million,	the	same	level	as	
2019.
see	note	51	on	page	108	for	the	development	in	var	figures	for	the	years	2016-2020.
the model in brief
the model is a parametric var model based on a historical analysis of the covariance 
(correlations)	between	the	prices	of	various	financial	assets	etc.,	including	differ-
ent	share	indices,	various	official	interest	rates	and	interest	swap	rates,	and	different	
exchange rate indices. by combining historical knowledge of the covariance on the 
financial	markets	with	the	bank’s	current	positions,	the	model	can	calculate	a	risk	of	
losses for a forthcoming ten-day period. all of the bank’s interest rate, foreign currency 
and listed share positions etc. are included in the calculation, while positions in sector 
shares are not included. the model does not take account of credit spread risks on the 
bank’s bond portfolio. as stated, the model’s underlying date was calibrated during the 
year, but the model’s method is unchanged compared to last year.
back tests and stress tests
 “back tests” are made to document that the var model provides a sensible picture of 
the bank’s risk. the test compares the calculated loss under the model with the losses 
which the bank would actually have suffered if the positions in question had been re-
tained for a ten-day period. a number of stress tests are also carried out to indicate the 
bank’s risk of loss in abnormal market situations. back tests of the model were per-
formed throughout the year with satisfactory results.

liquidity risks
it is the bank’s objective that the budgeted liquidity should meet the current lcr require-
ment	for	a	period	of	at	least	12	months.	the	bank	seeks	to	maintain	sufficient	liquidity	
for a stress scenario by means of recovery plans for a period of at least 12 months.
in terms of liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), the bank must comply with the statutory re-
quirement	of	at	least	100%.
this key ratio expresses the ability of banks to honour their payment obligations for a 
30-day	period	without	access	to	market	funds.	the	lcr	figure	is	computed	as	the	ratio	
of the bank’s cash and cash equivalents/liquid assets to its payment obligations for the 
next	30	days	as	computed	in	accordance	with	specific	rules.
on	31	december	2020	the	bank’s	lcr	was	206%,	which	thus	met	the	statutory	require-
ment by a good margin.
in	addition	to	the	lcr	figure,	a	liquidity	benchmark	also	applies	to	the	bank	as	men-
tioned in the section “the supervisory diamond”. the liquidity benchmark is based on a 
projected version of the lcr requirement. the projection is made on a stressed three-
month	basis	instead	of	the	30	days	used	for	the	lcr	figure,	but	the	basis	of	calculation	
is	more	relaxed	for	some	of	the	components	in	the	calculation.	the	bank’s	key	figure	for	
the	liquidity	benchmark	was	178%	on	31	december	2020,	compared	to	a	limit	value	of	
100%.	the	bank	thus	also	met	this	requirement	by	a	good	margin.
the bank’s assets and thus its loans portfolio are funded from a range of sources, 
primarily the bank’s deposits, but also by joint funding (bond issuance) of the bank’s 
home loans, by taking out longer-term loans with other credit institutions, issuing both 
preferred	and	non-preferred	senior	capital	and	finally	via	the	tier	2	capital	issued	by	the	
bank and its equity.
the bank’s deposit base consists of core deposits and deposits from customers with 
a long-term relationship with the bank. ringkjøbing landbobank has also entered into 
longer-term bilateral loan agreements with various european business partners.
the composition of the bank’s funding situation does not leave the bank dependent on 
individual business partners.
to	ensure	diversification	in	funding,	the	bank	also	has	an	emtn	bond	programme	of	
eur 2 billion. the programme helps to ensure alternative funding sources for the bank. 
funds were also raised under the programme in 2020.
the	bank	issued	non-preferred	senior	capital	for	the	first	time	in	2018.	in	the	period	
from december 2018 to december 2020, the bank issued non-preferred senior capital 
totalling dkk 1.3 billion. in addition, the bank has historically also used the emtn bond 
programme to issue both ordinary senior capital and tier 2 capital.
the bank also has a joint funding agreement with totalkredit/nykredit. the agreement 
means that the bank can procure liquidity by letting totalkredit/nykredit issue sdo 
bonds against security in the loans which the bank has provided to customers with 
security in real property.

as evident from the above, the short-term funding (time to maturity less than one year) 
is supported via the bank’s cash in hand and demand deposits with danmarks nation-

risks and risk management
operational risks (non-financial risks)
operational risks
operational	risks	are	those	entailing	other	direct	or	indirect	financial	losses	as	a	result	
of	flaws	in	internal	processes	and	systems,	human	error	or	external	events.
the bank regularly produces reports on the losses and events which are attributed to 
operational risks. 
based on these reports, an assessment is made whether procedures etc. can be adjust-
ed and improved in order to avoid or minimise any operational risks. the bank’s proce-
dures are regularly reviewed and assessed by the bank’s internal and external auditors. 
in addition, the bank conducts thematic reviews of selected business areas, identifying 
and assessing the potential risk scenarios for each area and subsequently adjusting the 
bank’s procedures etc. accordingly.
combating money laundering etc.
an	important	area	under	non-financial	risks	is	the	risk	that	the	bank	could	be	abused	for	
money	laundering	or	financing	of	terrorism.	
the	bank	wants	to	contribute	to	combating	any	form	of	money	laundering	and	financing	
of terrorism etc.
the bank is required to maintain high standards for combating money laundering and 
financing	of	terrorism	and	to	monitor	and	comply	with	financial	sanctions.	this	role	is	an	
important part of banking in a globalised world.
the bank has implemented internal procedures, controls, monitoring etc. to help comply 
with applicable rules in the area. the bank also regularly provides in-service training in 
combating	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism	for	its	employees.	further	refer-
ence is made to page 48.
it risks
it supports a large part of the systems and tools used by both the bank’s customers and 
its employees. it security is therefore an important element in the assessment of the 
bank’s operational risks.
the bank’s board of directors sets and formulates the requirements regarding the bank’s 
it risks in the it risk management policy and the it security policy. these two policies 
form the basis for the bank’s work with it risks.
part of the work with it risks and their management is an annual risk analysis. the 
analysis assesses different it risk scenarios for the bank’s different systems and the 
probability and consequences of the different scenarios – before and after mitigating 
measures.
the risk analysis is expressed as a risk score for each individual system. requirements 
for	the	confidentiality,	availability	and	integrity	of	the	bank’s	systems	are	also	assessed	
annually.
based on the above, the board of directors annually updates and approves the two poli-
cies.

in addition to addressing it risk management risks and it security risks, the bank’s it 
organisation and management also regularly decide on the it preparedness plans made.
preparedness exercises are carried out regularly to ensure that the bank is able to 
handle events that may arise.
the bank’s it risk management policy, it security policy and it preparedness plans  
apply to all aspects of its use of it, including it that is fully or partly outsourced. 
these requirements apply to the bank’s internal it organisation as well as its primary ex-
ternal it supplier bankdata, which the bank owns together with a number of other banks, 
and jn data which is a supplier to bankdata and responsible for the daily operations.
quantification of operational risks in the statement of capital
the capital adequacy rules require the banks to quantify and recognise an amount for 
operational risks when computing their capital adequacy.
the bank uses the basic indicator method which bases the calculation on an average of 
the	most	recent	three	financial	years’	net	incomes.	a	sum	is	then	quantified	and	added	
to the total risk exposure to cover the bank’s operational risks.
further information on the bank’s risks
danish banks are required by law to disclose information on risk. this annual report 
gives some of the required risk information but, for a more detailed overview of the 
bank’s disclosure requirement, the reader is referred to the bank’s website at the ad-
dress: www.landbobanken.dk/risk-information.

statement on corporate governance
goal
ringkjøbing landbobank has set a goal for corporate governance which focuses on the 
bank’s primary stakeholders, namely its shareholders, customers, employees, and the 
local areas where the bank operates.
the bank’s goals are to realise good long-term results and thus the best possible long-
term returns for its owners, the shareholders, and to achieve an annual return on equity 
among	the	top	one-third	of	the	danish	financial	sector,	via	rational	operation	of	the	bank	
and sound credit policy.
for its customers, the bank’s goal is to play a central role in west, central and north 
jutland, of which it is an integral part. the bank’s goal is thus to retain and further de-
velop that segment of its customer portfolio which is located in west, central and north 
jutland.
it also seeks to serve selected customer groups throughout denmark via the bank’s 
niche concepts and its private banking branches, offering a high level of expertise and 
competitive products.
in general, the bank will thus meet the expectations of a full-service bank for personal 
and business customers via its strengths in both capital and consultancy.
it is also a goal for ringkjøbing landbobank to be a good and attractive place to work 
for its employees. on the basis of its chosen strategy, the bank wishes to create an in-
teresting and challenging workplace which can attract and retain competent employees.
finally, the bank’s goal is to support development in those areas where it is rooted  
historically.
codes of management etc.
as	a	listed	financial	institution	and	member	of	finance	denmark,	the	bank	is	covered	by	
various codes.
being listed on the nasdaq copenhagen, the bank is covered by the recommendations 
on corporate governance issued by the committee on corporate governance, and as a 
member of finance denmark, by the corporate governance code of the danish bankers 
association.
the recommendations on corporate governance
corporate governance in ringkjøbing landbobank concerns the objectives, general prin-
ciples and structures governing the bank and the interplay between the bank, its  
management and its primary stakeholders: shareholders, customers and employees,  
and the local areas in which it has branches.
since 2002, the management has pursued an active approach to the recommendations 
issued on corporate governance. the bank’s position on corporate governance has been 
recorded in the annual reports since 2002.
the committee on corporate governance issued the edition of the recommendations 
applicable to the 2020 annual report in november 2017, and it contains 47 recommen-
dations.

the recommendations are drawn up, as far as possible, not to reproduce parts that ap-
pear directly in legislation or are already largely incorporated into corporate practice.
when preparing the 2020 annual report, under the “comply or explain” principle, the 
bank’s board of directors and general management have re-assessed the bank’s posi-
tions and actions on the recommendations.
the bank’s management supports the efforts in the area of corporate governance, and 
the general management and board of directors have adopted almost all of the recom-
mendations in this area. in a small number of areas, the bank’s management has, how-
ever, elected either not to follow the recommendations or to follow them only in part. 
the bank follows 42 of the total of 47 recommendations.
on 2 december 2020, the committee on corporate governance adopted and published 
updated	recommendations	on	corporate	governance	applicable	to	financial	years	com-
mencing on or after 1 january 2021. the bank’s management will later specify how it 
will	act	on	the	updated	recommendations	regarding	the	2021	financial	year.	
finance denmark’s corporate governance code
in 2013, the then danish bankers association (now finance denmark) published a cor-
porate governance code.
the code recommends finance denmark’s member companies give active consider-
ation to a number of managerial matters, and make their management frameworks 
more transparent.
on the “comply or explain” principle, the member companies of finance denmark must 
specify how they view the corporate governance code in connection with the presenta-
tion of their annual reports.
when preparing the 2020 annual report, the bank’s board of directors and general 
management	also	specified	how	they	viewed	finance	denmark’s	corporate	governance	
code.
the bank’s management also supports finance denmark's corporate governance code, 
and board of directors and general management have thus elected to follow all 12 rec-
ommendations.
stewardship
the stewardship code from 2016 published by the committee on corporate governance 
has been phased out. a provision on a stewardship policy has instead been implement-
ed in section 101a of the danish financial business act. under the provision, a stew-
ardship policy must either be prepared or an explanation given for why a policy has not 
been prepared.
the bank’s board of directors and general management assess that a stewardship 
policy is not necessary since the bank only has a very modest holding of listed shares 
and, in the role of asset manager, has not explicitly agreed with its customers that it 
must exercise stewardship, for example by exercising the voting rights pertaining to 
investments in listed shares.

the bank’s financial reporting process, management organs and their functions
the board of directors, the board’s audit committee and the general management 
regularly satisfy themselves that the bank’s controls and risk management in connection 
with	the	financial	reporting	process	are	functioning	satisfactorily.
the process is designed to ensure that the annual report is presented in accordance 
with statutory requirements and is free of material misstatement attributable to fraud or 
error.
the	financial	reporting	process	is	further	organised	so	that	the	bank’s	accounts	depart-
ment prepares its annual report in cooperation with the general management and other 
relevant departments.
a	general	rule	for	the	financial	reporting	process	is	that	the	bank’s	general	management	
and accounts department continuously monitor compliance with relevant legislation and 
other	regulations	and	provisions	in	connection	with	the	financial	reporting	process	and	
report regularly to the bank’s board of directors and the audit committee.
the complete statement on corporate governance describes in detail matters including 
processes, internal systems, recognition and measurement, the control environment, 
risk assessment, control activities, monitoring and reporting.
the statement also describes the bank’s management organs and their functions in detail.

diversity in the board of directors
the bank has a policy for diversity on the board of directors. the board of directors and 
its nomination committee assessed the policy in december 2020 and found no need for 
changes.
the intention of this policy is that the board’s composition should embrace diverse com-
petencies and backgrounds, including differences in professional identity, work experi-
ence, gender, age, etc.
the policy further lays down that recruitment of candidates for the board of directors 
must focus on ensuring that the candidates possess different competencies, back-
grounds, knowledge and resources which match the bank’s business model etc.
compliance with the adopted policy on diversity on the board of directors was assessed 
by the nomination committee and the board of directors during the annual evaluation 
process.
the	board	of	directors’	assessment	on	this	basis	confirms	compliance,	through	focus	
on the policy criteria in the recruitment process for candidates both for the board of 
directors and the shareholders’ committee, and otherwise. the reason for focusing on 
these criteria when recruiting candidates for the shareholders’ committee is that the 
shareholders’ committee elects the bank’s board of directors, and seven of the current 
eight board members, elected by the shareholders’ committee, came from the member-
ship of the shareholders’ committee, while only one board member (who has managerial 
corporate governance etc.

experience	from	another	financial	undertaking)	was	not	elected	from	the	membership	of	
the shareholders’ committee.
the under-represented gender
the	bank	has	a	target	figure	for	the	percentage	of	the	under-represented	gender	to	sit	
on the board of directors and a policy aimed at increasing the percentage of the under-
represented gender at the bank’s other management levels.
the board of directors and its nomination committee assessed the need to change the 
target	figure	and/or	the	policy	in	november	2020	and	identified	a	need	for	various	lin-
guistic	adjustments	to	the	policy	and	a	specification	of	the	target	figure	for	the	propor-
tion of the under-represented gender on the bank’s board of directors.
the	policy	specifies	that	the	target	figure	for	the	proportion	of	board	members	of	the	
under-represented	gender	should	be	at	least	16.7%	(provided	that	the	number	of	board	
members is twelve).
figures on the date of closing the accounts were:
•	
16.7%	women
•	
83.3%	men
the bank thus meets the target.
the policy adopted to increase the percentage of the under-represented gender at the 
bank’s other management levels aims at creating a basis for a more equal gender distri-
bution at these management levels.
it is the bank’s overall and long-term aim to provide a more equal gender distribution at 
the bank’s other management levels. the bank wants to be able to follow up on develop-
ments with respect to gender distribution at other management levels and to adjust the 
effort continually in relation to the target.
based	on	these	wishes,	the	bank	has	set	the	following	specific	targets	for	the	under-
represented gender at the bank’s other management levels:
• 
 the employees must feel that they have equal career and management opportuni-
ties, irrespective of gender.
• 
the	percentage	of	managers	from	the	under-represented	gender	must	be	at	least	20%.	
at the end of 2020, the gender distribution at the bank’s other management levels was 
as follows:
•	
26.1%	women
•	
73.9%	men
the distribution thus meets the target. 
in future recruitment processes for management positions, the bank will take its policy 
and	the	above	targets	etc.	into	consideration	but	will	always	appoint	the	best	qualified,	
irrespective of gender.
in accordance with section 135a of the executive order on financial reports for credit 
institutions and investment firms etc., the statutory complete statement on the under-
represented gender is available on the bank’s website at the address:

combating money laundering and financing of terrorism
at its annual meeting in 2018, finance denmark appointed an anti-money launder-
ing task force. in november 2019, the anti-money laundering task force published a 
report containing 25 recommendations for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist 
financing	measures	aimed	at	various	stakeholders	including	authorities,	the	banking	
sector in general and the individual banks.
the bank’s board of directors endorsed the 25 recommendations in 2020. 
one of the 25 recommendations is that the banks dedicate a page on their websites 
to targeted and publicly available information about their anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorist	financing	efforts.	
the bank has complied with this recommendation in 2020 and created such a web 
page. the page is available at the bank's web address: 
www.landbobanken.dk/antimoneylaundering.
another of the 25 recommendations is that the individual banks undertake to outline 
their	commitment	to	action	against	money	laundering	and	terrorist	financing,	including	
their anti-money laundering policy, in the management’s review section of their annual 
reports.
the bank also wants to comply with this recommendation and details of how ring-
kjøbing	landbobank	combats	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism	is	given	
below in this management's review.
combating	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism	in	ringkjøbing	landbobank	is	
generally a task for all employees, not least because the bank has a statutory obligation 
to know all its customers and the nature of their transactions. this task is carried out by 
collecting data, primarily by the individual customer advisers.
in addition, all employees have a right and duty to report unusual and/or suspicious 
activities or transactions to the bank’s central anti-money laundering department.
the	applicable	procedures	for	combating	money	laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism	
are available to the employees on the bank’s intranet.
the bank’s employees regularly receive training and are tested in combating money 
laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism.	training	follows	a	two-year	cycle	to	keep	the	cur-
rent employees up to date on new rules and on new methods and tools implemented by 
the bank and to familiarise new employees with the subject. 
the bank’s central anti-money laundering department is in charge of the overall anti-
money-laundering	and	counter-terrorist	financing	commitment	and	supports	the	employ-
ees’ effort.
the anti-money laundering department continuously monitors suspicious transactions 
and	reports	any	such	transactions	to	the	anti-money	laundering	secretariat	at	the	office	
of the state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime. the department 
works continuously to set up and adjust the criteria for identifying transactions that are 
picked out for further investigation by the department.
in addition, the department continuously checks that the necessary information on the 
individual customers’ identity and ownership are registered. it also checks that the pur-
pose and scope of the customers’ relationship with the bank are registered and updated.

in december 2019, the danish fsa conducted a functional inspection of ringkjøbing 
landbobank’s anti-money laundering area. the outcome of the inspection was three 
orders in september 2020 regarding improvement of the bank’s policy in the area and 
certain	routines	and	procedures.	the	bank	is	satisfied	with	the	danish	fsa’s	inspection	
and the outcome and has in autumn 2020 implemented the improvements ordered.
communication with stakeholders
the bank also places great emphasis on communication with its stakeholders. it has 
always been a priority to the bank that its advisers and other staff must be available to 
both customers and other stakeholders. this will remain a top priority going forward. 
the bank also gives high priority to having a website and a web and mobile banking 
platform which are accessible, easy to understand and can be used in the bank's com-
munication with its customers and other stakeholders.
the bank has prepared an investor relations policy dealing with the bank's information 
to, and communication with, investors and other stakeholders. a code of conduct has 
also been prepared which includes general guidelines for the bank's interaction with its 
stakeholders.
investor relations policy
the bank's investor relations policy states among other things that the bank must strive 
for openness and for good dialogue with its shareholders, investors and other stake-
holders.
the bank's goal is thus to give
• the stock exchanges on which the bank has listed issues
• existing and potential shareholders and investors
• share analysts and securities brokers and
• other stakeholders
quick	information	which	gives	a	true	and	fair	view	of	both	price-related	and	other	signifi-
cant matters.
the board of directors assessed the policy in november 2020 and found that a few 
adjustments were needed.
the investor relations policy is available at the bank's website at the address:  
www.landbobanken.dk/policies.
code of conduct
in	december	2014,	the	bank’s	board	of	directors	for	the	first	time	adopted	a	code	of	
conduct which establishes guidelines for the bank’s employees (including the bank's 
board of directors and general management) concerning the conduct expected of them 
towards stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers and authorities.
the board of directors adopted an update to the code of conduct in november 2020. in 
connection	with	the	annual	assessment	of	the	need	for	updates,	various	clarifications

remuneration
remuneration policy
in	2012	the	bank’s	board	of	directors	for	the	first	time	adopted	a	remuneration	policy	
which was subsequently approved by the annual general meeting in 2013.
the board of directors and the board’s remuneration committee have subsequently 
reviewed the remuneration policy each year to assess any need for updating. if changes 
have been adopted, the updated remuneration policy has been submitted to the bank’s 
annual general meeting for approval.
the current policy from 2020, which was approved by the bank’s annual general meet-
ing	held	on	4	march	2020,	specifies	that	the	bank’s	management	is	paid	remuneration	
which	is	both	in	line	with	the	market	and	reflects	the	management’s	performance	on	
behalf of the bank.
it	also	specifies	that	the	remuneration	paid	to	the	board	of	directors	and	the	general	
management	should	be	a	fixed	amount	without	any	form	of	incentive	component.
other major risk takers and employees in control functions may be paid variable salary 
components	in	cash	within	the	financial	framework	for	payment	of	personal	allowances	
under a current workplace agreement, below the cap on variable salary components and 
subject to the provisions in points 4 and 5 of the remuneration policy. severance may 
also be paid unless deemed to be variable salary in the terms of the applicable law. 
the remuneration policy also complies with the remuneration policy requirements of the 
danish companies act applicable to public limited companies with shares admitted to 
trading on a regulated market.
in january 2021, the bank’s board of directors and the board’s remuneration commit-
tee	assessed	that	additions	and	clarifications	were	needed	in	the	bank’s	remuneration	
policy in connection with changes to the danish financial business act, the coming into 
force	of	a	new	executive	order	on	wage	policies	and	remuneration	in	financial	institu-
tions	etc.,	the	coming	into	force	of	the	regulation	on	sustainability‐related	disclosures	in	
the	financial	services	sector	(the	disclosure	regulation)	and	other	adjustments.
the updated remuneration policy, which must be submitted to the bank’s annual general 
meeting in march 2021 for approval, is basically unchanged in respect of the above-
mentioned	matters	but,	as	stated,	contains	various	adjustments	and	clarifications.
the current remuneration policy is available at the bank's website at the address:  
www.landbobanken.dk/policies.

remuneration report and remuneration details
pursuant to provisions in the danish companies act, a new remuneration report has 
been prepared on the remuneration paid to the board of directors and the general man-
agement	for	the	2020	financial	year.
the remuneration report must be submitted for a consultative vote at the annual general 
meeting in march 2021. the remuneration report contains a statement from the bank’s 
external auditor.
in addition, a document with various remuneration details etc. is prepared pursuant 
to	the	executive	order	on	wage	policies	and	remuneration	in	financial	institutions	etc.,	
article 450 of the crr and section 80c of the danish financial business act.
the remuneration report and the remuneration details document are available at the 
bank's website at the address: www.landbobanken.dk/policies.
information on listed companies
in accordance with section 133a of the executive order on financial reports for credit 
institutions and investment firms etc., the bank advises as follows:
the bank’s share capital on 31 december 2020 was dkk 29,228,321 in 29,228,321 nom. 
dkk 1 shares.
the bank has only one share class, and the entire share capital, and thus all shares, are 
listed on the nasdaq copenhagen. there are no restrictions on the shares’ negotiability.
atp,	of	hillerød,	denmark	owned	5.05%	of	the	bank’s	share	capital	on	31	december	
2020, corresponding to 3,000 votes.
with respect to the exercising of voting rights, each nom. dkk 1 share carries one vote 
when the share is recorded in the company’s register of shareholders, or when the 
shareholder has reported and documented his or her right. however, a shareholder may 
cast no more than 3,000 votes.
under the bank’s articles of association, the members of the bank’s board of directors 
are elected by the members of the bank’s shareholders’ committee for four-year periods, 
and the bank’s employees also elect members to the bank’s board of directors in accor-
dance with rules in force.
a decision to amend the bank’s articles of association is only valid if the resolution is 
adopted by at least two-thirds of votes cast and two-thirds of the voting capital repre-
sented at the general meeting.
on the date of closing the accounts, the board of directors is authorised as follows, 
pursuant to the articles of association, to issue shares:
the board of directors is authorised to increase the share capital, by cash payment of up 
to nom. dkk 14,210,980, to nom. dkk 43,439,301 in one or more new issues for which 
the board of directors will determine the price. the capital increase must be fully paid 
up. the authorisation applies until 3 march 2025. a capital increase will take place with 
pre-emption for existing shareholders.
the board of directors is authorised to increase the share capital by payment of values 
other than cash of up to nom. dkk 14,210,980 to nom. dkk 43,439,301 in one or more 
new issues, for which the board of directors will determine the price, as payment for the 
pa g e  5 2  
r i n g k j Ø b i n g  l a n d b o b a n k  a / s
bank’s	takeover	of	an	existing	business	or	specific	asset	values	corresponding	to	the	
value of the shares issued. the capital increase must be fully paid up. the authorisation 
applies until 3 march 2025. the capital increase will take place without pre-emption for 
existing shareholders.
use of the authorisations may not exceed a total of nom. dkk 14,210,980, and each use 
of the authorisations will trigger simultaneous reductions in the amounts authorised 
under both authorisations, by the amount of the nominal capital issued.
it will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting in march 2021 to adjust 
the board of directors’ authorisations to increase the capital so that they are in line with 
the market.
the board of directors has the following powers with respect to the possibility of ac-
quiring the bank’s own shares:
the bank’s annual general meeting of 4 march 2020 authorised the board of directors, 
before the next annual general meeting and in accordance with applicable law, to permit 
the	bank	to	acquire	its	own	shares	to	a	total	nominal	value	of	10%	of	the	bank’s	share	
capital,	so	that	the	shares	can	be	acquired	at	the	current	listed	price	plus	or	minus	10%.
this authority was used on 4 march 2020 to initiate a share buy-back programme of 
dkk 150 million of an expected total buy-back programme of dkk 300 million for ex-
ecution in 2020.
in response to a joint statement of 23 march 2020 made by the government and fi-
nance denmark in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, the share buy-back programme 
was suspended on 30 march 2020. on 27 march 2020, the programme had been 
executed to the sum of dkk 57.5 million, the equivalent of 160,600 nom. dkk 1 shares. 
in	connection	with	the	publication	of	the	interim	report	for	the	first	half	of	2020	and	the	
danish fsa’s recommendation of 26 june 2020, the board of directors decided not to 
buy back further shares or pay any dividends until the end of 2020. 
cancellation of the 160,600 shares will be recommended at the bank’s annual general 
meeting in march 2021.
in conclusion, the bank has accepted “change of control” clauses in certain funding 
agreements. for reasons of competition, no further details are given.

corporate social responsibility
corporate social responsibility and esg report
ringkjøbing landbobank wants to be a responsible and value-creating bank that shows 
social responsibility. the bank works to create good, long-term results for its sharehold-
ers and intends to contribute to creating a sustainable society, focusing on customers, 
employees, climate and the environment, and society.
it is also the bank’s overall goal to be seen as a reliable and attentive partner by all its 
stakeholders.
in response to this goal and the bank’s deep roots in denmark and the local communi-
ties where we are represented, the board of directors has prepared and adopted a corpo-
rate social responsibility (csr) policy.
the	bank’s	csr	policy	focuses	specifically	on	the	five	stakeholder	groups:	customers,	
employees, climate and the environment, the local community and danish society.
the bank’s policy in the area of social responsibility is given on its website at the ad-
dress: www.landbobanken.dk/csr.
as	for	the	2019	financial	year,	the	bank	has	prepared	an	environmental,	social	and	
governance (esg) report for 2020. the esg report contains detailed information on the 
environment, social aspects and governance. 
the esg report also covers the requirement for a statutory statement on corporate 
social responsibility pursuant to section 135 of the executive order on financial reports 
for credit institutions and investment firms etc. the esg report is available on the 
bank’s website at the address: www.landbobanken.dk/csr.
further	to	the	above,	please	note	that	the	bank	has	not	prepared	specific	policies	on	
human rights or climate. the bank supports the efforts to put human rights and climate 
high on the agenda, however, and in the corporate social responsibility policy the bank’s 
target is to be and remain carbon neutral. 
the	bank’s	management	finds	that	the	bank	has	clearly	shown	its	attitude	to	and	sup-
port of both areas via its corporate social responsibility policy and code of conduct.

opinion
in	my	opinion,	the	financial	statements	for	ringkjøbing	landbobank	a/s	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	
bank’s	assets,	liabilities	and	financial	position	at	31	december	2020,	and	of	the	results	of	the	bank	op-
erations	for	the	financial	year	1	january	to	31	december	2020	in	accordance	with	the	danish	financial	
business act. 
my opinion is consistent with my long-form audit report to the audit committee and the board of direc-
tors.
the audit
i	have	audited	the	financial	statements	for	ringkjøbing	landbobank	a/s	for	the	financial	year	1	january	
to 31 december 2020, which comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, 
core earnings, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, statement of capital and notes, including 
accounting	policies,	and	five-year	main	and	key	figures.	the	financial	statements	were	prepared	in	ac-
cordance with the danish financial business act.
the audit was performed on the basis of the danish fsa’s executive order on auditing financial under-
takings etc. and financial groups, and in accordance with international auditing standards regarding 
planning and performing the audit.
i	have	planned	and	performed	the	audit	to	obtain	reasonable	assurance	that	the	financial	statements	
are free from material misstatement. i participated in the audit of all material and high-risk areas.
i	believe	that	the	audit	evidence	i	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	for	my	
opinion.
statement on management review
management is responsible for the management review.
my	opinion	on	the	financial	statements	does	not	cover	the	management	review,	and	i	express	no	form	
of assurance conclusion on that review.
in	connection	with	my	audit	of	the	financial	statements,	my	responsibility	is	to	read	the	management	
review	and,	in	doing	so,	consider	whether	it	is	materially	inconsistent	with	the	financial	statements	or	
with my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
i also considered whether the management review includes the disclosures required by the danish 
financial business act.
based	on	the	work	i	have	performed,	in	my	view,	the	management	review	is	in	accordance	with	the	fi-
nancial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial 
business act. i did not identify any material misstatement in the management review.

in	our	opinion,	the	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	financial	position	of	the	bank	
at	31	december	2020,	and	of	the	results	of	the	bank	operations	and	cash	flows	for	the	financial	year	1	
january to 31 december 2020 in accordance with the danish financial business act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report to the audit committee and the board of 
directors. 
what we have audited
ringkjøbing	landbobank	a/s’s	financial	statements	for	the	financial	year	1	january	to	31	december	
2020 comprise the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the core income, the 
balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of capital and notes, including sum-
mary	of	significant	accounting	policies,	and	five-year	financial	highlights	(‘the	financial	statements’).
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and the addition-
al requirements applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements 
are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of 
our report.
we	believe	that	the	audit	evidence	we	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	for	
our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the bank in accordance with international ethics standards board for accoun-
tants’ code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the additional requirements 
applicable	in	denmark.	we	have	also	fulfilled	our	other	ethical	responsibilities	in	accordance	with	the	
iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of regu-
lation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided. 
appointment
we	were	first	appointed	auditors	of	ringkjøbing	landbobank	a/s	on	8	june	2018	for	the	financial	year	
2018. we have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted 
engagement	of	three	years	including	the	financial	year	2020.				
key audit matters 
key	audit	matters	are	those	matters	that,	in	our	professional	judgement,	were	of	most	significance	in	
our audit of the financial statements for 2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.

key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key 
audit matter
loan impairment charges
loans are measured at amortised cost less impairment 
charges. 
impairment of loans and advances constitutes manage-
ment’s best estimate of expected losses on loans and ad-
vances at the balance sheet date in accordance with the pro-
vision of ifrs 9 as incorporated in the danish executive order 
on the presentation of financial statements of credit institu-
tions and stockbroker companies, etc. we refer to note 1 for 
a detailed description of the accounting policies applied.
as	 a	 result	 of	 covid-19,	 management	 has	 significantly	 in-
creased the impairment charges by way of its accounting es-
timate ('management estimate'). the impact of the covid-19 
pandemic on the bank's customers is largely undetermined, 
which implies that the estimation uncertainty related to the 
calculation of the indication of impairment is increased.  
impairment of loans and advances is a key focus area be-
cause	 management	 is	 making	 significant	 estimates	 in	 an	
area that is inherently complex and subjective. estimates are 
made both in relation to whether loans and advances need to 
be written down for impairment and in relation to the amount 
of loan impairment charges. 
the following areas are central to the calculation of loan im-
pairment charges:
•		determination	of	credit	classification	on	initial	and	subse-
quent recognition.
•  model-based impairment charges in stages 1 and 2, includ-
ing management’s determination of model variables adapt-
ed to the bank’s loan portfolio. 
•  the bank’s procedures to ensure completeness of the reg-
istration of credit-impaired loans (stage 3) or loans with sig-
nificant	increase	in	credit	risk	(stage	2).
•		most	 significant	 assumptions	 and	 estimates	 applied	 by	
management in the calculations of impairment charges, in-
cluding principles for the assessment of various outcomes 
of	the	customer’s	financial	position	(scenarios)	and	for	the	
assessment of collateral value of, for example, properties 
included in the calculations of impairment.
•  management’s assessment of expected credit losses at 
the balance sheet date as a result of possible changes in 
conditions and which are not included in the model-based 
calculations or individually assessed impairment charges, 
including in particular the impact of the covid-19 pandemic 
on the bank’s customers.
we	refer	to	note	2	‘accounting	estimates	and	judgements’,	
note	 47	 ‘risk	 factors	 and	 risk	 management’	 and	 note	 48	
‘credit	risk’	to	the	financial	statements	which	show	factors	
that may affect the impairment of loans and advances.
we reviewed and assessed the impairment 
charges recognised in the income statement for 
2020 and in the balance sheet at 31 december 
2020. 
our review included an assessment of the im-
pairment model applied prepared by the data 
centre bankdata, including division of responsi-
bilities between bankdata and the bank. 
we assessed and tested the bank’s calculation 
of model-based impairment charges in stages 1 
and 2, including assessment of management’s 
determination and adaptation of model vari-
ables to own issues. 
our review and assessment moreover included 
the bank’s validation of the methods applied for 
the calculation of expected credit losses as well 
as the procedures designed to ensure that cred-
it-impaired loans in stage 3 and underperform-
ing	loans	in	stage	2	are	identified	and	recorded	
on a timely basis. 
we assessed and tested the principles applied 
by the bank for the determination of impairment 
scenarios and for the measurement of collateral 
value of, for example, properties included in the 
calculations of impairment of credit-impaired 
loans and advances, and loans and advances 
that	are	significantly	underperforming.
we tested a sample of credit-impaired loans in 
stage 3 and underperforming loans in stage 2 by 
testing the calculations of impairment charges 
and applied data to underlying documentation. 
we tested a sample of other loans by making an 
assessment	of	stage	and	credit	classification.	
this included samples of large loans as well 
as loans relating to segments with generally 
increased exposure, including segments which 
are particularly affected by the covid-19 pan-
demic.
we reviewed and challenged the material as-
sumptions 
underlying 
management’s 
esti-
mates of expected credit losses not included 
in the model-based calculations or individu-
ally assessed impairment charges based on 
our knowledge of the portfolio, the sectors and 
current	market	conditions.	we	focussed	specifi-
cally on the bank's calculation of management 
estimates for hedging of expected credit losses 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.

auditors’ reports
statement on management’s review 
management is responsible for management’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s review, and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management’s 
review and, in doing so, consider whether management’s review is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially mis-
stated.
moreover, we considered whether management’s review includes the disclosures required by the dan-
ish financial business act.
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s review is in accordance with the fi-
nancial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial 
business act. we did not identify any material misstatement in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements 
management	is	responsible	for	the	preparation	of	financial	statements	that	give	a	true	and	fair	view	
in accordance with the danish financial business act and for such internal control as management 
determines	is	necessary	to	enable	the	preparation	of	financial	statements	that	are	free	from	material	
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the bank’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless management either 
intends to liquidate the bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are	considered	material	if,	individually	or	in	the	aggregate,	they	could	reasonably	be	expected	to	influ-
ence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence	that	is	sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	for	our	opinion.	the	risk	of	not	detect-
ing a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the bank’s internal control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
the independent auditor’s report – continued
a n n u a l  r e p o r t  2 0 2 0  
pa g e  6 1
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty	exists	related	to	events	or	conditions	that	may	cast	significant	doubt	on	the	bank’s	ability	
to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the 
bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope	and	timing	of	the	audit	and	significant	audit	findings,	including	any	significant	deficiencies	in	
internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were	of	most	significance	in	the	audit	of	the	financial	statements	for	the	current	period	and	are	there-
fore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would	reasonably	be	expected	to	outweigh	the	public	interest	benefits	of	such	communication.

accounting policies etc.
general
the annual report was prepared in accordance with the provisions of the danish financial 
business act.
the annual report is presented in danish kroner (dkk).
changes in accounting policies resulting from changes in the executive order on financial 
reports for credit institutions and investment firms etc. 
the accounting policies changed on 1 january 2020 as a result of changes in the executive 
order on financial reports for credit institutions and investment firms etc. in the form of new 
provisions compatible with the provisions of ifrs 16 – leases.
the changes in the rules and policies mean that the lessee is no longer required to distinguish 
between	finance	leasing	and	operating	leasing	for	accounting	purposes.	the	lessee	must	
recognise all leasing contracts, including leases, as lease assets representing the value of the 
right-of-use asset. on initial recognition the asset must be measured at the present value of 
the lease liability, including costs and any prepayments. the present value of the agreed lease 
payments must be recognised as a liability at the same time. 
lease assets recognised at the beginning of the year as a consequence of the implementation 
of the new leasing rules consist only of operating leases with the bank as lessee and concern 
rental contracts for properties used by the branch network (domicile properties).
when	assessing	the	expected	lease	terms,	the	bank	identified	the	fixed	lease	term	in	the	
agreements at 3-25 years. the lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
expected periods of use of 3-25 years and the lease liabilities are repaid according to the 
principle of annuities and measured at amortised cost.  
the lease liabilities are discounted to present value using the bank’s incremental borrowing 
rate,	which	is	the	cost	of	raising	external	finance	for	a	similar	asset	with	a	financing	term	simi-
lar to the term of the lease. when measuring the lease liability, the bank used borrowing rates 
of	1-2%	for	discounting	future	lease	payments.		
the bank has chosen not to recognise low-value asset leases and short-term leases in the bal-
ance sheet. lease payments for these leases are instead recognised in the income statement.
the bank has applied the transitional rules and recognised the lease assets at a value corre-
sponding to the lease liabilities calculated as at 1 january 2020 without restating comparative 
figures.	as	at	1	january	2020,	lease	assets	amounting	to	dkk	21	million	are	recognised	under	
domicile properties and corresponding lease liabilities under other liabilities. thus the effect 
on equity is dkk 0. 
rent was previously recognised as an administration expense in the income statement. the 
cost is now recognised as depreciation of the lease asset and interest on the lease liability. 
the	effect	on	net	profit	for	the	year	is	insignificant	compared	to	the	previous	practice.
apart from the above, and a few adaptations and linguistic adjustments, the accounting poli-
cies	are	unchanged	since	last	financial	year.
changes in comparative figures
the various items presenting the bank’s capital and capital ratios as stated on pages 23 and 
27 have been adjusted retrospectively for the period from the end of the second quarter of 
2018 to the end of the second quarter of 2020, because the danish fsa advised the bank in 
2020 that it cannot include the ifrs 9 addition taken over from nordjyske bank in the calcula-
tion of the transition programme concerning ifrs 9. the change has a small effect on the 
various items presenting the bank’s capital and capital ratios.
recognition and measurement – general
assets	are	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	when	it	is	probable	that	future	financial	advan-
tages will accrue to the bank and the value can be measured reliably.
liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when they are probable and can be measured 
reliably.

income is recognised in the income statement as it is earned.
expenses paid to earn the income for the year are recognised in the income statement, and 
value	adjustments	made	to	financial	assets,	financial	liabilities	and	derivative	financial	instru-
ments are also recognised in the income statement.
when measuring fair value etc. of bonds and shares, the three levels of the ifrs 7 hierarchy 
are used as valuation categories:
•  level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments, i.e. without changes in 
form or composition, including listed shares and bonds.
•  level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or other valuation methods where 
all	significant	inputs	are	based	on	observable	market	data.
•		level	3:	valuation	methods	where	any	significant	inputs	are	based	on	unobservable	inputs.
valuation is primarily based on generally recognised valuation techniques.
we refer to the following sections regarding the criteria for recognition and the basis of mea-
surement.
foreign currency
assets and liabilities in foreign currency are converted to dkk at the closing exchange rate 
for the currency on the balance sheet date, corresponding to the rate published by danmarks 
nationalbank. income and expenses are converted continuously at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date.
financial instruments – general
in	general,	the	bank	measures	financial	assets	and	liabilities	at	fair	value	on	initial	recognition.	
measuring	is	subsequently	carried	out	at	fair	value	unless	otherwise	specifically	stated	in	the	
following sections on the individual items. the bank uses the date of payment as the date of 
recognition	for	financial	instruments.
derivative financial instruments
forward	transactions,	interest	rate	swaps	and	other	derivative	financial	instruments	are	mea-
sured at fair value on the balance sheet date.
hedging transactions which, under the terms of the danish fsa’s executive order on financial 
reports for credit institutions and investment firms etc., are regarded as hedge accounting at 
fair value, are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet date with respect to both the hedg-
ing	instrument	and	the	hedged	part	of	the	financial	instrument.
all	value	adjustments	concerning	derivative	financial	instruments	and	items	subject	to	hedge	
accounting are entered under the item “value adjustments” in the income statement.
business combination
the acquisition method is used when new businesses are bought. under this method, the 
acquired	businesses’	identifiable	assets	and	liabilities,	including	any	assets	and	liabilities	that	
have not previously been booked in the acquired business, are measured at fair value on the 
takeover date.
any	positive	difference	between	the	cost	price	and	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	net	assets	is	
recognised as goodwill.
any	negative	difference	between	the	cost	price	and	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	net	assets	is	
recognised as badwill under other operating income in the income statement.
as	a	result	of	using	the	acquisition	method,	the	comparative	figures	for	previous	years	(2016-
2017) have not been adjusted and therefore only cover ringkjøbing landbobank before the 
merger with nordjyske bank in 2018.
group
the bank owns the entire share capital of sæbygård skov a/s, of ringkøbing. consolidated 
accounts	have	not	been	prepared,	as	the	subsidiary’s	business	is	insignificant	with	respect	to	
both balance sheet and activity compared to the bank.

the income statement
interest income
interest income is recognised by the effective interest method, under which interest income 
includes the allocated portion of loan establishment fees etc., which are considered to be part 
of the effective interest on the loan.
negative interest income is recognised as interest expenses and negative interest expenses 
are recognised as interest income. negative interest is presented separately in the notes to 
interest income and interest expenses.
on stage 3 loans which have been written down or off, the interest income relating to the writ-
ten-down part is entered under the item “impairment charges for loans and receivables etc.”
net fee and commission income
fees and commission relating to loans and receivables are recognised as part of the book 
value of loans and receivables. they are recognised as interest income in the income state-
ment over the term of the loans and receivables, as part of the effective interest rate on the 
loans. see “interest income” section above. guarantee-related commission is carried to in-
come over the guarantee term. income generated on performing a given transaction, including 
securities and custodianship fees plus payment handling fees, is recognised as income when 
the transaction has been completed.
staff and administration expenses
staff and administration expenses include salaries, pension costs, it costs, etc.
other operating expenses
other operating expenses include contributions to the guarantee fund and the resolution 
fund. other operating expenses also include items which, by nature, are secondary to the 
banking activities.
impairment charges for loans and receivables etc.
this item includes losses and impairment charges for loans and losses and provisions on 
guarantees etc. losses and impairment charges for receivables from credit institutions are 
also included.
tax
tax	on	the	profit	for	the	year	is	booked	as	an	expense	in	the	income	statement.
net deferred tax is calculated on the items which cover the temporary differences in account-
ing and booking of taxable income and expenses. changes in the corporate tax rate will be 
taken into account.
the bank is jointly taxed with the group undertaking sæbygård skov a/s.
corporation tax is paid in accordance with the danish tax prepayment scheme.
core earnings
the bank uses the alternative performance measure “core earnings”. core earnings are used 
as	a	measure	of	performance	for	both	external	and	internal	financial	reporting	because	they	
are deemed to give a true and fair view of the actual banking operations. overall, core earn-
ings	contain	the	same	items	as	the	traditional	measure	of	performance	“profit	before	tax,”	but	
the	calculation	method	and	degree	of	specification	are	different.
core	earnings	show	the	bank’s	income	and	expenses	adjusted	for	temporary	fluctuations	
following from the development in the bank’s trading portfolio of securities (the securities 
portfolio	less	sector	shares	etc.),	and	the	profit	before	tax	is	divided	into	two	main	elements:	
core earnings and result for the portfolio.
the result for the trading portfolio is composed of value adjustments for the portfolio plus the 
actual return in the form of interest and dividends from the portfolio and less the calculated 
funding costs for the portfolio.
a	numerical	explanation	of	the	correlation	between	“profit	before	tax”	and	“core	earnings”	is	
given in notes 15-20 on page 87.

the balance sheet
receivables from credit institutions and central banks
initial recognition takes place at fair value plus transaction costs, less establishment fees etc., 
and subsequent measurement is at amortised cost. reference is made to the section “deriva-
tive	financial	instruments”	with	respect	to	hedge	accounting.
loans and other receivables
initial recognition is at fair value plus transaction costs, less establishment fees etc., and 
subsequent measurement is at amortised cost. establishment fees etc. which are comparable 
with ongoing interest payments, and thus deemed part of the effective interest on the loan, 
are accrued over the life of the individual loan.
leasing
lease	contracts	are	classified	as	finance	leases	if	they	transfer	substantially	all	risks	and	
rewards of ownership to an asset to the lessee.
finance lease assets where the bank is the lessor are recognised as loans at the net invest-
ment in the lease contracts less depreciation (repayments) calculated according to the annu-
ity method over the lease term.
income from the lease assets is recognised on the basis of the effective interest agreed in the 
lease contracts and included under interest income in the income statement.
all	of	the	bank’s	lease	agreements	are	finance	lease	agreements.
model for impairment of expected credit losses on loans and other receivables etc.
under	the	ifrs	9-compatible	impairment	rules,	all	financial	assets	recognised	at	amortised	
cost are impaired by the expected credit losses. under the same rules, provisions for expected 
credit	losses	are	made	for	unutilised	credit	lines,	loan	undertakings	and	financial	guarantees.
the impairment rules use a model based on expectations, which means earlier recognition 
of impairment charges compared to the previous impairment model under which objective evi-
dence of impairment had to exist before impairment charges could and had to be recognised.
for	financial	assets	recognised	at	amortised	cost,	impairment	charges	for	expected	credit	
losses are recognised in the income statement and reduce the value of the asset in the bal-
ance sheet.
provisions	for	losses	on	unutilised	credit	facilities,	loan	undertakings	and	financial	guarantees	
are recognised as liabilities.
development stages for credit risk
the	expected	loss	impairment	rules	mean	that,	on	initial	recognition,	a	financial	asset	etc.	
must be impaired by the expected credit loss for a twelve-month period (stage 1). if the credit 
risk	for	the	asset	subsequently	increases	significantly	relative	to	initial	recognition,	the	finan-
cial asset must be impaired by the expected credit loss over the asset’s expected remaining 
life (stage 2). if the instrument is found to be impaired (stage 3), the asset must be impaired 
by the expected credit loss over its remaining life, and interest income must be recognised in 
the income statement based on the effective interest method applied to the impaired amount. 
the	same	applies	to	the	part	of	the	impaired	instruments	that	are	classified	as	weak	stage	2	
for	presentation	purposes:	see	the	section	“definition	of	credit-impaired	and	default”.
the expected loss is calculated as a function of the probability of oei (objective evidence 
of impairment), ead (exposure at default) and lgd (loss given default), into which forward-
looking information representing the management’s expectations for future development have 
been incorporated.
the	classification	in	stages	and	computation	of	the	expected	loss	are	based	on	the	bank’s	rat-
ing models, which were developed by the data centre bankdata, and the bank’s internal credit 
management.

assessment of significant increase in credit risk etc.
a	significant	increase	in	the	credit	risk	compared	to	initial	recognition	is	presumed	to	have	
occurred on a downgrading in the bank’s internal rating of the customer corresponding to one 
rating	class	in	the	danish	fsa’s	recommended	rating	classification.
payments	that	are	more	than	30	days	overdue	are	also	considered	a	significant	increase	in	
credit risk.
a	major	downgrading	within	the	danish	fsa’s	rating	class	2b	is	also	considered	a	significant	
increase in credit risk. the danish fsa’s rating class 2c in principle always characterises a 
significant	increase	in	credit	risk,	regardless	of	the	facility’s	initial	rating.
in accordance with the rules, facilities from nordjyske bank were considered initial recogni-
tions	in	connection	with	the	merger	and	thus	classified	in	stage	1.
if	the	credit	risk	on	the	financial	asset	is	considered	low	on	the	balance	sheet	date,	the	asset	
remains	in	stage	1,	which	is	characterised	by	no	significant	increase	in	credit	risk.
the bank considers credit risk to be low when the bank’s internal rating of the customer 
corresponds to the danish fsa’s rating class 3 and the best part of 2a. the rest of 2a is only 
considered low credit risk if payments are not overdue.
definition of credit-impaired and default
an	exposure	is	defined	as	credit-impaired	(stage	3)	and	in	default	if	it	meets	at	least	one	of	
the following criteria:
•		the	borrower	is	in	significant	financial	difficulties	and	the	bank	judges	that	the	borrower	will	
fail to honour its obligations as agreed;
•  the borrower is in breach of contract, for example by failing to meet its obligation to pay 
interest and repayments or by repeated overdrafts;
•  the bank has granted the borrower a relaxation of terms which would not have been consid-
ered	were	it	not	for	the	debtor’s	financial	difficulties;
•		the	borrower	is	likely	to	go	bankrupt	or	be	subject	to	other	types	of	financial	restructuring;
•		a	financial	asset	is	acquired	at	a	considerable	discount	which	reflects	that	losses	have	been	
incurred;
•  the exposure has been in arrears/overdue for more than 90 days with an amount judged to 
be substantial.
however,	if	the	customer	is	in	significant	financial	difficulties	or	the	financial	institution	has	
granted	a	relaxation	of	terms	because	of	the	customer’s	financial	difficulties,	the	financial	as-
set remains in stage 2 if no losses are expected in the most probable scenario (weak stage 2).
the	definition	of	credit-impaired	and	default	used	by	the	bank	when	measuring	the	expected	
credit	loss	and	for	transfers	to	stage	3	corresponds	to	the	definition	used	for	internal	risk	
management	purposes	and	is	also	close	to	the	definition	of	default	in	the	capital	requirements	
regulation (ccr).
the calculation of impairment for exposures in stages 1 and 2, except for exposures in weak 
stage 2, is on a portfolio-based model, while impairment for the rest of the exposures is based 
on a manual, individual assessment of relevant scenarios and associated probabilities that 
they will occur.
in	addition,	a	management	estimate	reflecting	macroeconomic	expectations	and	uncertain-
ties in models is allocated.
calculation of expected losses
the portfolio-based calculation model is based on the bank’s rating of its customers in dif-
ferent rating classes and an estimation of the risk for the individual classes. calculations are 
made in a set-up developed and maintained by the bank’s data centre bankdata, supplement-
ed with a forward-looking macroeconomic module developed and maintained by lopi, the 
association of local banks, savings banks and cooperative banks in denmark, and used as 
the starting point for incorporating management’s expectations for the future.

the macroeconomic module is built around a number of regression models that determine 
the historical connection between impairment charges for the year in a number of sectors and 
industries and a number of explanatory macroeconomic variables. the regression models 
are then supplied with estimates for the macroeconomic variables based on forecasts from 
consistent sources such as the danish economic council, danmarks nationalbank and oth-
ers. the forecasts generally cover two years ahead and include variables such as increase 
in public spending, increase in gdp, interest etc. the expected impairment charges are thus 
calculated up to two years ahead for the individual sectors and industries. for terms of more 
than two years, a linear interpolation is applied between the impairment ratio for year 2 and 
the impairment ratio for year 10. the model assumes that long-term equilibrium will exist in 
the form of a normal impairment level. the calculated impairment ratios are then transformed 
into adjustment factors adjusting the data centre’s estimates in the individual sectors and 
industries. the bank adapts these based on its own expectations for the future and based on 
the composition of loans. 
practice for derecognising financial assets from the balance sheet
financial assets are derecognised fully or partly from the balance sheet when the exposure or 
a	significant	part	of	it	is	deemed	to	be	lost.	derecognition	is	based	on	a	specific	assessment	
of	the	individual	exposures.	for	business	customers,	the	bank	bases	its	assessment	on	finan-
cial	indicators	such	as	the	customer’s	cash	flows,	earnings	and	equity	and	on	any	collateral	
furnished as security for the exposure. for personal customers, the assessment is also based 
on	the	customer’s	financial	situation,	including	the	possibility	of	enforcing	the	security,	if	any.	
when	a	financial	asset	is	derecognised	fully	or	partly	from	the	balance	sheet,	the	associated	
impairment	charges	for	the	financial	asset	are	also	removed	from	the	cumulative	impairment	
charges: see note 23.
as a principal rule, the bank’s efforts to collect the assets continue after derecognition from 
the	balance	sheet.	the	steps	taken	depend	on	the	specific	situation.	to	begin,	the	bank	at-
tempts to reach a voluntary agreement with the customer, including renegotiation of terms or 
restructuring of an enterprise. debt recovery and petition for bankruptcy are not applied until 
other steps have been tried.
bonds and shares
bonds at fair value
bonds listed on a stock exchange are measured at fair value determined on the basis of the 
closing price on the balance sheet day (level 1).
unlisted bonds are measured at fair value, computed on the basis of price information from 
the issuer (levels 2 and 3).
shares etc.
shares listed on a stock exchange are measured at fair value determined on the basis of the 
closing price on the balance sheet day (level 1).
unlisted shares are measured at fair value, computed on the basis of the price of a transac-
tion between independent parties. measurement is based on available information on transac-
tions,	published	announcements	of	financial	results	or,	alternatively,	market	capitalisation	
calculations (levels 2 and 3).
for unlisted shares in the form of shares in companies owned by the sector where the shares 
are distributed, the redistribution is considered to be the primary market for the shares. fair 
value is determined at the redistribution price and the shares are included as level 2 assets.
unlisted shares for which a reliable fair value cannot be determined are measured at cost less 
impairment charges (level 3).
the management actively considers the fair value computations.
all ongoing value adjustments to listed and unlisted securities are entered in the income state-
ment under the item “value adjustments”.

investments in group undertakings and associated companies
investments in group undertakings and associated companies are recognised and measured 
by the equity method, which means that the investments are measured at the proportionate 
share of the entity’s equity value.
the	bank’s	share	of	the	entity’s	profits	after	tax	and	any	gain	or	loss	on	sale	of	the	investment	
are recognised in the income statement.
net revaluation of investments in group undertakings is transferred to the net revaluation 
reserve by the equity method, subject to statutory reserves, to the extent that the equity value 
exceeds the cost price. write-downs are recognised in and deducted from any positive statu-
tory reserves as long as a reserve for offsetting exists.
group undertakings and associated companies with negative equity values are recognised at 
dkk	0.	if	the	bank	has	an	obligation	in	law	or	in	fact	to	cover	the	entity’s	deficit,	a	provision	will	
recognised.
assets linked to pooled schemes
all pooled assets and deposits are recognised as separate balance sheet items. 
returns on pooled assets and distributions to participants are posted under the item “value 
adjustments” in the income statement.
intangible assets 
goodwill 
goodwill acquired in connection with acquisitions is recognised at cost less cumulative 
impairment charges.
goodwill is not amortised but the value is impairment tested at least once a year. goodwill is 
written down to the recoverable amount through the income statement if the net asset’s car-
rying amount exceeds the higher of net sales price and value in use, which corresponds to the 
net	present	value	of	expected	future	cash	flows.
customer relationships
the value of customer relationships acquired in connection with acquisitions is recognised at 
cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life which will not exceed 
ten years. the useful life depends on customer loyalty, and is reassessed annually. changes 
in amortisation as a result of changes in useful life are recognised prospectively as a change 
in accounting estimates.
customer relationships are impairment tested when there is evidence of impairment. impair-
ment charges for customer relationships are recognised in the income statement and not 
subsequently reversed.
land and buildings
land and buildings cover the three items “investment properties”, “domicile properties” and 
“domicile properties (leasing)”. the properties which house the bank’s branches are included 
under domicile properties, while other properties are considered to be investment properties.
investment properties are included in the balance sheet at fair value, computed by the return 
method. ongoing changes in value of investment properties are recognised in the income 
statement.
domicile properties are included in the balance sheet at reassessed value, which is the fair 
value computed by the return method less cumulative depreciation and any impairment loss.
depreciation is calculated on the basis of an expected useful life of 50 years, computing de-
preciation at cost plus or minus revaluation less scrap value. depreciation and losses due to 
impairment are recognised in the income statement, while increases in reassessed value are 
recognised in total comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity under the item “provisions 
for revaluation” unless the increase corresponds to a reduction in value which was previously 
recognised in the income statement.

other tangible assets
other tangible assets, including operating equipment and improvements to rented premises, 
are recognised in the balance sheet at cost less cumulative depreciation and write-downs for 
any loss due to impairment.
depreciation	is	calculated	on	the	basis	of	the	assets’	expected	lives,	which	are	one	to	five	
years for operating equipment and thirty years for improvements to rented premises, on the 
basis of depreciation computed at cost less scrap value. depreciation and losses due to 
impairment are recognised in the income statement.
temporary assets
temporary assets comprise assets taken over as a result of termination of customer expo-
sures, the intention being to sell off the assets as soon as possible. the item also includes 
domicile properties for sale. temporary assets are included at cost on transfer and will subse-
quently be written down to a possibly lower realisation value.
other assets
other assets include interest and commission receivables as well as the positive market value 
of	derivative	financial	instruments.
tax
current tax assets and current tax liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet as tax calcu-
lated on the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax paid on account.
a deferred tax liability is allocated under the item “provisions for deferred tax”.
a deferred tax asset is booked under the item “deferred tax assets” following a prudent as-
sessment of the asset’s value.
the effect of changes in the corporate tax rate is recognised in “deferred tax 
assets”/“provisions for deferred tax”.
debt to credit institutions and central banks/deposits and other debt/deposits in pooled 
schemes/issued bonds at amortised cost/subordinated debt
measurement	is	at	amortised	cost,	but	reference	is	made	to	the	section	“derivative	financial	
instruments” with respect to hedge accounting.
other liabilities
other liabilities include interest and commission payable and the negative market value of 
derivative	financial	instruments.
provisions for liabilities
 “provisions for pensions and similar liabilities”, “provisions for losses on guarantees” and 
“other provisions for liabilities” all come under the heading of provisions for liabilities.
unfunded pension liabilities for former management members are itemised in the balance 
sheet under the item “provisions for pensions and similar liabilities”. the liability is calculated 
as the capitalised value of the expected future pension payments.
a	provision	is	recognised	in	respect	of	financial	guarantees	and	unutilised	loan	undertakings	
in accordance with the ifrs 9-compatible impairment rules: see the section “model for impair-
ment of expected credit losses on loans and other receivables etc.”
provisions are also made for other guarantees if it is probable that the guarantee will be called 
and the amount of the liability can be reliably determined.
contingent liabilities/guarantees
the bank’s outstanding guarantees are given in the notes under the item “contingent liabili-
ties”.

statement of capital
phasing in ifrs 9 impairment rules concerning capital
the bank has decided to take advantage of the transition programme under the capital 
requirements regulation (crr). thus both the static and the dynamic components of the ifrs 
9	transitional	rules	are	now	used,	including	the	simplified	approach	to	recalculation	of	capital	
requirements. the negative effect of the transition to the ifrs 9 impairment rules will thus not 
take full effect on total capital until the beginning of 2025.

core earnings per dkk 1 share (page 10)
the bank’s alternative performance “core earnings” is used as the value of earnings. for the

pay-out ratios (page 26)
detailed comments on the pay-out ratios:
the pay-out ratios in general:
pay-out ratios for the individual years were computed as the actual distributions for the year in 
percent	of	“net	profit	for	the	year”.
 actual distributions were calculated as the proposed and subsequently paid ordinary divi-
dend, any proposed and subsequently paid extraordinary dividend and the actual expense of 
buying back the shares actually cancelled under an adopted share buy-back programme, on 
the	basis	of	the	profit	for	a	given	financial	year.
pay-out ratio for 2018:
the	pay-out	ratio	for	2018	is,	however,	calculated	on	the	basis	of	the	pro-forma	“net	profit	for	
the year”.
pay-out ratio for 2020:
the percentage for 2020 is the expected pay-out ratio. the percentage was thus calculated on 
the basis of the proposed ordinary dividend and an expected share buy-back programme for 
implementation	during	2021	based	on	the	profit	for	2020.
share buy-back programme used:
as stated, the share buy-back programme adopted at the bank’s annual general meeting in 
march 2020 was suspended at the end of march 2020 and not fully utilised. only dkk 57.5 
million of the programme was used (the equivalent of 160,600 shares), and it is recommended 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting in march 2021 that the 160,600 shares be can-
celled in connection with a capital reduction.

accounting estimates and judgments
 
general
in computing the book value of certain assets and liabilities, estimates have been made of 
how future events will affect the value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date.
the estimates are based on assumptions which management judges to be responsible, but 
which	are	not	certain	or	predictable.	the	final	actual	results	may	thus	deviate	from	the	esti-
mates, as the bank is subject to risks and uncertainties which can affect the results.
the most important estimates concern the following areas:
• calculation of expected losses on loans and other credit exposures
• assessment of collateral security
•	fair	value	of	unlisted	financial	instruments
• valuation of intangible assets including goodwill
• fair value of domicile properties
calculation of expected losses on loans and other credit exposures
expected impairment is computed as a combination of individual calculations for facilities 
with objective evidence of impairment and model-based calculations for facilities without 
objective evidence of impairment. 
the calculations for facilities with objective evidence of impairment involve a number of 
estimates.	the	assessment	involves	estimates	of	various	scenarios	of	future	cash	flows	
which the customer is expected to generate. in addition to the calculated impairment charges 
which are based on probability-weighted scenarios, a management estimate is also allocated 
for facilities with objective evidence of impairment. this estimate comprises considerations 
regarding the industry, i.e. not the individual exposure, and the macro-economic impact of the 
probability weightings used for calculating the individual facilities. in 2020 the coronavirus 
pandemic and brexit in particular have given rise to the management estimates for customers 
with objective evidence of impairment.
pa g e  8 2  
r i n g k j Ø b i n g  l a n d b o b a n k  a / s
notes
facilities that do not show objective evidence of impairment are included in a portfolio of 
exposures where automated impairment calculations are made on the basis of customer rat-
ings and a number of parametric values. the parametric values are determined on the basis of 
historical data, including the risk of loss on different rating classes and the expected percent-
age loss if a loss arises. the historical data is translated into forward-looking expectations 
via a macroeconomic adjustment. this adjustment is included as part of the management 
estimate,	which	also	includes	other	aspects	that	are	difficult	to	detect	in	the	model-based	ap-
proach,	for	example	because	they	are	not	yet	reflected	in	the	bank’s	credit	models.	the	bank’s	
credit	models	are	largely	based	on	financial	ratios	and	there	may	thus	be	a	delay	from	when	
an	economic	challenge	arises	until	it	is	reflected	in	the	customer’s	rating.	the	impact	of	the	
coronavirus pandemic has therefore largely been included in the calculations via the manage-
ment estimate for customers without objective evidence of impairment and the management 
estimate is largely related to the coronavirus pandemic.
the reader is referred to note 1 “accounting policies etc.” under “model for impairment of ex-
pected credit losses on loans and other receivables etc.” for details of calculation of expected 
loss.
assessment of collateral security
to reduce the risk of the individual exposures, the bank receives collateral security mainly 
in the form of physical assets (with real property as the main form), securities etc. material 
estimates are involved in valuing the security.
a detailed description of security is provided in note 48 “credit risk”.
fair value of unlisted financial instruments
the	bank	measures	a	number	of	unlisted	financial	instruments	at	fair	value,	including	all	
derivative	financial	instruments	and	unlisted	shares.
as part of its operations, the bank has acquired strategic shares in different sector compa-
nies. strategic shares in sector companies are measured at fair value on the basis of available 
information on transactions in the relevant company’s shares or, alternatively, by a valuation 
model	using	recognised	methods	and	various	data.	valuation	is	also	influenced	by	co-owner-
ship, trading, shareholders’ agreements etc.
estimates	are	an	influence	where	valuations	of	financial	instruments	are	based	less	on	
observable market data. this is the case, for example, with unlisted shares and certain bonds 
where	there	is	no	active	market.	please	also	see	the	sections	“derivative	financial	instru-
ments” and “bonds and shares” under “accounting policies etc.” in note 1.
valuation of goodwill
goodwill is impairment-tested at least annually. this involves a degree of estimation in quan-
tifying the future income and determining the weighted average cost of capital (consisting of 
the return on shareholders’ equity and the cost of loan capital) in line with presumed market 
expectations.
reference is made to note 27 “intangible assets” for further details on the impairment test.
fair value of land and buildings
land	and	buildings	are	valued	using	a	return-based	model.	the	future	cash	flows	are	based	on	
the	bank’s	estimate	of	the	future	profit	or	loss	and	the	required	rate	of	return	for	each	property,	
taking into account location, maintenance etc. a number of these assumptions and estimates 
significantly	influence	the	calculations.
the management used available market statistics including average market rent and required 
rates of return for properties in the same geographical area to determine the properties’ 
market values. for a few properties with special circumstances the management used its own 
required rates of return.
please also see the section “land and buildings” under “accounting policies etc.” in note 1 and 
note 28 “land and buildings”.

goodwill was impairment-tested at the end of 2020. the merged bank was tested as a single unit, since the “old” 
nordjyske	bank	is	financially	fully	integrated	in	ringkjøbing	landbobank.	therefore	a	true	and	fair	view	could	not	be	
obtained from a test only of the part that had been taken over. the impairment test did not result in any write-downs.
the	model	used	in	the	impairment	test	is	based	on	the	bank’s	budget	for	2021.	“net	profit	for	the	year”	is	used	as	
the opening value for calculating the sensitivity. the tax rate is expected to be unchanged throughout the period. 
using	“net	profit	for	the	year”	as	the	opening	value	in	the	model	makes	the	test	harder	than	if	free	cash	flows	were	
used.	a	weighted	average	cost	of	capital	of	8.5%	and	an	expected	annual	increase	in	“net	profit	for	the	year”	of	2%	
were used.
the robustness of the model is tested in sensitivity analyses where required rate of return, changes in growth rate 
and negative effects of “result for the portfolio etc.” are tested. the management believes that the model is robust 
in respect of the relevant scenarios chosen.

fair value of financial instruments
financial instruments are measured in the balance sheet at either fair value or amortised cost (with 
consideration	to	risk	cover	that	fulfils	the	conditions	applying	to	hedge	accounting).
fair	value	is	the	amount	at	which	a	financial	asset	can	be	traded	or	at	which	a	financial	liability	can	be	
repaid	between	agreed	independent	parties.	the	fair	values	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities	priced	
on active markets are calculated on the basis of observed market prices on the balance sheet date. 
the	fair	values	of	financial	instruments	which	are	not	priced	on	active	markets	are	calculated	on	the	
basis of generally recognised pricing methods.
shares etc., investments in associated and group undertakings, assets linked to pooled schemes 
and	derivative	financial	instruments	are	measured	in	the	accounts	at	fair	value.	recognised	amounts	
equal fair values.
loans are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost plus any fair value hedging.  
the difference from fair values is calculated as fees and commission received, costs paid in the lend-
ing	activities,	and	for	fixed-interest	loans,	the	value	adjustment	which	is	dependent	on	the	interest	
level. this, in turn, is calculated by comparing the actual market interest rate with the nominal rate ap-
plying to the loans. the stage 1 impairment charges stated on the balance sheet date are also added.
the fair value of receivables from credit institutions and central banks is determined by the same 
method as for loans.
for	floating-rate	financial	liabilities	in	the	form	of	deposits	and	debt	to	credit	institutions	measured	at	
amortised	cost,	it	is	estimated	that	the	carrying	value	corresponds	to	the	fair	value.	for	fixed-rate	finan-
cial liabilities in the form of deposits and debt to credit institutions measured at amortised cost, the dif-
ference from fair values is estimated to be the value adjustment which is dependent on interest level. 
deposits in pooled schemes are measured in the accounts at fair value. recognised amounts equal 
fair values.
issued bonds and subordinated debt are measured at amortised cost plus any fair value hedging, 
which is estimated to correspond to the fair value.

description of security
when entering into transactions with its customers, ringkjøbing landbobank wants to reduce 
the risk as much as possible by obtaining collateral in the form of physical assets, securities, 
bank deposits etc. as well as guarantees, including by surety.
the bank regularly monitors the value of collateral security obtained, and the related loan values 
are calculated in accordance with the bank’s internal procedures as follows:
•	 	detached	houses,	owner-occupied	flats	and	holiday	homes	are	valued	at	fair	value	less	a
 
deduction.
•	 	rental	properties	are	valued	at	calculated	fair	values	on	the	basis	of	profitability	analyses	
less a deduction.
• movables are in principle valued at book value less a deduction.
•  agricultural properties are valued on the same principles as used by the danish fsa, except 
that the bank applies lower prices for farm land.

	wind	turbines	are	valued	at	the	present	value	of	the	calculated	cash	flow	over	their	expected	/	re-
maining lives. the calculation is based on the wind turbine’s expected output in a normal wind year.
when computing loan values, a deduction is made to cover the risk in connection with realisa-
tion, costs etc.

credit risk – continued
the tables above only show loan values corresponding to the maximum credit exposure for the 
individual exposure. if the loan value for the individual exposure exceeds the maximum credit 
exposure allowed, the surplus loan value is not included in the tables.
as a result of general cautiousness when computing loan values, the possible realisation values 
are often higher than the loan values shown. in a number of instances, customers' drawdown 
of their maximum credit facilities is also conditional upon their ability to deposit additional 
security. the real collateral values for the maximum credit risk are therefore actually higher than 
indicated in the tables.
in addition, a portion of the undrawn credit lines which are part of the maximum credit expo-
sure	is	in	closed	circuits,	where	the	bank	has	financed	assets	without	enabling	the	customers	
to claim any undrawn credit facilities. the maximum credit exposure is consequently lower in 
practice than indicated in the tables.

comments on the distribution by sector and industry
 
 the bank’s assessment is that the credit quality of its loans is generally high. the ability of the 
bank’s customers to pay is generally good and, combined with the bank’s solid cover of many 
exposures through collateral, the result is low credit risks.
	
	the	bank	has	a	well-diversified	portfolio	related	to	agriculture,	with	cattle	farms	accounting	for	
1.3%	of	the	total	volume	of	loans	and	guarantees,	pig	farms	accounting	for	1.2%,	and	others	for	
5.4%.	2020	was	a	very	mixed	year	for	agriculture.	at	the	beginning	of	the	year	prices	paid	to	pig	
production were very favourable while the year closed with low prices paid for piglets. the con-
ditions	for	mink	production	were	also	difficult,	culminating	with	the	shutdown	of	the	industry	
as a consequence of the coronavirus. security consists primarily of mortgages on agricultural 
property (land, buildings and other production facilities on the farms). to this must be added 
assignment to the bank of subsidies per hectare and other accounts etc.
	
	the	bank	has	financed	wind	turbines	for	many	years	and	in	recent	years	also	granted	loans	to	
the establishment of solar cell and biogas plants. the “renewable energy” portfolio accounts 
for	a	total	of	7.2%	of	the	bank’s	total	loans	and	guarantees.	security	consists	of	mortgages	on	
renewable energy plants and assignment in electricity accounts etc.
	
	real	property	accounts	for	a	total	of	16.9%	of	the	bank’s	total	loans	and	guarantees,	of	which	
12.7%	is	first	mortgages	without	prior	creditors.	these	loans	are	first	mortgages	on	real	prop-
erty	and	construction	financing	without	prior	creditors.	the	risk	profile	is	judged	to	be	lower	
than	for	traditional	real	property	financing,	which	is	typically	junior	to	mortgage	credit	financing.	
	
	finance	and	insurance	comprise	a	total	of	8.1%	of	the	bank’s	total	loans	and	guarantees	and	
include	exposure	to	well-consolidated	financial	counterparties,	loans	granted	on	mortgage	
deed portfolios and leasing companies and the bank’s concept for securities lending. security 
consists, among other things, of listed securities and mortgage deeds. 
	
	personal	customers	account	for	a	total	of	38.9%	of	ringkjøbing	landbobank’s	total	loans	and	
guarantees.	the	quality	of	the	loans	is	good	and	customers’	finances	generally	strong	and	
positively affected by low unemployment and increasing house prices. collateral received from 
personal customers consists primarily of mortgages on real property (private homes).

credit risk – continued
comments on the distribution by credit quality
the quality of the bank’s exposures is generally strong. the table shows exposures by high, medium 
and	low	credit	quality	as	well	as	credit-impaired	and	shows	that	the	credit	quality	is	high	for	72%	of	the	
bank’s	exposures,	a	reduction	compared	to	the	74%	last	year.	this	generally	reflects	a	continued	sound	
danish economy with low unemployment, low interest rates and continued favourable conditions for the 
bank’s niches. the coronavirus situation is a challenge in some industries, and although the bank is not 
severely exposed to particularly vulnerable industries, the result is marginal deterioration of the credit 
quality of the exposures. 
the categories high, medium and low credit quality do not translate directly into the danish fsa’s rating 
classes but, as a principal rule, high credit quality can be viewed as fsa rating classes 3 and 2a, me-
dium credit quality as the best part of fsa rating class 2b, while low credit quality covers the rest of fsa 
rating classes 2b and 2c as well as the customers with objective evidence of impairment where losses 
are not expected in the most probable scenario. credit-impaired exposures are those where losses are 
expected in the most probable scenario. 
comments on the distribution by stages
eighty-eight	percent	of	the	bank’s	exposures	are	in	stage	1,	while	9%	are	in	stage	2.	the	bank's	expo-
sures	in	stage	3	account	for	3%.	the	group	“credit-impaired	on	initial	recognition”	is	included	as	a	part	
of	stage	3.	in	the	second	quarter	of	2020,	the	bank	reviewed	all	significant	exposures	with	impairment	
on	an	individual	basis	to	ensure	they	are	classified	appropriately	in	the	different	stages	in	accordance	
with ifrs 9. as a principal rule, exposures where the bank assesses full repayment to be the most prob-
able scenario are placed in stage 2. the review resulted in migration from stage 3 to stage 2. the share 
of	exposures	in	stage	3	thus	decreased	from	4%	at	the	end	of	2019	to	3%	at	the	end	of	2020.	
the	table	shows	that	exposures	in	agriculture	in	particular	are	in	stage	3.	the	principles	for	classifica-
tion in stages are described in note 1 “accounting policies etc.” in the section “model for impairment of 
expected credit losses on loans and other receivables etc.”
comments on loans in stage 3
the bank is particularly focused on covering the risk on exposures which have been impaired. under 
the bank’s credit policy, these exposures must be covered to the greatest possible extent by collateral. 
when determining the need for an impairment charge, the value of collateral is included at the expected 
net realisation value in different scenarios. when determining the need for an impairment charge, the 
bank makes only modest allowance for the ability to make payments over and above the value of col-
lateral.

value at risk/market risk
 
 ringkjøbing landbobank uses a value at risk (var) model as a sensitivity analysis for market 
risks. the model is a parametric var model based on a historic analysis of the covariance (the 
correlations)	between	the	prices	of	various	financial	assets	etc.	the	model	combines	historical	
knowledge	of	covariance	on	the	financial	markets	with	the	bank’s	current	positions,	and	on	this	
basis calculates the risk of losses for a forthcoming ten-day period. the bank’s interest rate 
positions, foreign currency positions and listed share positions etc. are included in the calcula-
tion, while positions in sector shares etc. are not included. the model does not include the credit 
spread risks on the bank’s portfolio of bonds. the calculated var thus indicates the bank’s 
sensitivity to losses on the basis of its positions. the model is used as one of a number of tools 
in the bank’s management of market risks.
 
 reference is made to pages 36 and 39 of this annual report for further description of the model 
etc.
