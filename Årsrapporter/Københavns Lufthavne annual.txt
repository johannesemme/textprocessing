planned investments were reduced by  
approximately dkk 800 million. in august 
and november 2020, cph also implemented 
organisational adjustments to the activity 
level expected for the foresee able future.  
these adjustments will reduce yearly opera-
tional costs for cph by approximately dkk 
500 million.
it has been vital for us to succeed in signifi-
cantly slimming down. as critical infrastruc-
ture and denmark’s gateway to the world, 
we could not simply shut down and wait for 
better times. we had to stay open for the 
very limited passenger traffic that remained, 
and not least for important air cargo. this 
has meant that expenditure has far exceeded 
revenue.
collaboration to save jobs
in spring 2020, when we reached a low point 
of just 424 passengers on 9 april, we remained 
calm. excellent collaboration with the author-
ities and the government brought flexibility 
to the salary compensation scheme, allowing 
employees to be on rotation or furloughed. 
this was crucial.
overall, cph received dkk 348 million in 
compensation packages during the year of 
coronavirus. this gave us the breathing space 
to carry out the essential company adapta-
tions and allowed us to protect the jobs of 
2,600 employees until the end of august, 
when we had to make the first lay-offs. at  
the end of the year, there were 772 fewer 
full-time positions (ftes). while this has not 
been easy for anyone concerned, like others 
for copenhagen airports, 2020 was the worst 
year since the second world war. passenger 
numbers plummeted from 30.3 million to  
7.5 million – the same as in 1970. a pre-tax 
profit of around dkk 1.3 billion in 2019 
turned into a loss of dkk 828 million in 2020.
but 2020 was also a year in which employ-
ees, management and owners, in partnership 
with our stakeholders, stood together to 
weather the storm so that in 2021 we are 
well-adapted, stronger and ready to restart 
and rebuild.
during the year, a united cph was geared up 
to act quickly in an unpredictable reality of 
ever-changing travel and testing guidelines. 
this bodes well for the future.
we are confident of a good future for cph 
and the aviation industry in which we will  
all fulfil the pre-covid ambition of a green 
transition for the whole sector. that same 
confidence in cph is shared by our lenders, 
who have provided credit facilities of dkk 6 
billion to help us through 2020 and given us 
the platform to restart in 2021. in addition, 
due to the credit facilities provided, all our 
lenders provided support in waiving debt 
covenants until june 2021. we would like  
to thank them all for their cooperation.
in 2020, cph took significant actions to 
reduce costs and actively use the crisis to  
simplify and identify new, effective solutions. 
more than dkk 200 million in reductions  
related solely to external costs. in addition, 
from board & management
on the road  
to recovery
serious crises can bring out the best in people and companies. 
that has been the case at copenhagen airports, where we 
have used the covid-19 crisis to become a leaner, more 
agile company with adaptable employees and strengthened 
relations with the airlines, partners, authorities and other 
stakeholders. we are well positioned for the road to recovery.
across europe we have had to face up to the 
reality of the new situation.
as a consequence of the very low activity 
level at the airport, cph and the unions 
worked together on, among other things, 
upskilling and division of labour. the joint 
effort and excellent collaboration meant  
that cph was able to avoid cutting a further 
300 jobs. our union partners deserve huge 
credit for this.
overall, it is estimated that 10,000 jobs have 
been lost in the danish aviation sector – the 
majority in the 1,000 or so companies in and 
around copenhagen airport. in summer 
2020, cph therefore joined with the unions, 
sas, the danish ministry of employment and 
tårnby municipality to open a job and advice 
centre at copenhagen airport, to assist those 
impacted by the crisis.

a better experience – and the airlines, ground 
handlers and authorities better working  
conditions in the airport.
still investing in the future
before the coronavirus hit, cph was investing 
around dkk 2 billion annually in developing 
the airport. the whole investment programme 
was revisited, not least the numerous building 
projects. some were put on hold, while 
others went ahead because it would have 
been too costly to stop them. 
the five must-win battles of the crisis
the corona pandemic has put many of the 
activities of the architects of the future 
airport strategy on hold. but the objective 
remains the same: to create a leading, future-
proof, innovative airport. during the crisis, 
the whole organisation came together to 
fight five must-win battles:
  to ensure a safe, comfortable and  
positive travel experience for passengers 
  to safeguard teamwork and  
motivation in the organisation
  to simplify working processes and  
reduce bureaucracy for the future
  to focus on lower expenditure and  
minimise costs
  to protect and develop our revenue 
streams
fear of catching the virus while travelling 
complicated corona rules in every country, 
and the prospect of a long spell of quaran-
tine kept 75% of passengers at home in 
2020. cph launched the “let’s travel with 
care” initiative and embraced everything 
from face masks, hand sanitiser, plexiglass, 
extra cleaning and distance markings in  
the terminals to extra security and service 
personnel guiding passengers through  
the airport.
we mothballed 40% of the terminal area 
and combined operations to give passengers 
this was the case, for example, with the 
second phase of pier e, marking the end  
of the single largest capacity project for  
decades. the new pier includes flexible 
stands and gates served by boarding bridges, 
flexible bus gates, taxiways, stands and a 
new passport control area. the spacious  
pier is adorned with william soya’s ceiling- 
installed sculpture donated by the danish 
arts foundation and kolding municipality. 
the pier has proven invaluable in the safe 
handling of passengers during the pandemic. 
overall, in 2020 we reduced the cost of in-
vestments and building projects by around 
dkk 800 million.
but we still have our eye on the future. in 
october, cph and danish netcompany 
founded the joint venture smarter airports 
a/s to develop a new, market-leading digital 
platform for efficient operation of the air-
ports of the future. cph and netcompany 
will together invest up to dkk 200 million in 
the company. once the solution has been 
incorporated in copenhagen in 2021, the 
aim is to sell the system to airports all over 
the world and create a new revenue stream 
for cph.  
collaboration with airlines and partners
there has been close contact and collabora-
tion between cph, the airlines and our part-
ners throughout the corona crisis.
before the crisis, 150 stores and food outlets 
were open in and around the terminals. at 
the end of the year, there were just nine. 
throughout the year, cph worked with our 
partners to get through the crisis as well as 
possible. opening times were revised and 
new agreements negotiated with most part-
ners. when the pandemic grounded aircrafts 
in the spring, the airport did not impose 
parking charges.
in the first quarter of 2021, cph agreed with 
the airlines to focus on the restart and adjust 
the agreement for the period 2019-2023 on 
the charges paid to use the airport. the ad-
justed agreement addresses the unintended 
6 
6 
the pig picture / from board & management
consequences that covid-19 has had for the 
assumptions underlying the charges agree-
ment. this has created calm and balance for 
both cph and the airlines up to and includ-
ing 2023.
cph co-founder of green fuels  
for denmark
we do not yet know the full extent of the 
corona crisis or how long it will last. aviation 
was one of the first sectors to be hit by the 
crisis and will be among the last to come out 
on the other side. yet climate change is a 
challenge that we as businesses and as a  
society will have to deal with for many years 
to come, whatever the circumstances.  
in 2020, we entered into several promising 
partnerships that will help to ensure the de-
velopment of sustainable fuels in denmark 
and the zero-emissions airport of the future. 
we announced the innovative green fuels 
for denmark partnership, which also includes 
a.p. møller - mærsk, dsv panalpina, dfds, 
sas, nel, everfuel, haldor topsøe and Ørsted. 
as part of the danish government’s climate 
partnership with the aviation industry, we 
presented an ambitious plan to achieve sig-
nificant co2 reductions as early as 2030. as a 
result, we can now see more clearly the route 
to zero-emissions aviation in 2050.
in october, a consortium led by copenhagen 
airport with 14 european partners and the 
danish technological institute won an eu 
grant of close to eur 12 million to create  
the sustainable airport of the future.  
the alight project will develop solutions for 
airports to be able to operate without any 
carbon emissions and deliver infrastructure 
for carbon-neutral aircraft. 
europe’s best airport
on 9 march 2020 – just a few days before 
denmark locked down and closed its borders 
– passengers voted cph “europe’s best air-
port 2019” in the annual international surv ey 
of passenger satisfaction conducted by aci, 
the international trade organisation for 
airports.
we can still be europe’s best airport on the 
other side of the coronavirus pandemic when 
we are able to travel for business and leisure 
and experience the world again. cph will still 
be a safe and efficient airport for customers 
and passengers, ensuring its position as a 
driver of economic growth and a hub con-
necting denmark to the rest of the world. 
we are well positioned for the road to 
recovery.

social & climate-related results
the number of occupational injuries for  
cph employees per million working hours 
fell to 5.4 from 7.9 in 2019. this result has 
been achieved in a year where cph has had 
to continuously adjust and rapidly adapt our 
operations among other due to new and 
changing covid-19 guidelines from the 
danish authorities. 
in the months of march, april and may, there 
were no occupational injuries among cph 
employees. in total, the number of occupa-
tional injuries for cph employees was 21  
in 2020, down from 33 in 2019. 
in 2020, our annual energy savings more 
than doubled relative to 2019.  
through two major energy-saving projects 
in particular, we were able to take a further 
important step towards our 2030 goal 
of emission- free airport operations and 
ground transport. 
in 2020, we upheld our aca accreditation 
as a carbon-neutral airport. this means 
that the emissions over which cph has 
control have remained carbon-neutral 
throughout the year. the accreditation 
was received in 2019 as the culmination 
of many years’ climate and environmental 
work. the remaining emissions continue to 
be offset through a climate and develop-
ment project in laos. 
our ambition remains to achieve completely 
emission-free airport operations and ground 
transport at cph in 2030 without offsetting. 
worldwide, 62 airports have achieved a 
carbon neutrality accreditation under the 
airport carbon accreditation scheme.
we installed additional solar panels in 
2020, securing our total solar power 
capacity of 1.8 mwp, which is equivalent 
to the annual electricity consumption of 
more than 400 households. 
the electricity generated from our solar 
panels in 2020 covered 0.89% of cph’s 
total electricity consump tion.

the big picture / the annual report in five minutes
the coronavirus pandemic has triggered the 
worst crisis for aviation and copenhagen 
airports in living memory. the dramatic drop 
in flight operations and passengers is threat-
ening both our business areas: aeronautical 
and non-aeronautical. 
the aeronautical business comprises 
infrastructure and air traffic-related services – 
everything from route development, baggage 
systems and security checks to operation and 
development of technology, terminals, it, 
shuttle buses, aircraft stands and runways. 
the non-aeronautical business covers activ-
ities such as parking, restaurants and stores 
in the terminals, hotel operation and leasing 
of premises in the airport area. 
before the corona crisis hit, around 1,000 
companies were operating within the air-
port’s economic ecosystem, including airlines, 
builders, shops, restaurants, car rentals and 
the handling companies that take care of 
aeronautical processes from check-in and 
boarding to baggage and parked aircraft on 
the airlines’ behalf.
the total value created by cph’s aeronautical 
and non-aeronautical businesses is essential to 
our ability to invest in developing the airport, 
strengthening denmark’s connectivity and 
safeguarding reasonable returns for cph’s 
shareholders, including the danish state. but 
the coronavirus pandemic has turned profit to 
loss and increased our debt, which will limit 
our ability to invest for the foreseeable future.  
business environment & model
cph’s hub status 
under pressure
cph is a regulated private company that owns, operates and 
develops copenhagen airport and roskilde airport. the corona crisis 
presents a challenge to the airport’s most important social mandate: 
to strengthen denmark’s connectivity to the world and promote 
sustainable travel. the significantly increased competition for routes 
and passengers in the wake of the corona crisis may challenge our 
position as northern europe’s most important transport hub.

the big picture / business environment & model
business framework
cph is regulated in accordance with danish 
and eu law. where the aeronautical business 
is concerned, the airlines pay to use the 
aeronautical facilities, such as security, based 
on a commercially negotiated multi-year 
charges agreement. the current agreement 
runs until the end of 2023. 
the charges negotiated are subject to approval 
by the danish transport, construction and 
housing authority.
naturally, the charges agreement process 
could not have envisaged the unprecedented 
drop in passenger numbers caused by the 
pandemic, which has brought about a situ-
ation where the fundamental principles and 
assumptions on which the agreement has 
been based are now detached from reality.
the same applies to a number of incentive 
agreements intended to strengthen the 
airlines’ existing business and maintain cph’s 
position as scandinavia’s leading hub. the 
programmes did not take account of the 
industry effectively having to restart.
the latest (2017) revision of the charges 
regulations (bl9-15), which came into effect 
on 1 january 2018, provided for a midterm 
evaluation by 2021. 
in 2020, cph entered into dialogue with 
the airlines, and in the first quarter of 2021 
agreed with them to focus on restarting the 
hub and to adjust the agreement for the 
period 2021-2023 on the charges paid to  
use the airport. 
the adjusted agreement addresses the un - 
intended consequences covid-19 has had 
for the assumptions underlying the charges 
agreement. the changes have rebalanced the 
agreement to the benefit of both cph and 
the airlines up to and including 2023. 
a highly competitive  
business environment 
for many years, cph has worked closely 
with airlines and other parties to develop 
a substantial route network in and out of 
copenhagen. but the coronavirus pandemic 
has stopped international travel.
the competition to recover lost routes has 
increased the already tough competition 
in the aviation industry – between both 
airlines and airports. cph is competing 
with european airports such as amsterdam, 
brussels, frankfurt, zurich, stockholm and 
the new berlin airport to attract routes and 
airlines and win back those it has lost.
cph therefore has to maintain the financial 
strength to continue investing in the sustain-
able airport of the future and offering the 
airlines efficient operations and close cooper-
ation. cph needs to be attractive for network 
carriers, long-haul operators to the us, asia 
and africa, and low-cost airlines serving  
destinations in europe.
sustainable travel
in the words of cph’s purpose: “let’s travel 
together to a better tomorrow." 
this is cph’s call to join forces to create the 
industry of the future.
we do not yet know the full extent of the 
corona crisis or how long it will last. aviation 
was one of the first sectors to be hit by the 
crisis and will be among the last to come 
out on the other side. yet climate change is 
a challenge that we as businesses and as a 
society will have to deal with for many years 
to come, whatever the circumstances. today, 
cph has just as great a responsibility to make 
the transport sector sustainable as we did 
before the coronavirus pandemic struck.

the big picture / business environment & model
the strategy architects of the future airport 
takes its starting point in cph’s social mission: 
to bring the world closer to denmark with 
direct routes and to sustainably transform 
aviation. this mission has not changed.
the strategy is based on three main principles: 
customer focus, innovation and simplification. 
these principles tie together the six focus 
areas, our take-offs. many of the activities in 
the take-offs are temporarily on hold while we 
focus on creating a safe journey through the 
airport for passengers and on working with 
the airlines to re-establish the route network.
as an extension of the new business strategy, 
in may 2020 cph implemented a comprehen-
sive reorganisation that reflects the strategic 
strands of the business strategy – all this 
despite the corona crisis. clear roles and re-
sponsibilities will ensure that the organisation 
is able to efficiently and more easily execute 
on the strategic focus areas that will guide 
cph’s business in the coming years.
business strategy
we are still  
architects of the  
future airport
in 2019, the new strategy for copenhagen airports was 
launched under the name “architects of the future airport”. 
the corona pandemic has put many of the strategy’s activities 
on hold until aviation emerges on the other side of the crisis. 
but the objectives remain the same: to create a future-proof, 
innovative airport.
take-off 1
expand our positive role  
in society and contribute  
to sustainable travel  
cph wants to be a valued neigh-
bour and fulfil our role in society as 
the international airport for all of 
denmark. cph will take responsibil-
ity for a sustainable transformation 
of the airport.
take-off 2
take the passenger journey  
and retail experience to  
the next level 
cph will ensure that passengers 
have the best possible experience 
at copenhagen airport, incorporat-
ing new services and digital solu-
tions. in 2020, there was increased 
focus on safety and health.
take-off 3
build cph for the  
next generation  
many investments have been 
put on hold. however, we have 
kick-started the political process 
around new legislation that will 
create the platform for the continued 
development of the airport. with 
support from the airlines, we want to 
shift the airport’s third runway – the 
so-called cross-wind runway – east-
wards. this will make it possible to 
remodel the airport with all facilities 
under one roof and create space for 
future modern aircraft types, which 
are more fuel-efficient and less noisy.
take-off 4
develop the skills and  
organisation of the future 
given the low number of pas-
sengers and significantly reduced 
activity level, the corona crisis has 
provided cph with the opportunity 
to use this "down time" to further 
train and upskill the majority of our 
employees, improving existing skills 
and developing new skills for the 
jobs of the future.
take-off 5
create a digital and  
data-driven airport  
intelligent and innovative use of 
data and digital solutions is vital for 
us to be able to run an attractive 
and efficient airport. this work is 
ongoing, including in relation to 
take-off 6.
take-off 6
build new revenue streams  
based on our core strengths  
cph wants to develop new sources 
of income to secure the resources 
required to drive the transformation 
of the airport. the corona crisis has 
made it even more important to 
develop new business areas. cph 
and netcompany have founded the 
joint venture smarter airports a/s, 
which will develop a new, market- 
leading digital platform for efficient 
operation of the airports of the 
future. once the solution has been 
incorporated in copenhagen, the 
aim is to sell the system to airports 
around the world.

the big picture / business strategy
outlook
outlook  
for 2021
global aviation continues to face significant 
uncertainty from the ongoing covid-19 
pandemic as well as other factors such as 
economic uncertainty and climate change.
the pandemic will continue to affect the 
number of flights and passengers in 2021, 
both in terms of leisure and business travel. 
airlines have announced that they will con-
tinue to operate with reduced capacity and 
will scale their business based on demand.
due to the structural uncertainty that covid-
19 has created for air travel in denmark 
and the rest of the world, and significant 
uncertainty about how long the situation will 
last, it is currently not possible to make a rea-
sonable assessment of the financial outlook 
for cph. there is still significant uncertainty 
as to how and when travel restrictions will be 
lifted, and it is not therefore possible to give 
an outlook for passenger numbers, revenue, 
pre-tax result and total investments.
as a consequence, cph will continuously 
assess and adjust the level of operating costs 
and investments, and will advise the market 
as and when a meaningful outlook can  
be provided.

performance
the new reality of very few passengers and 
flights meant that in november cph closed 
40% of the terminal area (gates a2-a34).
also in november, airline council international 
(aci) published a global survey of 4,100  
passengers. one of the survey’s findings was 
that three in four people viewed the differing 
quarantine rules around the world as the  
biggest obstacle to travel.
a survey of 1,100 danes was carried out in 
the autumn. half of those questioned cited 
two particular reasons for not travelling: un-
certainty about coronavirus rules and con-
cerns about catching the virus on the journey.
the future of travel is touchless
the coronavirus situation has also increased 
the digital focus in terms of how cph can 
become even better at making passengers’ 
smartphones, tablets and laptops a natural 
part of the journey. 
the same applies to developing digital touch-
less solutions in the airport, which can further 
minimise the risk of infection and improve 
the passenger experience. to start with, a 
touchless solution is being trialled on the 
self-service cuss kiosks for check-in and 
self-service bag drop.
experience with self-service bag drop and check-
in from home, for example, shows that pas-
sengers are very happy to be able to manage 
their journey and time spend themselves. 
interest in travel remained high
despite everything, the dream of being able 
to travel freely again for business and leisure 
stayed alive in 2020 – not least on the air-
port’s facebook page, which saw a high level 
when the corona crisis hit in march, the 
number of passengers nosedived from 
83,000 on a normal day to a low point of 
just 424 on 9 april. in just a few weeks, the 
aviation industry was brought to its knees, 
and efforts to make air travel easy and pre-
dictable for passengers were set back 
decades. 
restoring simple and predictable parameters 
for a safe journey through the airport was to 
be a big challenge in 2020.
over the course of the spring and summer, 
and guided by the slogan “let’s travel with 
care”, the airport embraced everything from 
face masks, hand sanitiser, plexiglass, extra 
cleaning and distance markings in the termi-
nals to extra security and service personnel 
guiding passengers through the terminals, 
not to mention an extensive campaign on 
our website and social media. 
passengers felt safe – and were a little sad
the dramatic reduction in passenger num-
bers meant that cph was not able to carry 
out the usual extensive surveys of passenger 
beha viour and satisfaction in 2020. however, 
random samples of passengers surveyed 
during the year point to a high level of satis-
faction and confidence in the many corona 
measures that were put in place.
the surveys also show that business travellers 
still accounted for slightly more than one 
third of passengers. however, the remainder 
were not holidaymakers, as was the case 
before the corona crisis: most non-business 
travellers were danes and foreigners making 
important family visits.
at the same time, passengers said they were 
sad to see the terminals so empty. before the 
crisis, there were 150 stores and food outlets; 
by the end of the year, there were just nine. 
passengers
let’s travel  
with care… 
fear of catching the virus while travelling, confusing and 
conflicting coronavirus rules in every country, ever-changing 
travel restrictions and the prospect of a long spell of 
quarantine kept 75% of passengers at home in 2020.  
cph launched the “let’s travel with care” initiative.
of engagement from its 185,000 followers. 
posts on practical corona-related information 
and the monthly flight and passenger figures 
were read most frequently.
during the corona crisis, 23-35% of cph’s 
facebook followers have viewed its posts,  
europe’s most disability- 
friendly airport
in november 2020, industry organisation  
aci named cph europe’s most disability- 
friendly and accessible airport.
one of cph’s innovations in 2020 was the 
sunflower lanyard, which is available to 
passengers with special needs and hidden 
disabilities to show that they need a little extra 
help or time. the initiative has since been 
extended to all denmark’s major airports.
another new feature is assistance for persons 
with reduced mobility (prm) in the form of 
custom-made two-person bicycles. this is a less 
energy-consuming form of transportation that 
also gives prms a unique travel experience while 
getting a feel for the danish bicycle culture.

a new normal of testing
on 15 june, capital region of denmark 
opened a covid-19 test centre at the airport 
– initially on the airport plaza and, since july, 
in one of the parking areas adjacent to the 
metro. later in the year, falck was able to 
offer passengers rapid antigen and pcr tests 
in the airport. in just a few months, face 
masks, hand sanitiser and frequent testing 
almost became a natural part of what re-
mains of travel.
throughout the autumn, cph worked on a 
common european corona passport to restore 
confidence among passengers and ensure 
that air travel does not spread infection from 
one country to another.
light at end of the tunnel
aviation was one of the first sectors to be hit 
by the corona crisis and will be among the 
last to come out on the other side. when we 
do, it will be important to build on our strong 
points to regain our position.  
on 9 march 2020 – a few days before 
denmark locked down and closed its borders 
– passengers voted cph “europe’s best air-
port 2019” in the annual international survey 
of passenger satisfaction conducted by aci, the 
international trade organisation for airports.
we can be this again on the other side of the 
coronavirus pandemic, when people in 
denmark and around the world are vaccinat-
ed so we can get back to a more normal real-
ity in 2021 – one that once again allows us 
to travel and experience. despite everything, 
there is light at the end of the corona tunnel.

the authorities’ approval of the first covid-19 
vaccine and the subsequent launch of the 
national vaccination programme on 27 
december were without doubt the best  
news in a year with a tsunami of bad news 
for aviation and copenhagen airports.
in 2020, the aeronautical segment of the business 
went into near free fall. not since 1970 have so 
few passengers passed through the terminals at 
copenhagen airport. back then, the number was 
6.8 million; in 2020, it was 7.5 million, a stag - 
gering 22.7 million fewer than the year before.
revenue fell by 71.2% to dkk 695.4 million. 
this was the main reason why copenhagen 
airports a/s ended the year with an overall 
pre-tax loss of dkk 828 million, which is 
within the expectation communicated on 12 
november 2020.
normally, there are around 720 take-offs and 
landings every day at cph. during the corona 
crisis, from mid-march through to december, 
the average daily number fell to 170 in 
december, and on those flights the number 
of seats sold fell to around 40%.
nevertheless, the new vaccines brought hope 
that things would change and that the world 
would slowly reopen to air travel around the 
summer of 2021.

passenger  
numbers at 1970 
levels in 2020 
emergency flights and 9 april
in the first hectic weeks following the closure 
of denmark’s borders on 14 march, the focus 
was on special flights carrying personal 
protective equipment (ppe) and emergency 
flights repatriating thousands of danes 
stranded all over the world.
despite the lockdown, cph quickly re- estab-
lished parts of the network, including the 
majority of domestic routes and the interna-
tional routes to greenland, the faroe islands 
and a number of major european destinations.
the low point for the airport was 9 april, 
when we had just 424 passengers, compared 
to the usual 83,000 per day. after this, things 
were very quiet up to 25 june, which saw  
the introduction of a new model for travel 
guidelines that allowed journeys to countries 
with low infection (up to 30 new weekly 
cases per 100,000 people).
in july, the new travel guidelines brought a 
certain amount of optimism and joy of travel, 
with an average of 18,000 passengers passing 
through the terminals every day. this was 
significantly more than in the previous month, 
though still far fewer than in july 2019, when 
there were 100,000 passengers daily.
in the late autumn, a second wave of covid-19 
hit and the world went back into red and 
orange in the authorities’ travel guidelines.  
on thursday 29 october, greece and norway 
were the last countries to be declared orange 
and once again the advice was to avoid all 
non-essential travel to anywhere in the world.
smaller decline for domestic traffic
the international aviation crisis badly affected 
the whole of europe, with a decline in 
denmark of 75%. air traffic between 
countries was hit hardest, while in many 
countries domestic traffic fared slightly 
better.
cph is traditionally an international airport 
with lots of connections to europe and the 
rest of the world. domestic traffic, by contrast, 
is less prominent given denmark’s small size. 
all the same, as the world shut down, the 
domestic share of all traffic increased from 
5% at the start of the crisis to 17% in 
december.
while the number of passengers in europe 
and on long-haul routes fell by 76% and 
77% respectively, cph lost 59% of passen-
gers on its domestic routes in 2020.
the top 10 of destinations underwent a real 
shake-up during the year of coronavirus.  
for many years, london had clearly been the  
most popular destination out of copenhagen. 
however, as the pandemic worsened during 
the autumn and the highly contagious british 
coronavirus variant spread across the world, 
traffic to the british capital shrank. in december, 
london dropped to sixth place on the list, 
surpassed by, among others, danish destina-
tions such as aalborg and rønne. 
in 2020, copenhagen airports saw passenger numbers at 1970 levels. 
with just two normal months, january and february, the annual number 
of passengers at cph fell by 75% to a 50-year low. during the coronavirus 
period, departures and arrivals per day shrank from 720 to just 170 in 
december. cph’s aeronautical revenue fell by 71.2% to dkk 695.4 million. 
now cph is preparing to rebuild the route network and restore earnings.

route network needs rebuilding
the airlines have been badly hit by the crisis 
and have the majority of their fleets parked up 
at airports around the world, including 
copenhagen airport. the airlines have needed 
massive capital injections in the form of state 
aid or additional loans and credit.
before the crisis hit, sas was the largest 
operator, with 33% of traffic. this was 
followed by norwegian with 17%, ryanair 
with 8% and easyjet with 6%. during the 
corona crisis, sas and ryanair maintained 
their shares over the year, while norwegian 
and easyjet fell to 10% and 4% respectively.
over the year, cph maintained continuous 
close dialogue with the airlines, which all 
expressed their continued interest in flying 
into and out of copenhagen.

fierce competition expected
as the world gradually opens up again in 2021, 
it is expected that there will be fierce competi-
tion between countries and airports to attract 
airlines and re-establish route networks. 
the combination of short-haul northern 
european routes and long-haul intercontinental 
routes is vital for strengthening cph’s position 
as a traffic hub. this gives more northern 
european travellers the option to fly via 
copenhagen airport and out into the world 
– rather than flying via other hubs such as 
amsterdam, frankfurt and london.
re-establishing the route network, and retaining 
and protecting our position, will be among 
our most important priorities in 2021.

a very busy year at roskilde
traffic at roskilde airport (rke) was not hit  
as hard by covid-19. the number of oper-
ations increased by around 14%, driven by 
pilot training and private flights. rke main-
tained its position as denmark’s preferred 
training venue for pilots, with around  
35,000 training flights a year.
roskilde airport is a small exclusive “general 
aviation” airport, with an attractive location 
near copenhagen. around 2,000 private 
business jets use rke every year – though 
there were significantly fewer during the 
covid-19 pandemic.
the airport was once again recognised for  
its handling of business aviation by european 
business air news in its reader survey cover-
ing more than 400 fixed-base operators in 
europe, africa, the middle east and russia.
in addition to its flight-related personal ser-
vice to customers, roskilde also offers confer-
ence facilities and has been the setting for 
various events, including film recordings.
at rke, the engine maintenance company 
dao has a test cell for testing large aircraft 
engines. this is helping to limit noise. rke has 
also converted the runway lighting on both 
landing runways to led energy-efficient lights.
crucial air cargo operations continued
air carriage of personal protective equipment 
(ppe) and test kits was vital in the first month 
of the corona crisis. on 8 april, one of the 
world’s largest cargo airplanes, the near 
70-metre-long antonov an-124, touched 
down in kastrup. it was chartered by maersk 
and danish regions to fly ppe to denmark.
it is essential that denmark can keep its 
exports going and continue to trade with  
the rest of the world. throughout 2020, air 
cargo operated at a stable, albeit lower level. 
the volume of air cargo fell by 35% to 
223,243 tonnes.  
cargo included exports of pharmaceutical 
products, semi-manufactured pro ducts and 
foodstuffs to most of the world, while in  
the first half of the year especially denmark 
imported large volumes of ppe. 
normally, as much as 80% of the cargo 
capacity is belly cargo on the large inter-
continental passenger aircraft flying long-
haul routes. but as the majority of pas - 
senger routes were closed or significantly  
less frequently flown, a new type of cargo 
air -craft emerged, “preighters”. these are 
passenger aircraft that solely or primarily 
carry air cargo and only a few passengers.

performance / aeronautical business
revenue from the non-aeronautical segment 
of the business is essential to copenhagen 
airport’s finances and ability to invest and 
develop the future airport.
the charges that the airlines pay for using 
the airport make up around 60% of total 
revenue, but only around 20% of earnings 
(at ebit level). thus, the non-aeronautical 
segment of the business, including the 
non-aeronautical business
empty terminals  
and car parks  
during the crisis
shopping centre, parking and leasing, 
accounts for around 80% of profits.
pressure on the commercial segment of the 
business is challenging cph’s position as a 
hub, as there is a lack of money for invest-
ment and development. 
flexible reopening of the shopping centre
before the corona crisis really hit denmark in 
the corona crisis severely affected non-aeronautical 
business, which includes leasing of shops and 
restaurants, leasing of premises, parking and hotel 
operation. many companies either cut back on staff 
or closed. for cph, this meant a decline of 54.4% in 
non-aeronautical revenue, which is essential to our 
ability to invest and develop the airport. a plan is  
in place for flexible reopening. 
9
shops and food outlets open in december 
versus 150 before coronavirus
march, there were 150 stores, kiosks, food 
outlets and restaurants in operation. in spring, 
just four stayed open offering food and drink 
to passengers. at the turn of the year, 9 were 
open.
throughout the year, cph worked with it's 
partners to get through the crisis as well as 
possible. opening times were revised and 
new agreements negotiated with most 
partners. but not all will be returning when 
flights are restored and passengers start 
filling the terminals and car parks once again. 
in collaboration with our partners, we are 
working with a flexible plan to ensure that 
shops and food outlets that open – whether 
existing or new – are of the right type and  
in the right number for the customers in the 
terminals.

ment services (tms) and energy. prm, tms and energy are non-profit sources of revenue for cph. 
parking, hotel operation and leasing
in addition to the shopping centre, non- 
aeronautical revenue is also generated by 
parking, leasing of premises and land, and 
hotel operation. here, too, the corona crisis 
had a big impact.
fewer passengers meant correspondingly 
fewer people parking, hence revenue from 
the airport’s more than 10,000 parking spaces 
fell by 67.2%, from dkk 403.9 million to 
dkk 132.6 million.
as many partners operating at copenhagen 
airport experienced dwindling business, the 
need to rent offices/facilities at cph was also 
reduced. however, lease revenue was on a 
par with the year before: dkk 181.3 million.
the hotel business was also affected by 
corona in 2020, with international tourists 
few and far between. in 2017, cph joined 
with strawberry fields a/s to develop a new 
comfort airport hotel and a conference 
centre shared with the neighbouring clarion 
hotel. the new complex, offering a total of 
1,000 rooms, will open in 2021.the year

copenhagen airports 
international a/s (cai) is a 
100% owned subsidiary of 
cph providing advisory and 
management services to 
airports and airport investors.
during 2020, cph 
international was active with 
clients in mexico, colombia 
and turkey. in addition, 
cph international provided 
resources to the smarter 
airports a/s joint venture 
launched in october. 
however, the covid-19 situ-
ation significantly affected 
cph international’s business 
due to the reduction and 
postponement of projects 
and activities by its client 
airports. consequently, the 
cph international organisa-
tion was downsized to reflect 
the adverse market situation.

investments reduced 
by dkk 800 million
significantly lower investment, around dkk 800 
million, is planned for 2021. the investment 
resources for 2020 and 2021 have been allo-
cated to the most essential projects, especially 
within the priority areas of safety, security and 
compliance.
several projects have been postponed, while 
a few selected large projects are proceeding 
with revised timeframes because the cost of 
stopping them would be too high. in some 
cases, the construction period will instead 
extend over a longer period.
this means that the planned 66,000 m2 ex-
pansion of baggage reclaim and the terminal 
area airside will be phased over several years.
the airport of the future still has wings
we are anticipating that passengers will return 
on a growth path following the corona crisis. 
we are therefore continuing to work on 
planning the future airport. 
the flexible development of cph will be imple-
mented within the framework of our climate 
strategy, maintaining cph as an efficient 
airport for our customers and passengers, and 
securing our position as a driver of economic 
growth and a hub connecting denmark to  
the rest of the world.
the authorities are currently processing our 
application for new legislation to be enacted 
for the continued development of the airport. 
with support from the airlines, we want to re-
locate the airport’s third runway – the so-called 
crosswind runway – meaning that aircrafts using 
this runway will no longer be flying in and out 
over the residential areas west of the airport. 
the changes to the crosswind runway will 
create space to further develop the airport 
with all facilities under one roof – close to 
public transport – and provide more space  
for future modern aircraft types, which are 
more fuel-efficient and less noisy.

phase 2 of pier e 
the final 10,000 m2 of a total of 38,000 m² 
were completed in october. the inauguration  
of the second phase of pier e marked the end  
of the single largest capacity project for many 
decades. the new pier includes flexible stands 
and gates served by boarding bridges, flexible 
bus gates, taxiways, stands and a new passport 
control. the spacious pier is adorned by william 
soya’s ceiling-installed sculpture donated by the 
danish arts foundation and kolding municipality.

terminal 3 expansion 
the project, involving an additional 66,000 m² 
for passengers, passport control, logistics and 
baggage reclaim, is an extension after the  
central security check. the construction will  
be phased, and the timeframe for the first devel-
opment stage has been extended from 2024  
to 2027 as a consequence of the corona crisis.

new check-in area 
the project, involving new check-in counters 
and baggage drop, has been put on hold.

hotel and a conference centre shared with 
the neighbouring clarion hotel. the new

will open in 2021.

new baggage-handling facility 
the installation of new 3d scanners for 
outbound baggage was completed in 
2020. the construction of a new facility  
for outbound baggage will be complete in 
summer 2021. the facade of the 10,000 
m² building is in recycled aluminium to 
reduce the carbon footprint. 
6
car park 
once the shell for the 2,330-space car  
park for employees and passengers has 
been built, the project will be postponed 
for completion in 2022. 
prior to the corona crisis, cph was investing more than dkk 2 billion 
annually in developing the airport. many projects are now on hold or 
postponed. in 2020, planned investments were reduced by around 
dkk 800 million. the aim is still to be one of the world’s most 
efficient, sustainable and service-oriented airports.

corporate responsibility
crisis management  
and focus on  
sustainable 
transition
copenhagen airport has an obligation to handle 
air traffic at all times, even amid a global pan-
demic and severe economic crisis.  
 
our primary focus has been on safeguarding 
operations and simultaneously ensuring cph 
remains a safe, infection-free airport and a 
good place to work.
to protect as many jobs as possible for as long 
as possible, we utilised the financial support 
packages agreed by the government, parlia-
ment and labour market parties in the spring 
of 2020. this made a big difference and gave 
us breathing space to take the right decisions. 
but the expectation that the world would open 
a little over the summer unfortunately was sig-
nificantly below expectations. credit facilities 
were secured and cph continued to operate 
even when spending double-digit millions of 
kroner every month throughout the year.
as the government financial support packages 
expired and the airport’s economic crisis 
worsened, we were forced to reduce the 
number of full-time employees by a total of 
772 out of 2,617 and find cost savings of 
equivalent to 280 jobs through division of 
labour, competence development and solidary 
schemes, corresponding to annual savings  
of approximately dkk 500 million.
upholding our climate goals
the aviation industry remains under pressure 
– both globally and in denmark. the future  
is uncertain and difficult to predict. one thing 
that has not changed is the need to adapt 
our sector in the light of climate change, 
which is why cph is upholding the climate 
strategy and targets we set in 2019. 
in 2020, we entered into several promising 
partnerships that will help to ensure the de-
velopment of sustainable fuels in denmark 
and the zero-emissions airport of the future. 
as part of the danish government’s climate 
partnership with the aviation industry, we 
presented an ambitious plan to achieve sig-
nificant co2 reductions as early as 2030.  
as a result, we can now see more clearly the 
route to zero-emissions aviation in 2050.
let’s travel together to a better tomorrow
cph’s purpose and vision to be the architects 
of the future airport also involves being 
aware of how the company can contribute 
solutions to the biggest global challenges.
therefore, back in 2018, we started working 
with the un sustainable development goals 
(sdgs), drawing up – based on our cr  
stra tegy – a gross list of the goals we work 
with at cph.  
 
we matched our cr initiatives with the un 
targets and carried out a materiality analysis, 
which resulted in a prioritised list of the sdgs 
the covid-19 pandemic cast a shadow over cph and the aviation 
industry in 2020. our corporate responsibility (cr) efforts put 
extra focus on the staff affected, employees in the many airport 
businesses and the local community. cph also maintained focus  
on the climate in a year that offered strong partnerships,  
pointing towards a sustainable future.
where cph has the greatest negative and 
positive impact – and where stakeholders 
have the highest demands/strongest inter-
ests. on this basis, we selected the four  
sdgs below. 
 
as a follow-up to cph’s new business stra tegy, 
which positions corporate responsibility more 
centrally in the day-to-day work and strategic 
initiatives, the cr strategy was due for update 
in 2020. this was postponed to 2021 because 
of the corona crisis. part of the update will 
involve revisiting the sdgs with a view to 
sharpening our efforts and integrating the 
goals more tightly in our business.

air travel generates economic, human and 
cultural value. but aviation also contributes  
to global co2 emissions and climate change. 
this must be addressed. a sustainable transi-
tion is vital for enabling us to retain the posi-
tive aspects of being able to travel and do 
business between countries and continents. 
as a leading company in the danish aviation 
sector, cph has a special responsibility to 
contribute to a sustainable transition. although 
2020 was a year when we were compelled  
to put virtually all non-business-critical invest-
ments on hold, we nevertheless managed to 
make progress towards our climate targets  
for 2030 and 2050. 
a joint plan for sustainable aviation
as part of the government’s climate partner-
ship for aviation, in may 2020 the sector and 
climate
cph in strong
climate partnerships 
although the aviation industry’s ability to invest in a sustainable  
transition has been challenged by the economic crisis triggered by  
the pandemic, cph is maintaining a high level of ambition. in 2020,  
we engaged in strong climate partnerships and are working to  
cultivate political support for initiatives that can make aviation  
a sustainable form of transport. this bodes well for the future.
cph submitted a joint plan outlining 33 con-
crete initiatives that can contribute to meet-
ing the political target of a 70% reduction in 
co2 emissions from domestic air traffic in 
2030 compared to 1990. 
in addition, the sector has unilaterally com-
mitted to reducing co2 emissions from inter-
national air traffic by 30% by 2030 compared 
to 2017. the goal is climate-neutral aviation 
by 2050. 
developing new fuels based on sustainable 
energy – known as “power-to-x (ptx) fuels” 
– requires massive investments. sustainable 
aviation fuels such as biofuel are already 
available, but in extremely small quantities 
and at high cost. 
the technology is established, but production 
needs to be scaled up and the price brought 
down so that the green alternatives become 
competitive with the fossil fuels used today. 
this requires a political resolution to provide 
effective framework conditions so that pro-
ducers are willing to invest in large-scale  
projects and the aviation and transport sector 
is able to purchase the sustainable fuels.
establishing the aviation climate foundation 
is a key part of the climate partnership’s 
action plan. the foundation will help to fi-
nance the transition to the more expensive, 
sustainable aviation fuels by means of a cli-
mate contribution of dkk 20-30 on each 
local departing passenger from danish air-
ports. this will enable the industry itself to 
make a sustainable contribution to the green 
transition in aviation.

nership’s report and recommendations (in 
danish), please visit www.dansk-luftfart.dk.  
ptx – the green fuels of the future
for aviation and large parts of the heavy 
transport sector, the strategy for the green 
transition is closely connected with the devel-
opment of ptx fuels. 
during the first lockdown, we invited kindergartens in tårnby 
municipality to come on a tour of the airport, ensuring safe 
distancing and providing plenty of hand sanitiser. the potential 
employees and passengers of our future sustainable airport 
visited twice a week in may.
ptx is a generic term for the conversion 
of electricity into hydrogen via electro lysis, 
and subsequently into synthetic liquid or 
gaseous fuels or synthetic chemicals. in 
combination with co2, hydrogen made 
from renewable energy sources can be 
used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

in november 2020, cph joined with the 
energy industry trade association dansk 
energi and 16 of denmark’s biggest compa-
nies in submitting concrete recommendations 
for a national ptx strategy. the recommenda-
tions were presented to minister for climate 
dan jørgensen at a conference in the vilhelm 
lauritzen terminal at copenhagen airport.

a vision for the future 
in 2020, we were further able to announce the 
innovative green fuels for denmark partner-
ship, which also includes a.p. møller - mærsk, 
dsv panalpina, dfds, sas, nel, everfuel, 
haldor topsøe and Ørsted. the partnership, 
which represents both the supply and demand 
sides, plans to build one of the world’s largest 
ptx electrolysis plants to produce sustainable 
fuels for lorries, ships and aircraft. 
the vision is to develop the project in three 
stages over the next 10 years. the first stage 
will involve a 10 mw electrolyser plant to 
produce renewable hydrogen for buses  
and lorries. 
the second stage will see the facility expand-
ed to 250 mw and capture of sustainable 
co2 linked to the process to be able to pro-
duce renewable methanol for waterborne 
transport and sustainable jet fuel for aircraft. 
when completed, the 1.3 gw facility could 
potentially supply 30% of the fuel we expect 
to need for the aircraft at copenhagen 
airport by 2030.

on the way to zero-emissions  
operations in 2030
despite the severe economic crisis at cph,  
we have continued working towards zero- 
emissions airport operations and implement-
ed several energy-saving projects in 2020.
these included installing a large heat pump 
in magleby to create a sector-linked energy 
system with a capacity equivalent to the 
heating consumption of about 130 house-
holds. the heat pump runs on solar-generated 
energy and second-quality water.
at the same time, we have improved control 
of our groundwater cooling system, which 
now integrates better with our internal dis-
trict heating system. the project has resulted 
in an energy saving of approximately 5 gwh 
and means that 100% of the heating sup-
plied to the terminals at copenhagen airport 
in summer now comes from our own heat 
pumps on the coastal road. 
in 2020, we were also able to add an extra 
photovoltaic system on the roof of the head 
office building. this means we now have 
a total of 9,300 m2 of solar cells, which have  
a total production capacity of 1.8 mwp.  
in 2020, our solar panels produced enough 
electricity to cover 0.89% of cph’s total elec-
tricity consumption. the electricity produced 
from the new solar cells goes directly to an 
electrical panel that powers eight of our 
newly purchased electric vehicles.
due to the reduction in traffic, some of our 
terminal areas were mothballed in order to 
29 
29 
performance / corporate responsibility / climate
make the operation of the remaining traffic 
as effective as possible. in combination with 
our energy-saving projects, this resulted in a 
substantial reduction in our total energy con-
sumption. in 2020, our energy consumption 
thus fell by 15% to 68 kwh/m2.
combined with our energy-saving measures, 
the low level of activity at the airport meant 
that cph’s co2 emissions fell to 21,702 
tonnes in 2020. despite lower overall emis-
sions, co2 per passenger rose to 3.02 kg in 
2020 from 0.89 kg in 2019 due to the mas-
sive decline in passenger numbers. 
carbon-neutral airport
we maintained our aca accreditation as a 
carbon-neutral airport (level 3+) in 2020. the 
accreditation is based on cph’s many years of 
work on energy and the environment, as well 
as compensation for the residual co2 emis-
sions that cph is responsible for itself at 
copenhagen airport (scope 1 and 2).
the largest source of co2 emissions at 
copenhagen airport is fuel from the aircraft. 
aircraft taking off from and landing at the 
airport have accounted for approximately 
75% of total co2 emissions in the last five 
years. in 2020, the figure fell 
to 64%, equivalent to 95,081 
tonnes of co2 (2019: 276,126 
tonnes of co2). 
alight: a zero-emissions future 
working closely with the danish techn olo-
gical institute, in 2020 a consortium of 16 
european partners headed by cph won an 
eu tender to design the sustainable airport  
of the future. 
with funding of close to dkk 90 million, over 
the next four years the consortium will devel-
op and demonstrate concrete solutions and 
examples of how to facilitate a zero- emissions 
airport and deliver infrastructure for carbon- 
neutral aircraft. the results will lead to best 
practice tools that can inspire across europe.
the alight project – a lighthouse for the intro-
duction of sustainable aviation solutions for the 
future – started formally in november and will 
secure solutions to two overriding challenges: 
the first concerns operations and logistics  
for handling sustainable fuels for aircraft in 
an operational context, including purchasing, 
blending, fuelling, quality control and safety 
processes. 
the second concerns smart energy solutions 
for other airport operations, including in-
creased own production of renewable 
energy, energy storage and electrification.  
a design manual for the aircraft stand of  
the future will also be developed to support  
electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft. 
 
this project has received 
funding from the european 
union’s horizon 2020 re-
search and innovation pro-
gramme under grant agreement no. 957824.

in the spring of 2020, it quickly became 
apparent that covid-19 and the economic 
crisis would have severe consequences, 
particularly for amager. in normal times, 
around 22,000 people work at the 1,000 
or so businesses in and around the airport. 
during the spring, thousands of employees 
were furloughed, and everyday life was 
turned on its head. 
when it became obvious towards the 
summer that redundancies would be 
unavoidable in many companies, tårnby 
municipality took the initiative to open a local 
job and advice centre at the airport, targeted 
specifically at workers in the aviation sector. 
the opening of the local job centre was 
carried out in close cooperation with sas  
and cph. since august, the pop-up centre 
has been extremely busy providing advice  
on training opportunities and new jobs. 
local community & neighbourhood
stronger local partnerships  
in a time of crisis 
for several generations, copenhagen airport has been the focal point for tens of thousands of people  
on the island of amager. the worst aviation crisis in living memory hit the local community very hard.  
for many families, it meant that both parents lost their jobs at the airport. our dialogue with and  
activities in the local community in 2020 were strongly focused on and impacted by the crisis. 
in june, capital region of denmark estab-
lished a coronavirus test centre at the airport 
– initially on the airport plaza and later in one 
of the centrally located outdoor parking areas 
by the entrance to the metro. this provided 
a place for employees, passengers and others 
to be tested for covid-19.
dialogue with neighbours went virtual
in 2020, we held our annual neighbour meet-
ing as a virtual conference, where residents 
were able to put questions to ceo thomas 
woldbye via an online meeting platform. 
although the format was forced on us by the 
circumstances, the event was a success, and 
many local people found time to take part.
during the year, we stepped up communica-
tions via our “kære nabo” (“dear neighbour”) 
local facebook group, with more than 60 
posts. these have been used to provide 
instead, we decided to invite kindergartens in 
tårnby municipality to come on a tour of the 
airport. ensuring that everyone kept a safe 
distance in the shuttle bus and used plenty 
of hand sanitiser, we welcomed groups of 
children twice a week throughout may. these 
days were great fun, with the big fire engines 
proving a favourite with our young visitors. 
passengers donate trees to  
local day-care centres
in 2020, we decided to close our cph 
advantage benefits programme so we can 
concentrate on making the same offers and 
opportunities available to all our passengers. 
members of the scheme were given the 
choice of having their points paid out in cash, 
spending them at the airport or donating 
them to plant trees via the nationwide initia-
tive “danmark planter træer” (“denmark 
plants trees”) and the charity “plant et træ” 
(“plant a tree”). 
thanks to the passengers’ donations, we 
were able to donate dkk 71,562 to the 
tree-planting initiative and dkk 392,414 to 
the charity in 2020. we are working with the 
charity and tårnby and dragør municipalities 
to convert the donations into orchards, for 
example for tårnby municipality’s day-care 
facilities, schools and clubs, and all of dragør 
municipality’s day-care facilities.
the first of the 40 or so orchards were 
planted in a kindergarten in kastrup on  
7 december, which due to covid-19 
unfortunately became a smaller event than 
originally planned.
information about the consequences of the 
economic crisis for the airport, but also about 
use of the runways, climate projects, neighbour 
activities and competitions for members of the 
neighbour group. membership of the group 
has steadily increased from 688 in january to 
more than 1,300 at the end of the year.
an empty airport provided space  
for new activities
the empty terminals with just a few thou-
sand passengers in the spring inspired a 
number of innovations, including a series of 
concerts in the parking area and an evening 
of live music recorded at various locations at 
the airport and broadcast by dr, the danish 
broadcasting corporation.
visitors for our airport tours, which give 
people the chance to go airside at the air-
port, were also thin on the ground in 2020.

far fewer flights meant less noise in 2020. the 
number of aircraft operations fell from 263,411 
in 2019 to 98,239. noise from air traffic is one 
of an airport’s most noticeable environmental 
impacts, which is why we work with several 
partners to manage the noise responsibly. 
twelve measuring stations log the noise 365 
days a year. six of these are in the residential 
areas around the airport, and the other six

cph must reduce  
the airport’s  
environmental 
impact
may and october; however, as air traffic fell dra-
matically when the lockdown started in march 
2020, january, february and march turned out 
to be the three busiest months of the year. in 
these three months traffic was close to normal.
noise exposure is calculated using the tdenl 
method (total day-evening-night level), 
which expresses the level of noise exposure 
from air traffic in a single figure.  
 
cph wants to be a leader in sustainable solutions – including 
in relation to our neighbours and the local environment. 
among other things, we work to reduce noise, improve air 
quality and recycle resources to ensure that the airport’s 
environmental impact is reduced wherever possible. 
within the perimeter fence. there are also two 
mobile measuring stations, which make it pos-
sible to collect supplementary noise data in 
areas without permanent measuring stations.
the corona crisis has changed  
the noise profile
the annual noise exposure is calculated in an 
average 24-hour period for the three months 
with the most flights. this is normally between

the graph shows tdenl in db per month.  
the solid line (max) and the broken line (low) 
indicate the two limit values in the environmental 
approval, each with different action levels. the 
tdenl values were historically low for most of 
the year. however, the yearly tdenl value was 
just 2 db lower than in 2019. this is because the 
yearly tdenl value is calculated for the three 
busiest months, which in 2020 were january, 
february and march, when traffic was close to 
normal (except in the period after 11 march).

based on figures for january, february and 
march, the tdenl in 2020 was calculated at 
143.2 db, almost 2 db lower than in 2019 
(145.1). however, noise exposure was at an 
historic low for the rest of the year. in april, 
the tdenl was 10 db lower than normal.  
the number of take-offs and landings was 
much lower in 2020 than in previous years, 
but the change in runway use to accommo-
date maintenance work also changed the 
noise pattern in some periods. information of 
this nature is communicated via the facebook 
group “kære nabo” ("dear neighbour") and 
the cph flight tracker web portal. 
in 2020, we continued exploring the possibil-
ity of increasing the use of two starting posi-
tions further from housing in the village of 
store magleby when flights take off at night 
from runway 04r. we expect to be able to 
implement this change during 2021. 
improving air quality
cph works to improve air quality in the 
interests of neighbours and the working en-
vironment for employees at the airport. our 
action plan highlights five priorities: phasing 
out diesel vehicles, mapping knowledge 
of ultrafine particles, regulating the use of 
aircraft auxiliary power units (apu), aircraft 
single-engine taxi and respiratory protection. 
in 2020, the share of low-emission equip-
ment operating at cph increased from 70% to 
75%. the target is that all vehicles operating 
at cph should be emission-free by 2030. due 
to the economic challenges caused by the 
covid-19 crisis, we regrettably decided to 
postpone the planned purchase of electric 
shuttle buses. 
in addition, in 2020 we carried out a check of 
the airlines' use of apu. cph local regulations 
allow max. 5 minutes' use of the apu after 
arrival at and before departure from  
the gate. 
we monitored 153 departures and 80% 
complied with regulations. 
it has been emphasised vis-à-vis several air-
lines that compliance with the apu regula-
tions is a prerequisite for operating at 
copenhagen airport.
use of apu must be limited as much as 
possible. at copenhagen airport, the aircraft’s 
auxiliary power units may be used:
 
  for max. 5 minutes after the  
aircraft arrives at the gate
  for max. 5 minutes before the  
aircraft departs from the gate.
 
airline operators should not expect dis pen -
sation from the apu regulations.

drop in the level of nox and no2 
nox is the total of no (nitrogen oxide) and 
no2 (nitrogen dioxide). these gases contrib-
ute to air pollution and are usually produced 
during combustion of fuels, for example 
by vehicle and aircraft engines. there is no 
regulatory air quality limit value for nox in 
denmark. the limit value for no2 is 40 µg/
m3. at copenhagen airport, we measure  
no2 and nox at two measurement stations 
on the perimeter fence, one in the western 
and one in the eastern part of the airport,  
in order to evaluate the potential impact of 
the airport activities on the local community. 
the level of no2 dropped by approximately 
25% in 2020 compared to 2019. this is less 
than the drop in airport-related activities, 
which shows that the airport is not the only 
source of no2 in the local area.
measured concentrations of nox fell by 31% 
in 2020, although this is much less than the 
fall in calculated nox emissions from aircraft 
(66%). again, this is because aircraft at 
the airport are not the sole source of nox 
emissions. other sources include road traffic 
and heating of buildings in the local area, 
which have not experienced the same direct 
reduction in activity level as air traffic.
focus on recycling
fewer passengers in the terminals meant 
less waste: 2,089 tonnes compared to 5,385 
tonnes in 2019. however, the recycling rate 
also fell from 27% to 25%. this is mainly 
because food waste from the food outlets 
in the terminals, staff canteens and other 
kitchens at the airport normally accounts for 
around half of the waste sent for recycling – 
and there was little of this in 2020.
our target is to recycle 60% of waste from 
day-to-day operations by 2023. in 2020, we 
strengthened how cph is organised internally 
and, despite the corona crisis, launched several 
new initiatives. in 2021, we will reassess our 
target and strategy for recycling and introduce 
a sharper focus on the circular economy. this 
may lead to changes in our targets for 2023.
to improve opportunities for sorting more 
types of waste in the terminal areas, we are 
investing in a new type of waste container. 
as well as providing better sorting, this will 
save one in five of the plastic bags currently 
used in the general waste containers. the 
new containers are fitted with sensor technol-
ogy and a solar- powered compression unit, 
which means they can compress the waste 
and indicate when they need to be emptied.

quality-monitoring station west,

tial areas. the orange line illustrates

also in 2020, we set up liquid containers  
in the area before the security checkpoint  
so that passengers can empty their bottles 
and then dispose of them in the new waste 
containers. this measure alone has reduced 
our total waste volume by approx. 40-50 
tonnes a year and increased the recycling rate.

daily working life turned upside down
everyday working life was turned upside down for employees and management 
when the pandemic hit in march. one crucial goal for cph was to protect as 
many jobs as possible – for as long as possible. thanks to crisis management, 
communication and working closely with trade union representatives and  
the authorities, we made it together through a difficult 2020.
the coronavirus pandemic has made great 
demands of both employees and managers 
in terms of flexible crisis management. 
shifting messages on coronavirus guidelines 
for airports, the economic crisis facing all the 
businesses in and around the airport, and the 
ever-changing travel guidance made for a 
totally unpredictable situation, which has 
called for an extraordinary capacity to adapt 
quickly and handle new tasks.
despite the growing crisis, we carried out a 
planned organisational review and change to 
the organisation in the early summer, which 
ensured clear roles and responsibilities so we 
could execute on the new strategy (see page 
15). this made enormous demands of 
employees and management in the individual 
departments and units, where many people 
had been furloughed. 
alongside the significant changes under way, 
managers and employees had to find cash 
savings in the region of dkk 1 billion. on  
top of this, everyone had to come to terms 
with the loss of 772 out of 2,617 positions in 
august and november because of the severe 
economic crisis. credit facilities were secured 
and cph continued to operate even when 
spending double-digit millions of kroner every 
month throughout the year.
lay-offs unavoidable 
from the outset of the crisis, cph set a clear 
goal of safeguarding as many jobs at the 
airport as possible. in the spring, around 
2,200 (1,600 ftes) of 2,600 employees were 
furloughed or put on rotation under the salary 
compensation scheme that the government 
agreed with the labour market parties in march. 
even with traffic and revenue at a minimum, 
a good 40% of the workforce had to be at 
work to ensure we were able to keep the 
airport open and running. furlough and 
salary compensation protected hundreds  
of jobs throughout the spring and summer. 
but the expectation that the world would 
open a little over the summer unfortunately 
was significantly below expectations. 
with the salary compensation scheme being 
phased out, management had to make the 
difficult decision in august to announce 
savings equivalent to cutting 650 full-time 
positions. after negotiations with trade union 
representatives, a total of 625 full-time 
positions were cut through lay-offs, elimi-
nation of vacant positions and voluntary 
redundancies.
what little growth we had seen in july was 
expected to continue in august, but this did 
not happen. over the autumn, the world 
closed down again, and the authorities advised 
against all non-essential international travel.  
as a result, in november cph was forced  
to announce it would have to make further  
cost savings.
following constructive negotiations and a 
determination on the part of union repre-
sentatives and employees to find solutions 
involving competence development, job 
share scheme and other solidary solutions, 
the number of lay-offs was reduced.
throughout the process, we enjoyed close 
and fruitful collaboration with cph’s local  
job centre and tårnby municipality. 
the combined measures affecting cph’s 
employees translated into savings of approx-
imately dkk 500 million annually, which is vital 
in helping cph through the crisis.
training must build bridges to the future
the government and labour market parties 
made several new and improved reimbursable 
training schemes available to businesses  
in 2020. 
while the level of activity at the airport has 
been very low, we have been able to put 
extra focus on upskilling employees and 
better equipping everyone for the future.  
in 2020, we concentrated both on helping 
laid-off colleagues to find other work by 
means of competence development and  
on upskilling employees staying at cph.
35 
35 
performance / corporate responsibility / attractive workplace
we achieved this by working closely with 
three vocational colleges (tec, aof and 
zbc), the danish agency for labour market 
and recruitment, and cph’s local job centre. 
during 2020, employees completed a total of 
1,200 training weeks, with a focus on digital 
competences and english. in addition, we 
commenced 80 courses to train our unskilled 
employees to obtain skilled jobs, and since 
january 2021, we have run 30 courses to 
help employees change career pathway. 
remote management a challenge
for cph’s managers, the unpredictable crisis 
has called for significant agility and a far 
greater degree of situational leadership than 
before. cph’s people & capabilities function 
has therefore prioritised equipping managers 
to handle the many and ever-changing 
challenges. 
supporting individual managers to focus  
on mental health and build resilience in 
employees has been particularly important 
in a situation where many people have lost 
the day-to-day interaction with colleagues 
and been worried about the company’s 
financial situation and their own jobs.
equal conditions and 
opportunities for all at cph
cph is a vital part of danish society and 
infrastructure and has an international 
customer base. both elements require a 
diverse mindset and understanding. we take 
this responsibility very seriously, and strive to 
operate and develop the airport with respect 
for our customers, employees, partners, 
other stakeholders and society at large by 
mirroring the diversity we meet. we are 
highly dependent on key partnerships and 
net working to achieve our results.
in addition to the important role diversity 
plays in our strategic ambition and purpose, 
competition for skilled employees is increas-
ing. focus on diversity in the workplace will 
become even more important in the years 
ahead. furthermore, we need to realise cph’s 
full organisational potential: by having a 
diverse and inclusive organisation and 
workplace, we expect to increase motivation 
and commitment among our employees.
although the corona crisis overshadowed 
almost everything else in 2020, #metoo was 
also on the agenda. cph has updated its 
policy on handling harassment and discrimina-
tion cases. it has been clarified where 
employees should turn if they experience 
discrimination, and we have re-emphasised 
that cph has a zero-tolerance approach to  
all forms of discrimination.
cph aims to respect and pay attention to all 
six of the diversity dimensions defined by the 
institute for human rights: gender, age, 
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and 
disability. we updated our diversity and 
inclusion policy and kpis in 2020, primarily 
focusing on age, gender and ethnicity, and 
we track progress on specific diversity and 
inclusion targets and kpis.
our overarching goal is to increase diversity 
and inclusion at all organisational levels across 
cph, including board level. that means 
achieving a 70/30 split on gender and 
ethnicity, becoming more age diverse across 
the organisation and fostering a zero-discri-
mination culture.
diversity at cph
the replacement of marlene haugaard with 
martin præstegaard at the annual general 
meeting in 2020 means cph’s board of 
directors now has a gender split of 17% 
women and 83% men (one woman out of 
the six shareholder-elected board members). 
we aim to restore a proportion of 33% 
female members by 2023. 
the age split of the board is 17% in the 36-49 
age category and 83% in the over 50 age 
category. the split on ethnicity is 50% ethnic 
danes and 50% non-ethnic danes, and 
there fore within our target of a 70/30 split 
on ethnicity on the board.
to achieve a more gender-diverse manage-
ment team and workforce, our diversity 
strategy sets a target of achieving a minimum 
representation of 30% of both genders across 
all organisational levels by 2025. 
looking at the diversity across cph’s manage-
ment and workforce, the gender split in 2020 
was 66% men and 34% women, which 
breaks down into 25% female managers and 
35% female employees. this means our focus 
in the coming years will be to step up our 
efforts and initiatives to support a stronger 
representation of women in management.
in terms of age diversity, we aim to achieve  
a better mix of employees of all age groups. 
for cph that means the following split  
accross the four age categories: under 25 
(5%), 26-35 (15%), 36-49 (40%) and over 
50 (40%). in 2020, the shares were 2.1%, 
12.5%, 40% and 45.4% respectively. to 
better reflect the society in which we operate 
and to engage with our partners and custo-
mers, we are also striving to develop our 
mindset and multicultural understanding. 
diversity targets in focus 
to support our diversity targets, we focus  
in our recruitment process on promoting 
diversity. for example, we target our job 
postings to appeal to both women and men, 
and we expect our search partners to present 
candidates of both genders each time vacant 
positions are to be filled. in addition, we strive 
in our hr development activities to focus on 
unconscious biases and social norms, which 
are not conducive to achieving diversity goals. 
we are very aware that creating a diverse 
mindset and culture needs to be initiated and 
nurtured from the top of the organisation. 
for this reason, we will analyse whether there 
are aspects and structures within cph that 
may act as barriers to cultural diversity. 
we will also start a dialogue at all organi-
sational levels on how social norms and 
perceptions affect the culture at cph. we 
believe that creating a diverse mindset and 
culture begins with recognising our differ-
ences. this work will be closely linked to 
tracking our continued progress on reducing 
discrimination and harassment across cph.

copenhagen airport is a key part of denmark’s 
infrastructure, and must therefore remain open 
at all times. the outbreak of the coronavirus 
pandemic required the working environment 
department to draw up guidelines and policies 
to ensure that the airport’s many functions 
could be sustained as the virus struck. 
as soon as the lockdown started in march, 
cph mapped the units responsible for critical 
specialist functions crucial to continuing safe 
airport operations in line with the prevailing 
legislation. we subsequently introduced 
rotation systems and guidelines to ensure 
that any outbreak of the virus among cph’s 
employees would not compromise our ability 
to keep the airport open.

must be safe
for example, the staff at our two fire stations 
were unable to meet physically. as in society 
at large, home working and virtual meetings 
became vital tools in keeping things up and 
running – at a distance. on site at cph, hand 
sanitiser dispensers were set up, enhanced 
cleaning routines introduced, visors handed 
out and special guidelines drawn up for 
regular testing and use of meeting rooms  
and cph’s canteens.

for dealing with covid-19 at airports and in 
public areas meant that cph continually had 
to adapt and establish new procedures in the 
terminal areas, often at very short notice.
during the spring, cph experienced the same 
challenges in accessing enough personal 
protective equipment (ppe) as large parts of 
the danish healthcare system. with global 
production and distribution lines under 
extreme pressure, at one stage it was difficult 
to procure ppe, sanitiser and, in particular, 
masks and visors. 
many small companies and stores at the 
airport also had trouble finding the ppe 
they needed. cph therefore contacted local 
suppliers that do not normally work in the 
ppe industry. by working closely together and 
pooling product development, we were able 
to secure enough supplies both for ourselves 
and our partners at the airport. 
safe reopening of cph 
as denmark reopened its borders in the 
summer, cph set up a permanent task force 
to ensure the airport is always ready to meet 
society’s expectations and the requirements 
imposed by public authorities. in the first 
instance, rapid training of employees and 
service personnel to cope with the “new 
normal” was needed to avoid a repeat of 
the scenes of early summer, when cph was 
criticised for passengers standing too close 
together in the baggage reclaim area. 
we have focused on providing solutions in 
all the physical spaces in which passengers 
and cph employees move around: setting up 
containers of sanitiser all around the terminals 
and office buildings, extensively deploying 
visual aids, such as markings on floors, doors, 
walls and seats, to help people keep their 
distance, and – of particular relevance to 
employees – ensuring the availability of anti-
bacterial hand wipes and sanitiser dispensers 
in meeting rooms, vehicles and canteens.
occupational injuries and absence  
due to illness low
the severe economic crisis at the airport meant 
that large parts of the construction work 
under way were postponed or halted for 
good. the number of occupational injuries on 
building sites, however, increased in 2020 to 
13.6 injuries per million working hours. this 
was still below the 2020 kpi of less than 15.
in absolute numbers, occupational injuries 
on building sites fell from 21 in 2019 to 7 in 
2020. the number of occupational injuries 
among cph’s own employees was also low, 
at 5.4 per million working hours, and here, 
too, well below our kpi of less than 7.5. 
the rate of absence due to illness in 2020 
was 4.2%, below the kpi of less than 4.65%. 
however, this may relate to the fact that 
many employees were furloughed and the 
figure may therefore be under-reported. 
unavoidably, a number of cph employees 
tested positive for covid-19. the incidence 
rate was slightly above the danish national 
rate but below that of the capital region. 
the airport largely avoided chains of trans-
mission among employees. this outcome 
is attributable partly to the guidelines and 
the many initiatives taken by cph in the 
course of 2020, and partly to the employees 
faithfully and conscientiously complying with 
all the new coronavirus requirements.
with our efforts in the areas of e.g. working 
environment, diversity and inclusion, cph 
contributes to sustainable development goal 8:  
promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive 
employment and decent work for all.
a safe and healthy working environment is fundamental to ensuring  
cph remains an attractive place to work. everyone must be able to carry 
out their work at the airport as safely as possible. this aspiration was  
challenged by covid-19 and the global health crisis in 2020. together 
with our employees, we largely avoided chains of transmission and kept 
the airport safe and operational – something of which we can be proud.

performance / corporate responsibility / working environment
all passengers at copenhagen airport have 
the right to feel safe, secure and well treated. 
one example of how we put this into action 
is that all employees working in security 
undergo mandatory training that covers 
understanding of and respect for the passen-
gers’ different backgrounds and values. 
another example concerns passengers with 
hidden disabilities or diagnoses such as 
autism, alzheimer’s, brain damage, adhd, 
anxiety and dyslexia. in january 2020, cph 
adopted the now internationally recognised 
sunflower lanyard. by wearing this around 
the neck, passengers give airport employees 
a clear signal that they may require extra 
help, time or patience. 
all employees of cph and the many other 
airport companies have been introduced to 
business ethics & human rights
a place for  
everyone at cph 
cph supports and respects the protection of international human 
rights and does not take part in any form of activity that violates 
these rights. we have a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of 
corruption, including bribery and extortion.
various diagnoses and disabilities through 
training videos so that they are better 
equipped to understand and accommodate 
the diversity among the passengers in our 
airport. cph has also helped to extend the 
sunflower lanyard scheme to denmark’s 
other major airports. 
at the end of 2020, our many years of focus 
on accessibility were rewarded with industry 
organisation aci europe’s accessible airport 
award for the most disability-friendly airport 
in europe. to a large degree, this award is 
recognition of the positive cooperation be-
tween cph and the many partner companies 
that operate at the airport to create the best 
travel experience for all passengers.
handling personal data
cph gathers and processes personal data in 
connection with security in the airport area, 
and to provide various services to passengers, 
employees, visitors and other people who 
frequent the airport daily.
it is important to cph that everyone feels 
reassured that personal data are handled 
correctly, and that employees have access 
only to data relevant for carrying out their 
specific tasks. 
we follow up on the processes on an ongoing 
basis, and procedures are adjusted based 
on new knowledge and guidelines from the 
authorities. cph is not aware of any com-
plaints made to the danish data protection 
agency in 2020 concerning its handling of 
personal data.
transparent and responsible  
corporate culture 
being a responsible workplace also means 
having in place clear rules for ethical conduct 
for employees and the company as a whole. 
cph does not tolerate any form of corruption 
or bribery and has therefore introduced 
several safeguards to minimise risk. 
internal control systems are used to monitor 
areas such as exposure to potential bribery, 
breach of ethical policies and other risks. the 
overall risk exposure is assessed to make sure 
that any weaknesses are identified and dealt 
with as early as possible. to enhance the 
effectiveness of risk management, compli-
ance and internal controls, cph is organised 
according to the three lines of defence 
model. 
we upheld the relevant procedures in 2020, 
and our ongoing controls have not given rise 
to any observations or changes.
to ensure that our interactions with the world 
around us and internally at cph are based on 
sound ethical principles, we follow the em-
ployee conduct guidelines introduced in 2013. 
cph also has detailed guidelines on accepting 
gifts and participating in events and trips.
since 2013, cph has sought to promote a 
transparent corporate culture by means of a 
whistle-blower scheme, which provides a chan-
nel for everyone to speak up – including if they 
experience or witness irregularities or unlawful 
acts. the scheme enables employees and other 
stakeholders to report serious incidents.

taxation
group structure, ownership  
and tax strategy
together with its subsidiaries, copenhagen 
airports a/s operates two airports and a 
hotel in denmark, making it primarily liable 
to payroll tax. 59.4% of the shares are held  
by copenhagen airports denmark aps (cad). 
cad is indirectly controlled by kastrup 
airports parent aps (kap), the highest-level 
danish holding company, with which cph is 
jointly taxed. as the administrative company  
in the joint taxation scheme, kap is respons ible 
for submitting tax returns and communicating 
with danish tax authorities regarding corporate 
tax. for these purposes, cph reports to kap.
taxation
cph is an 
important 
contributor
with around 2,600 employees, cph is an important contributor 
of taxes to the danish state. this applies both to taxes expensed 
by cph and taxes collected (in transit) by cph on behalf of the 
government. the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in reduced/lost 
taxes for society. cph's tax contribution totalled dkk 570 million in 
2020, including corporation tax, environmental and energy taxes, 
payroll tax, etc., vat and property taxes.
tax compliance
cph has a clear compliance strategy with 
the objective that both corporation tax and 
other taxes are paid on time and reported in 
accordance with legislation. this also applies 
to taxes collected (in transit). cph's corpor-
ate tax policy applies only to copenhagen 
airports a/s and its subsidiaries, not to 
holding companies.
total tax contribution
in 2020, cph contributed dkk 570 million (2019: 
dkk 1,317 million) in taxes to the danish state. 
this amount includes dkk 38 million expensed 
by cph (2019: dkk 308 million). 
cph collected dkk 722 million (2019: dkk 
1,009 million) in taxes (in transit) such as vat, 
payroll tax, and environment and energy taxes. 
tax on the result for the year was due to the 
loss for the year an income of dkk 190 million. 
other taxes expensed comprise environment 
and energy taxes, social contributions (payroll 
tax, etc.), vat and property taxes. payroll tax  
is primarily paid by cph’s employees. public 
airports in denmark are generally exempt  
from property taxes.
corporation tax
the corporation tax rate in denmark is 22%. 
cph’s effective tax rate for 2020 was 23% 
(2019: 21.1%). cph makes maximum capital 
allowance for non-current assets, which 
reduces corporation tax while increasing 
deferred tax correspondingly. corporation  
tax is paid throughout the year, while the 
balancing amount is paid in the subsequent 
year. cph pays an interest supplement on the 
balancing amount. see note 2.6 in the financial 
statements for additional information.

safety &  
risk management
the number of aircraft operations in 2020 
was the lowest since the late 1960s, and 
many employees in safety had to be fully  
or partly furloughed. following expiry of the 
government salary compensation scheme in 
august, employees returned to a new and 
very different normal.
cph therefore focused on preparing every-
one for safety work at a time when everyday 
activity around runways, taxiways and stands 
was very different to how it had been before 
the corona pandemic hit. authorisations 
and permissions were reviewed, and extra 
training was carried out.
we also further developed the ground 
coordinator function, set up in 2018 to 
provide a better overview of air traffic and 
apron activities. this function requires a good 
shared understanding of safety and proce-
dures in areas that are extremely busy with 
equipment, vehicles, aircraft, employees and 
passengers.
safety
aviation safety is vital
we strive to be among the best airports in the world in terms of managing aviation safety  
in order to make passengers and staff feel safe. the corona crisis has meant significantly  
less traffic. we have spent the time on improvements and training.
we are now in the process of upgrading the 
ground coordinator function to include not 
just responding to observations and reports, 
but also identifying issues.
the significantly reduced traffic in 2020 also 
meant there was plenty of space to repaint 
all aircraft-related markings both around the 
runways and in the area where the aircraft 
park. this will reduce the risk of errors and 
confusion among pilots.
renovation of runway lights
it is inherent to a robust safety culture that 
the airport ensures that all relevant occur-
rences are reported and processed for the 
purposes of learning and continual improve-
ment of aircraft safety.
in particular, a very low tolerance threshold 
applies when it comes to safety in the 
airport’s aircraft manoeuvring area. runway 
inspections, for example, are conducted five 
times every 24 hours.
in january, a special occurrence report was 
submitted to the authorities concerning finds 
of dislodged light fittings and loose parts in 
the manoeuvring area in 2018 and 2019. 
this resulted in several improvements relating 
to preventive maintenance work, while the 
skills of the organisation were also adapted 
and strengthened.
with far fewer flights in 2020, the replace-
ment of the bottom parts of 2,400 lights 
was carried out faster than expected and 
completed in october.
more birds
the corona crisis has shown that aircraft  
are the most effective tool for scaring birds.  
a year with significantly fewer flights meant 
increased bird activity in and around the 
airport. so our 12 wildlife controllers were 
extra busy observing, recording and frighten-
ing birds away from the area to prevent  
bird strikes.
the increased bird activity primarily involves 
black birds such as crows and ravens, though 
the more territorial birds of prey, such as 
kestrels and buzzards, are also being seen  
at the airfield in greater numbers. our wild-
life controllers are on top of the situation, 
and cph has no reason to conclude that the 
risk has increased materially.

safety & risk management / safety
embedding current risk scenarios in our 
decision-making processes across the 
organisation ensures that decisions that are 
susceptible to one or more risks are made  
in accordance with the defined level of  
risk tolerance. 
internal controls
cph works actively to maintain its internal 
controls, anchoring them firmly in the 
organisation and engaging employees in 
their execution. 
financial risk
the finance department is responsible for 
addressing the company’s financial risks. the 
board of directors approves the principles 
and framework governing cph’s financial 
risk management at least once a year. for 
further information about how financial risks 
are managed, see note 4.3 to the financial 
statements, pages 86-90.
risk management, risks & internal controls
risk management method 
and approach at cph
cph takes a proactive and consistent approach to risk management, ensuring that  
risks are handled systematically with the involvement of relevant competences across  
the company. risk management is thus an integral part of our business activities  
and is aimed at preventing and preparing for incidents, reducing uncertainty,  
leveraging opportunities and facilitating the fulfilment of cph’s strategic goals.
organisation of risk management 
responsibility for risk management, com-
pliance and internal controls lies with the 
executive management. the board monitors 
risk management through the audit and  
risk management committee and has 
delegated responsibility for the ongoing 
development and implementation to man-
agement. the group risk manager monitors 
and facilitates the practical execution of risk 
management.
 
to achieve better risk management and 
efficient internal controls, cph applies the 
three lines of defence model. this model 
supports effective communication on risk 
management, compliance and internal 
control by specifying the distribution of roles 
and responsibilities in categories. 
responsibility for individual risks is embedded 
throughout the organisation and handled 
by designated risk owners in the various 
business units. their responsibilities include 
identifying, evaluating, managing, controlling 
and reporting risks, as well as providing an 
informed decision-making basis consistent 
with cph’s risk tolerance. all risks are care-
fully discussed, balanced and quality- assured 
at individual meetings with risk owners 
and at management group meetings in the 
respective business units in advance of the 
semi-annual risk reporting. 
material risks
cph is exposed to risks of a strategic, 
financial and operational nature, as well as 
risks relating to the airport’s reputation. cph’s 
overall risk profile rarely changes significantly 
from one year to the next. 2020 was an 
exception to this rule.

impact
mitigation
revenue 
risks
the aviation crisis in the wake of covid-19 is serious and 
has affected copenhagen airport, the airlines, the businesses 
operating at the airport and related industries significantly. 
travel restrictions are affecting thousands of danish jobs and 
will, in the short to medium term, impact cph’s ability to 
generate revenue. it is difficult to predict when air traffic will 
return, but cph expects that higher levels of operation will 
follow the distribution of vaccines.
since the covid-19 crisis hit and the number of passengers 
fell dramatically, cph’s revenue sources have come under ex-
treme pressure. this is why steps have been taken to develop 
and protect the revenue sources, including by protecting 
cph’s business partners, while simultaneously seeking to 
minimise costs and consumption.
safety  
and 
security
in any crisis, it remains important to ensure safe, high-quality 
travel for our passengers and safe high-quality operations for 
our business partners. this is why employee and passenger 
safety are at the heart of our risk management. in line with 
cph’s risk tolerance, safety has top priority and is in focus in 
day-to-day activities. 
as a result of the covid-19 crisis, cph will temporarily be a 
small airport that must still ensure safe, high-quality travel for 
all its passengers.
accidents or breaches of safety rules can have very serious 
consequences for a workplace such as cph. as an airport, 
we focus on delivering punctual and reliable operations with-
in the current rules, while keeping employee and passenger 
safety and needs in focus. even during the crisis, safety is 
paramount at cph. to reassure passengers, from 15 june 
2020 we introduced joint european guidelines on wearing 
face masks, hygiene and keeping a safe distance in airports.
cph goes to great lengths to monitor, prevent and act in 
response to safety incidents. for example, we have devel-
oped targeted emergency response plans in close dialogue 
with our business partners. these plans enable us to react to 
possible incidents at short notice. cph measures and reports 
on incidents each month using the selected kpis. please see 
the notes on page 107 for an example. in addition, cph is 
subject to many regulatory safety and security requirements. 
the danish transport, construction and housing authority 
monitors and checks compliance with these on an ongoing 
basis.
environ-
ment and 
climate
cph takes its environmental responsibility seriously and 
adopts a long-term, systematic approach to minimising its 
environmental impact and ensuring environmental responsi-
bility in both operation and development of the airport.
the challenges of climate change are attracting a lot of 
attention, both nationally and internationally.
the demands made of our business are changing rapidly. in 
parallel with this, there is a growing need to take responsibil-
ity, identify opportunities and solve challenges.
airport operations can impact the environment in many 
ways, for example in terms of noise, air quality, surface 
water, wastewater, groundwater, etc. 
our approach to building, including how we handle and 
transport building materials, waste, resource consumption 
and recycling, plays a big role in our impact on the environ-
ment and climate. 
in line with our risk appetite, cph works with innovative 
methods and solutions to environmental challenges – often 
in partnerships, and always in compliance with the relevant 
environmental regulations.
we work systematically to ensure that both operation and 
development of the airport are carried out responsibly with 
respect to the environment and climate. this approach is 
embedded in cph’s activities and decision-making processes. 
moreover, identifying and reducing potential environmental 
risks is a statutory requirement of major projects. read more 
about the environment on pages 27-34.
breaches  
of it 
security
digitalisation is one of cph’s strategic focus areas. among 
other things, this requires us to be innovative and exploit the 
digitalisation wave as a lever for growth. therefore, there is a 
focus on ensuring that cph’s it strategy supports the goal.
cph is particularly dependent on well-functioning and relia-
ble it systems that support our ability to operate the airport 
efficiently and ensure passenger safety. cybercrime is a very 
real threat, as hackers can cause disruptions that extend far 
beyond the actual incident.
we are highly focused on protecting our it systems against 
hacking, cybercrime and viruses. to this end, we have 
adopted an it security strategy to reduce the risk of cph’s  
it systems being compromised or damaged.

annual general meeting
the annual general meeting (agm) has the 
highest authority in all company matters. 
cph’s agm is held before the end of april 
every year. 
board of directors 
cph’s board consists of nine members: six are 
elected by the shareholders at the agm and 
three by the employees. the board oversees 
the overall and strategic management of cph. 
the board’s roles and responsibilities are 
defined in its rules of procedure, according  
to which the board must:
  ensure proper organisation of cph’s activ-
ities and that the executive management 
performs its duties in an appropriate 
manner 
corporate governance
corporate 
governance
the purpose of corporate governance at cph  
is to support value creation and accountable 
management, thereby driving long-term success.  
  ensure that bookkeeping and financial 
reporting are carried out in a satisfactory 
manner and that the necessary risk man-
agement and internal control procedures 
are in place
  ensure accountable management and 
sound capital resources
  define cph’s overall goals, strategies, 
action plans and investment policies. 
the board held eight meetings in 2020. the 
agenda is set out in an annual plan, ensuring 
that the principal tasks are performed in a 
timely manner and distributed sensibly over 
the year. due to the high level of uncertainty 
in 2020, the annual plan was supplemented 
with recurring update meetings, conducted 
by executive management, to keep the board 
well informed about the business at all times.
cph’s employees elect three members to 
serve on the board for four-year terms. the 
most recent employee election took place in 
march 2019. pursuant to danish legislation, 
employee-elected board members have the 
same rights, obligations and responsibilities 
as board members elected by the sharehold-
ers at the agm. 
the board has drawn up a specification of 
the competences required of members of 
cph’s board. board member nominations 
must take this specification into account. 
the specification states that members must 
have a relevant professional background 
with particular focus on relevant sectors. 
qualifications must include experience in 
business consulting, primarily commercial and 
financial consulting, commercial operations 
and aviation development. 
the board has laid down an evaluation proce-
dure in accordance with the recommendations 
on corporate governance. in autumn 2020, an 
evaluation was carried out of the board as a 
whole, and its collaboration with the executive 
management and other senior management. 
in light of a very thorough 2019 evaluation 
carried out with the assistance of an external 
consultant, the 2020 evaluation, overseen by 
the chairman, was conducted internally by 
means of a questionnaire. the conclusions 
were subsequently discussed by the board. 
the overall conclusion was that the board is 
generally well-functioning. dialogue on the 
47

governance, leadership & shares / corporate governance
individual sub-elements of the evaluation 
uncovered a few areas where the board will 
intensify its focus going forward.
chairmanship  
the board has elected a chairmanship 
consisting of the chairman and two deputy 
chairmen. the chairmanship prepares and 
organises the work of the board with a view 
to assisting the board in executing its tasks, 
duties and responsibilities efficiently and 
responsibly. the chairmanship also performs 
the role of a nomination and remuneration 
committee. the chairmanship held 12 meet-
ings in 2020, at which it considered several 
issues in accordance with the annual plan for 
the various activities. 
audit and risk management committee 
the board of cph has set up an audit and 
risk management committee (armc). the 
primary objective of the committee is to 
assist the board in discharging its account-
ing, reporting and auditing responsibilities, 
and carrying out internal control and risk 
management at cph. the airport-specific 
responsibilities related to the adr require-
ments and organisation also rest with the 
armc; this includes the appointment of an 
accountable manager. the armc held four 
meetings in 2020, at which it considered 
several issues in accordance with the annual 
plan for the various activities set out in the 
committee’s terms of reference.

2019
financial performance
revenue and other income
revenue for the year amounts to dkk 1,575.7 
million and comprises aeronautical revenue of 
dkk 695.4 million and non-aeronautical revenue 
of dkk 880.3 million. consolidated revenue fell by 
dkk 2,770.0 million or 63.7% compared to 2019.
the decline is caused by the coronavirus 
pandemic and related government actions to 
curb the spread of the virus, which resulted in 
a significant decrease in passenger numbers. 
this had an adverse effect on aeronautical 
revenue, which decreased by dkk 1,719.8 
million or 71.2% from 2019 to 2020. 
non-aeronautical revenue is also severely af - 
fec t ed by the low passenger numbers. most 
con cessionaires in the restaurant and convenience 
segment, banks and specialty shops were closed 
for large parts of 2020, which resulted in a de cline 
in revenue of 62.8%. parking revenue is also 
severely impacted by fewer locally departing 
passengers. sales of services decreased by dkk 
165.4 million, primarily as a result of fewer 
services for persons with reduced mobility (prm) 
and lower demand for energy, both of which were 
negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic.
other income of dkk 357.6 million primarily 
relates to com pen sation received from the 
danish gov ernment’s support packages for 
wages and salaries, fixed costs and airport 
charges. 
operating costs
operating costs including depreciation and 
amortisation fell by a total of dkk 267.5 million 
relative to last year to dkk 2,648.0 million. 
work performed on cph’s projects because of 
the lower investment level compared to last year. 
external costs decreased by dkk 181.9 million, 
mainly as a result of aligning costs to the lower 
level of activity. depreciation and amortisation 
were down by dkk 22.2 million due to fewer 
write-offs on assets not fully depreciated in 2020 
compared to 2019. depreciation reflects the 
current level of investment and is increasing 
because investments had increased previously.
ebitda
reported ebitda decreased by 91.5% to dkk 
201.2 million. excluding one-off items, ebitda 
fell by 85.2%. 
ebit
reported ebit decreased by dkk 2,147.1 million 
to a loss of dkk 715.1 million. excluding one-off 
items, ebit fell by dkk 2,012.9 million. 
net financing costs
net financing costs decreased by dkk 25.6 
million compared to 2019, mainly due to the 
lower average interest rate.
tax on profit/(loss) for the year
tax on profit for the year was a tax income of 
dkk 190.1 million, giving an effective tax rate 
of 23.0%. the tax rate in 2020 was 22.0% 
(2019: 22.0%).
net profit/(loss)
cph’s profit after tax decreased by dkk 
1,658.4 million to a loss of dkk 638.1 million. 
the decrease is primarily due to the corona-
virus pandemic, partly offset by the strong 
focus on cost savings and the compensation 
packages received from the danish government.

2019 
breakdown of investments in the aeronautical
and non-aeronautical segments
at 31 december 2020, the group has assets of dkk 14,278.2 million (2019: dkk 
14,146.8 million). the increase of dkk 131.4 million is mainly due to the increase in  
fixed assets.
non-current assets
non-current assets totalled dkk 14,002.0 million (2019: dkk 13,503.0 million), or 98.1% 
of total assets (2019: 95.4%). the largest investments in 2020 comprise expansion of 
terminal 3 landside, completion of pier e, construction of a multi-storey car park,  
and new baggage facilities.
current assets
current assets totalled dkk 276.2 million (2019: dkk 643.8 million). the decrease is 
primarily caused by lower trade receivables, other receivables and prepayments, primarily 
due to lower revenue as a result of covid-19. 
liabilities
liabilities amount to dkk 11,619.2 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 10,888.2 
million). the increase of dkk 731.0 million primarily relates to higher loan volumes. 
non-current liabilities increased by dkk 3,233.1 million compared to 31 december 2019 
(2019: decreased by dkk 392.0 million), primarily as a result of reclassification of financial 
institutions and other loans as current liabilities in 2019 and higher loan volumes in 2020. 
current liabilities excluding the current portion of financial institutions and other loans 
amount to dkk 1,024.2 million (2019: dkk 1,425.1 million), a decrease of dkk 400.9 
million. the decrease is mainly due to lower trade payables, lower payable tax and lower 
prepayments from customers.

equity & dividend
equity
equity totalled dkk 2,659.0 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 3,258.6 million). 
the decrease of dkk 599.6 million reflects the loss for the year.
change in equity
equity decreased by the loss for the year of dkk 638.1 million (2019: increased by a profit 
of dkk 1,020.3 million), partly offset by a positive impact of dkk 41.0 million (2019:  
dkk 68.5 million) from value adjustments of hedging transactions and the associated tax 
effect. these adjustments related to currency swaps to hedge usd and gbp exposure. 
there were also exchange rate adjustments of equity in a foreign branch, resulting in a 
negative impact of dkk 2.5 million (2019: negative impact of dkk 0.8 million). a decision 
was taken in 2020 not to pay a dividend to shareholders in respect of the second half  
of 2019 or in respect of 2020 (2019: dkk 915.7 million). 
equity ratio and return on equity
movements in equity in 2020
dividend 
the board of directors proposes for adoption at the annual general meeting that no 
dividend be paid in respect of 2020. dividends to shareholders in 2020 and 2021 have 
been suspended because of the financial situation and compensation received from the 
danish government’s support packages.
dividends paid in 2019 comprised a dividend in respect of 2018 of dkk 678.1 million 
and a dividend in respect of the first half of 2019 of dkk 237.6 million. 
equity ratio
the equity ratio amounts to 18.6% (2019: 23.0%) of the balance sheet total, a decrease 
of 4.4 percentage points compared to 2019 due to the net loss after tax in 2020.
return on equity
the return on equity is negative at 21.6% in 2020 (2019: positive at 32.2%). the decrease 
is primarily due to the loss for the year.

cash flow from operating activities
cash flow from operating activities amounts to dkk 183.1 million, a decrease of dkk 
1,590.4 million compared to 2019. the decrease primarily relates to the fall in revenue 
resulting from covid-19. the decrease in revenue is partly offset by lower costs as a result 
of the reduced activity level, the danish government’s support packages and lower tax 
payments. covid-19 also affected the ebitda index negatively.
cash flow from investing activities
cash flow from investing activities primarily comprises payments for intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment totalling dkk 1,517.2 million (2019: dkk 2,141.3 million). 
cash flow from financing activities
cash flow from financing activities is positively affected by proceeds from new loans raised 
and net draws on credit facilities, totalling dkk 3.4 billion. this effect is partly offset by 
amortisation and repayment of loans, including two uspp loans of usd 147 million (dkk 
893.8 million) and gbp 23 million (dkk 202.2 million). in 2020, the leverage ratio was 
negatively affected by covid-19, resulting in lower ebitda and higher loan volumes.
cash and cash equivalents
at 31 december 2020, cph has cash and cash equivalents of dkk 41.8 million (2019: 
dkk 19.2 million) and committed undrawn credit facilities of dkk 4,450.0 million (2019: 
dkk 1,881.8 million).
financing
at 31 december 2020, cph has interest-bearing debt of dkk 9,587.0 million (2019: dkk 
8,388.3 million) and net interest-bearing debt of dkk 9,545.2 million (2019: dkk 8,369.1 
million). the difference of dkk 41.8 million (2019: dkk 19.2 million) consists of cash and cash 
equivalents. in total, 98.5% of the interest-bearing debt (2019: 73.2%) is non-current, i.e. with 
a maturity of more than one year from 31 december 2020, comprising facilities in usd and dkk.
in may 2020, cph entered into a two-year facility agreement amounting to dkk 6.0 
billion with a club of banks. the new facility is a combination of a two-year term loan  
of dkk 2.0 billion and a two-year credit facility of dkk 4.0 billion.

1.1 
to make the report more manageable and readable, the accounting policies, estimates 
and judgements for specific items are placed together with the appropriate note, keeping 
all the information related to the item in one place.
basis of preparation of the financial statements
cph is a limited company domiciled in denmark and listed on nasdaq copenhagen.
the consolidated financial statements of cph are prepared in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the european union (eu) and 
further requirements applicable in denmark.
the financial statements of the parent company, copenhagen airports a/s, are prepared 
in accordance with the danish financial statements act.
significant accounting estimates
in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes various 
accounting estimates and assumptions that form the basis of the presentation, recogni-
tion and measurement of cph’s assets and liabilities. 
the estimates made by cph in determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to future events. these include 
estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and their residual values. 
estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical data and factors that 
management considers relevant under the given circumstances. these assumptions may 
have to be revised, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur.
there are no changes to the estimates made by cph in determining the carrying amounts 
compared to 2019. the carrying amounts of these items are disclosed in notes 3.2 and 3.3.
for a description of cph’s risks, see note 4.3 on financial risks.
general information 
the group annual report is prepared under the historical cost principle. assets and liabil-
ities are subsequently measured as described below. this is unchanged from 2019.
basis of consolidation 
the group annual report comprises the parent company, copenhagen airports a/s, and 
companies where the parent company directly or indirectly controls the majority of the 
votes or otherwise controls the companies (subsidiaries). companies where cph controls 
50% or less of the votes and does not have control but exercises significant influence are 
considered associates. 
in the consolidation, intercompany income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends and 
balances, and realised and unrealised intercompany gains and losses on transactions 
between the consolidated companies are eliminated.
cph’s group annual report is prepared on the basis of the financial statements of the 
parent company and the subsidiaries. the financial statements used in the consolidation 
are prepared in accordance with cph’s accounting policies. 
other income 
other income contains items of a secondary nature relative to cph’s primary activities, 
including gains and losses on the sale of assets and compensation from the danish 
government’s support packages for wages and salaries, fixed costs and traffic charges. 
foreign currency translation 
cph’s functional currency is the danish krone (dkk). this currency is used as the meas-
urement and presentation currency in the preparation of the annual report. therefore, 
currencies other than dkk are considered foreign currencies.
transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling 
at the transaction date. gains and losses arising as a result of differences between the 
exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the date of payment are 
recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.
receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that 
have not been settled on the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date.

statement of comprehensive income
cph presents comprehensive income in two statements: an income statement and a 
statement of comprehensive income, showing the results of operations for the year  
and income included in other comprehensive income. other comprehensive income 
comprises hedging transactions. tax related to other comprehensive income for the  
individual items is disclosed in the relevant notes.
equity
dividends
dividends expected to be declared in respect of the year are stated under equity.  
dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of adoption by the shareholders at  
the annual general meeting. 
reserve for hedging 
the reserve for hedging transactions contains the accumulated net change in the fair 
value of hedging transactions that meet the criteria for hedging future cash flows and 
where the hedged transaction has not yet been realised.
the reserve is dissolved when the hedged transaction is realised, if the hedged cash flows 
are no longer expected to be realised or the hedging relationship is no longer effective.
cost of hedging 
cost of hedging is the total cost of hedging for hedge transactions. expenses are 
dissolved when the hedged transaction is realised.
prepayments and deferred income 
prepayments recognised under assets comprise costs incurred relating to the following 
financial year and are measured at nominal value.
deferred income recognised under liabilities comprises payments received relating to 
income in subsequent financial years and is measured at nominal value. 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement shows cph’s cash flows for the year distributed between 
ope rating, investing and financing activities as well as the net changes in cash for the 
year and cph’s cash at the beginning and end of the year. 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash includes cash and balances on accounts available at no or short notice. 
cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow from operating activities comprises payments from customers less 
payments to employees, suppliers, etc., adjusted for financial items paid and income 
taxes paid. 
cash flow from investing activities 
the cash flow from investing activities comprises cash flows from the purchase and sale 
of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 
cash flow from financing activities 
the cash flow from financing activities comprises cash flows from the raising and repay-
ment of long-term and short-term debt to financial institutions as well as dividends paid 
to shareholders.

or cph’s financial statements in general.
new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted  
but not yet effective 
the iasb has issued the following new accounting standards and interpretations that are 
not mandatory for cph in the preparation of the group annual report for 2020:
• ifrs 17 insurance contracts

cph’s management has considered the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the impact  
on cash flow and liquidity position. it is management’s assessment that cph is a going 
concern and hence the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
in may 2020, cph entered into a two-year facility agreement totalling dkk 6.0 billion 
with a club of banks as well as waiver agreements with existing lenders, providing cph 
with relief from certain loan covenants up to and including q1 2021. this ensures that 
cph will be able to continue to meet its financial and investment commitments. the 
waiver agreements require cph to meet a liquidity covenant* with which cph has 
complied during 2020. 
while many countries have initiated comprehensive vaccination programmes that eventu-
ally are expected to lead to recovery of global travel, operational uncertainties for 2021 
remain high. cph will reduce all operational costs and capex in line with, and dependent 
on, the shape and timing of the recovery. 
in 2020, cph took significant actions with a positive effect on performance, including 
substantial cost reductions. reductions of more than dkk 200 million related solely to 
external costs, excluding the effects of various government support packages. in addition, 
planned investments were reduced by approximately dkk 800 million. in august and 
november, cph also implemented organisational adjustments to the activity level 
going concern 
notes general
expected for the foreseeable future. these adjustments will reduce yearly operational 
costs for cph by approximately dkk 500 million.
despite the actions taken, it is highly likely that cph risks being in breach of ebitda- 
based covenants when tested in june 2021. consequently, cph has initiated negotiations 
with existing lenders to extend the waiver agreements. based on informal indications, 
management expects to have new waiver agreements in place during q2 2021. in the 
unlikely event that waivers are not granted by lenders, management is confident that the 
debt market remains available, and credit institutions are expected to be willing to assist 
cph through the crisis.
the impact of covid-19 creates considerable uncertainty for the aviation industry. the 
need to seek waiver agreements indicates the existence of a material uncertainty that 
may cast significant doubt about cph’s ability to adopt a going concern basis of prepar-
ation for the financial statements. management assesses that cph will maintain sufficient 
liquidity over the next 12 months and, given the underlying credit quality of the business, 
can secure the necessary and timely support of its lenders, and that it is accordingly 
appropriate to adopt a going concern basis for the preparation of these financial state-
ments. these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amount 
or classification of assets and liabilities that would result if the financial statements had 
not been prepared on a going concern basis.
*  the liquidity covenant requires cph to have liquidity in the form of cash, undrawn and available credit lines at least equal  
to the following 180 days of operating costs (excluding taxes), capital expenditure and debt services.

segment information
accounting policies
the accounting policies for recognition and measurement of segment information are 
the same as for the income statement and balance sheet. the accounting policies are 
unchanged from 2019. 
 
the operating results for the segments comprise directly attributable revenue less related 
operating costs. operating costs comprise external costs, staff costs and amortisation and 
depreciation. 
 
segment assets comprise non-current assets used directly in the operating activities of 
each segment and current assets directly attributable to the operating activities of each 
segment, including trade receivables, other receivables, prepayments and deferred 
income. jointly used properties are allocated to the segments on the basis of an overall 
estimate of the amount of space used. 
 
segment liabilities comprise liabilities that have arisen out of the segment’s operations, 
including prepayments received from customers, trade payables and other payables.
 
operating segments
cph has two segments: aeronautical and non-aeronautical. 
 
the segment classification follows the legal and organisational classification of the 
group’s activities. the aeronautical segment comprises the regulated part of copenhagen 
airports (traffic charges) and the non-aeronautical segment comprises all other activities. 
this classification is appropriate, as the aeronautical segment reporting also con stitutes 
the reporting of regulatory activities under bl 9-15 (traffic charges). bl 9-15 is described 
in note 5.6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aeronautical
this segment comprises the operations and functions that the airports at kastrup and 
roskilde make available so that airlines can operate their flights, including facilities 
required for passengers to pass through these airports. revenue in the aeronautical 
segment comprises passenger, security, take-off and aircraft-parking charges and other 
income, including handling and cute charges (it technology used in connection with 
check-in). 
non-aeronautical
this segment comprises the other facilities and services provided at the airports for 
passengers and others, including car-parking facilities, shops, restaurants, rest areas, 
lounges and the hotel. the vast majority of the operations are operated by concession-
aires. the segment also includes the leasing of cph’s buildings, premises and land to 
non-group lessees. revenue in the non-aeronautical segment comprises concession 
revenue; rent from buildings, premises and land; revenue from parking, the hotel oper-
ation and services for persons with reduced mobility (prm); taxi management services 
(tms); sales of consulting services concerning airport operation; and other services. 
 
revenue related to cph’s largest customer amounted to dkk 323.7 million in 2020 
(2019: dkk 875.6 million), representing 20.8% of revenue (2019: 20.1%). this revenue 
relates to both the aeronautical and non-aeronautical segments. revenue related to the 
second-largest customer amounted to dkk 122.6 million in 2020 (2019: dkk 424.1 
million), representing 7.8% of revenue (2019: 9.8%). this revenue relates solely to the 
non-aeronautical segment. revenue related to the third-largest customer amounted to 
dkk 83.5 million in 2020 (2019: dkk 454.3 million), representing 5.3% of revenue 
(2019: 10.5%). this revenue relates to both the aeronautical and the non-aeronautical 
segments.

accounting policies
revenue comprises the year’s traffic revenue, rent, concession revenue and the sale of 
services, net of value added tax and price reductions directly related to sales, cf. the 
segment information in note 2.1.
 
traffic revenue 
traffic revenue comprises passenger, security, take-off and aircraft-parking charges, 
handling and cute charges (it technology used in connection with check-in), and is 
recognised at the time of departure of the aircraft to which the services relate. start-up 
discounts for previously unserved routes, transfer/transit discounts based on the 
preceding 12 months of traffic and incentive schemes for high-frequency feeder routes 
and to maintain passenger growth are deducted from traffic revenue. the nox charge 
is included in take-off charges.  
 
concession revenue 
concession revenue comprises sales-related revenue from copenhagen airport’s 
shopping centre, which is recognised in line with the revenue generated by the con -
cessionaires. revenue from car-parking facilities is recognised when a car exits the 
car-parking facilities. 
 
rent 
rent comprises rent for buildings and land and is recognised over the terms of the 
contracts.  
 
revenue from the sale of services, etc. 
revenue from the sale of services, etc. comprises revenue from the hotel operation and 
other activities, including services for persons with reduced mobility (prm), which are 
recognised when the services are provided, and taxi management services (tms), which 
are recognised on arrival at the taxi stand. other services typically include a perform-
ance obligation that is recognised either on a straight-line basis over a period or  
at a particular time when the services are provided.

composition of revenue
cph’s revenue consists only of services in the aeronautical and non-aeronautical segments. 
concession charges (except concessionaires who are subject to a minimum charge) related to the shopping centre and other concessions depend on the level of activity. 
there is no financing element, as payment terms follow cash payment on delivery or 14 days’ credit.

the executive management, fees to the board of directors and other staff costs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regular pension contributions under defined contribution plans are recognised in the 
income statement for the period in which they arise. for civil servants seconded by the 
danish state, cph recognises a pension contribution in the income statement, which is 
fixed each year by the state and paid to the state on a regular basis.  
 
in 2020, salaries and wages decreased by dkk 63.4 million. this was mainly due to a 
decrease in headcount of 96 full-time employees and the focus on savings, partly 
offset by provisions related to redundancies in august and november as a result of 
the covid-19 crisis.

external costs decreased by dkk 181.9 million compared to 2019. this was mainly driven 
by the focus on cost savings due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. furthermore, 
40% of the airport was mothballed from 25 november 2020, resulting in reduced 
expenses for energy, cleaning and maintenance. 
in 2020, cph incurred one-off costs of dkk 0.9 million, mainly related to restructuring 
(2019: dkk 4.0 million). see note 1.4 for an overview of one-off items.

employer-administered pension contributions accounted for dkk 1.1 million (2019: dkk 
1.1 million) of the salaries paid to members of the executive management.
the remuneration to the executive management consists of a fixed basic salary (including 
pension contributions), certain benefits (free company car, etc.) and an incentive plan, which 
is described below. in the event of termination of employment by cph, the members of the 
executive management are entitled to a maximum of two years’ remuneration.
 
 
 
 
 
 
in order to promote a sound long-term approach, a rolling three-year incentive plan has 
been introduced for the executive management. for 2020, the total costs expensed for 
the long-term incentive plan were dkk 0.7 million (2019: dkk 2.5 million). payments 
from the three-year incentive plan has a target level of four months’ and a maximum of 
six months’ salary per annum. the short-term incentive plan has terms of up to one year. 
the short-term incentive plan has a target level of six months’ salary, if all stretched 
objectives are met, and a maximum of nine months’ salary. for 2020, the total accrued 
costs for the short-term incentive plan were dkk 2.3 million (2019: dkk 3.0 million). 
the total remuneration in 2020 to members of the executive management was dkk 9.9 
million (2019: dkk 12.4 million), including a provision of dkk 0.7 million for a potential 
payout under the long-term incentive plan (2019: dkk 2.5 million) and a provision of 
dkk 2.3 million for the short-term incentive plan (2019: dkk 3.0 million). pension contri-
butions for members of the executive management are paid regularly to private pension 
companies. cph has no liabilities in this respect.
remuneration to the board of directors and executive management in 2020 was paid in 
accordance with the “general guidelines for remuneration to the board of directors and 
the executive management of copenhagen airports a/s”. key management consists of 
the executive management.
cph makes annual pension contributions to the danish state. these contributions are 
paid for those employees who, under their contracts of employment, are entitled to a 
pension from the danish state. the rate of pension contributions is fixed by the minister 
for finance and was 21.2% in 2020 (2019: 21.2%). in 2020, these pension contributions 
amounted to dkk 0.7 million (2019: dkk 0.9 million). 
 
in 2020, cph incurred one-off costs of dkk 150.4 million (2019: dkk 13.1 million),

copenhagen airports a/s is taxed jointly with kastrup airports parent aps (kap), copen-
hagen airports denmark holding aps (cadh) and copenhagen airports denmark aps 
(cad), and the two wholly-owned subsidiaries copenhagen airports international a/s 
(cai) and copenhagen airport hotels a/s (cah). kap is the administrative company for 
the jointly-taxed companies and settles corporation taxes due to the tax authorities. cph, 
cai and cah pay tax on account to kap and settle tax underpaid/overpaid with kap. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
income tax for the year, consisting of the year’s current tax and the year’s change in 
deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement at the amount that can be attributed 
to the profit for the year, and posted directly in other comprehensive income at the 
amount that can be attributed to movements therein. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
current tax liabilities are carried in the balance sheet as current liabilities to the extent 
such items have not been paid. tax overpaid on account is included as a separate line 
item under receivables. interest and allowances regarding tax payments are recognised 
under financial income and financial expenses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deferred tax is calculated according to the balance sheet liability method on all tempo-
rary differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and liabilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deferred tax is calculated on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates that will apply under 
the legislation in force at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax item is expected 
to crystallise as current tax. changes in deferred tax resulting from changes in tax rates 
are recognised in the income statement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the value at which they are 
expected to be realisable.

amortisation and depreciation
total amortisation and depreciation charges decreased by dkk 22.2 million compared to 
2019, primarily due to lower write-offs on assets not fully depreciated in 2020 compared 
to 2019. this was partly offset by an increase in depreciation, which reflects the current 
level of investment and is increasing because investments had increased previously. 
accounting policies
software is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
major projects in which software is the principal element are recognised as assets if there 
is sufficient certainty that the capitalised value of future earnings will cover the related 
costs. 
software costs comprise salaries, amortisation and other costs that can be attributed 
directly or indirectly to the software. costs also include interest expenses incurred during 
development of the software.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
software projects that are clearly defined and identifiable, where the technical rate of 
utilisation, adequate resources and potential scope for development in the group can be 
demonstrated, and where the intention is to produce and use the project, are recognised 
as non-current intangible assets, provided there is sufficient assurance that the value in 
use from future earnings will cover development costs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis commencing when the project is ready 
for use. the amortisation period is 3-5 years.
impairments
the carrying amount of software and software under development is tested at least 
annually for any impairment beyond that expressed in amortisation charges. where there 
are such indications, an impairment charge is made against the lower of the recoverable 
amount of the asset and the carrying amount. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the recoverable amount of the asset is determined as the higher of the net selling price 
and the value in use. the recoverable amount of software is assessed together with other 
assets in the smallest group of assets for which a reliable recoverable amount can be 
determined in an overall assessment.
estimates and judgements
the estimated useful lives are determined based on historical experience and expectations 
of future use of the assets. these may prove to be unachievable, which could lead to 
future reassessment of their useful lives and a need for impairment.

cost comprises the cost of acquisition and costs directly related to the acquisition up until 
the time when the asset is ready for use. in the case of self-constructed assets, cost 
comprises direct costs attributable to the asset, including salaries and wages, materials, 
components, and work performed by subcontractors. cost also includes interest expenses 
during construction.
the depreciation base is determined as cost less any residual value. depreciation is 
charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and begins

significant estimates and judgements
property, plant and equipment are depreciated to the estimated residual value over their 
expected useful lives, which cph has estimated above. these estimates are based on the 
company’s business plans and expected useful lives of the assets, the technical and main-
tenance state of the assets, and regulatory requirements. the residual value has been 
estimated at dkk 184.7 million (2019: dkk 184.7 million) at the balance sheet date. the 
useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least at 
every year-end based on these factors. cph evaluates the carrying amounts in order to 
assess whether events have occurred that require an adjustment of these amounts 
because they are not expected to be recoverable. 
in estimating the runways’ useful lives, cph has divided the system into three elements: 
foundations, surfaces and technical installations. cph’s assessment is that each element 
has a different useful life. the runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundations 
due to immediate wear: their useful life expectancy is 10 years. this assessment is 
supported by historical replacement of runway surfaces and planning for future replace-
ment. technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 
15 years. these technical installations related to the runways are not assessed to have the 
same useful life as other technical installations, taking into account safety measures.
impairment
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested at least annually for indi-
cations of impairment beyond that expressed in the depreciation charges. where there 
are such indications, an impairment charge is made against the lower of the recoverable 
amount of the asset and the carrying amount.
in assessing the recoverable amount, cph takes into account significant indicators of 
potential impairment such as purchase and selling prices, and general market conditions.

financial income and expenses
accounting policies
financial income and expenses include interest, realised and unrealised exchange differ-
ences, recycled accumulated gains and losses on swaps related to terminated hedges, 
amortisation of mortgage loans and other loans, including reversal of fair value adjust-
ments of effective hedges of loans, supplements and allowances under the on-account 
tax scheme. fair value adjustment of interest elements of swaps classified as a cash flow 
hedge for accounting purposes is recognised in comprehensive income.
financial expenses decreased by dkk 22.0 million, primarily due to a lower average interest 
rate partly offset by higher commitment fees.
an effective interest rate of 2.2% was applied to calculate loan costs for the cost of 
assets in 2020 (2019: 2.6%), corresponding to cph’s weighted average cost of capital for 
borrowings for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
as stated under currency swaps and hedging transactions in note 4.3 on financial risks, 
cph uses currency swaps to hedge foreign currency loans (in this case usd only) so that 
the exchange rate exposure on interest as well as the principal is converted from the 
foreign currency into fixed payments in dkk over the terms of the respective loans.  
the loans in question have been fully hedged.
exchange rate adjustments of loans as well as currency swaps (for loan principals) are 
recognised in financial income/expenses in the income statement at a net amount of 
zero, as the exchange rate adjustment of the loans is fully offset by an opposite exchange 
rate adjustment of the currency swaps.
the net value of the exchange loss recognised in 2020 included an unrealised exchange 
gain of dkk 186.0 million (2019: unrealised exchange loss of dkk 59.5 million) related to 
long-term loans denominated in usd and gbp, offset by an unrealised exchange loss of 
dkk 186.0 million on currency swaps (2019: unrealised exchange gain of dkk 59.5 
million) relating to the same loans.
amortisation of loan costs relates to costs in connection with the establishment of bank 
loans and credit facilities.

mortgage loans, loans from financial institutions and other loans are recognised when

4.3 
accounting policies
in connection with cph’s hedging of future financial transactions and cash flows, deriva-
tive financial instruments are used as part of cph’s risk management.
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value 
on the transaction date under other receivables and other payables respectively.
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair 
value hedges of a recognised asset or liability are recognised in the income statement 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or hedged liability.
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of 
expected future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumu-
lated under reserve for hedging. if the expected future transaction results in the recogni-
tion of non-financial assets or liabilities, amounts previously deferred in other compre-
hensive income are transferred via other comprehensive income from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability respectively. other 
amounts deferred in other comprehensive income as part of equity are transferred to the 
income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects the income 
statement.
the fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is determined as the present value of 
expected future cash flows. the fair value of forward exchange contracts and other deriv-
ative financial instruments is determined based on observable exchange rates and the 
swap and forward rates at the balance sheet date. an evaluation of own and counter-
party credit risks is also included.
cph’s risk management policy
cph’s financial risks are managed from its head office by the treasury department. the 
principles and framework governing cph’s financial management are laid down once a 
year by the board of directors. the financial risks occur primarily as a result of operating 
and investing activities and are hedged to the greatest extent possible.
credit risks
cph’s credit risks primarily relate to receivables, bank deposits, securities and derivative 
financial instruments.
credit risk regarding receivables arises when cph’s revenue in the form of traffic charges, 
concession charges, rent, etc. is not prepaid, or when customer solvency is not covered 
by guarantees, etc.
cph’s revenue comprises aeronautical revenue from national and international airlines, 
and non-aeronautical revenue from national and international companies within and 
outside the aviation industry. as part of cph’s internal procedures regarding risk manage-
ment, the credit risk relating to customers is monitored on a monthly basis. this is done 
by reviewing any failure to pay amounts due and assessing whether the customer has 
financial problems.
cph’s trading partners sas, norwegian and gebr. heinemann (the largest concession-
aire), constitute the most significant concentration of credit risk. gross receivables from 
the sale of services to these customers amounted to approximately 30.0% (2019: 40.0%) 
of the total. sas’s credit rating from standard & poor’s is b- (2019: b+). norwegian does 
not have a published credit rating but has provided a deposit for rent. gebr. heinemann 
does not have a published credit rating but has given cph a banker’s guarantee equiv-
alent to four months’ revenue (2019: four months’ revenue). the remaining credit risk is 
distributed among cph’s other customers. see note 5.1 on trade receivables for further 
information.
credit risks related to bank deposits, securities and derivative financial instruments arise 
as a result of uncertainty regarding the counterparty’s ability to meet liabilities when due. 
cph seeks to limit the credit risk regarding bank deposits and derivative financial instru-
ments by diversifying financial contracts and by entering into contracts only with financial 
counterparties with satisfactory credit ratings. the credit risk is calculated per counter-
party based on the actual market value of the contracts entered into. at the balance 
sheet date, cph had no credit risk on derivative financial instruments. 
credit exposure to financial counterparties at 31 december 2020 totalled dkk 41.8 million 
(2019: dkk 19.2 million), corresponding to the value of bank deposits and money market 
deposits, including accrued interest.

capital management
cph’s policy concerning borrowings is, as far as possible, to ensure a certain flexibility by 
diversifying funding by maturity date and counterparties. furthermore, it is cph’s policy 
to comply with the loan covenants in its loan agreements. the board of directors and 
management ensure that the company has a sound capital structure and, based on this, 
the financing policy is approved on an annual basis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cph, individually and on behalf of its subsidiaries, has undertaken not to create or 
permit to subsist any charge over its assets or those of its subsidiaries, subject to a 
maximum permitted amount. furthermore, cph has made a commitment to its lenders 
to comply with a number of other terms and conditions, including financial covenants.  
a number of cph’s agreements on loans and credit facilities may be terminated in the 
event of failure to comply with these terms and conditions. in may 2020, cph obtained 
waivers for financial covenants covering the period until and including q1 2021. process 
for further extension of waivers for financial covenants has been initiated (please refer to 
page 65). cph complied with all applicable terms and conditions during 2020 and as at 
31 december 2020. for information about dividend policy, see page 46.
liquidity risk
in may 2020, cph entered into a two-year facility agreement totalling dkk 6.0 billion 
with a club of banks as well as waiver agreements with existing lenders, relieving cph 
of certain loan covenants until and including q1 2021. this was done to ensure that 
cph has adequate liquidity during the covid-19 crisis. a rolling six-month forward 
liquidity covenant was granted.
cph’s liquid assets consist of cash totalling dkk 41.8 million (2019: dkk 19.2 million) 
and undrawn committed long-term credit facilities totalling dkk 4,250.0 million 
(2019: dkk 1,800.0 million). cph also has overdraft facilities available of dkk 200.0 
million (2019: dkk 81.8 million). 
throughout 2020, cph complied with the liquidity covenant. from q2 2021, cph shall 
resume performance of the financial covenants obligations that have been waived by 
lenders. it is most likely that cph risks being in breach of ebitda-based covenants, for 
which reason cph has made a request for extended waiver agreements. please refer to 
page 65 for further details. 
a complete overview of payment commitments is disclosed on the following pages.  
all cash flows are undiscounted and include all liabilities under the contracts. interest 
payments on floating-rate debt not yet hedged are recognised at the fixed forward rate 
from the day the loans are expected to be swapped, based on the yield curve applicable at 
the balance sheet date. the dkk value of future interest and principal payments on loans 
in foreign currency is calculated based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

*  the fair value of financial liabilities is the present value of the expected future instalments and interest 
payments, except for trade payables, other payables and receivables, which are stated at the net 
carrying amount at year-end. a zero-coupon interest rate for similar maturities plus estimated credit 
cost based upon the present rating of the company is used as the discount rate. the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments is determined based on published exchange rates, swap and forward 
rates, etc. an evaluation of own and counterparty credit risk is also included. the fair value measure-
ment of financial instruments is divided into the following measurement hierarchy: 
level 1:  observable market prices of identical instruments
level 2:   valuation models primarily based on observable prices or traded prices of comparable instruments
level 3:   valuation models primarily based on non-observable prices
the fair value of cph’s forward exchange contracts and other derivative financial instruments (interest rate 
and currency swaps) is considered a level 2 fair value measurement, as the fair value is primarily determined 
directly based on published exchange rates and quoted swap and forward rates at the balance sheet date.

market risks
interest rate risks 
it is cph’s policy to hedge interest rate risks on most of its loans whenever it is considered 
that the interest payments can be hedged at a satisfactory level. hedging is normally by 
means of entering into interest rate swaps under which floating-rate loans are swapped 
to a fixed interest rate.
the interest rate swap on the mortgage loan expired on 31 december 2019. accordingly, 
there are no outstanding dkk interest rate swaps for mortgage loans at year-end (2019: 
dkk 0 million). 
in order to reduce its overall interest rate sensitivity, cph seeks to ensure that its debt has 
a duration that to a certain extent takes into account the useful lives of its assets. the 
duration of cph’s loans at 31 december 2020 has been determined at approximately  
6.0 years (2019: approximately 7.4 years).
61% of cph’s dkk loan portfolio is at a fixed rate (i.e. variable rate at 39%). fluctuations 
in the interest rate level would therefore have only a relatively limited impact on cph’s 
income statement, given the outlook for future interest rate changes. 
as the exchange rate and interest rate risk on debt denominated in usd (the gbp debt 
has been paid off during 2020) is hedged by usd/dkk interest rate swap, accounted for 
as a cash flow hedge, a change in interest rate levels would affect equity.

exchange rate risks
exchange rate fluctuations would have only a minor impact on cph’s operating results 
because most of its revenues and costs are settled in dkk.
currency swaps
currency swaps have been used to hedge fixed-rate bond loans denominated in usd by 
swapping the exchange rate exposure on both interest and principal from fixed payments 
in usd to fixed payments in dkk throughout the terms of the respective loans. the total 
notional amount of these outstanding cross-currency swaps at 31 december 2020 was 
usd 160 million (2019: usd 307 million and gbp 23 million). the carrying amount of the 
currency swap contracts was dkk 61.7 million (2019: dkk 195.2 million). 
 
 
hedging transactions
the net fair value stated will be transferred from reserve for hedging to the income state-
ment as and when the hedged interest payments are made. the terms to maturity of the 
cross-currency swaps match the terms to maturity of the related loans.

accounting policies
receivables are measured at amortised cost. write-downs to offset losses are made in 
accordance with the simplified expected credit loss model, whereby the total loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement at the same time as the receivable is 
recognised in the balance sheet based on the expected loss over the total life of the 
receivable. 
 
interest on written-down receivables is recognised based on the written-down value 
using the effective interest rate for each receivable.
estimates and judgements
using the simplified expected credit loss model, the expected loss on receivables from 
sales and services is recognised immediately in the income statement. receivables are 
monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the group’s risk management until 
realisation. the write-down is calculated based on the expected loss ratio. the loss ratio is 
calculated on the basis of historical data adjusted for estimates of the effect of expected 
changes in relevant parameters, such as economic development, political risks, etc. on

the market. for receivables where there is no objective indication of impairment at indi-
vidual level, the remaining receivables are assessed for objective indications of impairment. 
the objective indications are based on historical loss experiences.
 
 
if there is an objective indication that an individual receivable is impaired, such as non- 
payment of amounts due or the debtor having financial difficulties in the form of payment 
suspension, bankruptcy, expected bankruptcy or the like, a write-down is made on the 
receivable in question.
in a number of cases, cph receives collateral security for sales on credit, mainly regarding 
non-aeronautical activities, and such collateral is included in the assessment of the write-
down required for bad and doubtful debts. the collateral may be in the form of financial 
guarantees. of the trade receivables of dkk 156.5 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: 
dkk 427.7 million), dkk 57.9 million (2019: dkk 101.0 million) was covered by collateral 
security. the maximum credit risk is reflected in the carrying amount of the financial 
assets in the balance sheet.

other payables are recognised when, as a result of events occurring on or before the 
balance sheet date, the group has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. the 
method for providing for holiday pay was changed in 2019 from a summary to an actual 
calculation.
other payables primarily comprise holiday pay liabilities, payroll taxes, vat and interest 
payable and are measured at nominal value. other payables also comprise the fair value 
of derivative financial instruments.
other payables increased by dkk 134.3 million, primarily due to an increase in holiday 
pay and other payroll items due to the new holiday act, which covered holiday in the 
period from 1 september 2019 to 31 august 2020.

at 31 december 2020, cph had entered into contracts to build facilities totalling dkk 
210.6 million (2019: dkk 432.5 million) and other commitments totalling dkk 34.5 
million (2019: dkk 44.5 million). major commitments include contracts for capacity expan-
sion of the baggage facility, construction of the multi-storey car park, and expansion of 
terminal 3.
furthermore, cph is committed to providing redundancy pay to civil servants pursuant to 
the provisions of the danish civil servants act, cf. note 2.5.
in january 2017, petter anker stordalen and cph entered into an agreement that nordic 
choice hotels would assume management of the existing airport hotel from 1 april 2017. 
the existing airport hotel has been upgraded to a high-end clarion hotel. the agreement 
also included the construction of a 600-room comfort hotel and a 3,000 m² conference 
facility, expected to be opened by nordic choice hotels in mid-2021. the total budget  
for upgrading and new construction will be approximately dkk 1.0 billion. when work 
on the new hotel and conference centre is complete, petter anker stor dalen’s property 
company, strawberry fields, will hold a 47% stake in the two hotels and the conference 
centre, with cph holding the remaining 53%. cph retains control.
under the agreement with naviair for the provision of air traffic services, cph has 
accepted liability for any terminal navigation charges (tnc) that naviair users may fail to 
pay. this liability takes effect when the claim has been ascertained and documented as 
irrecoverable, and when other specifically agreed terms and conditions have been met.
debt to financial institutions is secured by mortgages on cph’s properties as described  
in note 3.3.
cph has a secondary liability for the tax liabilities of the danish holding companies, which 
hold 59.4% of the shares in the company. see note 2.6 for additional information.
cph is subject to certain change of control restrictions in relation to the dkk 6 billion 
credit facility and the waiver agreements obtained in may 2020.
financial commitments
notes other notes
cph’s related parties are the danish labour market supplementary pension (atp) and the 
ontario teachers’ pension plan (otpp), given their controlling ownership interests in cph 
and an associate (see note 3.4), and the board of directors and executive management. 
see also note 2.5 regarding remuneration to the board of directors and executive 
management.
atp and otpp (via their respective underlying holding companies) jointly own and control 
copenhagen airports denmark aps (cad), company reg. (cvr) no. 29144249. cad is 
indirectly controlled by kastrup airports parent aps (kap), company reg. (cvr) no. 
33781903, which is owned by atp and otpp.
kap is thereby the ultimate holding company of cph. the consolidated annual report of 
kap, in which cph is included as a subsidiary, may be obtained from kap through private 
equity administration aps, frederiksborgvej 171, 3450 allerød, denmark.
cad holds 59.4% of both the shares and voting rights in cph.
atp and otpp (through an underlying holding company) have signed a shareholders’ 
agreement providing for agreement between the two parties on all material resolutions. 
the agreement also stipulates rules for the nomination of members to the board of direc-
tors of cph.
for additional information on atp and otpp, see www.atp.dk and www.otpp.com.

pursuant to section 55 of the danish air navigation act, special permission from the 
minister of transport is required for aerodrome operations. the permissions for the aero-
dromes in kastrup and roskilde, which are issued by the danish transport, construction 
and housing authority (dtca), are valid until 1 march 2025, at which time they must be 
renewed.
also, commission regulation (eu) no 139/2014 establishes requirements and administra-
tive procedures related to aerodromes and aerodrome operators. on 22 december 2016, 
cph received new certificates from the dtca according to eu regulations. these certifi-
cates have been issued to cph as aerodrome operator and replace the former technical 
approvals. the certificates are valid indefinitely.
the minister of transport may lay down regulations concerning the charges that may  
be levied on the use of an aerodrome (“charges regulation”).
the charges regulation for cph is set out by the dtca in bl 9-15, 4th edition, of  
16 november 2017: “regulation on payment for use of airports (airport charges)”. 
according to bl 9-15, the airlines and the airport are first requested to seek consensus on 
future airport charges in the coming regulatory period. if this is not possible, the dtca 
will set annual revenue caps, which comprise the maximum total amount the airport can 
apply for each of the years as a basis for setting the charges for the use of the aeronau-
tical facilities and services (fall-back). if the charges are negotiated by the parties, the 
parties must also agree on the length of the coming regulatory period. the regulatory 
period is two years if the charges are not agreed between the parties. the parties can 
agree amongst themselves on the charges for a period of up to six years.
note 
5.6 
concession for airport operations and charges regulation
notes other notes
bl 9-15 includes various rules on determining charges by negotiation and in the event of 
a fall-back situation. in a fall-back situation, the revenue caps will be determined to cover 
operating costs, depreciation and cost of capital for efficient operation of the airport. 
based on the revenue caps, cph is then required to prepare a proposal for charges during 
the regulatory period, for approval by the dtca. bl 9-15 includes various rules on how 
to calculate these revenue caps.
in 2018, cph and the airlines entered into a charges agreement that was approved by 
dtca in january 2019 and which sets out the charges applicable for the period 1 april 
2019 – 31 december 2023. under the charges agreement, the price for using the airport 
is fixed for each of the years in the regulatory period. charges will only be subject to 
adjustments if either the investment level changes significantly (+/-dkk 250 million over a 
three-year period) or the development in passenger numbers deviates from the forecast 
submitted by the dtca during the charges negotiations (+/-1-2.5%).

summary of significant accounting policies 
basis of preparation of the non-financial statements
the non-financial statements are prepared in accordance with the statutory statements 
on corporate responsibility, the under-represented gender and board diversity in 
accordance with sections 99a, 99b and 107d of the danish financial statements act and 
constitute a detailed description of our corporate responsibility results achieved in 2020.
you can find information on our main cr results for the year on pages 27-40 and 
the notes on the following pages, which provide a status on relevant kpi figures and 
indicators.
cph has supported the ten principles of the un global compact regarding human rights, 
workers’ rights, environment and anti-corruption since 2011. as a global compact 
signatory, cph reports on activities undertaken to incorporate the principles in its 
strategy, operations and corporate culture. as part of these efforts, cph also works to 
communicate the principles to its suppliers and business partners. since 2017, cph has 
focused on the un’s sustainable development goals (sdg), initially as part of the updated 
cph cr strategy, in which cph started a process to determine which of the 17 sdgs and 
169 sub-goals to select as future focus areas, and which goals would make sense and add 
value for cph to engage in going forward. in 2019, cph introduced esg key figures, 
which will give us better insight into sustainable value creation by applying a common 
standard.
materiality
it is cph’s responsibility to ensure that issues reported on are relevant to cph's stake-
holders and of material importance to our business both now and in the future. 
as part of cph’s new business strategy, which places corporate responsibility more 
centrally in the day-to-day work and strategic initiatives, we implemented a reporting 
standard based on esg key figures in 2019 and have continued to integrate the esg 
recommendations from nasdaq et al. in the non-financial statements in 2020. an update 
of our cr strategy was due in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 because of the corona 
crisis. part of the update will involve revisiting the sdgs with a view to sharpening our 
efforts and integrating the goals more tightly in our business.
the selection of the data included in the non-financial reporting was made based on 
statutory requirements and management’s annual evaluation of what is material to 
report to cph’s stakeholders. both short-term and long-term value creation are taken into 
account. management's assessment is based on an evaluation of last year's integrated 
report for the group, "travelling towards the airport of the future", an assessment of 
compliance and materiality, and input and comments from relevant stakeholders and the 
consortium of owners.
all cph reporting sites and companies apply identical measurement and calculation 
methods. data and disclosures are recorded continuously based on reporting from the 
individual areas and functions at the airports and are essentially based on externally 
documented records, internal records, calculations and, to a lesser extent, estimates. the 
specific method of calculation used for each kpi is stated in the related accounting policy 
note. historical data are adjusted only if a change accounts for more than 2% of the 
consolidated figure, in which case the reason is disclosed in a note.
changes relative to 2019 
to further integrate the esg recommendations and align with the new reporting requirement 
on diversity, we have implemented the following kpis and indicators in the 2020 non-financial 
statements:
• total gender diversity at all organisational levels
• gender diversity at employee level and managerial level
• average number of full-time employees
• average age
• age split in four age categories for employees and managers respectively

basis of consolidation
the annual report includes reporting for the entire group with respect to non-financial data 
and disclosures. companies are consolidated into or eliminated from reporting with effect from 
the date when they are controlled by or no longer controlled by cph, as the case may be.

the volume of carbon emissions (scope 1) is calculated based on the consumption  
of natural gas, fuel for vehicles and diesel generators, and emission factors for the 
individual sources of carbon. emission factors for sources of carbon are provided by  
the danish energy authority. for natural gas, a rolling average for the five calendar  
years immediately preceding the reporting year is used.
the volume of carbon emissions (scope 2) is calculated based on the consumption of 
power and district heating and emission factors for the individual sources of carbon.
emission factors are provided by the utility companies ctr (centralkommunernes 
transmissionsselskab i/s) for district heating and energinet for power. a rolling  
average for the five calendar years immediately preceding the reporting year is used.
the calculation of indirect carbon emissions (scope 3) is based on the number of 
aircraft operations, tenants' energy consumption, distribution of passengers by means

of transport (car, taxi, bus, train and metro) as well as several vehicles for the transport 
of goods. based on materiality, figures for the smallest sources are primarily based on 
assumptions. the determination is limited to the island of amager and, with respect 
to flights, to operations below an altitude of 3,000 feet. it is also limited by source to 
utilities and transportation.
the annual effect of energy efficiency measures is calculated. the annual energy savings 
are calculated in mwh. the savings are calculated/certified by an external firm that 
complies with the danish energy agency’s code of conduct.
energy consumption is calculated based on the consumption of power, district heating, 
natural gas, and fuel for vehicles and diesel generators. the consumption is based on 
meter readings and invoices.
notes non-financial statements
natural gas consumption in 2020 totalled 315,695 m³, down 7% from 338,009 m³ in 2019. the 
decrease can mainly be attributed to limited heating of hot water. in addition, another heat pump was 
installed at varmecentral vest, which is why heating is being generated by electricity instead of natural 
gas. this heat pump was only installed at the end of 2020, otherwise the change would have been 
greater. moreover, there were 2,474 degree-days in 2020 compared to 2,613 in 2019, which has a 
significant impact on gas consumption. source: https://www.dmi.dk
total power consumption for the airport was down 20% in 2020, with cph’s power consumption 
for its own operations 12.5% lower than in 2019. the basic reason for this is the particularly low 
passenger numbers in 2020, which led to large parts of the shopping centre being closed. in addition, 
the ates groundwater-cooling system and the heat pump facility on the coastal road helped to limit 
power consumption for cooling facilities elsewhere. the increase in second-quality water for cooling 
also had a positive impact on power consumption.
total district heating purchased for the airport in 2020 was down 25%, with cph’s district-heating 
consumption 37% lower than in 2019. the reduction in heat consumption is mainly due to low 
passenger numbers, resulting in limited consumption for hot-water heating. weather conditions in 
2020 were largely consistent with 2019.
the level of activity is the sole reason for fluctuations in energy-saving measures carried out.
another heat pump was installed at magleby in 2020, resulting in significant energy savings.
cph has also invested in new control systems for both the ates groundwater-cooling system and the 
heat pumps on the coastal road, enabling greater use to be made of the power generated. this has 
been done by linking up cph’s district heating systems, to increase the capacity of the heat pumps 
during the summer half-year.

can document a clean exhaust, e.g. fuel cells or gas. in addition, random checks are 
made of new vehicles or in the event of suspected defects. the individual lists filed by 
the companies as well as the overall statement are confidential and kept on file by cph. 
based on the overall statement, a non-confidential “green equipment %” is calculated 
covering all self-reported vehicles.
energy consumption by m² is stated as total cph consumption per m². energy 
consumption comprises power, natural gas and district heating.
the area of cph's buildings in square metres is calculated using cph’s space 
management system, which is updated on a daily basis.
co2 per passenger rose to 3.02 kg in 2020 from 0.89 kg in 2019 because of the massive decline in 
passenger numbers.
production of power via solar cells at cph increased by approximately 320% in 2020 because of the 
new solar panel systems installed at car park p3 and the head office at lufthavnsboulevarden 6.
the fluctuations are explained by the level of activity regarding energy-saving measures, extreme 
weather conditions and access to areas in connection with the expansion of cph.
we are still seeing a positive development in the share of very low-emission equipment. this is a result 
of efforts under the air quality programme, where vehicle criteria are set jointly with all key players at 
the airport.

fewer passengers in the terminals meant less waste: 2,089 tonnes in 2020 compared to 5,385 
tonnes in 2019. however, the recycling rate decreased from 27% to 25%, the main reason being 
a changed mix in 2020 between recycling, other recovery and disposal. compared to 2019, 
recycling and other recovery were reduced by 64%, while disposal was reduced by 24% only. 
disposal of waste, which primarily comes from street cleaning, must be maintained even with low 
levels of passenger activity.

performance against this kpi is determined using gender diversity percentages for all 
full-time employees in all departments.
information about employees, such as age and gender, is generally based on cph’s hr 
system records, in which an employee’s data are recorded from the date the employment 
contract comes into force until the employee is no longer on the payroll.
number of employees is divided into men and women and calculated as a percentage. 
the same procedure is used for management.
the diversity indicators are stable, with a small increase in men for both employees and manage-
ment, since there was a slight over-representation of women in the two rounds of lay-offs. this is 
because most of the lay-offs were passenger-oriented divisions of cph, where female employees 
were relatively more represented in the workforce.

including the financial year 2020.
material uncertainty relating  
to going concern
we draw attention to note 1.3 in the financial 
statements, which indicates that the company 
most likely risk being in breach of ebitda-based 
debt covenants when testing in june 2021. 
this event, along with other matters as set 
forth in note 1.3, indicate that a material 
uncertainty exist that may cast significant 
doubt upon the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. currently, it is uncertain 
whether commitments will be obtained 
to finance the operation and necessary 
investments in the coming year. however, 
it is management’s assessment that such 
commitments will be obtained which is why 
the financial statements have been prepared 
on the basis of going concern.
our opinion is not modified in respect of  
this matter.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that,  
in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
in addition to the matter described in the 
material uncertainty related to going concern 
section, we have determined the matters 
described below to be the key audit matters  
to be communicated in our report.

management’s statement & auditor's reports 
independent auditor's report (continued)
revenue comprises an aeronautical and a 
non-aeronautical segment. revenue in the 
aeronautical segment comprises passenger, 
security, take-off and aircraft parking 
charges and other charges. revenue in the 
aeronautical segment is recorded on the basis 
of various data sources that are integrated 
through automated and manual processes.
 
 
revenue in the non-aeronautical segment 
comprises concession income, rental income 
and parking charges. concession income 
and rental income are recorded on the basis 
of contracts signed. the income is recorded 
through automated processes and partially 
through manual processes as regards revenue 
based contracts. parking charges are recorded 
automatically upon leaving the parking area  
by means of parking barriers. 
we focused on this area because the large 
number of processes and transactions related 
to the various revenue streams involves a risk 
of misstatement of revenue recognition. 
refer to note 2.2 in the consolidated financial 
statement
we considered the appropriateness of the 
company’s accounting policies for revenue 
recognition of the various revenue streams, 
discussed the principles with management 
and assessed compliance with applicable 
accounting standards. 
we gained an understanding of the group’s 
internal processes and controls and tested 
relevant controls on a sample basis. in this 
connection, we tested it general controls 
related to the financial reporting, relevant 
automated application controls and manual 
controls. 
we performed substantive audit procedures 
regarding revenue through reconciliation of 
transactions with significant contracts and 
charges regulation etc. 
we performed data analysis including 
analysis of revenue transactions in order to 
identify transactions outside the ordinary 
transaction flows.
property, plant and equipment account for 
more than 90% of the group’s total assets, 
and investments for the year amounted to 
dkk 1,360 million. 
the individual items of property, plant and 
equipment consist of a large number of 
transactions that are recorded through 
manual processes on a current basis. 
investments through internal production 
and through the conclusion of agreements 
with contractors require robust control 
procedures and systems to ensure that 
the assets are recognised and measured 
accurately in the financial statements. 
a large part of property, plant and 
equipment are specialised and require 
considerable estimates by management 
for the determination and reassessment of 
useful lives, which is done in cooperation 
with the company’s own specialists. 
we focused on this area due to the 
complexity and the considerable estimates 
made by management in connection with 
the determination of useful lives. 
refer to note 3.3 in the consolidated 
financial statements.
we gained an understanding of the group’s 
internal controls and performed an evalu-
ation and validation of these through test 
of relevant controls, including procedures 
ensuring the existence and correct recording 
of additions, transfers and disposals of 
property, plant and equipment. 
we evaluated management’s assessment of 
the useful lives of property, plant and equip-
ment through analysis of the historical need 
for write-downs related to scrapped assets. 
moreover, we obtained data on the historical 
useful lives of special airport specific facilities 
and compared these with management’s 
assessment of the useful lives of property, 
plant and equipment. 
we obtained overview of investments made 
by the company for the most comprehensive 
investments, which primarily comprised, 
baggage facilities, the establishment of pier e, 
the expansion of terminal 2 and terminal 3, 
and the expansion of the security area in order 
to assess the effect of the investments on the 
existing facilities.

management’s statement & auditor's reports 
independent auditor's report (continued)
statement on management’s report
management is responsible for management’s 
report, pages 4-51.
our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover management’s report, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
management’s report and, in doing so, consider 
whether management’s report is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s 
report includes the disclosures required by the 
danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our 
view, management’s report is in accordance 
with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial statements 
act. we did not identify any material 
misstatement in management’s report.
management's responsibilities  
for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements that  
give a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements  
in the danish financial statements act and for 
the preparation of parent company financial 
statements that give a true and fair view  
in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing  
the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  
as applicable, matters related to going  
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an  
audit conducted in accordance with isas  
and the additional requirements applicable  
in denmark will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also: 
–  identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  
or the override of internal control.
–  obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
–  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
–  conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures  
in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group or the 
parent company to cease to continue as  
a going concern.
–  evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether  
the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
–  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the 
group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we 
remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.

management’s statement & auditor's reports 
independent auditor's report (continued)
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit  
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter  
or when, in extremely rare circumstances,  
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

management’s statement & auditor's reports 
limited assurance report of the independent auditor
to the stakeholders of  
københavns lufthavne a/s
the management of københavns lufthavne 
a/s engaged us to provide limited assurance 
on the consolidated non-financial statements 
stated in the annual report for the period 1 
january to 31 december 2020.
our conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and 
the evidence we obtained, nothing came to 
our attention that causes us not to believe that 
the consolidated non-financial statements as 
stated on pages 97-108 are free of material 
misstatements and are prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the accounting 
policies as stated on pages 100-108 of the 
annual report 2020.
this conclusion is to be read in the context of 
what we say in the remainder of our report.
what we are assuring
the scope of our work was limited to 
assurance over data in the consolidated 
non-financial statements in københavns 
lufthavne a/s annual report 2020.
professional standards  
applied and level of assurance
we performed a limited assurance engage-
ment in accordance with international 
standard on assurance engagements 3000 
(revised) ‘assurance engagements other than 
audits and reviews of historical financial 
in formation’, and, in respect of the green-
house gas emissions, in accordance with inter-
national standard on assurance engagements 
3410 ‘assurance engagements on greenhouse 
gas statements’. greenhouse gas quantification 
is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to deter-
mine emissions factors and the values needed  
to combine emissions of different gases.
a limited assurance engagement is substan-
tially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assess-
ment procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks; 
consequently, the level of assurance obtained 
in a limited assurance engagement is substan-
tially lower than the assurance that would 
have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control
we have complied with the code of ethics 
for professional accountants issued by the 
international ethics standards board for 
accountants, which includes independence 
and other ethical requirements founded 
on fundamental principles of integrity, 
objectivity, professional competence and 
due care, confidentiality and professional 
behaviour. pwc applies international standard 
on quality control 1 and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
our work was carried out by an independent 
multidisciplinary team with experience in 
sustainability reporting and assurance.
understanding reporting  
and measurement methodologies
data and information in the consolidated 
non-financial statements need to be read and 
understood together with the accounting 
policies on pages 100-108, which management 
is solely responsible for selecting and applying. 
the absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows 
for different, but acceptable, measurement 
techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities and over time.
work performed
we are required to plan and perform our 
work in order to consider the risk of material 
misstatement of the data. in doing so and 
based on our professional judgement, we:
 - made enquiries regarding methods, 
procedures and internal control as well as 
conducted selected interviews with data and 
reporting responsible personnel and checks 
to underlying documentation;
 - conducted analytical review of the data 
and trend explanations submitted for 
consolidation at group level;
 - evaluated the evidence obtained.
management’s responsibilities
management of københavns lufthavne is 
responsible for:
 -  designing, implementing and maintaining 
internal controls over information relevant 
to the preparation of the consolidated 
non-financial statements on pages 97-108 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; 
 -  establishing objective accounting policies for 
preparing data;
 -  measuring and reporting the consolidated 
non-financial statements based on the 
applied accounting policies; and
 -  the content of the consolidated 
non-financial statements for the period  
1 january – 31 december 2020.
