we will always focus on 
the long term objective  
of netcompany
letter from the chairman
despite severe disturbance to our mar-
kets following the covid-19 pandemic 
we continued to deliver on time, budget 
and scope. it is often in times of crisis 
the business model is truly put to the 
ultimate test, and as chairman i am 
proud of how resilient the netcompany 
business model has proven to be. the 
relentless focus on quality in everything 
we do, the focus on always being agile 
and ready to adapt to new surroundings 
while still focussing on getting projects 
live as agreed has been pivotal for our 
performance for the year. 
netcompany continued to 
deliver complex and mission 
critical solutions to our  
customers in 2020 in an  
unprecedented time 
we refrained from retracting our 
guidance for the full year during the 
spring as most other companies did, 
based on our strong backlog and 
pipeline of projects. 
however, the second lockdown in the 
uk in the fall, and the following 
impact on the uk economy, led us to 
reduce our growth expectations by a 
couple of percentage points, which 
we delivered with growth close to 17% 
in constant currencies. despite the 
negative impact from covid-19 we 
refrained from participating in any 
government relief package on a 
group level and still realised margins 
of 26%. for 2021, we expect to grow 
15-20% organically and deliver 
around 23-25% in adjusted ebita 
margin.

we have always strived to be open, 
transparent and direct in our commu-
nication – with all stakeholders includ-
ing the investor community and share-
holders, which i believe that we have 
exercised in a difficult time. during the 
year, we have seen increased interest 
in our company and we have wel-
comed several new shareholders. as 
of december we entered the main 
index of nasdaq copenhagen – the 
c25 index – following increased mar-
ket capitalisation of close to 100% in 
2020 and an average daily share turn-
over which more than doubled in 
2020.
our work as board of directors
during the year, we have made a cou-
ple of changes to the board. pernille 
fabricius stepped down as vice-
chairman and left the board during the 
spring. juha christensen assumed the 
role as vice-chairman of the board of 
directors. in addition, robbert kuppens 
left the board for personal matters dur-
ing the summer. instead we welcomed 
Åsa riisberg, a swedish citizen, and 
hege skryseth, a norwegian citizen. 
Åsa riisberg assumed the role as 
chairman of the audit committee.
during the year, the board has 
engaged in discussions and prioritisa-
tions around the strategic direction, 
the financial performance, risk man-
agement and general governance 
within the group. we reconfirmed the 
long term strategic ambition for 
netcompany and believe that we 
stand strong to deliver on that ambi-
tion in the years to come. further, we 
have conducted a self evaluation 
where we have concluded that we as a 
board fulfil our fiduciary duties. 
capital structure
for the year 2020, we propose that 
the annual general meeting approve 
to pay out dkk 50m as a dividend for 
the year. in addition, we will initiate a 
share buyback programme of the 
same size bringing the total remunera-
tion to the shareholders to dkk 100m 
for the year. our strong financial posi-
tion and cash flow allows us to do so. 
we will continue to ensure a solid cap-
ital base for netcompany and will 
gradually increase the distribution of 
free cash flow to shareholders.

extraordinary results in 
an extraordinary year
letter from the ceo
2020 has indeed been an extraordi-
nary year. the spread of covid-19 
globally has challenged our busi-
nesses, authorities and every institu-
tion in society. when i look back at 
2020, i am truly proud of what we 
have achieved driven by our talented 
workforce. we have delivered a wide 
range of complex business critical 
solutions helping some of the largest 
public and private organisations and 
enterprises to realise benefits through 
digitalisation.
our strong performance is a testi-
mony to our dedicated focus on 
always delivering what we promise to 
our customers no matter the chal-
lenges we face – high quality solu-
tions on time, budget and scope. 
following our steadfast and guiding 
principle the group has realised 
around 17% growth and 26% margins 
generating earnings close to dkk 
750m. 
i am pleased to see netcompany 
being so resilient in creating ongoing 
business value and high quality in all 
our project deliveries. 
in close collaboration with atp, net-
company delivered socialpension – a 
secure and efficient public benefits plat-
form that ensures correct and timely 
pay-out of benefits to citizens. further, 
the danish authorities was equipped 
with covidmeter and smittestop - 
solutions contributing to monitor and 
combat the spread of covid-19. 
in the fall of 2020, we established  
a joint venture together with 
copenhagen airport a/s, to develop a 
future market leading digital airport 
platform. also, in 2020 dsv went live 
with a new global platform for handling 
the quoting and sales processes across 
all countries in the road division.

& world-class employees

in addition, we engaged in promising 
partnerships and delivery of complex 
projects in our entities outside of 
denmark - encouraging for our ability 
to execute on our longer-term vision 
of becoming a northern european 
market leader. 
our growing international operation
a dedicated effort to grow our inter-
national footprint shows positive 
momentum. our unique business 
model proves repeatable and scalable 
across markets with exciting and stra-
tegically important recent wins in both 
norway and the netherlands. 
in may, netcompany was selected to 
deliver and maintain a toll service 
provider solution for fjellinjen utsteder 
as, who wish to make toll payments 
simpler and clearer for drivers and 
companies. in october, it was 
announced that netcompany will be 
the norwegian medicines agency's 
long term strategic digitalisation part-
ner in developing a new and innovative 
digital platform. furthermore, the 
norwegian authorities appointed 
netcompany to deliver the new contact 
tracing app designed to better help 
containing the spread of covid-19. 
in the netherlands, the rapid adoption 
of the successful netcompany busi-
ness model and the inherent focus on 
complex, larger scale public projects 
in the dutch operation has led to 
impressive results. 
in july, we proudly delivered a new 
and modern donor register for the 
dutch government – a solution being 
praised for its accessibility and 
user-friendliness. our pipeline is prom-
ising and supports our continued 
growth in the exciting dutch market.  
in the uk, the severe negative impact 
from covid-19 to the economy has 
challenged the business. we have 
experienced engagements being post-
poned or even cancelled in the short 
term, while we have continued to 
deliver quality performance in all our 
existing projects. in addition, we have 
successfully converted the majority of 
our contractors to permanent employ-
ees during 2020. this is a planned and 
important step to leverage the full 
potential of our unique and scalable 
business model in the uk market – a 
market we strongly believe has large 
potential in a long term perspective.
it is therefore with great confidence 
and motivation we continue to exe-
cute on our planned integration of 
both talented new hires and the 
netcompany business model.  
reinventing the way to  
digitise societies  
the advantages of digital transformation 
are real, tangible, and in many cases cru-
cial for establishing sustainable business 
models in both private and public enter-
prises. at netcompany, we enable our 
customers to adapt to the ever-changing 
world whether the changes are caused 
by political forces, climate change, or an 
unforeseen pandemic. 
in 2020, we launched the govtech 
framework consisting of hundreds of 
society-critical it solutions based on 
more than 2,000 components. our 
govtech framework, which might be 
the most comprehensive portfolio of 
successful govtech deliveries and com-
ponents in northern europe, provides 
in-depth insights as well as a deep 
understanding of what we believe a 
successful delivery model for a modern 
digital public sector should look like. 
this goes hand in hand with our flexi-
ble platform engineering. we believe 
in agile, futureproof solutions, based 
on proven platform components that 
ensure full flexibility and opportunity 
for ongoing innovation. with our 
undisputed track record of delivering 
some of the most complex and inno-
vative solutions we know how to 
deliver the right solutions instrumental 
for world-class, user-friendly, digital 
services for citizens and businesses. 
we are convinced that whilst a lot has 
been achieved in the area of digitalisation 
we are still only at the starting point of 
the journey. the govtech framework and 
our platform engineering combined will 
be key drivers in helping governments 
and businesses across markets pave the 
way for a successful and sustainable 
business model in a digital world. 
andré rogaczewski
ceo and co-founder
unique talent delivering unique 
results
our ongoing success is defined by our 
ability to continuously attract, develop, 
and retain top talent in all markets. in 
2020, we welcomed around 1,000 new 
netcompany employees and increased 
the employee base by 20% reaching a 
total of around 3,100 talented people. 
the majority of our new starters have 
been warmly and successfully wel-
comed virtually, due to covid-19 
restrictions. i am full of admiration of 
how we have managed to onboard our 
new netcompany family members vir-
tually to ensure the best possible start 
to hopefully an exceptional and devel-
oping career path with us. 
despite the impact of covid-19 we 
have continued to invest in our employ-
ees personal and professional skills and 
will continue to do so in the future to 
sustain a highly attractive workplace 
for top class it professionals. 
i am excited to embark on 2021 
together with our clients, partners, and 
employees getting another step closer 
to realise our ambition of becoming a 
northern european market leader.

our 
business
jan, manager
“i want to drive the digitalisation 
of society in the right direction 
and make the world a better 
place through technology”
our ambition 
and strategy
our ambition in netcompany is to become a northern 
european market leader within it services. to realise 
that ambition we have defined a strategy based on 
three main pillars  
in the four countries where we are 
already present, we aim to increase 
our market share by focussing on 
winning larger and complex projects 
to deliver solutions to both public 
and private customers.
by attracting the best talent, edu-
cating them rigorously in our own 
netcompany academy, and by 
ensuring quality “side by side” train-
ing with skilled more experienced 
colleagues, we are confident that 
our value proposition will prevail 
leading us to gain market shares.
where it makes sense, we will be 
willing to make “bolt on” acquisitions 
in specific areas to gain access to 
either a pool of specific talent, a cer-
tain industry or a given technology.
the way netcompany operates and 
develops complex solutions can be 
expanded into other countries. since 
2016, netcompany has established 
its presence in norway, the uk and 
the netherlands – all via acquisi-
tions. in general terms, netcompany 
expects to reach financial perfor-
mance targets of 20-25% growth 
and 20-25% ebita margin in new 
countries within 3-5 years after 
acquisition.
the plan for the next couple of years 
is to establish netcompany in 
sweden and finland. where entry 
into a new country historically has 
been done via an acquisition, our 
entry into sweden could also be 
made greenfield in conjunction with 
a new swedish customer.
a key part of netcompany´s delivery 
model is to use common tools and 
methodologies for developing and 
documenting new solutions. since the 
founding of netcompany in 2000, 
these methodologies have been in 
place and a significant number of 
components have been developed 
and standardised. these components 
belong to netcompany and have in 
2020 been formally structured into a 
framework named govtech. 
the govtech framework allows us to 
present new solutions to new and 
existing customers, where parts of the 
end solution exist already and hence, 
significantly reduces time to market for 
our customers and in addition reduces 
the total costs of ownership.
in addition, we have embarked on 
“the platform” approach when devel-
oping new large complex solutions. 
we will seek to enter partnerships 
with customers when developing new 
platforms that can subsequently be 
commercialised in a broader context 
– like the case with copenhagen 
airport and the establishment of the 
joint venture, smarter airports, to 
develop a new digital airport 
platform.

equity story
this means that in the solutions we 
develop, maintain and operate, we:
•  use new technologies to develop 
solutions
•  are technology agnostic
•  focus on mission critical and com-
plex solutions with our clients
•  have no legacy systems in our  
portfolio
in doing so we enable our client’s  
digital transformation making them 
more competitive, more efficient and 
bring them into a position to lead the 
industries or services they operate in.
our business is split between public 
and private customers with roughly 
half of our revenues stemming from 
development of new solutions and 
the other half stemming from main-
taining and running them.
we achieve our financial metrics by 
having a relentless focus on always 
delivering our projects on time, budget 
and scope. we have done so since we 
were founded in 2000 by ensuring that 
we always have it people leading it 
people, by employing top talent and by 
adhering to the same methodology on 
all projects in all parts of the company. 
when we enter new geographies, we 
aim to transition the acquired com-
pany into the netcompany operating 
model in 3-5 years.

ensuring quality  
medicinal treatment 
case story
netcompany is partnering with the 
norwegian medicines agency in the 
development of a new digital platform 
after having won one of the largest 
new govtech deals in the norwegian 
public sector in 2020. 
the project is a great example of 
netcompany’s approach to scalable 
govtech platforms that can be adapted 
to fit the needs of the specific client 
and context. the new platform for the 
norwegian medicines agency will be 
based on open govtech registry com-
ponents used to build a similar plat-
form for the danish medicines agency 
that launched in november 2020. 
both nordic medicines agencies aim to 
ensure that the population in each 
country has access to safe, reliable, 
and efficient medicine. the agencies 
are also the specialists and supervisory 
authorities for medical devices, just as 
they facilitate research and innovation.
in order to carry out these tasks in the 
best possible way, both agencies con-
sidered it necessary to acquire a new 
digital platform. one that will 
strengthen cooperation and interaction 
with european authorities, improve 
internal processes and make informa-
tion to the health service more accessi-
ble. one that can be used to efficiently 
administer all processes surrounding 
medicine approval, marketing authori-
sations and supervision.  
as the digital partner of both agencies, 
netcompany delivers on a 
long term  digital partnership  to create 
wider and more  efficient use of data
society-critical task. in collaboration 
with the agencies, we help make sure 
that the agencies’ specific ambitions 
for the platform are met, as well as 
ensuring that the platforms follow local 
legislation and improve all aspects of 
user engagement. 
for the norwegian medicines agency, 
netcompany has become the new long 
term digital partner the agency has 
been looking for. the project is a his-
torical milestone for the data-centred 
agency as the project allows for a 
wider and more efficient use of the 
agency’s data between the agency’s 
employees, just as the platform will 
interact extensively with its european 
counterparts.

state pension and 
disability pensions
case story
as an organisation within atp (danish 
labour market supplementary 
pension), europe's 3rd largest pension 
provider, udbetaling danmark is 
responsible for the collection, dis-
bursement and control of a number of 
public benefits on behalf of the 
danish government, and contributes 
to an efficient welfare society. 
a central task of the organisation is to 
handle state pensions and early retire-
ment pensions, as well as other pen-
sion related benefits for danish citi-
zens in denmark and abroad. 
in need of a modern replacement, 
atp and netcompany engaged in 
close collaboration to deliver 
socialpension — a secure and efficient 
benefits platform that ensures correct 
and timely pay-out of benefits. 
benefits that for many recipients are 
their only income and, hence, are 
essential for their livelihood.
the platform covers a full range 
self-service portal, managing the 
assessment and calculations of bene-
fits based on current legislation com-
bined with different aspects in a pen-
sioner’s life — such as income, 
cohabitation and death — as well as 
the management of the actual pay-

the main objective of the project was 
to combine several obsolete and 
cost-intensive systems into one mod-
ern system with significantly lower 
operational and maintenance costs.

the platform was delivered during the 
covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 
2020, showing great skills, ambitions, 
and commitments from everyone 
involved to succeed with the project 
and meet the deadline. this project is 
also a testament to how netcompany’s 
platforms can easily be adapted to 
work across industries and sectors.

2020 financial performance and 2021 guidance
in 2020, the group delivered revenue 
growth of 17% in constant currencies 
(16% reported) of which 16 percentage 
points was organic and 1 percentage 
point was non-organic related to the 
acquisition of qdelft (netcompany 
netherlands) in 2019. 
adjusted ebita margin was 26%. 
revenue growth in constant curren-
cies and adjusted ebita margin was in 
line with the revised guidance of the 
year.
non-organic revenue growth for the 
year was 1%, which was in line with 
expectations.
the market for digitalisation in 
denmark remained strong in 2020 and 
a number of public tenders are 
expected to come to the market in 
2021 following the recent years' trend. 
in addition, more and more projects in 
the private sector are initiated, which 
enables a balanced growth between 
the public and private sector. 
continued focus on talent attraction 
and development remain core, and the 
group expects training activities and 
social events to return to pre covid-
19 levels for 2021.

in the uk, the transition away from 
independent contractors towards our 
own employees has almost been com-
pleted and, hence, the implementation 
of ir35 is not expected to have any 
negative impact on netcompany uk 
assuming resources are utilised. 
additional investment, in the form of 
increased involvement from senior 
management in denmark and in the 
further development of the uk busi-
ness, is still expected.
the integration of netcompany 
netherlands has progressed well in 
2020 and the dutch operation is 
expected to continue its strong 
growth. the completion of two large 
fixed fee projects in q1 2020 has 
changed the dutch operation struc-
turally, which will also impact margins 
in 2021 positively.
in norway, the investment into devel-
oping the business to tender for – and 
win – larger projects started to show 
results in 2020. while good progres-
sion has been made in 2020, there is 
still some work remaining before the 
integration can be concluded as com-
plete.
the group has plans to enter into 
sweden and finland, but timing is dif-
ficult to accurately predict and thus 
the effects on top line growth is not 
included in the guidance for 2021.
in the fall, the group revised its expec-
tations for both top line growth and 
margin due to the negative impacts on 
the uk operation following the strict 
lockdown measures in relation to the 
second wave of covid-19 infections. 
this led the group to reduce its 
expectations for revenue growth by 2 
percentage points to the low end of 
17% to 19% and to reduce its expecta-
tions to adjusted ebita margin by 1 
percentage point to around 25%.

guidance for 2021
for 2021, we expect organic revenue 
growth of 15% to 20% in constant cur-
rencies and an adjusted ebita margin 
of between 23% and 25% in constant 
currencies. 
the range in the expectation for reve-
nue growth reflects the general mac-
roeconomic uncertainty, and the con-
tinued risk in the uk market in 
particular. 
we have in our guidance assumed to 
be able to initiate internal training 
activities and social events in 2021 and 
bring them to the same level as pre 
covid-19. 
in addition, office expansions in both 
copenhagen and oslo that were 
planned but delayed in 2020 are 
expected to be completed in 2021. 
further, the margins in 2021 will be 
negatively impacted by the full inclu-
sion of expenses for the ongoing three 
year revolving long term incentive 
programme initiated at the time of the 
ipo.
based on organic growth, free cash 
flow is expected to continue to 
improve during 2021 in absolute terms. 
leverage, measured as net interest 
bearing debt to 12 months adjusted 
ebita, is expected to be around 0.5 
taking into consideration redistribu-
tion of funds of dkk 100m to share-
holders in 2021. 
our expectations for 2021 is reflecting 
a number of uncertainties, which indi-
vidually or in conjunction can have a 
negative impact on our ability to grow 
our business and hence our margins. 
we base our 2021 expectations on the 
following main assumptions:
•  no negative impact from macroeco-
nomic events.
•  no material improvement to the 
business environment in the uk fol-
lowing severe economic conse-
quences from the covid-19 in 2020 
and the uncertainty of brexit.
•  public digitalisation to continue on at 
least par level with 2020.
•  no delay or deferral of ongoing or 
planned public tender processes.
•  continued digitalisation in the pri-
vate sector in the markets where the 
group has meaningful presence in 
that specific segment.
•  continued ability to attract, educate 
and retain talent throughout the 
group.
•  ability to schedule training activities, 
social events, business travel and 
other meetings across our markets 
with no major restrictions.
in addition, our guidance for 2021 is 
based on the assumption that no 
major third wave of covid-19 with 
associated lockdown restrictions will 
occur. given current progress on 
developing and making vaccines avail-
able, the general improvement in 
understanding of how covid-19 
in 2021, we expect organic revenue growth 
of  15% to 20%  in constant currencies and 
an adjusted ebita margin of between  23% 
and 25%  in constant currencies

transmits and the measures required 
to prevent this, we see a third pro-
longed full lockdown as unlikely. 
however, at this point in time we can-
not rule out the possibility entirely.

netcompany netherlands, acquired at 13 may 2019, is not fully included in the reported figures for 2019 and the impact from netcompany netherlands for the period 1 janu-
ary 2020 until 13 may 2020 is shown in the table as non-organic impact from netcompany netherlands, whereas impact from 14 may 2020 and onwards will be seen as 
organic impact.
reported revenue grew 15.7% (con-
stant 16.6%) to dkk 2,838.6m from 
dkk 2,453.9m in 2019. non-organic 
revenue was 1.1 percentage points 
related to the impact from 
netcompany netherlands in the 
period from 1 january 2020 to 13 may 
2020.
revenue growth was driven by strong 
performance in the danish operation 
that grew by 21% and in the dutch 
operation that more than doubled rev-
enue in 2020. in norway, revenue 
growth was 0.7% (constant 9.6%) and 
in the uk, revenue growth was nega-
tive 14.8% (constant 13.6%).
in 2019, revenue was positively 
impacted by the release of dkk 32.6m 
from the risk contingency reserve 
compared to a release of dkk 3.5m in 
2020. the net impact hereof is close 
to 1.5 percentage points negative on 
the revenue growth rate for 2020.
growth on group level was driven by 
the public segment which grew 22.1%, 
whereas the private segment only 
increased 6.3% as a consequence of 
the impact on the private segment fol-
lowing covid-19 related lockdown 
restrictions in norway and in the uk.

annual report 2020
management review 
despite the negative impacts from 
covid-19 related measures taken by 
various governments, netcompany has 
seen utilisation ratios in line with previ-
ous years. however, the underlying 
performance per country has varied 
with the operations in denmark and 
the netherlands yielding improved uti-
lisation ratios and the operation in 
norway and the uk yielding lower uti-
lisation ratios compared to 2019.
cost of services increased with 15.4%, 
which was slightly lower than the 
increase in revenue. this was caused 
by a higher utilisation in denmark and 
the netherlands, which was almost 
ofset by lower utilisation in norway 
and in the uk and the transition away 
from independent contractors to own 
employees in a period where revenue 
was lost at short notice also impacted 
utilisation negatively in the uk. 
additionally, more resources have 
been spent on business development, 
tender activities and other sales 
related tasks in 2020 than in 2019 – in 
particular as a consequence of the 
danish operation being involved in 
multiple tenders in norway, the uk 
and in the netherlands. while these 
activities, in the short term have 
reduced the gross profit margins, they 
are fundamental for the continued 
future progression in margins across 
the group.
gross profit margin for the group was 
slightly higher in 2020 at 40.7% com-
pared to 40.6% in 2019. additionally, 
gross profit margin in 2019 was posi-
tively impacted by the release of dkk 
32.6m from the risk contingency 
reserve into revenue. for 2020, the 
release amounted to dkk 3.5m. 
adjusted for the contingency risk 
reserves, gross profit margin in 2020 
and 2019 would have been 40.6% and 
39.8% respectively, which means gross 
profit margin increased by 0.8% - in a 
normalised setting.
sales and marketing costs increased 
to dkk 17.1m, corresponding to an 
increase of 45.7% due to a low base in 
previous year. during 2020, more 
resources have been used to increase 
awareness of the netcompany brand 
and name outside of denmark, and in 
addition, a number of new branding 
activities were launched in denmark 
to strengthen netcompany's brand 
even further.
administrative costs increased by 7.4% 
compared to 2019, hence, at a lower 
rate than the intake of new employees 
which grew by 20.7%. the main reason 
for administrative costs growing 
slower than the fte intake is the 
restrictions imposed related to covid-
19, which has led to less travel, fewer 
social activities and also fewer courses. 
in addition, planned office expansion 
in copenhagen and oslo has been 
postponed from 2020 to 2021. while 
some costs patterns are most likely to 
change structurally it is still too early 
to firmly conclude that recurring cost 
savings are to follow from covid-19. 
as in 2019, the cost for the group's 
long term incentive programme is in a 
gradual build up phase meaning that 
the cost for the programme will not be 
fully loaded into the costs base until 
2022. the annual increase for the total 
long term incentive based remunera-
tion programme is approximately dkk 
25m of which around dkk 8m are 
reported as administrative costs and 
the remaining part included in cost of 
adjusted ebita was  dkk 744.4m   
– an increase of 20.6%
services. once fully loaded the total 
annual cost for the programme is 
around dkk 40m – before adding new 
participants to the programme.
40.7%
gross profit margin
6.6%
non-client facing fte
non-client facing ftes was 6.6% in 
2020 – slightly below the level of 2019. 
netcompany continues to aim for a 
ratio of non-client facing ftes of 
around 5%. in 2020, particularly in the 
uk, additional resource was added to 
the hr function to facilitate the 
increased intake of our own employ-
ees. for 2021 and onwards, it is 
expected that the non-client facing 
fte ratio will gradually move towards 
the targeted 5% level.
adjusted ebita was dkk 744.4m, 
which is an increase of more than dkk 
125m or 20.6% compared to 2019, 
yielding an adjusted ebita margin of 
26.2%, which is 1.1 percentage point 
higher than realised margin in 2019. 
adjusting for the release of the dkk

would have been 2 percentage points, 
underlining the strong operational 
performance realised in 2020, which 
was further improved by savings on 
some costs as a result of the measures 
implemented related to covid-19.

loan was negative dkk 23.9m. interest 
rate costs for the group's external 
banking facility was dkk 13.7m com-
pared to dkk 18.8m in 2019.
the adjustment of the contingent pur-
chase prise for the dutch acquisition 
was dkk 141.3m and reflected an 
increased value of our dutch invest-
ment following superior performance 
in 2020. the increase in the purchase 
price was handled as an expense in 
accordance with ifrs 3.
net tax for the year was 129.8m, which 
was equivalent to an effective tax rate 
of 28.7% compared to an effective tax 
rate of 21.9% in 2019. the increase in 
effective tax rate was due to the non-
tax deductible fair value adjustment of 
dkk 141.3m. if not adjusted for the 
contingent purchase price regulation, 
effective tax rate would have been 
21.9%. netcompany pays corporate 
income tax in all its operating entities 
following current and at any time 
applicable rules. in addition, 
netcompany has not participated in 
any government funded support or 
relief package related to covid-19 in 
any of the countries in which 
netcompany is doing business.
when adjusted for the fair value 
adjustment of the purchase price for 
the dutch acquisition, net profit for 
the year was dkk 463.2m, corre-
sponding to an improvement of dkk 
74.7m compared to 2019.
operating profit (ebit) increased by 
dkk 133.7m to dkk 644.9m. 
amortisation was in line with 2019. 
some of the intangible assets are fully 
amortised in 2020 and others will be 
fully amortised by the end of 2022.
net financial cost for the year was dkk 
47m of which the majority is related to 
currency exchange adjustments. in q4, 
an internal loan within the group 
related to the financing of the acquisi-
tion of hunter macdonald in the uk, 
now netcompany uk, was converted 
to equity and eliminate the translation

revenue in constant currencies grew 
by 16.6% from dkk 2,453.9m in 2019 
to dkk 2,861.1m in 2020. the non-or-

tion amounted to dkk 26.2m or 0.9%.
in the danish operation, revenue 
increased by dkk 381.1m, equivalent to 
21% growth compared to 2019. in 
norway, revenue increased by dkk 
19.1m (9.6%) and in the netherlands,

equivalent to negative 13.6%.
for the danish public tenders the win

annual report 2020

the net impact hereof is equivalent to 
a negative impact to revenue growth 
in denmark in 2020 of close to 2 per-
centage points. gross profit margin in 
2019 would have been 0.8 percentage 
point lower adjusted for this too. 
the underlying strong performance in 
denmark was driven by the continued 
timely delivery of a number of larger 
projects and continued growth of new 
projects in both the public and private 
segment. in addition, the restrictions 
imposed related to covid-19 has led 
to fewer hours used on training and 
social events, which in turn has 
increased the amount of available 
hours in general terms to be used on 
client related tasks.
in norway, gross profit margin was 
negatively impacted by the lack of 
major new wins from the summer 2019 
to the fall 2020 as resources have not 
been fully utilised. additionally, loss of 
smaller short term projects with some 
private customers followed the 
covid-19 measures implemented in 
norway during the spring and sum-
mer. further, a number of senior 
managers and partners have spent a 
significant amount of time during 
2020 on business development in 
norway, leading to lower gross profit 
margin as costs related hereto are 
allocated to the norwegian unit.
in the uk, gross profit margin was 
negatively impacted by a combination 
of hard lockdown from covid-19, the 
ongoing change from independent 
contractors to permanent employees 
and too a high proportion of the pro-
ject portfolio being of a short term 
nature. loss of projects seen particu-
lar in the spring and late q3 2020 led 
to significant under-utilisation of 
resources. in the same period,  
netcompany uk successfully had 
reduced the amount of independent 
contractors by close to 100 and 
instead hired the doubled amount of 
own employees. this essentially meant 
that the cost of the underutilisation 
was mainly borne by netcompany uk.
in the dutch operation on the other 
hand, gross profit margins were 
improved significantly during 2020 as a 
result of two larger fixed fee projects 
with negative margins being completed 
early in the first quarter. in addition, the 
dutch operation has increased utilisa-
tion during the year compared to 2019 
following the implementation of the 
netcompany operating model.
in denmark, adjusted ebita before hq 
costs increased by dkk 165m yielding 
an adjusted ebita margin of 33.4% 
compared to 31.3% in 2019. the restric-
tions to travel and social activities 
imposed as a response to the covid-
19 pandemic has improved margins by 
around 1 percentage point. in addition, 
planned office expansions in 
copenhagen and oslo was postponed 
to 2021 improving margins further.
in norway, the adjusted ebita margin 
before hq costs was reduced by 8.7 
percentage points as a result of the 
lower activity, also impacting gross 
profit margin, and costs for redundan-
cies for members of the former man-
agement group. severance costs 
impacted adjusted ebita margin by 
1.4 percentage points.
the adjusted ebita margin before hq 
costs was significantly reduced in the 
uk as a direct consequence of the 
lower utilisation and more permanent 
employees also impacting gross profit 
margin. in addition, the uk operation 
had increased the hr function sub-
stantially in 2020 to hire the replace-
ment of close to 100 independent 
contractors.
adjusted ebita before allocated cost  
from hq increased by  dkk 133.8m  yielding 
an adjusted ebita margin of  27.5%
in the netherlands, the adjusted ebita 
margin before hq costs increased 
from negative 15.7% in 2019 to positive 
19% in 2020. the improvement was 
driven by the improved gross margin 
and a significant improvement in the 
administrative routines in the dutch 
operation during the year. in addition, 
a number of integration projects have 
been completed during 2020.
total hq costs allocated to the oper-
ating entities was dkk 41.5m com-
pared to dkk 36.4m in 2019. the main 
increase in the allocated costs relates 
to the gradual build up of share based 
remuneration following the restricted 
stock units (rsu) programme that 
has a three year revolving character, 
which means that the full costs for the 
rsus will be embedded in the num-
bers from 2021 and onwards.

revenue in the public segment 
increased by 22.1% in 2020 to dkk 
1,777.7m compared to dkk 1,455.5m in 
2019. the non-organic growth was 1.8 
percentage points and is attributable 
to the dutch operation.
the increase in the public segment rev-
enue was overall driven by continued 
high activity in the danish operation, 
which grew a total of 21% and in the 
dutch operation, which close to tripled 
revenue in the segment in 2020.
in denmark, performance was driven 
by high activity levels with the danish 
ministry of taxation, kombit and atp, 
whereas growth in the dutch segment 
was driven by high activity with the 
replacement fund and the 
participation fund as well as the 
ministry of finance in the netherlands.
in norway, revenue in the public seg-
ment showed moderate growth driven 
by the wins late in the year together 
with the norwegian medicines agency. 
in the uk, growth was 8.1%. 
gross profit margin for the segment

37.6%, however, with substantial devi-
ations from country to country. in 
denmark and the netherlands, mar-
gins improved following strong deliv-
ery on projects and high utilisation 
throughout the year despite covid-
19. in the uk and in norway, margins 
were lower than in 2019 as covid-19 
impacted operations in these markets 
negatively as they both had a number 
of smaller short term projects in the 
public segment that were postponed 
during 2020 leading to lower utilisa-
tion.
adjusted ebita margin improved to 
22.8% compared to 20.9% in 2019. in 
addition to the improved gross profit 
margin, adjusted ebita margins was 
improved significantly in the danish 
operation following strong deliveries 
and a generally lower level of costs to 
be allocated following covid-19. in 
addition, performance in the dutch 
operation was also improved signifi-
cantly on adjusted ebita margin level.

private segment
revenue in the private segment was 
dkk 1,060.9m, which was 6.3% higher 
compared to realised in 2019 of dkk 
998.3m. however, there are significant 
differences in the underlying perfor-
mance country by country. in both 
norway and the uk, revenue in the 
private segment was reduced in 2020 
compared to 2019, whereas the reve-
nue in the private segment in denmark 
increased by 20.9% in 2020 with 
growth picking up in the third and 
fourth quarter, which both grew by 
more than 24%. the strong growth in 
the danish segment was a result of an 
increase of larger projects in the mar-
ket late 2019 and early 2020, which 
netcompany successfully won. 
additionally, the growth was impacted 
by the continued development of pro-
jects with topdanmark and the joint 
venture, which netcompany estab-
lished with copenhagen airport.
in norway, revenue in the private seg-
ment fell by dkk 3.1m in 2020 mainly 
as a consequence of projects being 
postponed or delayed due to covid-
19. the reason for these projects being 
delayed was – as opposed to denmark 
– that the projects to a large extent

were smaller short term non-strategic 
projects, mainly sold on the basis of 
individual expertise. the same was the 
case in the uk where revenue in the 
private segment fell by dkk 72.7m. 
like in 2019 the amount of business 
that the dutch operation delivers in 
the private segment is limited.
despite the drop of revenue in the pri-
vate segment in both norway and in 
the uk, gross profit margin for the seg-
ment on a group level was in line with 
last year at 45.3%, mainly driven by a 
strong margin in denmark and the fact 
that the relative size of the danish 
operation is large. on a group level, the 
loss of revenue in norway and the uk 
was to a large extent recovered by 
higher margin revenue realised in the 
danish operation during 2020.
for the same reasons adjusted ebita 
margin for the group at 32% was in 
line with 2019.

the combined value of work in pro-
gress, prebilled invoices and trade 
receivables increased by 11.7% com-
pared to a revenue growth of 15.7% in 
2020. the combined value of contract 
work in progress, prebilled invoices and 
trade receivables as a percentage of 
revenue fell from 32.6% in 2019 to 31.5% 
in 2020, which was an improvement of 
1.1 percentage points, while days sales 
outstanding improved from 79 days in 
2019 to 59 days in 2020.
free cash flow and cash 
conversion ratio
netcompany generated a free cash 
flow of dkk 557m, an increase of dkk 
121.3m, which led to a cash conversion 
ratio of 139.4% compared to 93.2% in 
2019. the increase in cash conversion 
ratio was driven by a combination of 
the factors described and the fair 
value adjustment of the contingent 
consideration regarding the acquisi-
tion of netcompany netherlands (pre-
vious qdelft b.v.). adjusting for the 
fair value adjustment of contingent 
consideration, cash conversion ratio 
for 2020 would have been 103%.
funding and liquidity 
by the beginning of 2020, 
netcompany had drawn dkk 965.2m 
of the total committed facilities of 
dkk 1,500m. during 2020, 
netcompany has used the positive 
cash flow to repay borrowings of fur-
ther dkk 200m, hence, a total out-
standing credit facility of dkk 765.2m 
as of 31 december 2020. further, 
netcompany invested dkk 75m in a 
joint venture with copenhagen 
airport. 
the positive development in the cash 
position has resulted in a debt lever-
age below 1, as strived for. this also 
meant that the external interest rate 
has been reduced twice during 2020, 
and now equals 1.1%. 
based on the strong financial position 
and cash flow, netcompany proposes 
a payout of dkk 50m in dividend to 
shareholders and will initiate a share 
buyback programme of the same size 
bringing the total remuneration to the 
shareholders in 2020 to dkk 100m.

netcompany is helping customers 
implement new technologies to fur-
ther digitalise their respective busi-
nesses and operations, which indi-
rectly have a positive impact on the 
environment as these new solutions 
are significantly more efficient in rela-
tion to energy consumption than old 
legacy systems. 
the impacts of these systems are diffi-
cult to measure, however, they do exist 
and contribute positively to an 
improved environment. in addition, 
netcompany measures its direct impact 
on the environment as outlined here.
netcompany has a strong focus on its 
employees to ensure that they are 
continually educated. we measure our 
employees satisfaction with working 
at netcompany and can proudly 
report an enps of 42 across the 
group. we have an equal pay policy 
meaning that women and men with 
equal experiences, competencies and 
performance receive the same salary. 
netcompany recognises that a diverse 
and inclusive workplace is imperative for 
securing and maintaining competitive-
ness in the market and securing better 
problem-solving abilities and innovation. 
raising the underrepresented gender 
in our group is not easy given that 
netcompany hires 80% of staff 
straight from educations where the 
same gender inequality is present. 
however, we will aim to raise the num-
ber of female it professionals rela-
tively in netcompany in 2021.
netcompany has chosen to disclose 
its statutory statement on corporate 
social responsibility, including diver-
sity, cf. sections 99a, 99b and 107(d) 
of the danish financial statements 
act, and our communication on

compact, which netcompany joined in 
2013, in the form of an esg report.
this year's environmental kpi's are in 
many ways affected by covid-19 and 
should be viewed in this context. 
therefore, we have also chosen to 
maintain our environmental targets 
from 2020.

corporate governance
governance model
netcompany has a two-tier manage-
ment structure, which is comprised of 
the board of directors and the 
executive management. the board of 
directors, which is appointed by the 
shareholders, supervises the work of 
the executive management and is 
responsible for the overall and strate-
gic management and proper organisa-
tion of the company’s activities, while 
the executive management is respon-
sible for the company’s day-to-day 
management. the division of responsi-
bility between the board of directors 
and the executive management is set 
out in the rules of procedures for the 
board of directors and executive 
management instructions.
shareholders and general meetings
netcompany’s shareholders exercise 
their rights at the general meeting. 
the general meeting adopts decisions, 
such as the election of board mem-
bers and the auditor, in accordance 
with applicable law.
board of directors and executive 
management
for the time being, the board of 
directors of netcompany group a/s 
currently consists of five members. 
according to the articles of 
association, the board of directors 
must consist of at least three and not 
more than seven members elected at 
the general meeting. the board of 
directors appoints a chairman and a 
deputy chairman among its members. 
each member is elected for a one-
year term, and members may be 
re-elected. the board of directors 
meets at least five times a year and 
holds extraordinary meetings when 
required. 
the composition of the board of 
directors is intended to ensure that 
the board of directors has a diverse 
competency profile enabling the 
board of directors to perform its 
duties in the best possible manner. all 
five members of the board of 
directors are considered independent 
under the “recommendations on 
corporate governance”. 
during 2020, the board of directors 
conducted an evaluation of the board 
of directors and the individual mem-
bers. as two of the board members 
joined the board in august, it was 
decided to base the evaluation on a 
questionnaire that the individual mem-
bers of the board of directors had 
the committees perform  preparatory 
tasks  and make recommendations to the 
board of directors, who in turn will take 
the  final decision  on subjects at hand
been asked to complete. the evalua-
tion included among others effective-
ness, performance, achievements and 
composition of the board of directors, 
including an evaluation of the perfor-
mance of the individual members of 
the board of directors as well as the 
collaboration with the executive 
management. the evaluation showed 
a high degree of satisfaction among 
the members of the board of directors 
and group executive management. in 
2021, the board evaluation will be car-
ried out with external assistance.
a description of the individual board 
members, including their other execu-
tive positions and independence, can 
be found on page 35.
board committees
in order to support the board of 
directors in netcompany group a/s, 
netcompany has established three 
board committees: audit committee, 
remuneration committee and 
nomination committee.
the committees perform preparatory 
tasks and make recommendations to 
the board of directors, who in turn will 
take the final decision on subjects at 
hand. the main tasks and duties for 
each committee are set out in sepa-
rate committee charters. the charters 
are reviewed, and if deemed appropri-
ate updated, and approved by the 
board of directors annually.

whistleblower
in 2017, netcompany implemented a 
whistleblower system, where the pur-
pose is to provide a possibility to report 
serious offences or suspected serious 
offences with full anonymity that may 
impact netcompany group as a whole 
or the life or health of an individual.
the whistleblower system allows per-
sons related to netcompany, such as 
employees, members of the executive 
management and board of directors, 
auditors, lawyers, suppliers and other 
business partners of netcompany, to 
report serious offences or suspected 
serious offences.
the whistleblower system is an inde-
pendent and autonomous channel and 
the independency is secured by using 
an external law firm (plesner) to 
receive reports submitted. the law 
firm will forward any reports to the 
chairman of the board, who will inves-
tigate the matter promptly and take 
appropriate action.
in 2020, three incidents were submit-
ted via the whistleblower system, and 
appropriate action was taken where 
applicable. 
whistleblower cases are taken very 
seriously, and we have enhanced the 
awareness of good conduct and that 
incidents can be reported through the 
whistleblower portal.

directors and executive management. 
the board regularly discuss the per-
formance of the executive

executive management is discussed. 
recommendations on corporate 
governance

mendations.

management assumes a full allocation 
of variable incentives, and will at full 
pay out of incentives be a total of 250% 
including the fixed base salary.

risk management
risk management is anchored locally 
under the  guidelines and methodol-
ogy set out by the board of directors.
risk management has always been an 
integral part of doing business in 
netcompany. whether it be entering 
new business lines, onboarding new 
customers, embracing new technolo-
gies or ensuring new employees 
understand and adhere to the group´s 
risk management, the philosophy has 
always been to anchor responsibility 
locally with the operational units 
based on methodology and processes 
defined centrally.
with expansion into new business 
segments and with increased business 
complexity the natural inherent risk in 
the group has increased during the 
past years. entering into multi-year 
development contracts, running mis-
sion-critical infrastructure and 
expanding coverage to new countries, 
naturally increases the need for a 
more comprehensive risk manage-
ment framework.
netcompany continuously improves 
the risk management framework with 
the aim of strengthening management 
of risks across the group. 
risk management framework
the overall process for the risk  
reporting can be illustrated as below:
projects, services 
and operations
information security

credit, cash manage-
ment and interests

of netcompany’s key risks, including 
root causes and mitigation actions 
taken throughout the group in 2020.
40
annual report 2020
management review 
not able to attract  
and retain talent
loss of
existing clients
root cause
netcompany is built on talent and as an it services 
company, future growth is directly linked to the abil-
ity to continuously attract, develop and retain talent. 
failure to continue to grow the employee base will 
limit the growth opportunities.
further, the progression of newly hired consultants 
to become managers, principals and eventually 
partners represents an equally high risk, as the con-
tinued development of the hierarchy is also a pre-
requisite for future growth.
risk
losing the close relationship with universities and 
other institutions may lead to a less favourable per-
ception of netcompany among graduates, thereby 
reducing the applicant pool for new hires.
a discontinuation of the netcompany academy may 
lead to fewer new applicants wanting to apply as 
career progression would be perceived as limited.
further, the lack of ongoing development of tal-
ented people may lead to loss of more experienced 
consultants, which in turn will have a negative 
impact on netcompany’s ability to hire new gradu-
ates, as the senior consultant and manager level in 
the career pyramid is crucial for continued growth.
mitigating actions 
continued building and maintaining relationships 
with leading universities in all countries where 
netcompany is represented.
continued funding for the netcompany academy. in 
case of potential short term declines in revenues, 
the academy will be one of the last resorts for 
spending cuts as it is a key pillar for continued 
growth.
established presence in other countries with large 
pools of available relevant it professionals like in 
poland and vietnam.
root cause
more than 90% of netcompany’s business is gen-
erated from existing customers at the beginning of 
the year. maintaining the current level of repeat 
customer revenue is thus a prerequisite for the 
continued growth of netcompany.
risk
failing to meet the target of being “on time, on 
budget and in scope” may lead to loss of reputa-
tion in the marketplace hindering netcompany’s 
ability to generate new business.
inability to answer tenders and business requests 
due to resource constraints may lead to a percep-
tion in the market that netcompany is not able to 
deliver on the committed obligations.
mitigating actions 
ensuring that projects are monitored and assessed 
on an ongoing basis so that potential issues and 
problems are identified before they escalate.
continued allocation of sufficient time for senior 
staff to conduct “business development” and 
allowing time to be used for answering tenders 
and business requests to ensure that a healthy 
pipeline is maintained at all times.

annual report 2020
management review 
cyberattack
general data 
protection regulation
root cause
while netcompany has a high degree of repeat 
customers generating a solid foundation for its 
annual revenues, the continued successful addition 
of new customers is also an important growth fac-
tor. new customers in new segments and new mar-
kets are an integral part of netcompany’s growth 
strategy.

tion in the marketplace hindering netcompany’s

continued allocation of sufficient time for senior 
staff to conduct “business development” and 
allowing time to be used for answering tenders 
and business requests to ensure that a healthy 
pipeline is maintained at all time.
root cause
as netcompany is hosting solutions for customers, 
cyberattacks will always be a potential risk, which 
netcompany has the responsibility to ensure ade-
quate protection against. the customer base and 
the types of services delivered are rising in critical-
ity and exposure, which may lead to an increase in 
the risk of cyberattacks.
risk
cyberattacks, including unauthorised access to 
network and data, could potentially damage the 
reputational image. 
system down time also includes attacks due to a 
breach or leak at the external supplier. unexpected 
down time for a system could result in data breach, 
loss of customers and increased costs for 
netcompany and its customers.
mitigating actions 
netcompany has various controls implemented to 
handle both internal and external risks, including 
storage platforms with georedundant mirroring 
capabilities as well as established backup proce-
dures for internal system failure.
external suppliers to netcompany are obliged to 
deliver an isae 3402 type ii audit statement to 
netcompany annually to ensure compliance for the 
external suppliers. 
netcompany continuously access the level of secu-
rity in both its solutions and internal it environments.
root cause
the general data protection regulation (gdpr) 
was implemented in may 2018 with the purpose of 
protecting eu citizens' privacy. the regulation sets 
forth the requirements for processing personal 
data. 
netcompany provides it solutions to both private 
and public customers, which involves personal and 
sensitive data.
risk
netcompany must at all times be compliant with all 
requirements, and it is crucial that no information 
leak or breach can occur. 
if netcompany is unable to demonstrate compli-
ance with gdpr or in the unlikely event, that there 
is a breach of personal data, netcompany could 
potentially be fined and will suffer reputational 
damage.
mitigating actions 
at the beginning of 2018, netcompany imple-
mented and communicated an internal data pri-
vacy policy including methodology framework. 
furthermore, security policies including security 
technology, to ensure effective protection, has 
been implemented.
in 2020, netcompany adopted a data ethics policy 
to further ensure the interface of handling all data 
in all matters.

accounting policies
note 1
netcompany group a/s presents the 
financial statements in accordance 
with the international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and additional danish disclo-
sure requirements for financial state-
ments applicable to the 2020 financial 
year. 
netcompany group a/s is an entity 
with its registered office in denmark.
the financial statements are pre-
sented in dkk, which is considered 
the functional currency of the group’s 
and the parent’s activities.
totals in the financial statements have 
been calculated on the basis of actual 
amounts in accordance with the cor-
rect mathematical method. a recalcu-
lation of totals may in some cases 
result in rounding differences caused 
by the underlying decimals not dis-
closed to the reader.
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements 
comprise netcompany group a/s 
(parent) and the entities (subsidiaries) 
that are controlled by the parent. con-
trol is achieved when the parent is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with an 
entity and has the ability to use its 
power over the entity to affect those 
returns.
consolidation principles
the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared on the basis of the finan-
cial statements of netcompany group 
a/s and its subsidiaries. the consoli-
dated financial statements are pre-
pared by adding together financial 
statement items of a uniform nature. 
the financial statements used for con-
solidation have been prepared apply-
ing the group’s accounting policies.
on consolidation, intra-group income 
and expenses, intra-group accounts 
and dividends as well as profits and 
losses on transactions between the 
consolidated entities are eliminated.
subsidiaries’ financial statement items 
are recognised in full in the consoli-
dated financial statements. netcom-
pany netherlands b.v. is recognised 
from 13 may 2019, when the group 
acquired full control of the entity.
foreign currency translation
on initial recognition, foreign currency 
transactions are translated applying 
the exchange rate at the transaction 
date. receivables, payables and other 
monetary items denominated in for-
eign currencies that have not been 
settled at the balance sheet date are 
translated using the exchange rate at 
the balance sheet date. exchange dif-
ferences that arise between the rate at 
the transaction date and the one in 
effect at the payment date or the rate 
at the balance sheet date are rec-
ognised in the income statement as 
financial income or financial expenses. 
property, plant and equipment, intan-
gible assets, and other non-monetary 
assets that have been purchased in 
foreign currencies are translated using 
historical rates.
when subsidiaries, which prepare 
their financial statements in a func-
tional currency different from dkk are 
consolidated into the consolidated 
financial statements, the items of the 
income statement are translated at 
the average exchange rates. 
exchange differences arising out of 
the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ 
balance sheet items at the beginning 
of the year using the balance sheet 
date exchange rates as well as out of 
the translation of income statements 
from average rates to the exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date are 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
revenue recognition
revenue is measured based on the 
consideration to which the group 
expects to be entitled in a contract 
with a customer and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. 
the group’s primary service offerings 
include information technology con-
sulting services and operations solu-
tions. consulting services are generally 
provided on either a time-and-material 
basis or on a fixed-price contract 
basis. revenue from time-and-material 
contracts is recognised as hours are 
delivered and direct expenses are 
incurred. revenue from fixed-price 
contracts is recognised under the per-
centage-of- completion method, 
whereby revenue is recognised based 
on hours incurred to date as a percent-
age of the total estimated costs of 
hours to fulfil the contract.
revenue from operations solutions is 
recognised in the period the solutions 
are provided, which will either be 
based on output measures or using 
the straight-line method over the term 
of the contracts.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement shows cash 
flows from operating, investing and 
53
annual report 2020
consolidated financial statements  basis of preparation
financing activities as well as cash and 
cash equivalents at the beginning and 
the end of the financial year.
cash flows from operating activities are 
presented using the indirect method 
and calculated as the operating profit 
adjusted for non-cash operating items, 
working capital changes as well as 
financial income received and financial 
expenses and income taxes paid.
cash flows from investing activities 
comprise payments in connection with 
acquisition of subsidiaries and joint 
ventures, activities and fixed asset 
investments and proceeds from the 
sale of property, plant and equipment. 
in the parent financial statements, 
investing activities also include receipt 
of dividends from subsidiaries.
cash flows from financing activities 
comprise cash from changes in the 
size or composition of the group’s 
share capital and related costs as well 
as the raising of loans, instalments on 
interest bearing debt, payments relat-
ing to leasing obligations and dividend 
payments to shareholders.
cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash. 
for a detailed specification of the 
group’s accounting policies, please 
see relevant notes in the consolidated
financial statements.
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
when applying the accounting poli-
cies, management has to make judge-
ments, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities that cannot be directly 
derived from other sources. such esti-
mates and assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other rele-
vant factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. 
the actual results may deviate from 
these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions.
estimates and the underlying assump-
tions are reassessed on a regular basis. 
any changes in the accounting esti-
mates are recognised in the account-
ing period in which the change was 
made as well as in future accounting 
periods if the change affects the 
period in which it was made as well as 
subsequent accounting periods.
accounting policies (continued)
note 1

is particularly important to note the 
following judgements, estimates and 
assumptions. these are described in 
further detail adjacent to the relevant 
disclosed notes: 
judgements

  accounting principles
special items are non-recurring costs 
or income recorded in the income 
statement which cannot directly be 
attributed to the group´s ordinary 
activities.
such costs and income comprise 
expenses for restructuring, fundamen-
tal structural changes in the business 
and m&a. they are therefore pre-
sented separately to provide a more 
comparable basis for assessing the 
underlying performance.
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
key assumptions involve judgement 
from management in identifying and 
separating special income or expense 
items from other items in the income 
statement. these items are carefully 
considered in order to ensure correct 
presentation.

  accounting principles
tax for the year, which consists of cur-
rent tax for the year and changes in 
deferred tax, is recognised in profit for 
the year by the portion attributable to 
the profit for the year and recognised 
directly in other comprehensive 
income and equity by the portion 
attributable to entries recognised 
directly in other comprehensive 
income and equity.
current tax payable and current tax 
receivable are recognised in the state-
ment of financial position, calculated 
as tax on taxable income for the year, 
adjusted for prepaid tax.
on calculation of current tax, the tax 
rates and rules applicable at the bal-
ance sheet date are used. 
deferred tax is recognised on all tem-
porary differences between the carry-
ing amounts and tax-based values of 
assets and liabilities using the balance 
sheet liability method. deferred tax is 
calculated on the basis of the planned 
use of each asset and the settlement of 
each liability, respectively. deferred tax 
is measured using the tax rates and tax 
rules which – based on acts in force or 
acts actually in force at the balance 
tax (continued)
note 11
sheet date – are expected to apply 
when the deferred tax is expected to 
crystallise as current tax. changes in 
deferred tax resulting from changed 
tax rates or tax rules are recognised in 
profit/loss unless the deferred tax is 
attributable to transactions previously 
recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income. in the latter 
case, such changes are also recognised 
directly in equity or other comprehen-
sive income.
deferred tax assets, including the tax 
base of tax loss carry-forwards, are 
recognised in the statement of the 
financial position at their estimated 
realisable value, either as a set-off 
against deferred tax liabilities or as 
net tax assets to be set off against 
future positive taxable income. at 
each balance sheet date, it is consid-
ered whether sufficient taxable 
income is likely to arise in the future 
for the deferred tax asset to be used.

  accounting principles
goodwill
on initial recognition, goodwill is rec-
ognised and measured as the 
difference between, on one hand, 
the cost of the acquired subsidiary 
and, on the other hand, the fair value 
of the acquired identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities. 
the recognised goodwill amount is 
allocated to the activities of the group 
generating separate payments, which 
represents the lowest level of cash
generating units (cgus). determina-
tion of cgus complies with the man-
agement structure and management 
accounting and reporting of the 
group. 
goodwill is not amortised but tested 
at least once a year for impairment. 
goodwill derives from business acqui-
sitions.

intangible assets 
note 13
other intangible assets
other intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination consists of tech-
nology, order back-log, customer rela-
tionships and trademark. intangible 
assets acquired in a business combi-
nation are recognised separately from 
goodwill and are initially recognised at 
their fair value at the acquisition date 
(which is regarded as their cost). sub-
sequent to initial recognition, intangi-
ble assets acquired in a business com-
bination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accu-
mulated impairment losses.
amortisation is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives:
• technology: 5 years
• order back-log: 3 years
• customer relationships: 5 - 7 years
• trademark: 20 years 
software
the cost of developed software com-
prises costs such as salaries, deprecia-
tion and amortisation that are directly 
attributable to the development proj-
ects and are needed to complete the 
project, recognised from the time at 
which the development project first 
qualifies for recognition as an asset. 
amortisation is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives:
• software: 3-5 years
the estimated useful life and amortisa-
tion method are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period, with the effect 
of any changes in estimate being 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
impairment
goodwill and other intangible assets 
which are acquired through business 
combinations are impairment tested at 
least annually or when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may 
be impaired. the tests are performed 
at the lowest level of the cgus repre-
senting different business acquisitions.
the carrying amount of intangible 
assets with definite useful life is exam-
ined at the balance sheet date in order 
to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. if this is the 
case, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is determined in order to deter-
mine the need for any write-down and 
the extent thereof. 
if the asset does not generate cash 
flow independently of other assets, 
the recoverable amount is determined 
for the smallest cgus of which the 
asset forms part. 
the recoverable amount is determined 
as the higher of the asset’s or the 
cgus fair value, net of selling costs, 
and the value in use. 
to determine the value in use, esti-
mated future cash flows are discounted 
to net present value by applying a dis-
count rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of 
money and the particular risks related 
to the asset or the cgu, and for which 
no adjustments have been made in 
such estimated future cash flows. 
if the recoverable amount of the asset 
is lower than the carrying amount, 
the carrying amount is written down 
to the recoverable amount. for cgus, 
the write-down for impairment is allo-
cated so that goodwill is written down 
first, and then any remaining impair-
ment loss is allocated on the other 
assets of the unit, however, the indi-
vidual asset may not be written down 
to an amount below its fair value net 
of any expected selling costs.
impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. on any subsequent 
reversal of impairment losses for 
intangible assets arising from changes 
in the assumptions used to determine 
the recoverable amount, the asset’s 
carrying amount is adjusted to the 
recoverable amount, however, not 
exceeding the carrying amount that the 
asset would have had if the impairment 
had not been made. impairment losses 
of goodwill may not be reversed.
impairment tests
the tests performed at the end of 
2020 showed the recoverable 
amounts were estimated to be higher 
than the carrying amounts of all cgus 
and therefore no impairment loss has 
been recognised in 2020. the most 
significant assumptions are related to 
revenue and ebitda-margins which 
are based on a combination of histori-
cal experience and external sources of 
information. 
the value in use amounts were calcu-
lated as future free cash flows based 
on budgets for 2021 and forecasts for 
the following years incorporating the 
assumptions used in financial budgets, 
including the expected impact from 
business synergies. 
for all cgus, the forecast period com-
prise five years.

   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
goodwill is not amortised but tested
at least once a year for impairment.
the determination of the recoverable
amount of a cgu to which goodwill is
allocated requires significant manage-
ment judgement in determining the
various assumptions, such as cash 
flow projections, discount rate and 
terminal growth rates. the sensitivity 
of the estimated measurement of 
these assumptions, combined or indi-
vidually, can be significant.
furthermore, the use of different esti-
mates or assumptions when determin-
ing the fair value of such assets may
result in different values and could 
result in impairment in future periods.
cash flow projections beyond the five 
year forecast have been extrapolated 
using a steady 1.0% per annum growth 
rate. management believes that the 
growth rate is reasonable based on it 
services demand, and the continued 
digital conversion in the markets, and 
any reasonably possible change in the 
key assumptions on which the recov-
erable amount is based would not 
cause the carrying amount to exceed 
its recoverable amount.
netcompany shares were priced at 
dkk 622.5 per share at 31 december 
2020, equal to a market capitalisation 
of dkk 31,125 million, which is signifi-
cantly higher than equity value at 31

the group made no acquisitions 
during 2020.
in may 2019, the group acquired the 
entire share capital of netcompany 
netherlands b.v. (qdelft b.v.) at a 
price estimated at dkk 157.8 million of 
which dkk 37.3 million was paid in 
cash and dkk 120.4 million was part 
of a contingent consideration. 
the determination of the purchase 
price and the purchase price alloca-
tion is considered final. any adjust-
ments after 12 months has been and 
will be recognised in comprehensive 
income as a fair value adjustment of 
the consideration payable. 
an adjustment to the purchase price is 
warranted given the mechanisms set 
forth in the share purchase agreement 
because the dutch operation has signifi-
cantly overperformed in 2020 com-
pared to the expectations at the aquisi-
tion date. this adjustment will be added 
to the payable purchase price and 
expensed in 2020 as a fair value adjust-
ment following ifrs 3.
the total consideration consists of 
two elements – a contingent element 
and an earn out element. the basis for 
the valuation of both elements is 
normalised adjusted ebita before hq 
cost for the dutch operation for 2020. 
the contingent purchase price is 11 
times the 2020 normalised adjusted 
ebita before hq cost less net debt 
adjustments at the transaction time 
equal to dkk 178.6 million. the contin-
gent purchase price is paid half in 
cash and half in netcompany shares. 
the cash part of the purchase price 
was paid partly in may 2019 by an 
upfront payment of dkk 37.3m and 
the cash part of the contingent con-
sideration of dkk 89.3 million will be 
paid in february 2021. the part of the 
contingent purchase price which is 
payable in shares, will be due after the 
approval of the annual report 2022 at 
the annual general meeting in march 
2023. the share based part of the 
contingent purchase price is dkk 89.3 
million which will be translated into 
rsus based on the share price of net-
company at the time of the transac-
tion. this corresponds to 378,153 
shares, which will be granted to the 
sellers in february 2021 and vest in 
march 2023. 
the earn-out related purchase price is 
maximum 5 times the 2020 nor-
malised adjusted ebita before hq 
costs depending on performance 
criteria for the period 2020 to 2022. if 
cagr and adjusted ebita before allo-
cated hq costs are above 25% on 
both metrics the maximum earn out 
will be paid equal to a value of dkk 
107.5 million. the earn-out purchase 
price is fully payable in shares based 
on the share price netcompany at the 
time of the transaction. 
based on the measurement of identifi-
able assets and liabilities at their fair 
values, the difference between the 
total consideration and the fair value 
of the identified net assets was origi-
nally estimated at dkk 155.4 million, 
which represents the goodwill from 
the acquisition of netcompany neth-
erlands b.v. (qdelft b.v.). taking the 
actual performance for 2020 and 
adjustments to the expected earn-out 
into account, an adjustment to the 
purchase price recognised in 2020 
equals dkk 141.3 million, which has 
been recognised as a fair value adjust-
ment in the income statement.
in addition, the consideration paid for 
the business combination effectively 
included amounts in relation to the 
benefit of expected synergies, reve-
nue growth, future market develop-
ment and the assembled workforce of 
netcompany netherlands b.v. these 
benefits are not recognised separately 
from goodwill because they do not 
meet the recognition criteria for iden-
tifiable intangible assets. 
goodwill is also not deductible for tax 
purposes.
assets and liabilities recognition
these amounts have been calculated 
using the subsidiary’s results and 
adjusting them for differences in the 
accounting policies between the 
group and the subsidiary.
the group has incurred acquisition 
costs totalling dkk 4.4 million in 2019, 
which are included in special items.

fair value of order back-log has been determined on the basis of 
net operating profit less adjusted taxes (noplat) from the order 
back-log at the acquisition date, adjusted for amounts already 
included in the recognition of fair value of other identified intangible

  accounting principles
acquisitions of businesses are 
accounted for using the acquisition 
method. the cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the consideration trans-
ferred for assets acquired and liabili-
ties assumed in the business combina-
tion measured at fair value on 
acquisition date. deferred tax related 
to the revaluations is recognised.
the most significant assets acquired 
generally comprise goodwill, order 
back-log and customer relationships. 
as no active market exists for the 
majority of acquired assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities, in particular 
in respect of intangible assets, man-
agement estimates the fair value.
the consideration paid for a business 
consists of the fair value of the agreed-
consideration in the form of the assets 
transferred, equity instruments issued, 
and liabilities assumed at the date of 
acquisition. if part of the consideration 
is contingent on future events, such 
consideration is recognised at fair 
value. subsequent changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration are 
recognised in the income statement.  
a positive excess (goodwill) of the con-
sideration transferred over the fair 
value of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
if uncertainties regarding identifica-
tion or measurement of acquired 
assets, liabilities or contingent liabili-
ties or determination of the consider-
ation transferred exist at the acquisi-
tion date, initial recognition will be 
based on provisional values. any 
adjustments in the provisional values, 
including goodwill, are adjusted retro-
spectively, until 12 months after the 
acquisition date, and comparative fig-
ures are restated.
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
  
key assumptions for the methods 
applied in determining the fair value is 
based on the present value of future 
cash flows, churn rates or the 
expected cash flows related to the 
specific asset. estimates and method-
ologies used, can have a material 
impact on the respective values and 
ultimately the amount of the fair val-
ues recognised for identifiable assets 
and liabilities of the acquired business.

  accounting principles
equipment and leasehold improvements
equipment and leasehold improve-
ments are measured at cost less accu-
mulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
cost comprises the acquisition price, 
costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, and preparation costs of 
the asset until the time when it is 
ready to be put into operation.
the basis of depreciation is cost less 
estimated residual value after the end 
of useful life. straight-line depreciation 
is made on the basis of the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, which are 
3-5 years.
depreciation methods, useful lives and 
residual values are reviewed annually.
gains and losses from the sale of 
equipment are calculated as the dif-
ference between selling price less sell-
ing costs and carrying amount at the 
time of sale. gains or losses are rec-
ognised in the income statement in 
the functions to which the assets 
relate.
right of use assets
right of use assets are measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses adjusted for 
any re-measurements of the lease lia-
bility where initial cost is equal to the 
initial amount of the related lease lia-
bility.
depreciation is straight-line on the 
basis of the underlying contracts 
which are 1-10 years.
short term and low-value assets
the group has entered into leasing 
contracts regarded as low-value and 
short term, all expiring within 6 
months. total commitments relating to 
the non-cancelling period is dkk 0.2 
million (dkk 0.1 million). all other 
lease contracts are recognised on the 
statement of financial position accord-
ing to ifrs 16.

investment in joint venture
note 16
  accounting principles
the joint venture is recognised using 
the equity method so that the carry-
ing amount of the joint venture consti-
tutes the group’s proportional share 
of the net assets of the enterprise less 
unrealised internal profit. profit after 
tax of the joint venture has been rec-
ognised as a separate line in the state-
ment of comprehensive income. joint 
venture with negative net asset value 
are included without any value.
the carrying amount of investment in 
joint venture is examined at the bal-
ance sheet date in order to determine 
if there is any indication of impairment.
impairment test for investments
impairment tests are performed if 
indications of impairment are present. 
if the carrying amount is found to be 
greater than the implied fair value, 
then impairment has occurred and the 
book value of the joint venture is writ-
ten down to its recoverable  amount. 
the recoverable amount is the higher 
of the net selling price and value in 
use.  
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
the classification of the joint venture 
where netcompany group controls 
less than 100% of the voting rights is 
based on an assessment of the con-
tractual and operational relationship 
between the parties. this includes 
assessing the conditions in share-
holder agreements, contracts etc. 
consideration is also given to the 
extent to which each party can govern 
the financial and operating policies of 
the entity, how the operation of the 
entity is designed, and which party 
possesses the relevant knowledge and 
competences to operate the entity. 
another factor relevant to this assess-
ment is the extent to which each of 
the parties can direct the activities 
and affect the returns, for example by 
means of rights, reserved matters, or 
casting votes.

development in aging of trade receivables from 2019 to 2020
  accounting principles
trade receivables include receivables 
from sales. trade receivables are mea-
sured at fair value on initial recogni-
tion and subsequently at amortised 
cost, usually equalling nominal value 
less any expected credit losses.

  accounting principles
contract work in progress consists of 
client related assets and liabilities
contract work in progress is measured 
at the selling price of the work carried 
out less prepayments received at the 
balance sheet date. the selling price is 
measured based on the stage of com-
pletion and the total estimated income 
from the individual contracts in prog-
ress. usually, the stage of completion 
is determined as the ratio of actual to 
total budgeted consumption of 
resources. for some projects where 
the consumption of resources cannot 
be applied as a basis, the ratio 
between completed and total sub-ac-
tivities of the individual projects has 
been applied. if the selling price of a 
project cannot be made up reliably, it 
is measured at the lower of the costs 
incurred and net realisable value. if 
prepayments received exceed the sell-
ing price on a contract by contract 
basis, the excess amount is recognized 
as a liability in “prebilled invoices”.
revenue recognised 
revenue recognised in the financial 
year that was included in the contract 
portfolio at the beginning of the year 
amounts to dkk 417.3 million (dkk 
256.2 million). 
the recognition of revenue is to some 
extent impacted by management esti-
mates and judgement for contract 
work in progress in relation to deter-
mining stage of completion and 
expected profitability of the individual 
projects, and hence, revenue rec-
ognised in subsequent years may be 
impacted by changes in estimates to 
the revenue recognised in previous 
years. revenue recognised from con-
tract work in progress in 2020 and 
2019 has not been impacted by any 
significant changes to the revenue 
recognised in previous years.
at 31 december 2020, the group has 
recognised a provision for project 
risks of dkk 0.0 million (dkk 3.5 mil-
lion). please refer to note 24.

future performance obligations 
derives solely from fixed price con-

represent contractual values less reve-
nue recognised at 31 december 2020 
for the group’s fixed price projects at 
year end. as of 31 december 2020, the 
group has future performance obliga-
tions of dkk 382.2 million on open 
fixed price projects out of a total of 
dkk 1,465.7 million (dkk 315.3 million 
out of a total of dkk 1,165.8 million). 
the assessment of the timing of 
expected revenue recognised from the 
future performance obligations is sub-
ject to some uncertainty.
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
contract work in progress for fixed 
priced contracts is measured at the 
selling price of work completed at the 
balance sheet date, and the selling 
price is calculated on the basis of con-
tracted income and the determined 
stage of completion. stage of comple-
tion is determined making estimates 
of future hours and other project 
costs. 
the group reviews its contract portfo-
lio on a regular basis. if circumstances 
arise that change the original esti-
mates of the selling price of the 
contracts or costs, revisions to esti-
mates are made. these revisions may 
result in increases or decreases in esti-
mated revenues or costs, and such 
revisions are reflected in the income 
statement in the period in which the 
circumstances giving rise to the revi-
sions become known by the group.

loans. 
according to the loan agreement all 
distribution of dividend has to be 
approved by the lender.
  accounting principles
on initial recognition, borrowings are 
measured at fair value less related 
transactions costs paid. subsequent 
to initial recognition, borrowings are 
measured at amortised costs using 
the effect interest method. any differ-
ence between the proceeds initially 
received and the nominal value is rec-
ognised in financial expenses over the 
term of the loan.

   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
contingent consideration resulting 
from business combinations is valued 
at fair value at the acquisition date as 
part of the business combination.  
when the contingent consideration 
meets the definition of a financial lia-
bility, it is subsequently remeasured to 
fair value at each reporting date. the 
key assumptions take into consider-
ation the probability of meeting the 
performance target.

based on the current project portfolio 
including monitoring of deliveries on 
projects, no particular provisions for 
specific customer cases have been 
considered applicable at 31 december 
2020 (2019: dkk 3.5 million)
  accounting principles
provisions represent commitments for 
onerous contracts. an onerous con-
tract is considered to exist when the 
group has a contract under which the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obli-
gation under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits to be received from 
the contract, hence the recognised 
provision represents the group’s best 
estimate of the unavoidable loss to 
complete its contract obligations for 
the related contracts. 
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
as part of its regular review of the 
contract portfolio, the group may 
identify contracts where the comple-
tion of a contract most likely will result 
in a negative contribution. in these cir-
cumstances, the group will record a 
provision to cover the unavoidable 
loss. the estimates of the provision 
may be subject to significant manage-
ment judgement and uncertainty 
depending on project complexity and 
on whether there are any disputes 
with customers in relation to project 
performance, claims and counter 
claims, contract interpretation and 
alike.

policy for management  
of financial risks
there is no change in netcompany’s 
financial risk assessment compared to 
last year. the group’s objective at all 
times is to limit the group’s financial 
risks. 
the group manages the financial risks 
and coordinates cash management 
and management of interest rate and 
currency risks based on financial risk 
policies agreed with the board of 
directors.
liquidity risks
the group attempts to maximise flexi-
bility and minimise risks. at 31 decem-
ber 2020, the group has unutilised 
credit facilities of a total of dkk 699.9 
million (dkk 534.8 million) excluding 
an acquisition facility of dkk 400.0 
million (dkk 400.0 million).
credit risks
in 2020 and 2019, the group has not 
realised any credit losses. based on 
the customer composition and past 
history with no credit losses, the credit 
risk is assessed to be limited and at 31 
december 2020, the group made a 
provision of dkk 5.8 million (dkk 0.8) 
for expected credit losses. 
currency risks
the group is to a limited extent 
exposed to foreign currency risks. the 
main part of the group’s transactions 
is in danish kroner, which implies lim-
ited foreign exchange risk due to the 
ultimate parent company’s functional 
and reporting currency being in dkk.
the group is exposed to exchange 
rate risk in the countries where the 
group has it sales activities outside 
denmark, which means norway, uk, 
netherlands and to a lesser extent, 
exchange rate risk in poland and viet-
nam, which is used as sourcing centres 
and therefore do not have an 
exchange rate risk related to sales 
activities. with respect to subsidiaries 
situated in norway, uk, netherlands, 
poland and vietnam there are transac-
tions with the subsidiaries, however, 
their extent and risk are not signifi-
cant. 
the bank loan is in dkk. the group 
has not entered into any hedging con-
tracts regarding exchange rate risks 
during 2020 or 2019.
the group’s policy is to hedge any 
exchange risk net exposure, that 
would yield a +2/-2 percentage points 
ebit margin impact from a +10%/-10% 
change in the given currency. if all 
currencies that the group is exposed 
to, change by +/- 10%, this will affect 
the ebit by +/- dkk 3.2 million. 
interest rate risks
the interest-bearing liabilities in the 
group relates to the loans obtained to 
finance acquisitions in previous years. 
following the ipo in 2018, the group 
entered into one overall bank agree-
ment. the bank agreement consists of 
committed facilities constituting a pri-
mary facility agreement of dkk 750.0 
million, an ancillary facility of dkk 750.0 
million and an optional facility of dkk 
400.0 million limited to acquisitions, 
whereof dkk 765.2 million has been uti-
lised on borrowings and dkk 34.9 mil-
lion on guarantees. 
the group’s bank loan carried floating 
interest rates at 31 december 2020, 
which is depending on the financial 
leverage. current interest rate at 1.1% 
is equal to a yearly bank loan interest 
expense of dkk 8.4 million. 
if the interest rate changes ‘one step 
up’, due to changes in leverage, a new 
interest rate of 1.35% will be applicable 
equal to interest expenses of dkk 10.3 
million, which leads to an increase in 
financial expenses of dkk 1.9 million. 
according to the loan agreement, it is 
not possible to get a lower interest rate 
than the current rate achieved. 
the group is to a limited extent 
exposed to interest rate risks relating 
to the cash balances, which bear neg-
ative interest due to the current low 
interest environment.
optimisation of the capital structure
the group regularly assesses whether 
its capital structure is in accordance 
with the group’s and the shareholders’ 
interests. the overall objective is to 
ensure a capital structure that sup-
ports long term growth whilst maxi-
mising returns for the group’s share-
holders’ by optimising the 
equity-to-debt ratio.
   significant judgements,  
estimates and assumptions
the fair value at 31 december 2020 
and 2019 of netcompany’s financial 
instruments was measured in accor-
dance with level 2 and level 3 in the 
fair value hierarchy (ifrs 13).

  accounting principles
investments in subsidiaries are re- 
cognised and measured at cost. divi-
dend is recognised as income when 
the right is finally obtained.
the carrying amount of investments in 
subsidiaries is examined at the bal-
ance sheet date in order to determine 
if there is any indication of impair-
ment.
impairment test for investments
the subsidiaries of the parent are con-
sidered independent cash-generating 
entities. in the event of any indication 
of impairment of the carrying amount 
(cost) of investments in subsidiaries, 
any impairment loss is determined 
based on a calculation of the value in 
use of the relevant subsidiary.
if dividends distributed exceed the 
subsidiary’s comprehensive income in 
the period for which dividend is dis-
tributed, this is considered an indica-
tion of impairment.
for the years ended 31 december 2020 
and 2019, all subsidiaries are perform-
ing according to the plan with satisfac-
tory earnings, and hence management 
has concluded that there are no impair-
ment indicators that require a detailed 
impairment test to be performed.

financial risks and financial instruments (continued)
note 14
policy for management of  
financial risks
the parent’s objective at all times is to 
limit the parent’s financial risks.
the parent manages the financial risks 
and coordinates cash management 
and management of interest rate and 
currency risks based on financial risk 
policies agreed with the board of 
directors.
liquidity risks
the parent attempts to maximise flexi-
bility and minimise risks. at 31 decem-
ber 2020, the parent has unutilised 
credit facilities of a total of dkk 699.9 
million (dkk 534.8 million) excluding 
an acquisition facility of dkk 400.0 
million (dkk 400.0 million).
credit risks
in 2020 and 2019, the parent has not 
realised any credit losses. at 31 
december 2020 and 2019, the credit 
risk is primarily relating to intercom-
pany receivables where the credit risk 
is considered remote and the parent 
has made a provision of dkk 0 for 
expected credit losses.
currency risks
the parent is only to a limited extent 
exposed to foreign currency risks. the 
main part of the parent’s transactions 
is in dkk. 
interest rate risks
the interest-bearing liabilities relates 
to the loans obtained to finance acqui-
sitions in previous years. following the 
ipo in 2018, netcompany group 
entered into one overall bank agree-
ment. the bank agreement consists of 
committed facilities constituting a pri-
mary facility agreement of dkk 750.0 
million, an ancillary facility of dkk 
750.0 million and an optional facility 
of dkk 400.0 million limited to acqui-
sitions, whereof dkk 765.2 million has 
been utilised on borrowings and dkk 
34.9 million on guarantees through 
subsidiaries. 
the bank loan carried floating interest 
rates at 31 december 2020, 
which is depending on the financial 
leverage. current interest rate at 1.1% 
is equal to a yearly bank loan interest 
expense of dkk 8.4 million. 
if the interest rate changes ‘one step 
up’, due to changes in leverage, a new 
interest rate of 1.35% will be applicable 
equal to interest expenses of dkk 10.3 
million, which leads to an increase in 
financial expenses of dkk 1.9 million. 
according to the loan agreement, it is 
not possible to get a lower interest 
rate than the current rate achieved. 
optimisation of the capital structure
the parent regularly assesses whether 
its capital structure is in accordance 
with the parent’s and the sharehold-
ers´ interest. the overall objective is to 
ensure a capital structure that sup-
ports long term growth whilst maxi-
mising returns for the parent’s owners 
by optimising the equity-to-debt ratio.

comprise the statement of compre-

mary of significant accounting poli-
cies, for the group as well as for the 
parent. the consolidated financial

in our opinion, the consolidated finan-

2020 in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and additional 
independent auditor’s report
requirements of the danish financial 
statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our 
audit book comments issued to the 
audit committee and the board of 
directors.
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accor-
dance with international standards 
on auditing (isas) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. 
our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are 
 further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the

are independent of the group in

tants’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and the 
additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. 
we believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and 
belief, we have not provided any pro-
hibited non-audit services as referred 
to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 
537/2014.
we were appointed auditors of net-
company group a/s for the first time 
on 16 april 2018 for the financial year 
2018. we have been reappointed 
annually by decision of the general 
meeting for a total contiguous 
engagement period of two years up to 
and including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters 
that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial state-
ments for the financial year 1 january 
2020 – 31 december 2020. these mat-
ters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these 
matters.
revenue recognition, including the 
measurement and recognition of work 
in progress and provisions
refer to notes 18 and 24 in the consol-
idated financial statements. 
at 31 december 2020, the carrying 
value of the group’s work in progress 
amounted to a net asset of dkk 434.9 
million represented by sales value of 
work performed of dkk 1,083.5 mil-
lion less prebilled invoices of dkk 
648.6 million. furthermore, the group 
has recognised a provision of dkk 0 
million covering onerous contracts 
and project risks. 
significant judgements are required 
by management in determining the 
stage of completion and estimating 
profit on fixed price projects, including 
assessment of specific project risks 
and assessment of potential onerous 
contracts. in addition, the group’s 
accounting for arrangements with 
multiple elements is subject to com-
plexity, as the total contract value is 
allocated to each identified element 
and recognised as revenue as the ser-
vices are delivered.

independent auditor’s report
due to the complexity in the judge-
ments combined with the significance 
of revenue and work in progress, reve-
nue recognition based on the stage of 
completion method and measurement 
and recognition of work in progress are 
considered to be a key audit matter. 
how the matter was addressed 
in our audit
as part of our audit procedures, we 
obtained an understanding of the pro-
cess for determining time and cost-to-
complete estimates and the process 
for identifying potential onerous con-
tracts and projects with significant 
project risks and how provisions are 
determined for such onerous con-
tracts and for identified projects with 
significant project risks. 
we tested the internal controls relat-
ing to monitoring of project develop-
ment, time registration, estimation of 
time and cost-to-complete and identi-
fication and assessment of project 
risks and potential onerous contracts. 
we obtained an overview of the 
group’s contracts in progress during 
the year and at 31 december 2020. 
we selected a sample of contracts to 
be tested in detail from a statistical 
approach and based on an 
assessment of project risk and materi-
ality. for the selected contracts, we 
tested and challenged the group’s 
assumptions for determining stage of 
completion, estimation of expected 
time and cost-to-complete and esti-
mated profits and we tested the appli-
cation of the group’s accounting for 
multiple element arrangements. fur-
thermore, we tested and challenged 
the group’s accounting, identification 
and assessments in relation to change 
orders, warranty issues, onerous con-
tracts and other identified project 
risks. 
for contracts completed during the 
year, we have – among other audit 
procedures - applied audit proce-
dures to match revenue transactions 
with external payment data and com-
pared actual profitability with original 
expected profitability to assess the 
completeness and accuracy of man-
agement’s assumptions applied 
throughout the contract periods.
statement on the management 
commentary
management is responsible for the 
management commentary.
our opinion on the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent 
financial statements does not cover 
the management commentary, and we 
do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the manage-
ment commentary and, in doing so, 
consider whether the management 
commentary is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial state-
ments or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to 
consider whether the management 
commentary provides the information 
required under the danish financial 
statements act.
based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that the management 
commentary is in accordance with the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements and has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify 
any material misstatement of the man-
agement commentary.
management’s responsibilities for the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements
management is responsible for the 
preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and parent financial state-
ments that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with international finan-
cial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements 
of the danish financial statements 
act, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of consoli-
dated financial statements and parent 
financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements, management is responsi-
ble for assessing the group’s and the 
parent’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, for disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern, and 
for using the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the consoli-
dated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements unless 
management either intends to liqui-
date the group or the entity or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

auditor´s responsibilities for the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consoli-
dated financial statements and the par-
ent financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with isas and the addi-
tional requirements applicable in den-
mark will always detect a material mis-
statement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements 
and these parent financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accor-
dance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, 
we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also: 
•  identify and assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, 
design and per-form audit proce-
dures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, inten-
tional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal 
control relevant to the audit in 
order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effec-
tiveness of the group’s and the par-
ent’s internal control. 
•  evaluate the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting esti-
mates and related disclosures made 
by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in pre-
paring the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements, and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a mate-
rial uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s 
and the parent’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent 
financial statements or, if such dis-
closures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our audi-
tor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group 
and the entity to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, 
structure and content of the consol-
idated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, includ-
ing the disclosures in the notes, and 
whether the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner 
that gives a true and fair view.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or busi-
ness activities within the group to 
express an opinion on the consoli-
dated financial statements. we are 
responsible for the direction, super-
vision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged 
with governance regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any signifi-
cant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we 
have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding indepen-
dence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applica-
ble, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with 
those charged with governance, we 
determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and 
independent auditor’s report (continued)

the parent financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public dis-
closure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to out-
weigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
