annual report 2020
this annual report contains forward-looking state-
ments that reflect management’s current views 
with respect to  certain future events and potential 
financial performance. although nordea believes 
that the expectations reflected in such for-
ward-looking statements are reasonable, no assur-
ance can be given that such expectations will prove 
to have been correct. accordingly, results could dif-
fer materially from those set out in the for-
ward-looking statements as a result of various fac-
tors. important factors that may cause such a 
 difference for nordea include, but are not limited to: 
(i) the macro economic development, (ii) change in 
the competitive climate, (iii) change in the regulato-
ry environment and other government actions and 
(iv) change in interest rate levels and foreign 
exchange rate levels. this report does not imply 
that nordea has undertaken to revise these for-
ward-looking statements, beyond what is required 
by applicable law or appli cable stock exchange 
regulations  if and when  circumstances arise that 
will lead to changes compared with the date when 
these statements were provided.

our purpose 
our vision
nordea is a nordic universal bank with a clear purpose. we help our 
customers realise their dreams and aspirations – and have done so for 200 
years. 
we want to make a real difference for our customers and the communities in 
which we operate. when our customers succeed, we feel proud, because we 
have succeeded too. 
we are the largest bank in the nordics and have a strong market position 
within our four business areas: personal banking, business banking, large 
corporates & institutions and asset & wealth management.
we recognise that we have a responsibility to help our customers and  
society shift to a sustainable future. we will support our customers in their 
transition, enabling them to make sustainable choices. we will also be an 
active owner and drive change through our lending and investment 
decisions.   
together, we lead the way, enabling dreams and everyday aspirations  
for a greater good.
our vision is to be a strong and personal financial partner.

the year 2020 was extraordinary for 
individuals, businesses and societies. 
the covid-19 pandemic has chal-
lenged us to adapt to new and different 
ways of living, working and consuming. 
covid-19 has not only been a health 
crisis. it has also had serious societal 
and economic consequences, which the 
world will need time to fully recover 
from.
this exceptional situation has truly 
shown our purpose as a bank. over the 
past year, we have done our utmost to 
support our customers, keep our 
employees safe and maintain business 
continuity. 
at the beginning of the pandemic we 
reacted quickly and offered instal-
ment-free periods on loans. even 
though we had to temporarily close the 
branch offices in some of our home 
markets, our advanced digital capabili-
ties have enabled us to continuously 
support and connect with our custom-
ers. the majority of our customer meet-
ings in 2020 were held online. 
i am very happy to see that we made 
good progress in 2020. we improved 
our performance, delivered on our busi-
ness plan and key priorities, and contin-
ued to progress towards our 2022 tar-
gets. our business volumes grew and 
we gained market shares across the 
nordics. 
we improved customer satisfaction 
scores and reduced customer com-
plaints by more than 20%. at the same 
time, we reduced our costs and 
increased operational efficiency. our 
work to build a strong cost culture has 
started well and we are determined to 
continue on the same track. 
our full-year 2020 operating profit 
was eur 2.96bn and our cost-to-income 
ratio improved to 54.8% – our target is 
50% in 2022. 
our credit quality has remained 
strong throughout the pandemic. our 
realised loan losses have been at low 
levels, but we have chosen to have a 
prudent approach to loan loss provi-
sions, as the full economic impact of the 
pandemic remains uncertain. we have 
therefore retained our eur 650m man-
agement buffer for 2021.
we entered the covid-19 crisis with 
a robust capital position, which we have 
strengthened even further. our capital 
position is among the best in europe, 
with a cet1 ratio of 17.1%. our financial 
strength means that we are well posi-
tioned to support our customers and 
the societies around us – and pay out 
dividends.
dividends are important to our share-
holders and benefit both them and soci-
ety at large. however, we understand 
the reasoning behind the exceptional 
measures promoted by the european 
central bank (ecb) for the banking 
industry. we have followed the ecb’s 
recommendations, even though they 
might be less relevant for us as a 
strongly capitalised bank.
our capital and dividend policy is 
unchanged. we consider dividend pay-
ment to be a matter of timing only. our 
board has proposed a dividend of eur 
0.39 per share for 2020, in line with our 
dividend policy. including the delayed 
2019 dividend of eur 0.40 per share, 
this would mean a total payout of eur 
0.79 per share in 2021.
one of the highlights of 2020 was our 
updated plan to fully integrate sustain-
ability into our business strategy. the 
plan includes updated targets and a 
long-term objective to become a net 
zero emissions bank by 2050 at the 
latest. 
we firmly believe that the increasing 
demand for sustainability-linked prod-
ucts and services is good for our busi-
ness and for society. we want to make a 
difference for a greater good – and for 
generations to come.
we will deliver on our targets by 
working together with our customers 
towards a sustainable future. successful 
implementation of our sustainability 
plan requires the entire bank to take an 
active role. 
we believe that both our employees 
and culture are key to our sustainable 
value creation. we trust that diversity 
and inclusivity contribute to better col-
laboration and engagement, leading to 
better decisions and results. 
i couldn’t be any prouder of the 
efforts of our employees. first of all, 
they have done their utmost to support 
our customers. they have also imple-
mented new ways of working – and 
they have engaged with local communi-
ties, assisting senior citizens in using 
digital banking services, guiding young 
people in developing financial skills and 
supporting start-ups. 
i would like to take the opportunity 
to thank our dedicated and highly com-
petent employees, who will also ensure 
our future success.
it is times like these that require us to 
be an even safer and more trusted part-
ner to our customers. we are a strong, 
customer-centric and well-capitalised 
bank, even in the most turbulent times.
i believe that 2020 proved that noth-
ing is certain but the unforeseen. in the 
months to come we will most likely be 
balancing recovery with some setbacks. 
the good news is that there are signs 
we are heading towards brighter times. 
we are well on track and committed 
to delivering on our plan and financial 
targets. we will continue to focus on our 
three key priorities: to create great cus-
tomer experiences, drive income growth 
initiatives and optimise operational effi-
ciency. in doing so, we will create sus-
tainable value for our customers, share-
holders and societies as we move 
towards 2022 – and beyond.
dear shareholder,
“we are a strong, customer-centric 
and well-capitalised bank, even  
in the most turbulent times.“

customers, investors, regulators and policymakers increasingly  
expect banks to take responsibility and play their part in addressing  
the world’s growing social and environmental challenges.
with a view to fulfilling our responsibili-
ty and becoming an even more sustain-
able bank than we are today, we have 
developed a long-term plan to fully 
integrate sustainability into our busi-
ness strategy. our focus is on reducing 
the negative impact and increasing the 
positive impact of our business activi-
ties and internal operations, and setting 
sustainability-linked targets and objec-
tives in line with society’s expectations. 
the plan, which is the culmination of 
intensive work throughout 2020, rests 
on four pillars: financial strength, cli-
mate action, social responsibility, and 
governance and culture. 
financial strength
we are a financially strong bank: our 
business is well diversified, our credit 
quality is strong, and we have solid fund-
ing and a robust capital position. our 
financial strength enables us to act on 
our responsibility to support our custom-
ers and society, including in tough times. 
in fact, it’s when times get tough that we 
have an especially important role to play. 
during the covid-19 pandemic, we were 
quick to offer instalment-free periods to 
nordic retail and corporate customers 
who needed help overcoming temporary 
liquidity problems.
managing risks related to environ-
mental, social and governance (esg) 
areas is key to maintaining our financial 
strength. in 2020 the materiality assess-
ment for esg-related risks associated 
with financial exposures focused on the 
impact of physical and transitional cli-
mate change factors on our corporate 
loan portfolio. the assessment conclud-
ed that esg-related risks are material to 
our credit risk profile. we will therefore 
manage esg-related risks in line with 
internal rules for all material risk types.
climate action
our commitments in relation to climate 
change are described in our  position 
statement on climate change. in addi-
tion, we have several sector guidelines 
and investment policies which address 
the issue of climate change and clarify 
what we expect from customers and 
investee companies in terms of their 
commitment to the paris agreement.
while we achieve our greatest 
 positive impact on the climate through 
investment and financing, we also work 
 
annual report 2020  
9 
nordea
nordea in society
to minimise the climate impact of our 
internal operations. we engage in vari-
ous ways to reduce our carbon emis-
sions from business travel, energy con-
sumption, and physical mail and distri-
bution, among other things. despite our 
active efforts to reduce our carbon foot-
print, we have some emissions that are 
difficult to reduce. for these, we buy 
carbon offsets to ensure that we are 
carbon neutral.
social responsibility
for us, social responsibility is about 
 caring – for individuals, businesses and 
society. it’s about taking sustainability 
issues like human rights, labour rights 
and equality into consideration across 
our entire value chain – empowering 
and supporting our  customers, invest-
ing responsibly, having a sustainable 
supply chain and being an inclusive 
employer. it’s also about engaging with 
local communities: we help young peo-
ple across the nordics to develop finan-
cial skills, assist senior citizens in 
accessing digital banking  services and 
support start-ups through financing 
and advice.
governance and culture
leveraging the combined strength of 
our purpose-led culture and sound 
operating model will enable us to both 
support the economy in transitioning to 
a greener, more sustainable future and 
reduce sustainability-related risks.
we are therefore enhancing our 
existing governance and risk manage-
ment structures to align with our long-
term plan for integrating sustainability 
into our business strategy and meet 
regulatory requirements and stakehold-
er expectations. going forward, our 
governance fora will facilitate the forth-
coming integration of sustainability into 
our business strategy and oversight, 
emphasising the importance of a sus-
tainable business model.

sustainability, see the non-financial statement in the 
board of directors' report (pages 57-61) and our sus-
tainability report 2020 at nordea.com.

priorities and financial targets
our priorities and financial targets
we are committed to delivering on our three key priorities to support our customers and society as a whole. our priorities 
guide us in how we run the bank, helping us to ensure loyal and satisfied customers, improve our financial performance and 
become truly competitive.
we are creating a solid and consistent performance culture. we are focused on executing our business plan, and have given 
the business areas full accountability. our aim is to deliver a little bit better every single day. this drives us to be a strong and 
personal financial partner for our customers, shareholders and society.
we continue to progress towards our 2022 financial targets. our cost-to-income ratio is improving in line with  
our 2022 target of 50%, decreasing to 55% in 2020 from 57% last year. return on equity for 2020 was 7.1%,  
demonstrating good underlying progress towards the target of above 10%. our financial strength means that we are  
well positioned to both support our customers and pay out dividends.

our people
our values are a clear expression of the 
culture we want to build, where people 
can be passionate about customers, col-
laborate across the organisation, retain 
a true sense of ownership in their work 
and have the courage to speak up and 
challenge each other.
we continue to empower our people 
by creating a simpler and flatter organi-
sation. this enables better communica-
tion and faster decision-making, and 
helps us to take ownership and be more 
adaptable, especially in a work environ-
ment that is increasingly virtual.
learning organisation
opportunities for learning and personal 
growth are a leading source of motiva-
tion for employees not only to join but 
also to remain with nordea. to further 
support employee development, we are 
working towards a more modern learn-
ing offering via enhanced digital deliv-
ery channels. the latest learning evalu-
ation data show higher satisfaction 
scores for virtual classes compared with 
in-person classes. 
our renewed focus on our internal 
job market means that talent develop-
ment has become a very important 
lever to increase retention and acceler-
ate professional growth. during 2020 
we had almost 14,000 individual talent 
reviews, and analysis of the insights 
gained will form the basis of our 2021 
talent strategy.
future ways of working
the covid-19 pandemic proved to be a 
fast track for nordea to trial new prac-
tices for flexible work. we will monitor 
and assess the long-term impact of 
flexible working on well-being, perfor-
mance, culture and productivity. 
remote leadership is becoming 
increasingly important in driving perfor-
mance and sustaining engagement. 
early on, we established instructions 
and e-learnings for leaders to guide 
them on how to manage the covid-19 
situation during the extended period of 
remote working. transparent and fre-
quent communication also contributed 
to increased engagement levels, 
according to our quarterly “people 
pulse” survey results, with 91% of 
respondents “agreeing” or “partially 
agreeing” that they had received appro-
priate guidance and support from their 
leaders.
we took all these aspects into 
account when we started evaluating the 
flexible working practices in the fourth 
quarter of 2020.
income development, digitalisation 
and automation will most likely continue 
to drive a need for adjustments to our 
organisation and how we work to help 
us reach our financial targets. in cases 
where this could lead to certain job 
changes, we will play a key role in 
securing the right strategic approach for 
engaging our people, while respecting 
labour market conditions. together with 
the unions, we are committed to treat-
ing our people with respect and care.
diversity and  inclusion make us better 
our ability to grow sustainably depends 
on the people we employ, the environ-
ment we provide and the extent to 
which we succeed in achieving diversity 
of thought. we aim to attract and retain 
talent, regardless of gender, age, eth-
nicity, nationality, cultural affiliation, 
sexual orientation, physical ability or 
any other aspect.
we work to ensure equal opportuni-
ties for all our people, equal pay for 
equal work, and inclusive workplaces 
– and we condemn all forms of discrim-
ination and harassment.
we are taking initiatives to raise 
awareness and support more diversity 
in our succession pipelines.
during 2020 we maintained the gen-
der balance in our overall workforce. 
however, we have not yet reached this 
gender balance at the top leadership 
level. 
in 2020 we launched our latest 
employee resource group, which will 
focus on cross-generational aspects, 
since age diversity plays an important 
role in improving organisational perfor-
mance and maximising productivity. 
our purpose establishes a clear link between our daily efforts to 
help our customers fulfil their dreams and aspirations and our 
commitment to work for a greater good and be a sustainable 
part of the societies in which we operate.

throughout the year we saw strong 
business momentum in mortgages, 
resulting in higher market shares in all 
four nordic countries compared with 
last year. we also launched several digi-
tal services to improve customer experi-
ence. for example, we launched a digi-
tal mortgage loan promise in denmark 
and norway. in denmark, this has led to 
an initial reduction of more than 50% in 
the loan process handling time when 
customers use our digital solutions. our 
customers say they find the new solu-
tion intuitive, easy to use and

we improved our savings advisory 
experience to make it easier for our cus-
tomers to start saving, both through 
in-person advisory meetings and 
through the mobile bank app. the 
improvements have been well received 
by customers, resulting in a significant 
increase in the number of sessions held 
with our digital advisor, nora (+120% 
compared with 2019).
in consumer finance we continued to 
focus on strengthening our digital capa-
bilities. one of our key achievements 
was to make the consumer loan appli-
cation process smoother for customers 
through increased automation. during 
the period of turbulence related to the 
covid-19 pandemic, we carefully and 
continuously reviewed our lending 
approach to ensure that we provided 
the best possible support to our cus-
tomers and maintained our position as 
a responsible lender.
with the new mobile bank app live in 
all countries, we continued to expand 
our common digital platforms by imple-
menting the new netbank in finland 
and sweden. we launched an account 
aggregation service in our mobile app 
in denmark, norway and sweden, 
enabling customers to get an overview 
of all their accounts, including those 
with other banks. the service, which 
was launched in partnership with the 
fintech tink, will go live in finland in the 
first quarter of 2021. we also upgraded 
our chatbot, nova, to actively perform 
certain tasks on behalf of customers in 
denmark, finland and sweden.
customer satisfaction increased in all 
countries compared with 2019.

in personal banking our aim is to create 
great customer experiences and fulfil all 
customer banking needs. in particular, 
we focus on savings and mortgage 
advice. we leverage our nordic scale 
and local market adaptability, driving 
cost efficiency and digital development.
our strategy focuses on building 
strong and personal relationships with 
our customers, and establishing our- 
selves as a safe and trusted partner that 
truly cares for their financial well-being. 
we will ensure a caring and personal 
approach in all interactions, both digital 
and in-person, and intensify our 
engagement with customers through 
the effective use of digital channels.
we are also focusing on creating a 
great omnichannel experience for our 
customers, where they can obtain the 
same high-quality advice through mul-
tiple channels and perform an increas-
ing number of tasks digitally. we want 
customers to have a consistent experi-
ence of us, regardless of the channel 
they use.
total income decreased by 2% in local 
currencies compared with last year due 
to lower payment and card fee income, 
which was attributable to the impact of 
covid-19, and high conversion activity 
in the danish mortgage market in 2019. 
however, we were able to partly miti-
gate the negative impact with a record-
strong 6% annual growth in mortgage 
volumes.
net interest income increased by 1% 
in local currencies across all countries, 
driven by the mortgage volume growth 
and increased deposit margins in swe-
den. this development was somewhat 
offset by lower deposit margins in fin-
land and norway resulting from rate 
changes. furthermore, consumer lend-
ing volumes were negatively affected 
by the pandemic.
net fee and commission income 
decreased by 6% in local currencies due 
to lower payment and card fee income 
in 2020 across all countries, as well as 
the high mortgage conversion activity 
in denmark during 2019. our underlying 
lending fee business development was 
strong throughout the year, and savings 
income reached the same level as last 
year despite the market turbulence 
caused by the pandemic.
net result from items at fair value 
decreased by 29% in local currencies 
compared with last year, as 2019 includ-
ed high positive revaluations booked in 
denmark.
total expenses decreased by 8% in 
local currencies compared with last 
year due to lower activity levels in gen-
eral following the pandemic.
net loan losses and similar net result 
increased significantly compared with 
last year due to the additional manage-
ment judgement allowances booked in 
the second quarter. as a result, operat-
ing profit decreased by 10% compared 
with last year.
to support our household customers, 
we granted covid-19-related instal-
ment-free periods on loans for approxi-
mately 90,000 customers, equivalent to 
a total loan amount of eur 13bn.

sustainability offering
we continue to see an increase in cus-
tomers who wish to save in a sustain-
able way. we also see more and more 
customers taking advantage of our 
green loan offerings, which include 
green mortgages, green car loans and 
energy renovation loans. sales of sus-
tainability-enhanced funds were up by 
around 300% and green mortgages 
were up by around 140% compared 
with last year.
we will continue to add new products 
to our sustainability offering. we are also 
entering into new partnerships to help 
our customers to be more sustainable. 
most recently, we teamed up with a heat-
ing pump company to help customers in 
denmark make more sustainable choices 
and increase the value of their homes by 
replacing boilers running on fossil fuels 
with energy-efficient heating pumps.

in 2020 we continued to grow lending 
and deposit volumes, which were up 
8% and 20% respectively compared 
with last year. we saw strong momen-
tum in norway and sweden due to 
enhanced engagement with new and 
existing customers.
we onboarded more customers to 
our digital solutions, further rolling out 
our enhanced netbank for corporate 
customers, nordea business. more than 
240,000 customers in finland and swe-
den are now able to use the enhanced 
service, which we also plan to expand 
to denmark and norway. moreover, we 
now offer a mobile version of our 
enhanced netbank to customers in den-
mark and finland and the majority of 
customers in sweden.
in april nordea startup & growth 
arranged a hackathon together with 
one of sweden’s leading tech news 
sites, breakit. more than 40 start-ups 
competed to come up with the best 
solution to help the elderly make use of 
digital solutions to overcome 
covid-19-related isolation.
we also continued to develop our  
digital dashboard solution for corporate 
customers, which supports them in cash 
planning and provides overviews of 
transactions and upcoming payments. 
the platform currently has 20,000 users 
across the nordics.
in the second quarter we started pro-
viding data insights for the greater good 
of societies through the launch of the 
corona barometer, a weekly report ana- 
lysing the economic impact of the 
covid-19 pandemic on different sec-
tors, based on card transaction statis-
tics. the barometer is the first time we 
have utilised product statistics to analyse 
macroeconomic trends for markets and 
governments on a nordic level. the 
news was well received by media, gov-
ernments and markets, and was cov-
ered by 134 national media publications, 
reaching over four million people.
customer satisfaction improved 
across all four home markets compared 
with 2019. improving customer experi-
ence and satisfaction in business bank-
ing continues to be one of our key focus 
areas.
we finalised the acquisition of sg 
finans in october and rebranded the 
company nordea finance equipment 
(nfe). the integration of nfe is running 
according to plan. the acquisition sup- 
ports our group strategy to focus on 
core business in the nordic market. in 
particular, it will increase our competi-
tiveness in the equipment and receiv-
ables finance market.
in business banking we offer banking and advisory products and 
services to our small and medium-sized corporate customers. 
business banking also includes transaction banking, which 
provides payment and transaction services, and nordea finance, 
which provides asset-based lending and receivables finance.

in business banking our aim is to be the 
leading bank for businesses and entre-
preneurs in the nordics, while achieving 
a cost-to-income ratio of around 45%  
by 2022.
our strategy focuses on protecting 
and developing our customer relation-
ships, developing digital and self-servic-
ing options for our corporate customers, 
and increasing operational efficiency by 
simplifying and improving key processes.
we aim to create great customer 
experiences when interacting with our 
customers. in particular, we want our 
customers to feel valued and appreciat-
ed by our advisers, who understand 
their business and can provide access to 
a wide variety of specialists across the 
bank. we are therefore working on free-
ing up more time for our advisers to 
spend with customers by simplifying 
and improving our “know your custom-
er” (kyc) and credit processes.
freeing up time will also support us 
in further improving our financial per-
formance, as it will enable our staff to 
be more proactive and carry out more 
targeted customer acquisitions and 
cross-selling.
another key priority is to continue 
developing our digital solutions and 
self-servicing functionalities to enable 
simple and easy daily banking for our 
customers. this will improve our cus-
tomer experience, digital offering and 
cost to serve.
sustainability offering
in business banking we support cus-
tomers seeking sustainable options by 
offering and raising awareness about 
sustainable financing and investment 
opportunities, for example green car 
leasing, green corporate loans and sus-
tainability-enhanced investment prod-
ucts. in 2021 we will further enhance 
the focus on environmental, social and 
governance (esg) guidance and devel-
op esg capabilities to meet customers’ 
expectations. 
total income increased by 4% in local 
currencies compared with last year due 
to good business momentum and high 
lending volume growth.
net interest income increased by 6%  
in local currencies, mainly due to higher 
lending and deposit volumes. lending vol-
umes increased by 8% in local currencies, 
driven by strong growth in norway and 
sweden and the consolidation of nfe.
net fee and commission income was 
unchanged in local currencies com-
pared with 2019, as higher lending fee 
income and high equity market activity 
were offset by lower payment and card 
fee income and lower mortgage refi-
nancing activity. corporate card com-
missions in particular were negatively 
impacted by lower levels of economic 
activity related to the covid-19 
pandemic.
net result from items at fair value 
decreased by 2% compared with 2019 
due to low market product activity 
during the first wave of covid-19 and 
lower income from interest rate prod-
ucts, which was partly offset by 
increased income from fx products.
total expenses decreased by 2% in 
local currencies compared with last 
year, reflecting our continued drive for 
cost efficiency along the value chain, as 
well as lower travel and representation 
costs due to the pandemic.
credit quality remained strong 
thanks to our well-diversified portfolio 
and limited exposure to vulnerable sec-
tors. net loan losses and similar net 
result totalled eur 316m (34bp) and 
was driven by the management judge-
ment buffer related to covid-19. oper-
ating profit amounted to eur 894m, a 
decrease of 4% compared with 2019.
return on capital at risk (rocar) 
decreased from 11% to 10% for the full 
year, driven by loan loss provisions, 
which were partly offset by higher 
income, lower costs and lower econom-
ic capital.
to support our corporate customers, 
we granted covid-19-related instal-
ment-free periods on loans, which 
totalled eur 6bn. approximately 9,000 
customers benefited from this measure. 
the demand for payment holidays 
decreased throughout the year and we 
have now resumed our normal credit 
process for customers needing an 
instalment-free period or other relaxed 
terms. so far, the vast majority of cus-
tomers have returned to normal amorti-
sation schedules following the expiry of 
their payment holiday.

in 2020 we achieved a clear improve-
ment in return on capital at risk 
(rocar), from 4% to 7%, through high-
er income, lower costs and reduced 
capital.
the high demand for lending facili-
ties at the height of the covid-19 crisis 
gradually returned to normal levels 
during the second half of 2020. lending 
volumes excluding repurchase agree-
ments decreased by 8% and lending 
margins increased slightly compared 
with 2019, in line with our strategy to 
improve profitability. 
we saw high levels of customer 
activity overall throughout the year. in 
debt capital markets this was reflected 
across investment-grade and high-yield 
segments. for nordic equity capital 
markets and mergers and acquisitions, 
an eventful year resulted in all-time-
high investment banking revenues and 
the receipt of euromoney’s award for 
best investment bank in finland. signif-
icant transactions with nordea’s 
involvement included rights issues in 
finnair, the initial public offering of hus-
compagniet, and the merger of cargo-
tec and konecranes, among many 
others.
customer satisfaction remained high 
during the intense business reposition-
ing. in the 2020 prospera customer sat-
isfaction survey we were awarded #1 
positions in corporate banking den-
mark (third year in a row), debt capital 
markets investment grade issuers in 
the nordics, finland and sweden, and 
debt capital markets high yield issuers 
in sweden.
we increased our focus on envi-
ronenmental, social and governance 
(esg) areas and continue to be a lead-
ing platform within sustainable advisory 
services.
in 2020 we were the top arranger of 
nordic corporate sustainable bonds, 
with a market share of 19%, and sus-
tainability-linked financing increased 
significantly compared with 2019.
nordea markets saw increased cus-
tomer activity and improved pricing lev-
els during the pandemic, and main-
tained solid risk management through-
out the year. leveraging our size and 
diversification, we generated higher 
aggregated risk management income 
compared with 2019, most notably in 
the fx, rates and equity product 
franchises.

in lc&i our aim is to create the leading 
large corporate and institutional fran-
chise in the nordics, significantly 
enhancing our current return profile, 
while positively contributing to the soci-
eties we operate in.
our strategic direction is to create a 
more focused and more profitable busi-
ness area, with reduced volatility of 
income and capital, and a rocar of 
more than 10% by 2022. this plan rests 
on four main pillars: reduce low-return 
assets, streamline the markets business 
model, invest in esg and lc&ix (our 
digital incubator), and optimise the 
international footprint.
to further reduce our low-return 
assets, we are continuously refining our 
customer strategies, focusing on capi-
tal-light ancillary income and prioritis-
ing return requirements. in markets we 
are redirecting the focus to the profit-
able core while continuing to reduce 
costs and capital through customer, 
product and geographical 
prioritisations.
increasing customer esg engage-
ment and meeting regulatory esg 
demands are key to further developing 
our leading sustainable finance plat- 
form. lc&ix will continue to develop 
and scale autofx iq, a new digital fx 
service for small and medium-sized 
enterprises.
we are optimising our international 
footprint by preserving our presence 
where our core nordic customers need 
it the most. our operations have been 
terminated in frankfurt and we will 
continue to wind down our singapore 
operations and our nordic desk in rus-
sia, with minimal disturbance to existing 
services.
furthermore, our ambitious diversity 
and inclusion agenda, together with 
skills development and new ways of 
working, will be essential to our contin-
ued repositioning of the business.
sustainability offering
we have a strong sustainability focus 
and hold the lead league table position 
for nordic corporate sustainable bonds 
in 2020. we will continue to further 
develop our sustainability offering for 
customers, focusing on esg research 
and green loans.

the development was driven by lend-
ing-related efficiencies, a gradual 
reduction in unused commitments, 
reduced inventories and further nor-

changes to the treatment of software 
assets also contributed to the reduction.
rocar increased from 4% in 2019 to

in asset & wealth management we offer an extensive range of 
award-winning savings products through internal and partners’ 
distribution channels, and provide financial advice to high net 
worth customers and institutional investors.
in 2020 our customers entrusted us with 
record-high assets under management 
(aum), which exceeded eur 350bn 
during the year. end-of-year aum stood 
at eur 353.8bn, an annual increase of 
eur 29.1bn.
customer investment appetite 
returned during a year that was heavily 
impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. 
while investment markets experienced 
a downturn following the outbreak of 
the virus in the first quarter, a sharp 
recovery saw the rest of 2020 character-
ised by strong performance and a very 
strong flow of new investments.
proactive customer service was at 
the top of the agenda in private bank-
ing. covid-19-related uncertainties and 
market volatility called for even stron-
ger ties between customers and advis-
ers. private banking customer satisfac-
tion remained high in all markets, and in 
november we were recognised as the 
best private bank in denmark, finland, 
norway and sweden by global finance.
institutional clients and third-party 
distributors of nordea funds increased 
the number of mandates awarded to 
asset management. in particular, 
requests for responsible and sustain-
ability-enhanced investment solutions 
grew throughout 2020. our leading 
position within responsible investments 
was confirmed when asset manage-
ment was announced winner of the esg 
engagement initiative of the year 2020 
by environmental finance.
life & pensions continued to grow

particular on growing occupational

banking.
net fee and commission income was 
eur 810m, up 3% compared with last 
year, reflecting the increase in aum. net 
result from items at fair value was eur

due to the divestement of velliv and 
lower return on own funds in life & 
pensions.
total expenses decreased by 9%, 
year on year, mainly due to structural 
changes in asset & wealth manage-
ment and reduced travel.

results summary 2020 
total operating income in 2020 was up 1% in local currencies 
(unchanged in eur) compared with 2019, excluding items 
affecting comparability. total expenses were eur 4,643m, a 
decrease of 4% in local currencies (down 5% in eur) excluding 
items affecting comparability, in line with guidance. net loan 
losses increased from last year to a level of 35 bp of loans (22 
bp in 2019). operating profit was down 11% in local currencies 
(down 12% in eur) excluding items affecting comparability.
income
net interest income was up 7% in 2020 compared to 2019 in 
local currencies, driven by strong mortgage growth through-
out the year. net fee and commission income decreased by 
1% in local currencies (2% in eur) due to lower activity main-
ly in payments and cards following covid-19. savings-related 
net fee and commission income recovered during the second 
half of the year as markets stabilised and our aum reached 
record levels. trading income supported 2020 compared with 
2019 but total net items at fair value decreased by 14% in 
local currencies.
expenses 
total operating expenses were down 4% in local currencies 
(down  5% in eur) compared to 2019 excluding items affect-
ing comparability, in line with our guidance. staff costs were 
down 1% in local currencies (2% in eur), excluding items 
affecting comparability. other expenses were down 11% in 
local currencies (12% in eur), excluding items affecting com-
parability. depreciation was up 4% in local currencies (2% in 
eur), excluding items affecting comparability. 
net loan losses and similar net result
net loan losses for 2020 were eur 908m (eur 536m), corre-
sponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 35bp for amor-
tised cost. including similar net result gains of eur 48m, they 
amounted to eur 860m, corresponding to 26bp (16bp). eur 
443m was due to increased management judgements mainly 
to cover for the uncertainty on future losses related to covid-
19. the individual provisions were driven by oil, gas and off-
shore as well as maritime mainly due to changed collateral 
values. there were also large net loan losses for consumer 
lending, but this was mainly related to the management 
judgements decided during the year. net loan losses and sim-
ilar net result for 2020 was on level with the 5-year average 
prior to the covid-19 crisis.
taxes
the effective tax rate in 2020 was 23.6% compared with 27% 
last year.

buffer. 
board of directors’ report
29
nordea annual report 2020
nordea maintained a strong liquidity position throughout 
the period of covid-19-related market stress. nordea bank 
abp issued approximately eur 15.0bn in long-term funding. 
throughout 2020, nordea bank abp remained compliant with 
the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) requirement in all curren-
cies on a combined basis. nordea bank abp has participated 
in different local central bank facilities, including the targeted 
longer-term refinancing operations (tltro) provided by 
the ecb to further support customer needs. for more infor-
mation, see note p2.
the group issued approximately eur 23.4bn in new and 
extended long-term funding during the year, excluding dan-
ish covered bonds and subordinated debt. liquidity manage-
ment is presented on pages 134-135. a maturity analysis is 
presented in note g44. for more information, see also note 
g2.
hedge accounting
nordea uses hedge accounting in order to have a symmetrical 
accounting treatment of changes in fair value of the hedged 
risks in the hedged items and of the hedging instruments and 
in order to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows and 
net investments in foreign operations. more information on 
the hedged risks is presented in notes g1 and g19.
authorisations held by the board of directors
the annual general meeting (agm) held on 28 may 2020 
decided in accordance with the board of directors’ proposal 
to authorise the board of directors to decide on a dividend 
payment of a maximum of eur 0.40 per share for the finan-
cial year 2019, to be distributed in one or several instalments.
furthermore, the 2020 agm authorised, for the period until 
the end of the next agm, the board of directors to decide on 
the issuance of special rights entitling to shares, either new 
shares or treasury shares, against payment (convertibles). 
the maximum number of shares that may be issued based on 
this authorisation is 404,995,191 shares. the issuance of spe-
cial rights by virtue of the authorisation may be made with or 
without preferential rights for existing shareholders and must 
be made on market terms.
the 2020 agm authorised the board of directors to decide 
on the repurchase of not more than 225,000,000 shares. the 
shares may be repurchased on one or several occasions either 
through an offer to all shareholders on equal terms or 
through other means and in another proportion than that of 
the shares held by current shareholders (directed purchases). 
the company’s own shares must be repurchased using the 
unrestricted equity of the company. the company’s own 
shares must be repurchased at a price that does not exceed 
the market price prevailing on the relevant stock exchange at 
the time of the repurchase or otherwise at a price formed on 
the market. the authorisation is in full force and effect until 
the earlier of (i) the end of the next agm or (ii) 18 months 
from the decision by the agm.
the 2020 agm authorised the board of directors to decide 
on the issuance of new shares or transfer of own shares in an 
amount of not more than 30,000,000 shares in total. the 
shares may be issued or transferred with deviation from the 
shareholders’ pre-emptive rights (directed issues). the authori-
sation is in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) the end of 
the next agm or (ii) 18 months from the decision by the agm.
financial review 2020
share issue resolutions
the 2020 agm resolved that nordea, before the end of the 
2021 agm, may transfer own shares in the ordinary course of 
its securities trading business, with deviation from the share-
holders’ pre-emptive rights, by way of a directed share issu-
ance. the facilitation of the company’s securities trading busi-
ness, in which the ability to trade also in own shares is 
required, forms a weighty financial reason for a directed issue. 
the number of own shares to be transferred may not exceed 
175,000,000 shares, corresponding to approximately 4.32% of 
the company’s shares.
for information on share-based incentive programmes see 
g8. staff costs on pages 147-148.
holding of own shares
as of 31 december 2020, nordea bank abp held 11,862,171 
shares (0.3% of the total number of shares) in nordea, an 
increase of 1,052,361 shares compared to 31 december 2019. 
the total price paid for own shares held at 31 december 2020 
amounted to eur 33m.
nordea holds treasury shares partly for remuneration pur-
poses and partly for trading purposes in its securities trading 
business. see also “share issue resolutions” above.
during 2020 aggregated amounts of 1,040,750 and 13,572 
own shares held by nordea were transferred without consid-
eration to participants in nordea’s variable remuneration pro-
grammes in may and september, respectively.
see also “statement of changes in equity” on pages 74-77.
personnel
personnel expenses, significant agreements with key man-
agement personnel and the distribution by number of 
employees, by country and by gender are disclosed in note 
g8. more information is presented on page 15, "our people".
profit sharing and share-based incentive systems
the three decided criteria for the goals for the profit-sharing 
plan 2020 are: return on equity (roe), cost-to-income ratio 
(c/i ratio) and a customer satisfaction goal. if performance 
goals are fully met, the cost will amount to approximately 
eur 63m (eur 68m in 2019). the provision for nordea’s prof-
it-sharing plan was eur 32.4m compared with eur 13m in 
2019. 
the profit-sharing scheme and the share-based incentive 
systems as well as other remuneration principles are presented 
in the chapter remuneration on pages 63-66 and in note g8.
pension liabilities
the total pension obligation in defined benefit plans 
increased from eur 3,790m to eur 3,871m in 2020. the 
increase was mainly due to re-measurements from changes in 
financial assumptions, mainly following lower discount rates. 
the increase in sweden was partly offset by a lower inflation 
and salary increase assumption.
pensions paid have had a reducing effect on the pension 
obligation offset by new pension rights earned and discount-
ing effects. the fair value of plan assets amounted to eur 
3,650m (eur 3,524m). despite challenging asset returns, 
 particularly in equities, strong performance of fixed income 
assets and interest rate hedging instruments led to a positive 
total return. the net pension liability amounted to eur 221m 
(eur 266m). see note g34 for more information.

security, also focusing on anti-money laundering activities. 
additionally, supporting requests from regulators and improv-
ing data management have been emphasised. improving cus-
tomer satisfaction, investing in digital solutions, and stream-
lining processes have been and will be in focus in the future. 
see also note g21 “intangible assets” on page 163.
financial crime prevention
nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences 
in 2020. significant compliance enhancements have been 
achieved within the areas of: i) governance, ii) it support of 
customer due diligence processes, iii) acceleration of kyc files 
remediations, iv) transaction monitoring capabilities, 
v) updating nordea's policies in the light of changes in regu-
lation, and vi) strengthening of nordea's sanctions 
programme. 
during the year nordea closely followed issued warnings from 
international advisory bodies and national nordic regulators 
regarding the potential impact of the pandemic on financial 
crime (fraud, cybercrime, exploitation of government funds, etc.).
nordea has also initiated proactive and reactive case 
reviews through a risk assessment process, looking into pat-
terns and red flags in addition to existing controls (e.g. false/
fraudulent claims of government aid, unusual transaction pat-
terns during the lockdown period). furthermore, nordea has 
increased its cooperation with local financial intelligence 
units due to higher numbers of urgent inquiries from these.

covid-19 pandemic on nordea, as well as the measures taken 
to address these impacts, has been provided in various sec-
tions of this annual report. nordea has also identified signifi-
cant risks caused by the covid-19 pandemic given the uncer-
tainty of the economic impact on the markets in which the

outlook
key priorities to meet 2022 financial targets
nordea’s business plan focuses on three key priorities to meet 
its 2022 financial targets: 1) to optimise operational efficiency, 
2) to drive income growth initiatives and 3) to create great 
customer experiences.
financial targets 2022
nordea’s financial targets for 2022 are:
• a return on equity above 10%
• a cost-to-income ratio of 50%
costs
total costs for 2021 are expected to be below eur 4.6bn.
capital policy
a management buffer of 150–200bp above the regulatory 
cet1 requirement, from 1 january 2021.
dividend policy
nordea’s dividend policy stipulates a dividend payout ratio of 
60–70%, applicable to profit generated from 1 january 2021. 
nordea will continuously assess the opportunity to use share 
buy-backs as a tool to distribute excess capital.
2019 capital markets day follow-up
in 2020, nordea continued delivering on the plan as present-
ed at the capital markets day (cmd) in october 2019. the 
cost-to-income ratio improved to 55% in 2020, down from 
57% in 2019, and is on track to reach the target of 50% in 
2022. return on equity fell to 7.1% in 2020, down from 8.2% in 
the same period last year, impacted by loan loss provisions 
made during the first two quarters of 2020 and a significantly 
larger equity base. the progress towards the 2022 target of a 
return on equity above 10% is on track.
risks and uncertainties 
within the framework of its normal business operations,
nordea faces various risks and uncertainties. maintaining risk 
awareness in the organisation is engrained in nordea’s busi-
ness strategies. nordea has defined clear risk and liquidity 
management frameworks including policies and instructions 
for different risk types, capital adequacy and capital structure. 
further information see note g2. “risk and liquidity man-
agement” on pages 102–135, note g33 “provisions” on page 
168 and note g38 “contingent liabilities” on page 174.
credit risk
credit risk is defined as the potential for loss due to failure of
a borrower(s) to meet their obligations to clear a debt in 
accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. the poten-
tial for loss is lowered by credit risk mitigation techniques. 
credit risk stems mainly from various forms of lending, but 
also from issued guarantees and documentary credits and 
includes counterparty credit risk, transfer risk and settlement 
risk.
a description of credit risk is presented on pages 105-106.
counterparty credit risk
counterparty credit risk is the risk that nordea’s counterparty
in an fx, interest rate, commodity, equity or credit derivative 
contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and that
nordea at that time has a claim on the counterparty.
a description of counterparty credit risk is presented on 
page 125.
market risk
market risk is the risk of loss in nordea’s positions in either
the trading book or the non-trading book as a result of 
changes in market rates and parameters that affect market 
values or net interest income flows. market risk exists irre-
spective of the accounting treatment of the positions.
a description of market risk is presented on pages 129–131.
operational risk
nordea defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and sys-
tems or from external events, and includes legal risk.
a description of operational risk is presented on pages 
131-132.
financial reporting risk
financial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements or 
deficiencies in financial reporting and regulatory reporting and 
disclosures. the risk arises from the erroneous interpretation and 
implementation of accounting standards and regulation, the use 
of judgement in reporting and inadequate governance and control 
frameworks around valuation and financial reporting.
a description of financial reporting risk is presented on

liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that nordea is unable to service its 
cash flow obligations when they fall due, or is unable to meet 
its cash flow obligations without incurring significant addi-
tional funding costs. nordea is exposed to liquidity risk in its 
lending, investment, funding, off-balance-sheet exposures and 
other activities which result in a negative cash flow mismatch. 
cash flow mismatches can occur at the end of a day or 
intraday.
a description of liquidity risk is presented on pages 
134-135.
compliance risk
nordea defines compliance risk as the risk of failure to com-
ply with applicable regulations and related internal rules.
nordea is subject to various legal regimes and require-
ments, including but not limited to those of the nordic coun-
tries, the european union and the united states. the supervi-
sory and governmental authorities administering and enforc-
ing these regimes make regular inquiries and conduct 
investigations with regard to nordea’s compliance. areas sub-
ject to investigation include investment advice, anti-money 
laundering (aml), trade regulation and sanctions adherence, 
external tax rules, competition law, and governance and con-
trol. the outcome and timing of these inquiries and investiga-
tions are unclear and pending. accordingly, it cannot be ruled 
out that these inquiries and investigations could lead to criti-
cism against the bank, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, dis-
putes and/or litigation.
in june 2015 the danish financial supervisory authority
investigated how nordea bank danmark a/s had followed
the regulations regarding aml. the outcome resulted in criti-
cism and, in accordance with danish administrative practice,
the matter was handed over to the police for further handling
and possible sanctions. as previously stated, nordea expects
to be fined in denmark for weak aml processes and proce-
dures in the past and has made a provision of eur 95m for 
ongoing aml-related matters.
there is a risk that the costs of dealing with these matters 
could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current provi-
sion, and that this could also impact nordea’s financial perfor-
board of directors’ report
32
annual report 2020 nordea
mance. in addition, some of these proceedings could lead to 
litigation. given this uncertainty, nordea will maintain the 
level of provision for ongoing aml-related matters while con-
tinuing the dialogue with the danish authorities regarding 
their allegations concerning historical aml weaknesses.
nordea has made significant investments to address the 
deficiencies highlighted by the investigations. among other 
actions, nordea established the financial crime change pro-
gramme in 2015 and has strengthened its organisation signifi-
cantly to enhance its aml and sanction management risk 
frameworks. nordea also established the sustainability and 
ethics committee and a culture transformation programme to 
embed stronger ethical standards into its corporate culture. 
the group is also investing in enhanced compliance stan-
dards, processes and resources in both the first and second 
lines of defence.
the danish tax authorities have raised a claim for damages 
against nordea of approximately dkk 900m relating to 
nordea's provision of assistance to a foreign bank in connec-
tion with the said bank’s reclaim of dividend tax on behalf of
one of its customers. it is nordea’s assessment that it is not
liable, and nordea disputes the claim. 
a description of compliance risk is presented on pages 
132-133.
claims in civil lawsuits
within the framework of normal business operations, nordea
faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most
of which involve relatively limited amounts.
presently, none of the current disputes are considered like-
ly to have any significant adverse effect on nordea or its 
financial position.

esg risks

(“esg”) risks see “non-financial statement” on pages 57-61 
and note g2 “risk and liquidity management” on pages 
102-135.
covid-19
there are significant risks caused by the covid-19 pandemic
given the uncertainty of the economic impact on the
markets in which nordea operates. depending on future
developments, potential adverse impacts on income could
arise due to lower net interest income, market volatility and
reduced business activity impacting transaction volumes and
customer activity.
depending on the duration and magnitude of the situation,
there is a possibility that nordea will not be able to
meet its financial targets in very adverse scenarios.

nordea annual report 2020
economic outlook 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the world economy 
experienced a major decline in 2020. economic activity is thus 
estimated to have fallen by 3.5% compared with last year as a 
result of societal shutdowns aimed at containing the spread 
of infection. however, as a result of a rapid, coordinated and 
very extensive easing of economic policy, much of the pro-
duction losses were largely recovered as societies reopened 
over the summer. towards the end of the year, however, the 
second wave of the pandemic hit and europe in particular 
was hit by a new comprehensive shutdown. again with great 
consequence for economic activity. the service sector in par-
ticular has been hit hard, while the manufacturing sector has 
improved during the crisis.
the nordic countries have done relatively well during the 
pandemic. all countries experienced large declines in eco-
nomic activity in the second quarter, but had a significant 
boom over the summer and autumn. when the second wave 
hit, however, it led to new restrictions, which limited activity 
towards the end of the year. 
the recovery of the global economy is expected to contin-
ue during 2021, with pre-covid-19 global gross domestic 
product (gdp) levels reached by the end of the year. 
the nordic countries have been among the best perform-
ing countries globally during the pandemic. they are all 
expected to grow in 2021 following a relatively weak end to 
2020 due to new containment measures.
denmark 
danish gdp decreased by 3.7% in 2020 – the biggest setback 
since the financial crisis in 2009. the main drag on gdp occurred 
in q2 2020 as harsh restrictions were enforced to curb the spread 
of the coronavirus. however, in the second half of 2020 activity 
quickly rebounded, driven by a significant increase in household 
consumption. by the end of the year new containment measures 
were introduced, which slowed the economic recovery. the situ-
ation in the labour market has improved since the spike in the 
unemployment rate in may 2020. despite the crisis, the housing 
market has been strong, with accelerating selling prices and a 
significantly higher number of housing sales than in previous 
years. in march 2020 danmarks nationalbank made an indepen-
dent interest rate hike to safeguard the fixed-exchange regime. 
since then the dkk has been strengthening against the eur and 
the central bank has not intervened in the fx market. the mon-
etary policy rate is not expected to be changed until 2023 at the 
earliest. 
finland 
the finnish economy survived the coronavirus crisis in 2020 
better than expected. for the full year of 2020, finnish gdp 
decreased by 3.2%. the economic recovery slowed towards 
the end of the year due to the second wave of covid-19, and 
in the service sectors the situation continues to be dire. the 
export sector has fared relatively well during the covid-19 
pandemic and goods exports picked up clearly towards the 
end of the year as global trade recovered. the unemployment 
rate was 8.2% in december and the annual average was 7.8% 
in 2020. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the finnish 
housing market was short-lived and we saw a quick rebound 
in the second half of the year. housing prices were 2.3% high-
er in december compared to the year before. the ecb's mon-
etary policy rates are not expected to be changed until 2023 
at the earliest.
norway 
norwegian mainland gdp fell by 2.5% in 2020, making nor-
way one of the countries that has weathered the covid-19 
pandemic the best. the rebound was also evident in regis-
tered unemployment figures, which fell from above 10% dur-
ing the second quarter to 3.9% at the end of 2020. during 
2020, norway had some of the lowest infection rates and 
least stringent containment measures compared to other 
developed economies. house prices staged a strong develop-
ment throughout the year and rose 8.7%, year on year, in 
december 2020. housing prices benefited greatly from norg-
es bank’s rate cuts from 1.5% to zero. the central bank has 
pencilled in the first rate hike during q1 2022. however, given 
the latest vaccination outlook, we expect normalisation soon-
er than norges bank and look for the first rate hike during the 
fourth quarter of 2021. the norwegian krone weakened con-
siderably during the worst market panic in march. since then 
the nok has strengthened in tandem with rising oil prices.
sweden 
the swedish economy performed relatively well during 2020, 
where gdp decreased by 2.8%. after a tough second quarter 
the recovery gained speed, driven by a strong increase in 
household consumption of goods. exports of goods also grew 
strongly in line with the recovery of global trade and in some 
sectors the order intake approached record-high levels. 
growth slowed by the end of last year due to the second 
wave of the covid-19 pandemic and parts of the service sec-
tor are still in a very difficult situation. the unemployment 
rate averaged 8.3% for 2020 but ended the year higher at 
somewhat below 9%. home prices increased by 12% in the 
course of 2020. sveriges riksbank kept its repo rate 
unchanged at 0% in december 2020 as well as in february 
2021, and signalled that the repo rate would remain 
unchanged for the coming three years. the quantitative eas-
ing programme runs until end-2021. the trade-weighted 
swedish krona strengthened by 7% in 2020

nordea bank abp’s ordinary shares are listed on nasdaq 
nordic, the stock exchanges in helsinki (in euro), stockholm 
(in swedish krona) and copenhagen (in danish krone) and its 
american depository receipts (adr) are traded in the us in

8% on the nasdaq helsinki exchange from eur 7.24 to eur 
6.67. the daily closing prices listed for the nordea share in 
2020 ranged between eur 4.55 and eur 8.15. in 2020, the

the nordea share with competitors and general indices as 
well as find historical prices for the nordea share.
total shareholder return 2020
total shareholder return (tsr) is the market value growth per 
share and reinvested dividends. total shareholder return in 
2020 was -7.8% (9.7% in 2019). 
during 2020 the board of directors of nordea decided to 
follow the ecb's recommendations to banks not to pay divi-
dends or buy back shares in the light of the covid-19 pan-
demic. consequently, no dividends were paid to shareholders 
during 2020.
turnover – the most liquid nordic bank share
the nordea share was the most liquid nordic bank share in 
2020, with an average daily trading volume of approximately 
eur 135m, corresponding to approximately 21 million shares. 
turnover on all exchanges combined totalled eur 34bn in 
2020, corresponding to 5 billion shares. 
34% of the total volume traded in nordea shares takes  
place over other exchanges such as cboe europe and equities, 
 turquoise and aquis. out of the total number of nordea shares 
traded in 2020 on nasda q, approximately 49% were sek-de-
nominated, 46% eur-denominated and 3% dkk-denominated.
share and voting rights
nordea’s articles of association do not contain any provisions 
on share classes or voting rights and consequently nordea 
has one class of shares and all shares in nordea are ordinary 
shares. each share confers one vote at nordea's general 
meetings, as well as an equal right to any dividend. on 31 
december 2020, the total number of shares in nordea was 
4,049,951,919. see also "statement of changes in equity" on 
pages 74-77.
there are no restrictions in the articles of association 
regarding the right to transfer shares and nordea is not 
aware of any agreements between shareholders in this 
respect. however, as nordea is a credit institution, a direct or 
indirect acquisition of shares in nordea, which results in the 
acquirer’s total holdings being considered qualified holdings 
(representing 10% or more of the equity capital or of the vot-
ing rights, or a holding that otherwise enables the acquirer to 
exercise a substantial influence over the management of 
nordea) or an increase in qualified holdings, may only occur 
following approval by the finnish financial supervisory 
authority according to the finnish act on credit institutions. 
under the single supervisory mechanism, the european cen-
tral bank is the authority that ultimately decides on (in coop-
eration with the finnish financial supervisory authority) 
whether to approve an acquisition of a qualifying holding in 
nordea, as nordea is subject to the direct supervision of the 
european central bank.
on 31 december 2020, sampo plc was the largest individu-
al shareholder with a holding of 15.9% and the only share-
holder with holdings of more than 10%. a table showing the 
largest registered shareholders in nordea as at the end of 
2020 is provided on page 36.
on 31 december 2020, employees had an indirect share-
holding of 0.6% in nordea through the nordea profit-sharing 
foundation and a minor indirect shareholding in nordea 
through the pension foundation. the voting rights are in nei-
ther case exercised directly by the employees.

at1 conversion notes and special rights entitling to shares
the at1 conversion notes issued in 2019 by nordea bank abp 
automatically convert into an aggregated maximum number 
of 194,099,378 newly-issued nordea shares if the cet1 ratio 
of either nordea bank abp on a solo basis or the nordea 
group on a consolidated basis falls below 5.125%. the notes 
shall be convertible into shares at a price not exceeding a 
specific nominal amount, subject to adjustments. upon con-
version of the notes into shares, nordea’s existing sharehold-
ers have preferential rights to all newly-issued nordea shares.
there are no convertible bonds issued by nordea that give 
option exercise rights for holders to acquire shares in nordea.
share capital 
the share capital amounts to eur 4,049,951,919, which 
equals the total number of shares in the company. 
dividend for 2019 and 2020
on 15 december 2020, the ecb issued an updated dividend 
recommendation to banks. the ecb in general expects divi-
dends and share buy-backs to remain below 15% of the 
cumulated profit for 2019-2020 and not to exceed 20bp of the 
cet1 ratio until the end of september 2021. the board of 
directors of nordea decided on 16 december 2020 to follow 
the updated ecb recommendation.
based on the recommendation and after a dialogue with 
the ecb, the board of directors decided on 18 february on a 
dividend distribution of eur 0.07 per share, in accordance 
with the mandate received from the 2020 annual general 
meeting (agm) and based on the adopted balance sheet for 
the financial year ended 31 december 2019. the record date 
for such dividend payment was 22 february and the payment 
date is 1 march 2021 or as soon as possible thereafter. 
in addition, the board has proposed that the 24 march 2021 
agm authorise it to decide on a dividend payment of a maxi-
mum of eur 0.72 per share. the payment would be distrib-
uted based on the balance sheet to be adopted for the finan-
cial year ended 31 december 2020, in one or several instal-
ments. the authorisation would remain in force until the 
beginning of the next agm.
the proposed amount of eur 0.72 maximum per share is 
in line with nordea’s dividend policy and includes the residual 
amount of the 2020 agm dividend mandate (eur 0.33 per 
share) as well as 70% of the net profit for the financial year 
2020 (eur 0.39 per share). the board of directors will refrain 
from deciding on a dividend payment based on the proposed 
authorisation before 1 october 2021 unless the ecb updates 
or revokes its current recommendation. the total dividend 
payment for 2020 would be eur 2,907m. the dividend yield 
calculated on the share price at 31 december 2020 was 10.7%. 
nordea will publish any future decisions on dividend pay-
ment by the board of directors separately, and will simultane-
ously confirm the dividend record and payment dates. 
shareholders
with approximately 575,000 registered shareholders at the 
end of 2020, nordea has one of the largest shareholder bases 
of all nordic companies. the number of shareholders in fin-
land is approximately 305,000, in sweden approximately 
145,000 and in denmark approximately 125,000, largely 
unchanged from last year.
the largest shareholder category is finnish institutions 
(including sampo plc), with a 23% holding of nordea shares. 
at year-end, swedish institutional shareholders held 19% 
while non-nordic shareholders held 34%. the largest individ-
ual shareholder is sampo plc with a holding of 15.9%.

nordea annual report 2020
ratings
nordea’s credit ratings are some of the strongest among banks 
globally. during 2020, nordea’s ratings were reaffirmed at 
unchanged levels with a stable outlook from moody’s and 
were reaffirmed at unchanged levels with negative outlook on 
the long-term ratings from standard & poor’s (s&p) and fitch.
the long-term ratings for senior unsecured preferred debt 
for nordea bank abp are all at the aa level: standard & poor’s 
aa– (negative outlook), moody’s aa3 (stable outlook) and fitch 
aa (negative outlook). the short-term ratings are at the highest 
level: a–1+ from s&p, p–1 from moody’s and f1+ from fitch.
the negative outlook from standard & poor’s and from 
fitch mainly reflect nordea’s lower profitability in recent peri-
ods and relate to nordea’s ability to meet its new financial 
targets and improve profitability.
the covered bond ratings for the covered bond-issuing 
entities are unchanged and these are all aaa/aaa for the cov-
ered bonds issued by nordea hypotek ab (publ) (in sweden), 
nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab (in denmark), nordea 
mortgage bank plc (in finland) and nordea eiendomskreditt 
as and nordea direct boligkreditt as (in norway).
the analysis from the rating agencies’ side is in broad terms 
focused on credit risks and other risks, profitability, capitalisa-
tion, the strength of the business franchise as well as on the 
funding profile and liquidity strength. for these areas, the 
views on nordea have been stable during the year, with the 
exception of the view on profitability as described above.
the senior non-preferred (snp) bonds that nordea has

annual report 2020 nordea
nordea strives to be efficient in its use of capital and therefore 
actively manages its balance sheet with respect to different 
asset, liability and risk categories. the goal is to enhance returns 
to shareholders while maintaining a prudent capital structure. 
the board of directors decides ultimately on the targets for cap-
ital ratios, the capital policy and the overall framework of capital 
management at nordea. the ability to meet targets to maintain 
minimum capital requirements is reviewed regularly within the 
asset & liability committee (alco) and the risk committee.
capital and dividend policy
the capital policy states that the nordea group under normal 
business conditions should have minimum targets for the 
common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio, the tier 1 capital 
ratio and the total capital ratio that exceed the capital 
requirements set by the competent authorities. in addition, 
nordea will maintain a management buffer. our intention is to 
hold a cet1 capital management buffer of 150-200bp above 
the cet1 capital ratio requirement (restriction level for the 
maximum distributable amount, mda). we strive to maintain 
a strong capital position in line with our capital policy. 
our ambition is to distribute 60-70% of the net profit for 
the year to shareholders. excess capital in relation to capital 
targets will be used for organic growth and strategic business 
acquisitions, as well as being subject to buy-back 
considerations.
minimum capital requirements
the calculation method for the risk exposure amount (rea) 
depends on regulatory approval. nordea had 87% of its credit 
risk exposure amount covered by the internal ratings-based 
(irb) approach by the end of 2020. nordea is approved to use 
its own internal value-at-risk (var) models to calculate capital 
requirements for the major share of the market risk in its trad-
ing book. for operational risk the standardised approach is 
applied. based on the total rea, nordea needs to hold the 
applicable minimum and combined buffer requirements. in 
addition, competent authorities require nordea to hold capital 
for other risks which are identified and communicated as part 
of the supervisory review and evaluation process (srep). in 
november 2020, the ecb communicated that the total pillar 2 
requirement (p2r) of 1.75% would be maintained. furthermore, 
as communicated by the ecb in march 2020, the p2r can par-
tially be complied with using capital instruments that do not 
qualify as common equity tier 1 capital, i.e. additional tier 1 or 
tier 2 instruments. the p2r of 1.75% is also applicable to 
nordea bank abp on solo level. 
internal capital requirement (icr)
for internal risk and capital assessment purposes, nordea uses 
the icr. in line with article 73 of crd iv, the icr specifies the 
amount, type and distribution of internal capital that is consid-
ered adequate to cover the nature and level of all risks to which 
the group or any of its subsidiaries are or might become 
exposed over a foreseeable future, including during periods of 
stress. 
the icr is one of the main inputs for the internal capital 
adequacy assessment process (“icaap”), together with reg-
ulatory views on the required amount of capital as expressed 
under the regulatory perspective.
nordea defines the icr as the internal capital requirement 
for all material risks from an internal economic perspective, 
taking account of the regulatory, normative, through-the-
cycle perspective, adequate to withstand periods of stress.
this ensures that nordea’s icr is aligned with, but not 
restricted by, the regulatory perspective and it also ensures that 
data and processes are appropriately validated and governed. 
economic capital (ec)
ec is a method for allocating the cost of holding capital as a 
result of risk-taking and is a central component in the value 
creation framework (vcf). the vcf supports the operational 
decision-making process at nordea to enhance performance 
management and ensure shareholder value creation.
ec is aligned with the group’s target cet1 level, which is 
set by future expected levels of the capital policy to ensure a 
sustainable long-term capitalisation for the nordea group. in 
addition, the ec framework also includes the following items:
• legal equity contribution of nlp 
• certain capital deductions for which allocation keys have 
been agreed
ec (including nordea life & pensions) was, at the end of 
2020, eur 23.5bn (eur 25.7bn at the end of 2019). the 
decrease in ec during 2020 was primarily driven by an update 
of the ec framework to reflect the new capital requirements 
due to the covid-19 outbreak and to support business 
momentum. 
own funds
own funds are the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital. tier 1 capi-
tal consists of both common equity tier 1 (cet1) and addi-
tional tier 1 capital. cet1 capital is considered to be capital of 
the highest quality with ultimate loss-absorbance characteris-
tics and consists predominately of paid-in capital and 
retained earnings. profit may only be included after permis-
sion from the financial supervisory authority and after 
deducting the proposed dividend. additional tier 1 and tier 2 
capital consist mostly of undated and dated subordinated 
loans, respectively. holdings of other financial sector entities’ 
subordinated loans are deducted from the corresponding tier.
further information – capital adequacy and 
the capital and risk management report
further information on capital management and capital ade-
quacy is presented in the capital and risk management 
report. nordea bank abp, on the basis of its consolidated sit-
uation, quarterly provides capital and risk management 
report disclosures according to part eight of regulation (eu) 
no 575/2013 (crr). the disclosures constitute a comprehen-
sive disclosure of risks, risk management and capital manage-
ment. it includes disclosures, or references to other disclo-
sures, required according to part eight of the crr and by eba 
guidelines and standards for disclosure requirements. 
information exempted from disclosure due to being non-mate-
rial, proprietary or confidential can be found in part 2, other 
tables of the capital and risk management report. accompany-
ing the capital and risk management report are  
the required disclosures for the subsidiaries nordea kredit 
realkreditaktieselskab, nordea hypotek ab, nordea mortgage 
bank plc, nordea eiendomskreditt as, nordea direct bank group, 
nordea finans norge as and nordea finance equipment as.
nordea and its subsidiaries have adopted a formal policy to 
assure compliance with the disclosure requirements and have 
established policies for assessing the appropriateness of 
these disclosures, including the verification and frequency. 
the capital and risk management report is available on 
www.nordea.com. the subsidiaries' disclosures are included 
as appendices and are published on the same website after 
the publication date of each subsidiary's annual report.
country by country reporting
further information on country-by-country reporting in accor-
dance with the finnish act on credit institutions is presented 
in a separate appendix available at www.nordea.com.

nordea annual report 2020 
new regulations
the capital requirement directive iv (crd iv) and capital 
requirement regulation (crr) entered into force on 1 janu-
ary 2014 followed by the bank recovery and resolution 
directive (brrd) on 15 may 2014. the crr became applica-
ble in all eu countries from 1 january 2014 while the crd iv 
and brrd were implemented through national law within all 
eu member states from 2014. from 31 december 2019, the 
crr and crd iv were also finally implemented in norway.
in june 2019, the ‘banking package’ containing revisions to 
the brrd, the crd and the crr was adopted. the revisions 
include a review of the minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (mrel), a review of the market risk 
requirements (fundamental review of the trading book, 
frtb), the introduction of a binding net stable funding ratio 
(nsfr), the introduction of a strict leverage ratio requirement 
of 3% to be met by tier 1 capital and amendments to the pil-
lar 2 and macroprudential framework. the revised crd (crd 
v) and brrd (brrd ii) are to be applied from 28 december 
2020, while the majority of the changes in the crr (crr ii) 
are to be applied from 28 june 2021. the consultation on the 
“banking package” ended on 6 january 2021 in norway and 
implementation is pending.
on 26 june, the so-called ‘quick fix’ was implemented with 
the intention to ensure that banks can continue to lend 
money to support the economy and help mitigate the signifi-
cant economic impact of covid-19. the package includes a 
few targeted “quick fix” amendments to the crr with the 
intention to maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb 
losses related to covid-19. among the changes, the quick fix 
implements the extended sme factor and the changed treat-
ment of software at an earlier date than previously decided.
on 6 april, the board of the finnish fsa decided to remove 
the systemic risk buffer (srb) and to adjust bank-specific 
requirements so that the buffer requirements for all finnish 
banks fall by 1 percentage point. for nordea, the 3% srb was 
removed and instead the 2% buffer for other systemically 
important institutions (o-sii) became applicable, reducing 
the overall requirement for systemic risk from 3% to 2%. in 
the decision it is also stated that this promotes a smooth tran-
sition to coming changes in capital regulation (crd v) that 
states that the buffers for srb and o-sii will be additive.
on 12 march, the ecb announced that they will allow 
banks to operate temporarily below the level of capital 
defined by the pillar 2 guidance (p2g) and the capital conser-
vation buffer (ccob). the ecb also stated that they will allow 
banks to partially use capital instruments, i.e. additional tier 1 
(at1) and tier 2 (t2) capital, to meet the pillar 2 require-
ments (p2r), which is a measure that was expected to be 
applicable with the implementation of crd v.
the ecb has during the year made three recommendations 
on dividends during the covid-19 pandemic. the most recent 
recommendation on 15 december states that banks should 
refrain from or limit dividends until end-september 2021. the 
recommendation states that dividends are to remain below 
15% of cumulated 2019–20 profits and not higher than 20 
basis points of the cet1 ratio. 
in march 2020, the countercyclical buffer rate was 
decreased in sweden, denmark and norway due to covid-
19. the buffer rate in both sweden and denmark was 
decreased to 0%, while it was reduced to 1% in norway. in 
finland the buffer rate remains at 0%.
to mitigate the effect of the norwegian implementation of 
the crr and crd iv, the norwegian ministry of finance 
adopted changes in banks’ capital requirements by changing 
the systemic risk buffer (srb) from the current 3% for all nor-
wegian banks to 4.5% for all norwegian exposures. the 
changes apply from 31 december 2020 to all banks' expo-
sures in norway that are currently subject to the advanced 
internal rating based (irb) approach. for all other banks, the 
changes to the srb enter into force from 31 december 2022. 
new risk weight floors for residential real estates to 20% and 
for commercial real estates to 35% according to article 458 of 
the crr have also been adopted and apply from 31 decem-
ber 2020. on 2 february 2021, the norwegian ministry of 
finance requested the european systematic risk board 
(esrb) to issue a recommendation to other eea states to 
reciprocate the measures. nordea does not agree to the 
change in the systemic risk buffer and is raising its concerns 
with relevant decision-making bodies. if reciprocity is accept-
ed by the finnish fsa, the aforementioned measures would 
then also apply to the nordea group, leading to an estimated 
increase in the group's cet1 capital ratio requirement of 
approximately 95 bp.
on 22 december 2020, the commission delegated regula-
tion on the deduction of software assets from common equi-
ty tier 1 items was published in the eu official journal. the 
delegated regulation is applicable from 23 december and 
explains how prudently valued software assets which are not 
negatively affected by resolution, insolvency or liquidation are 
defined and calculated. under this approach, the positive dif-
ference between the prudential and the accounting accumu-
lated amortisation shall be fully deducted from cet1 capital, 
while the residual portion of the carrying amount of software 
shall be risk weighted to 100%. the prudential amortisation 
period is maximum three years and shall start from the date 
on which the software asset is available for use and begins to 
be amortised for accounting purposes.
the swedish fsa has implemented a temporary risk 
weight floor for residential mortgages of 25%. the floor was 
implemented with effect from 31 december 2018 and was in 
december 2020 decided to be prolonged to also be valid dur-
ing 2021. this has been reciprocated by the finnish fsa and is 
therefore valid for the nordea group. the finnish fsa has 
implemented a similar risk weight floor of 15% for residential 
mortgages with effect from 1 january 2018 until 31 december 
2020 after which it is discontinued.
the new european covered bond directive and regulation 
has been finalised. the directive entered into force on 8 janu-
ary 2020; the national transposition period will last until 8 
july 2021 and national measures must be applied by 8 july 
2022. the regulation will apply from 8 july 2022, in parallel 
with the deadline for the national measures of the directive. 
finalisation of basel iii framework (“basel iv”)
basel iii is a global regulatory framework on bank capital 
adequacy, stress testing and liquidity risk. in december 2017, 
the finalised basel iii framework, often called the basel iv 
package, was published. the basel iv package was supposed 
to be implemented in 2022, but was postponed until 2023 due 
to covid-19, and includes revisions to credit risk, market risk, 
operational risk, credit valuation adjustment (cva) risk, lever-
age ratio and introduces a new output floor. 
on credit risk, the package includes revisions to both the 
irb approach, where restrictions on the use of irb for certain 
exposures are implemented, as well as on the standardised 
approach. also, for market risk the internal model approach 
and the standardised approach have been revised. for opera-
tional risk, the three existing approaches will be removed and 
replaced by one standardised approach to be used by all 
banks. on cva risk, the internally modelled approach is 
removed, and the standardised approach is revised. the pack-
age also includes the implementation of a minimum leverage 
46
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
new regulations
ratio requirement of 3% to be met with tier 1 capital with an 
additional leverage ratio buffer requirement for global sys-
temically important banks (g-sibs) of half the size of the 
g-sib capital buffer requirement.
the output floor is to be set at 72.5% of the standardised 
approaches on an aggregate level, meaning that the capital 
requirement under the floor will be 72.5% of the total pillar 1 
rea calculated with the standardised approaches for credit, 
market and operational risk. the floor will be phased in, start-
ing with 50% from 2023 to be fully implemented at 72.5% 
from 1 january 2028.
before being applicable to nordea, the basel iv package 
needs to be implemented into eu regulations and will there-
fore be subject to negotiations between the european com-
mission, council and parliament, which might change the 
implementation and potentially also the timetable. it is 
expected that the commission will publish its proposal  
in mid-2021 after which negotiations in the council and  
parliament will begin.

corporate governance statement 2020
strong corporate governance is about companies having 
clear and systematic decision-making processes, thus provid-
ing clarity about responsibilities, avoiding conflicts of interest 
and ensuring satisfactory internal control, risk management, 
transparency and accountability. 
corporate governance at nordea bank abp (the “compa-
ny” or “nordea”) follows generally adopted principles of cor-
porate governance and relevant normative frameworks. 
nordea is subject to and applies the finnish corporate gover-
nance code 2020, approved by the securities market associa-
tion on 19 september 2019, (the “code”) and complies with 
all the recommendations of the code apart from the appoint-
ment procedure for electing employee representatives to the 
board (recommendation 5), as described further below.
this corporate governance statement describes nordea’s 
approach to the key elements of corporate governance and is 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the finnish 
act on credit institutions, the finnish accounting act, the 
finnish securities market act, the ministry of finance decree 
on the obligation of securities issuers to disclose periodic 
information, and the code.
nordea’s corporate governance statement is available  
at www.nordea.com and the code is available at  
https://cgfinland.fi/en/. 
corporate governance at nordea
nordea is a finnish public limited liability company and the 
parent company of the nordea group (comprising the com-
pany and its subsidiaries). the company’s shares are listed on 
the nasdaq stock exchanges in helsinki, stockholm and 
copenhagen and its american depository receipts (adr) are 
traded in the us in us dollars. furthermore, as part of its 
funding operations the company issues long-term debt 
instruments on the capital markets, which are usually listed 
on various stock exchanges. the corporate governance of 
nordea is proportionate and comprehensive with respect to 
the nature, scope and diversity of the company’s operations 
to ensure efficient management in accordance with prudent 
conduct of business principles. furthermore, nordea's com-
mitment to purpose, values and vision requires the integra-
tion of sound corporate governance practices into regular 
business activities.
the board of directors (the “board”) and the president 
and group ceo are responsible for the management of the 
company. the main emphasis is on the board noting and 
undertaking its role in nordea’s corporate governance struc-
ture and the interaction with the other governing bodies to 
ensure sound corporate governance, including systems for 
internal control and risk management regarding financial 
reporting. corporate governance and the duties of the gov-
erning bodies of nordea are defined by the applicable inter-
nal and external frameworks. the external framework that 
regulates corporate governance includes eu-law and nation-
al-level laws, such as directive 2013/36/eu (“crd iv”), regu-
lation (eu) no 575/2013 (“crr”), directive 2014/65/eu 
(“mifid ii”), regulation (eu) no 600/2014 (“mifir”) as well 
as rules and guidelines issued by the relevant financial super-
visory authorities, such as the eba guidelines on internal 
governance (“gl11”) and the joint esma and eba guidelines 
on the assessment of the suitability of members of the man-
agement body and key function holders (“gl 12”), as well as 
national level laws, including the finnish companies act, the 
finnish act on credit institutions, the finnish accounting act 
and the relevant fin-fsa regulations and guidelines. nordea 
also complies with rules and guidelines issued by other rel-
evant financial supervisory authorities, as well as eu legisla-
tion for the financial industry, stock exchange rules for each 
relevant stock exchange, and the rules and principles of the 
code. 
the board has adopted instructions for the president and 
group ceo specifying his responsibilities as well as other 
charters, policies and instructions for the operations of the 
nordea group. furthermore, nordea’s code of conduct pro-
vides an ethical framework for the conduct of all members of 
governing bodies and employees. these mechanisms, togeth-
er with the articles of association, the charter (as defined 
below) and the committee charters (as defined below) 
 constitute the internal framework that regulates corporate 
governance at nordea. the internal framework is designed to 
enable prudent conduct of business by defining the powers 
and responsibilities of the corporate bodies and employees.

division of powers and responsibilities
the management and control of nordea is divided among the 
shareholders (at general meetings), the board and the presi-
dent and group ceo, pursuant to the provisions of the exter-
nal framework, the articles of association and the internal 
framework set forth by the board.
general meetings (1)
the general meeting is the company’s highest decision-mak-
ing body, at which shareholders participate in the supervision 
and control of the company through their voting rights and 
right to speak. applicable regulations and the articles of 
association of the company determine the matters to be 
dealt with at a general meeting. at the general meeting, 
decisions are taken regarding matters such as the annual 
accounts, dividend, election of the members of the board and 
auditor, as well as remuneration for the board members and 
auditor. in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, 
the remuneration policy for governing bodies and, as of 
2021, the remuneration report for governing bodies will be 
presented and adopted through an advisory vote at the gen-
eral meeting. the remuneration policy for governing bodies 
and the remuneration report are available at www.nordea.
com.
general meetings are held in helsinki. due to the covid-19 
pandemic and in order to ensure the health and safety of the 
company’s shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, 
the board resolved on extraordinary meeting procedures pur-
suant to the temporary legislation initially adopted by the 
finnish parliament on 24 april 2020 (the “temporary legisla-
tion”) for the annual general meeting (“agm”) 2020. the 
agm was held on 28 may 2020 at the headquarters of the 
company without physical participation and the shareholders 
could thus participate in the agm and exercise their share-
holders’ rights by voting in advance or through a proxy repre-
sentative, and by making counterproposals and asking ques-
tions in advance. additionally, the shareholders had the pos-
sibility to follow the 2020 agm through a live web stream. 
due to the covid-19 pandemic none of the members of the 
board, the proposed new board member, the president and 
group ceo, the company’s auditor nor representatives of the 
company’s senior management were physically present at 
the 2020 agm. information on the decisions of the 2020 agm 
and the minutes are available at www.nordea.com. 
due to the covid-19 pandemic, also the 2021 agm will be 
arranged in accordance with extraordinary meeting proce-
dures pursuant to the temporary legislation at the headquar-
ters of the company on wednesday 24 march 2021.
voting rights
nordea’s articles of association do not contain any provisions 
on share classes or voting rights and consequently all issued 
shares are ordinary shares and carry equal voting rights, with 
each share carrying one vote at general meetings. at general 
meetings, each shareholder is entitled to vote the full number 
of shares that he or she holds or represents. nordea is not 
entitled to vote with its own shares at general meetings in 
accordance with applicable legislation. more information 
about the nordea share is presented in the section “the 
nordea share and ratings” on pages 34-37 and in the “finan-
cial review 2020” on pages 28-29.
articles of association
the articles of association are available at www.nordea.com. 
amendments to the articles of association are resolved by 
the general meeting pursuant to finnish law and are subject 
to the review of the finnish financial supervisory authority.
shareholders’ nomination board (2)
pursuant to the finnish act on credit institutions, a significant 
credit institution shall have a nomination committee that con-
sists of board members or a shareholders’ nomination board 
that consists of members appointed by the shareholders. the 
agm held on 28 march 2019 decided to establish a perma-
nent shareholders’ nomination board and approved the 
charter of the shareholders’ nomination board. a revised 
charter of the shareholders’ nomination board was approved 
by the 2020 agm according to which the shareholders’ nomi-
nation board is to prepare, annually and otherwise when 
appropriate, proposals to the general meeting for the elec-
tion and remuneration of the chair and members of the 
board, and present the proposals at the general meeting. the 
shareholders’ nomination board shall also participate in the 
evaluation and succession planning of the board and in its 
work consider the diversity policy of nordea as well as per-
form certain other tasks assigned in its charter.
 the shareholders’ nomination board comprises the chair 
of the board (torbjörn magnusson) and four members 
appointed by the four largest shareholders in terms of voting 
rights on 31 august 2020, who wish to participate in the 
shareholders’ nomination board. holders of nominee regis-
tered shares are taken into account when determining the 
members.
the composition of the shareholders’ nomination board 
was made public on 18 september 2020. sampo plc had 
appointed ricard wennerklint, nordea-fonden had appointed 
lars ingemann nielsen, alecta had appointed ann grevelius 
and cevian capital ab had appointed niko pakalén as mem-
bers of the shareholders’ nomination board. ricard wenner-
klint had been appointed chairman of the shareholders’ 
nomination board. on 31 august 2020, when determining the 
members of the shareholders' nomination board, the mem-
bers of the shareholders’ nomination board represented  
31.1% of all shares in the company. 
prior to the 2021 agm the shareholders’ nomination board 
constituted in the autumn 2020 held six meetings. each mem-
ber participated in all the meetings and decision-making of 
the shareholders' nomination board apart from torbjörn 
magnusson who did not participate in preparations or deci-
sion-making regarding board remuneration and other mat-
ters in which he was conflicted to participate due to his role 
as chair of the board.

nordea board of directors (3)
the board of the company is charged with the organisation 
of nordea and the administration of the company’s opera-
tions and the overall management of the nordea group’s 
affairs in accordance with the external and internal 
framework. 
composition of the board of directors
according to the articles of association, the board shall con-
sist of not less than six and not more than fifteen members. 
the term of office for board members is one year and expires 
at the end of the agm following the election. nordea has nei-
ther a specific retirement age for board members nor a time 
limit for how long a board member may serve on the board. 
according to the code, the fact that a board member has 
served as a member for more than ten consecutive years shall 
be considered when conducting the overall evaluation of 
independence. further, applicable european regulatory 
requirements of the banking sector are taken into account in 
the evaluation.
the company strives to promote diversity of the members 
of the board with the aim of ensuring that the board, as a 
whole and for the purpose of its work, possesses requisite 
knowledge of and experience in the social, business and cul-
tural conditions of the regions and markets in which the main 
activities of the nordea group are carried out. 
the board has adopted a diversity policy that establishes 
the principles of diversity of the board. according to the 
diversity policy, all board member nominations shall be 
based on merit with the prime consideration being to main-
tain and enhance the board’s overall effectiveness. in order to 
fulfil this, a broad set of qualities and competencies is sought, 
and it is recognised that diversity – including age, gender, 
geographical provenance and educational and professional 
background – is an important factor to consider. nordea’s 
objective is to have a fair, equal and balanced representation 
of different genders and other diversifying factors on the 
board collectively. the board is to have a composition appro-
priate to the company’s operations and phase of develop-
ment and the board members elected by the general meet-
ing are collectively to exhibit diversity and breadth of opin-
ions, qualifications and experience.
during the nomination work before the 2021 agm, the 
chair of the board of the company informed the sharehold-
ers’ nomination board of the competencies and skills needed 
for the board as a whole, and for board members individually. 
the shareholders’ nomination board considered a broad 
range of qualifications and knowledge to ensure sufficient 
expertise and independence, and also strived for equal gen-
der distribution on the board in accordance with the suitabil-
ity policy and the diversity policy of the company.
it is assessed that the board collectively possesses the req-
uisite knowledge and experience in the social, business and 
cultural conditions of the regions and markets in which the 
main activities of nordea and the nordea group are carried 
out, exhibiting adequate diversity and breadth of qualities 
and competencies, and that the gender distribution is well 
balanced. 
the board consists of 13 ordinary members and one depu-
ty member. of these board members, ten (six men and four 
women) were elected by the agm held on 28 may 2020, and 
three ordinary members and one deputy member (three men 
and one woman) were appointed by the employees of the 
nordea group. the board members elected by the 2020 agm 
are torbjörn magnusson (chair), kari jordan (vice chair), 
pernille erenbjerg, nigel hinshelwood, petra van hoeken, 
robin lawther, john maltby, sarah russell, birger steen, and 
jonas synnergren. additionally, maria varsellona was a mem-
ber of the board until the end of the 2020 agm. 
as mentioned above, in addition to the members proposed 
by the shareholders’ nomination board and elected by the 
agm, three ordinary members and one deputy member are 
appointed by the employees of the nordea group as employ-
ee representatives to the board. the term of office for the 
employee representatives is one year. the employee repre-
sentatives until the end of the 2021 agm are kari ahola, dorrit 
groth brandt, gerhard olsson and hans christian riise (depu-
ty member). the appointment procedure for the employee 
representatives to the board deviates from recommendation 
5 “election of the board of directors” of the code. the reason 
for this deviation is that at nordea, employee representation 
is based on an agreement between nordea and an employee 
representative body, which was entered into under the finn-
ish act on employee involvement in european companies 
and european social cooperatives as well as the finnish act 
on personnel representation in the company administration 
in connection with the cross-border merger effectuating the 
re-domiciliation to finland in 2018.
the president and group ceo of nordea is not a member 
of the board. the composition of the board is set out in the 
table on page 52 and further information regarding the board 
members elected by the agm and the employee representa-
tives is presented in the sections “board of directors” and 
“employee representatives” on pages 284-285.
independence of the board of directors
nordea complies with applicable requirements regarding the 
independence of the board according to applicable european 
regulatory requirements and finnish laws and regulations as 
well as requirements according to the code. the board con-
siders all the members elected by the shareholders at the 
2020 annual general meeting to be independent of the com-
pany according to the code, including sarah russell who has 
been board member of the company and its legal predeces-
sors for over 10 consecutive years. based on an overall evalua-
tion, her independence is not compromised due to her long 
service history, and no other factors or circumstances have 
been identified that could impair her independence. no board 
member elected by the shareholders at the 2020 agm is 
employed by or works in an operative capacity at the 
company. 
the ordinary board members and the deputy board mem-
ber appointed by the employees are employed by the nordea 
group and are therefore not independent of the company 
according to the code.
all board members, except for torbjörn magnusson, are 
furthermore independent in relation to the company’s signifi-
cant shareholders according to the code. torbjörn magnus-
son was during 2020 managing director of sampo plc and 
group ceo and president of sampo group. as sampo plc 
owns more than 10 per cent of all shares in the company, tor-
björn magnusson is thus not considered independent of the 
company’s significant shareholders.
50
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
corporate governance statement 2020
according to the code, the majority of the board members 
shall be independent of the company, and at least two board 
members who are independent of the company shall also be 
independent of the significant shareholders of the company. 
thus, the number of board members independent in relation 
to the company and independent in relation to the compa-
ny’s significant shareholders, exceeds the minimum require-
ments of the code. 
the independence of each board member is also shown in 
the table on page 52.
the work of the board of directors
the board elects the vice chair and appoints the members of 
the board committees. the board has adopted written work 
procedures governing its work that also set forth the man-
agement and risk reporting to the board (the “charter”) and 
separate work procedures for its work carried out in each of 
the board committees (the “committee charters”). for exam-
ple, the charter sets forth the board’s and the chair’s respec-
tive areas of responsibility, documentation and quorum as 
well as the frequency of meetings. it also contains rules 
regarding conflicts of interest, confidentiality and the board 
secretary (currently jussi koskinen, chief legal officer).
the board is charged with the organisation of nordea and 
the administration of the company’s operations and the over-
all management of the nordea group’s affairs in accordance 
with the external and internal framework and its charter. the 
board shall ensure that nordea’s legal and organisational 
structure is appropriate and transparent with a clear alloca-
tion of functions and areas of responsibility that ensure sound 
and efficient governance, avoids the creation of complex 
structures and enables supervisors to conduct efficient 
supervision. 
the board regularly follows up on nordea’s strategy, busi-
ness development as well as the company's financial position 
and the performance of the financial market. furthermore, 
the board regularly updates the policies and internal rules for 
the governance and control on which it has decided. the 
board is also reviewing the risk appetite and regularly follows 
up on the development of relevant risks, capital and liquidity. 
significant organisational changes, certain senior manage-
ment appointment as well as mergers and acquisitions and 
other resolutions of significance are other matters dealt with 
by the board. in 2020 the board dealt extensively with various 
aspects related to the pandemic caused by covid-19. addi-
tionally, the board handled matters related to digitalisation, 
internal control and compliance, financial crime as well vari-
ous remediation and implementation programmes.
furthermore, the board shall ensure that the company’s 
organisation in respect of accounting, management of funds 
and the company’s financial position in general includes sat-
isfactory controls. the board is ultimately responsible for 
ensuring that an adequate and effective system of internal 
control is established and maintained. group internal audit 
(“gia”) annually provides the board with an assessment of 
the overall effectiveness of governance and the risk and con-
trol framework, together with an analysis of themes and 
trends emerging from internal audit work and their impact on 
the organisation’s risk profile. further information regarding 
internal control at nordea is provided on pages 53-55 under 
“internal control framework”.
the board regularly meets the external auditor and regu-
larly considers the need for such meetings without the pres-
ence of the president and group ceo or any other member of 
the group leadership team (“glt”). in addition, the auditor 
in charge regularly attends the meetings of the board audit 
committee.
in 2020 the board of the company held 16 meetings, six of 
which were held as per capsulam meetings. for more infor-
mation see the table on page 52.
chair
the chair of the board is elected by the shareholders at the 
general meeting. the board meets according to its annual 
meeting schedule and as necessary. the chair is to ensure 
that the board’s work is conducted efficiently and that the 
board fulfils its duties. the chair is to organise and lead the 
board’s work, maintain regular contact with the president 
and group ceo, ensure that the board receives sufficient 
information and documentation and ensure that the work of 
the board is evaluated annually, and that the shareholders’ 
nomination board is informed of the result of the evaluation.
evaluation of the board
the board annually conducts a self-evaluation process, 
through which the performance and the work of the board is 
evaluated for the purpose of continuously improving the 
board work. the evaluation is based on methodology that 
includes questionnaires to evaluate the board as a whole, the 
chair and individual board members. the result of the self-
evaluation process is further discussed by the board and pre-
sented to the shareholders’ nomination board by the chair of 
the board.
in accordance with applicable european regulatory 
requirements, a suitability assessment of the members of the 
board individually and of the board as a whole is completed 
annually and in connection with the selection process for new 
board members.
board committees 
in accordance with the external framework and in order to 
increase the effectiveness of the board work, the board has 
established separate working committees to assist the board 
in preparing matters, belonging to the competence of the 
board and to decide in matters delegated by the board. the 
duties of the board committees, as well as working proce-
dures, are defined in the committee charters. in general, the 
board committees do not have autonomous decision-making 
powers and each committee regularly reports on its work to 
the board. nordea follows the legal requirements and com-
plies with the code in respect of board committees.
the board audit committee (4)
the board audit committee (“bac”) assists the board in ful-
filling its oversight responsibilities, for instance by monitoring 
the nordea group’s financial reporting process and system, 
and providing recommendations or proposals to ensure their 
reliability (including efficiency of the internal control and risk 
management systems), monitoring the effectiveness of gia, 
keeping itself informed as to the statutory audit of the annual 
and consolidated accounts, and by reviewing and monitoring 
the impartiality and independence of the external auditors, 
including the offering of services other than auditing services 
by the auditors, prepares a recommendation of appointment 
of the company's auditor, as well as by taking care of the 
responsibilities of the audit committee pursuant to applicable 
legal requirements. the bac also assists the board in moni-
toring and assessing how related party transactions meet the 
requirements of ordinary activities and arm’s-length terms. 
further information is presented in the separate section “prin-
ciples for related party transactions”.

framework. in addition, the bric reviews and makes recom-
mendations regarding the group’s risk appetite and market

1) according to the code a significant shareholder is a shareholder who holds at least 10% of all company shares or the votes carried by all the shares, or who has the right or obligation 
to acquire the corresponding number of already issued shares. for additional information, see independence of the board of directors on page 49. 
and he is also responsible for developing and maintaining 
effective systems for reporting and internal control within the 
group. in line with applicable regulations, the company has a 
deputy managing director. further information about the 
control environment for risk exposures is presented in note 
g2, “risk and liquidity management”, on pages 102-135. 
the president and group ceo works together with certain 
senior officers within the group in the glt. these senior offi-
cers being glt members report to the president and group 
ceo. the glt supports the president and group ceo in man-
aging the company and the glt members, apart from the 
president and group ceo, are responsible for management of 
their respective business area’s or group function’s perfor-
mance, operations, risks and resources and for the develop-
ment of the business area or group function in the best inter-
ests of nordea, and in compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. 
the glt meets regularly and whenever necessary at the 
request of the president and group ceo. these meetings are 
chaired by the president and group ceo, who reaches deci-
sions after consulting with the other members of glt. notes of 
meetings, verified by the president and group ceo, are kept. 
at the end of 2020 the glt members were: frank vang-

internal control framework 
the board is responsible for setting and overseeing an ade-
quate and effective internal control framework. the internal 
control framework includes the control functions and the risk 
management framework and covers the whole nordea group.
the internal control framework is designed to ensure 
effective and efficient operations, adequate identification, 
measurement and mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of 
business, sound administrative and accounting procedures, 
reliability of financial and non-financial information reported 
or disclosed (both internally and externally) and that compli-
ance risk is effectively managed. the internal control process 
is carried out by the board and the president and group ceo 
together with senior management, the control functions and 
other staff at nordea. 
the internal control process aims to create the necessary 
fundamentals for the entire organisation to contribute to the 
effectiveness and high quality of internal control through, for 
instance, clear definitions, assignments of roles and responsi-
bilities and common tools and procedures. roles and respon-
sibilities with respect to internal control and risk management 
are divided into three lines of defence. according to the 
group board directive on internal governance the first line of 
defence refers to all units and employees that are neither in 
the second nor the third line of defence.
in the first line of defence, the business organisation and 
group corporate functions are risk owners, and thus respon-
sible for conducting their business within risk exposure limits 
and the risk appetite and in accordance with the internal 
control framework. 
the second line of defence consists of group risk and 
compliance (“grc”), which is responsible for maintaining 
and monitoring the implementation of the risk management 
framework as a fundamental part of the internal control 
framework. to ensure effective risk management grc has 
access to all business lines and other internal units that have 
the potential to generate risk, as well as to relevant subsidiar-
ies and branches, and outsourced activities.
gia, which is the third line of defence, performs audits and 
provides the board with an assessment of the overall effec-
tiveness of the governance and risk and control framework, 
together with an analysis of themes and trends emerging 
from internal audit work and their impact on the organisa-
tion’s risk profile.
group risk and compliance (9)
grc comprises the independent risk and compliance func-
tions and is structured to carry out risk monitoring and con-
trol in line with nordea’s internal control framework. as a 
second line of defence, the control functions are responsible 
for maintaining the risk management framework, as part of 
the internal control framework, and for monitoring the 
implementation of the policies and procedures within this 
framework. the risk function oversees the implementation 
of the financial and the non-financial risk policies and accord-
ing to a risk-based approach, monitors and controls the risk 
management framework and shall among other things 
ensure that all risks to which nordea is or could become 
exposed are identified, assessed, monitored, managed and 
reported. the chief risk officer (“cro”), who is also a mem-
ber of the glt, has overall responsibility of grc and reports 
to the president and group ceo. the cro is appointed, sus-
pended or dismissed by decision of the board, after prior con-
sultation with the president and group ceo. the cro regu-
larly reports to bric and the board on nordea group’s risk 
exposure.
group compliance is responsible for creating a compliance 
risk management framework that ensures compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations, standards, supervisory require-
ments and related internal rules, as well as providing training, 
advice, monitoring and ensuring compliance matters are ade-
quately communicated and adhered to by management. 
group compliance is responsible for identifying compliance 
risks and performing monitoring and control to ensure that 
the risks are managed by the relevant functions. group com-
pliance activities shall be decided and conducted according 
to a risk-based approach. the compliance function is headed 
by the cco (head of group compliance). the cco has a 
functional reporting line to the cro. the cco is appointed, 
suspended, or dismissed by decision of the board, after prior 
consultation with the president and group ceo.
the responsibilities and mandates of grc are described in 
more detail in the “group board directive for the second line 
of defence risk function” and in the “group board directive on 
group compliance”.
group internal audit (10)
gia is an independent function commissioned by the board. 
the bac is responsible for guidance on and evaluation of gia 
within the nordea group. the cae has the overall responsi-
bility for gia. the cae reports on a functional basis to the 
board and the bac and reports on an administrative basis to 
the president and group ceo. the board approves the 
appointment and dismissal of the cae and decides, by pro-
posal of the brc, on salary and other employment terms and 
conditions for the cae.
the purpose of gia is to support the board and glt in pro-
tecting the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organ-
isation. gia does this by assessing whether all significant risks 
are identified and appropriately reported by management 
and the risk functions to the board, its committees and the 
glt, by assessing whether all significant risks are adequately 
controlled and by challenging the glt to improve the effec-
tiveness of governance, risk management and internal con-
trols. gia does not engage in consulting activities unless oth-
erwise instructed by the bac.
all activities and entities of the group fall within the scope 
of gia. gia makes a risk-based decision as to which areas 
within its scope should be included in the audit plan 
approved by the board.
gia shall operate free from interference in determining the 
scope of internal auditing, in performing its audit work and in 
communicating its results. this means for example that gia, 
via the cae, is authorised to inform the financial supervisory 
authorities of any matter without further approval. the cae 
has unrestricted access to the president and group ceo and 
the chair of the bac, and should meet with the chair of the 
bac informally and formally throughout the year, including 
without the presence of executive management. gia is 
 authorised to conduct all investigations and obtain all infor-
mation required to discharge its duties. this includes the right 
54
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
corporate governance statement 2020
to sufficient and timely access to the organisation’s records, 
systems, premises and staff. gia has the right to attend and 
observe board committees, glt, overall committees and for 
the nordea group and other key management decision-mak-
ing fora when relevant and necessary.
external audit (11)
according to the articles of association, the auditor of the 
company shall be an audit firm with the auditor-in-charge 
being an authorised public accountant ("apa"). the term of 
office for the auditor expires at the end of the agm following 
the election. the current auditor of the company is pricewa-
terhousecoopers oy. jukka paunonen, apa, was the auditor 
in charge as of the 2020 agm.
further information about the fees paid for audit services 
and non-audit services is presented in note g9 on page 149.
report on internal control and risk management 
regarding financial reporting
the systems for internal control and risk management of 
financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assur-
ance about the reliability of financial reporting and the prepa-
ration of financial statements for external purposes in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles, appli-
cable laws and regulations, and other requirements for listed 
companies. the internal control and risk management activi-
ties are included in nordea’s planning and resource allocation 
processes. internal control and risk management of financial 
reporting at nordea can be described as follows below.
control environment
the control environment is comprised of nordea’s internal 
controls and centres around the culture and values estab-
lished by the board and glt and the organisational structure, 
with clear roles and responsibilities. 
nordea’s organisational structure aims to support the over-
all strategy, ensuring business momentum and meeting 
requirements on capital and liquidity. 
the primary governance principle is the adherence to the 
three lines of defence model which provides a foundation for 
a clear division of roles and responsibilities in the organisa-
tion. for further information about the three lines of defence, 
see “internal control framework”.
clear roles and responsibilities are crucial in the governance 
of internal control over financial reporting (“icfr”). the first 
line of defence is responsible for the daily risk management 
and for compliance with applicable rules. risk owners in the 
business areas and group functions are responsible for risk 
management activities. a central function supports the cfo in 
defining standards that apply to relevant controls group wide. 
these controls are implemented and maintained within signifi-
cant processes and monitored by quarterly self-assessments. 
the grc, in the second line of defence, is responsible for moni-
toring the implementation of icfr framework.
risk assessment
risk assessment in relation to reliable financial reporting 
involves the identification and assessment of risks of material 
misstatements or deficiencies. financial reporting risk 
(“frr”) is defined as the risk of misstatements or deficiencies 
in financial reporting, regulatory reporting and disclosures.
risk management is considered to be an integral part of run-
ning the business and the main responsibility for performing 
risk assessments regarding financial reporting risks sits with 
the business organisation. performing risk assessments close to 
the business increases the possibility of identifying the most 
relevant risks. in order to govern the quality, control functions 
stipulate in governing documents when and how these assess-
ments should be performed. examples of risk assessments are 
the reoccurring risk and control self-assessments and the 
event-driven change risk management and approval process.
control activities
the scope of the icfr framework is designed to focus on 
areas where risk of material financial misstatements could 
exist, i.e. where the judgment of a reasonable person relying 
upon the report would have been changed or influenced by 
the inclusion or correction of the misstated item. 
business areas and group functions are primarily respon-
sible for managing risks associated with the units’ operations 
and financial reporting processes. entity wide controls 
(“ewc’s”) are directive measures and governance bodies in 
place to set the standards for internal control, such as the 
group accounting manual, financial control principles and 
the group valuation committee. the group accounting manu-
al (“gam”) holds information on the accounting policies to be 
used in the group and contains detailed reporting instructions 
and the tools needed for producing the financial statements. 
the icfr control structure is based on transaction level 
controls (“tlc”) that are identified by analysing risks based 
on high level processes with an end-to-end product focus. 
after deciding on the tlcs an analysis is performed to deter-
mine which systems/applications are relied on in financial re-
porting, including the it general controls. 
the quality assurance achieved through the management 
reporting process, where a detailed analysis of the financial 
outcome is performed, constitutes an important control 
mechanism associated with the reporting process.
information and communication
group finance ("gf") is responsible for ensuring that the 
gam and the financial control principles are up to date and 
that changes are communicated to the responsible units. 
these directive measures are supported by detailed guide-
lines and standard operating procedures in the responsible 
units. 
management at different levels in the organisation are pro-
vided with information related to the performance and 
assessment of the identified key controls and details on the 
outcome of the self-assessment of controls in their process. 
nordea interacts with relevant subject-matter experts 
externally to keep up to date with changes in reporting 
expectations and ensure fulfilment of financial reporting 
objectives. nordea actively participates in relevant national 
and international forums, such as those established by the 
financial supervisory authorities, central banks and associa-
tions for financial institutions.
monitoring
nordea has established a process for regular self-assessment 
of internal controls with the purpose of ensuring proper mon-
itoring of the quality of the financial reporting. the group 
cfo reports specifically on self-assessment outcomes, and 
other activities related to the management of financial 
reporting risks to the bac on a quarterly basis. 
an independent risk control function resides in the second 
line of defence and is responsible for identifying, controlling 
and reporting on financial reporting risks. in addition, gia 
provides the board with an assessment of the overall effec-
tiveness of the governance, risk management and control 
processes throughout the organisation, including financial 
reporting.
the board, bac, bric, bosc, grc and gia have important 
roles in respect of governance and oversight of the internal

risk and compliance (9)" and “group internal audit (10)” in 
the previous pages.
insider administration
insider administration is organised according to the applica-
ble eu and national level laws and regulations. the board has 
approved groupwide rules and guidelines to provide clear 
instructions for employees to facilitate their compliance with 
the rules applicable to ensure that inside information is iden-
tified and handled appropriately.
insiders are identified on a case-by-case basis whenever 
inside information is detected and are subsequently regis-
tered on a related insider register and notified of their insider 
status. all identified insiders are then prohibited from dealing 
in the financial instrument(s) to which the inside information 
relates, until that information is made public or otherwise no 
longer deemed inside information, and the insider register is 
closed. nordea does not maintain a permanent insider regis-
ter under the eu market abuse regulation no 596/2014 
(“mar”). 
the company has also identified members of the board 
and glt as well as the cae as persons discharging manage-
rial responsibilities (as defined by mar) who, along with per-
sons closely associated with them, are required to notify the 
company and the relevant financial supervisory authority of 
any transaction in financial instruments issued by nordea 
executed on their account or on their behalf. the company 
publishes such reported transactions to the market through 
stock exchange releases.
in addition to this reporting duty, persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities are prohibited from trading in 
financial instruments issued by nordea during a period of 30 
calendar days before (and including) the date of the publica-
tion of a nordea group interim financial report, half-year 
report or a year-end report, as well as whenever such per-
sons are in possession of inside information about nordea.

services or advice to clients, the company also applies group-

wide internal trading restrictions and transaction reporting 
obligations that are based on the trading rules established by, 
inter alia, finance finland, the swedish securities dealers 
association and the swedish investment fund association. 
furthermore, in the capacity of a company licensed to provide 
investment services and as a fund management company, the 
company and its subsidiary nordea funds ltd, respectively, 
maintain insider registers of persons who are classified as 
“public insiders” pursuant to the finnish act on investment 
services and the finnish act on mutual funds. the holdings 
of such persons in securities listed in finland are public infor-
mation and uploaded to the public insider register kept by 
euroclear finland oy. the register of holders of units in funds 
managed by nordea funds ltd is also available for viewing at 
nordea funds ltd.
the responsibilities of nordea’s insider administration 
include training of and providing information to employees 
who are exposed to inside information, to make sure they are 
aware of the restrictions and obligations placed on insiders, 
setting up and maintaining insider registers, as well as moni-
toring compliance with the insider rules. the rules are put in 
place to mitigate the risk of insider dealing and other forms of 
market abuse, and the overall responsibility for making sure 
that a high level of knowledge of and compliance with these 
rules is maintained is held by group compliance.
principles for related party transactions
applicable laws and regulations set requirements for moni-
toring, assessment, and decision-making concerning related 
party transactions as well as for the disclosure of executed 
related party transactions.
generally, the company’s transactions with its related par-
ties are part of the company’s ordinary course of business 
and carried out on the same criteria and terms as those of 
comparable transactions with other parties of similar stand-
ing. the decision-making processes have furthermore been 
structured in order to avoid conflict of interests and to comply 
with the statutory decision-making requirements.
the company has defined its related parties in accordance 
with the applicable laws and regulations and keeps an up-to-
date record of its related parties. relevant internal stakehold-
ers, such as client responsible units and other relevant busi-
ness units and group functions, are informed of the list of 
related parties and thereto related restrictions, in order to 
monitor transactions with such parties. 
nordea is also bound by applicable close circle rules and 
has processes in place for identifying the persons belonging 
to the close circle of nordea and ensuring that credits and 
comparable financing granted to such persons, as well as any 
investments into an entity belonging to the close circle, are in 
accordance with applicable laws and rules.
pursuant to the company’s conflict of interest policy, 
nordea’s employees, management and members of the 
board may not handle matters on behalf of nordea in cases 
where he/she or a closely associated person or company may 
have an interest that conflicts with the interests of nordea or 
its customers. nordea’s business areas and group functions 
are obliged to identify, prevent and manage actual and 
potential conflicts of interests.
the board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring 
proper processes for the identification, reporting, and super-
vision of related party transactions as well as the proper deci-
sion making related thereto. the bac shall assist the board in 
respect of monitoring and assessing how related party trans-
actions meet the requirements of ordinary activities and 
arm’s-length terms.
related party transactions that are not part of the com-
pany’s ordinary course of business or are made in deviation 
from customary commercial terms require a decision of the 
board to carry out the related party transaction, unless 
required otherwise based on applicable laws and regulations. 
in respect of such related party transactions the board must 
ensure that: (i) the relevant transactions have been appropri-
ately identified, reported, and controlled (ii) the preparation 
and decision making have carefully considered the conflict of 
interest policy; and (iii) the preparation of related party trans-
actions contain adequate reports, statements, and/or assess-
ments. furthermore, nordea publicly discloses its related 
party transactions, in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations.
further information about related party transactions is pre-
sented in note g1 on page 101 and note g45 on page 192.

board of directors’ report
nordea annual report 2020 
non-financial statement
this report constitutes nordea’s non-financial statement for the financial year 2020.  
the report covers the parent company nordea bank abp and its subsidiaries.
in 2020, nordea was present in 22 countries, including our 
four nordic home markets – denmark, finland, norway and 
sweden. through our four business areas – personal bank-
ing, business banking, large corporates & institutions and 
asset & wealth management – we offer a wide range of 
products and services. 
as a financial institution, our business model is to create 
value for our customers, investors, employees, shareholders 
and society in general. for a sustainable business model to 
succeed, value cannot only include monetary means, but 
must encompass environmental concern, social responsibility, 
employee-related matters, respect for human rights and 
anti-corruption. 
we believe we can do this through sustainable banking. as 
a leading bank, with a wide spectrum of customers and val-
ues deeply rooted in the nordics, we recognise that we have a 
key role to play in the transition to a resilient economy. this 
entails mitigating environmental, social and governance 
("esg") risks by embedding sustainability throughout the 
bank, into our products and processes in our core areas of 
financing, investment and advice, and in our internal opera-
tions. it also entails inspiring and enabling our customers to 
make sustainable choices. 
material sustainability topics and targets
as a member of the core group of founding banks and a sig-
natory to the principles for responsible banking, nordea is 
committed to the objectives of the paris agreement and the 
un sustainable development goals. 
we have developed a long-term plan to fully integrate sus-
tainability into our business strategy focusing on the sustain-
ability topics where nordea can have a material impact, 
either through reducing our negative impact or increasing our 
positive impact. the material topics were identified through a 
combined materiality and impact analysis conducted in 2020. 
the analysis considered all of nordea, which means all busi-
ness areas, all products and services as well as internal oper-
ations. the identified material topics were grouped into four 
strategic pillars: financial strength, climate action, social 
responsibility, and governance and culture. these are con-
nected to targets for 2023 and the climate action pillar also to 
long-term objectives. the targets and objectives were 
approved by the president and group ceo in the group lead-
ership team ("glt") in november 2020 and by the board of 
directors (the "board") in december 2020.
the short-term targets we set for 2020 were a continuation 
of the targets for 2019, focusing on aligning both with the 
paris agreement but with an even clearer focus on granular-
ity and measurability. most of the targets for 2019 and 2020 
have been fulfilled now. those that were not have been inte-
grated with the new targets and objectives. 
financial strength
managing esg-related risk is key to maintaining our financial 
strength. in response to the heightened supervisory and regu-
latory expectations on esg, a group-wide task force was 
established in june 2020 with the objective to assess how to 
comply with the ecb’s guide on climate-related and envi-
ronmental risks and to address any required developments. 
the outcome of this work was presented to the risk commit-
tee ("rc"), the business ethics and values committee 
("bevc"), the glt, and the board risk committee ("bric"). 
this included a high-level five-year action plan to remediate 
identified gaps through clear allocation of roles and responsi-
bilities across the three lines of defence and a proposal for a 
steady-state esg-related risk governance. 
strategic management of esg-related risks
we define esg risk as the risk of negative financial impact 
over the short to longer term, stemming from the direct or 
indirect impact that environmental (including climate), social 
and governance issues may have on nordea. these issues 
relate either to nordea’s internal operations (such as process-
es, people, systems and the functions supporting nordea’s 
internal operations such as outsourcing) or to its financial 
exposures such as issues relating to trading positions, the 
operations of nordea’s customers (including borrowers and 
trading counterparties) and those of the companies that 
nordea has invested in.
consequently, nordea considers esg factors as drivers of 
existing risk categories and will further incorporate them into 
existing risk management frameworks taking a proportionate 
and risk-based approach. recent efforts have focused on inte-
grating climate-related risks in the credit risk framework 
while integration to other financial risk frameworks is planned 
to start in 2021. 
managing esg-related risk in relation to our customers
in relation to our customers, nordea’s code of conduct is the 
central steering document for our financing operations 
together with our principles on esg in financing, investing 
and advice in our sustainability policy. 
the esg evaluation of large corporate borrowers is cur-
rently integrated into the credit process through the credit 
risk framework. there are different types of esg evaluations 
performed depending on the type and size of the transaction 
and the customer’s internal segmentation. in the needs analy-
sis stage of the credit process for large corporates & institu-
tions, the customer responsible unit is responsible for the cus-
tomer dialogue and for performing the initial credit risk 
screening of the customer. they must adhere to the guiding 
parameters and requirements for esg in our industry-specific 
credit policies. esg-related risks identified in the esg evalua-
tion process are integrated into the credit risk assessment. a 
credit memorandum is produced, which contains a conclusion 
on the level of esg-related risk associated with the customer. 
approval follows the established credit decision-making pro-
cess. for customers classified as having high esg-related risk, 
the decision is escalated to the executive credit committee. 
in 2021, the credit risk framework will be updated to 
address regulatory requirements and supervisory expecta-
tions on the integration of climate and environmental factors 
in customer onboarding, evaluation and monitoring 
processes.
for household customers seeking mortgage funding, ener-
gy efficiency labels are increasingly one of the factors consid-
ered in credit decision-making.
esg-related risk identification and materiality assessment
in 2020, the materiality assessment for esg-related risks 
associated with financial exposures focused on the impact of 
physical and transitional climate change factors on our corpo-
rate loan portfolio. the assessment concluded that climate-
related risks are material to our credit risk profile. we will 
therefore manage esg-related risks in line with internal rules 
for all material risk types. by the end of 2023 we shall have 
risk assessments in place for the sectors and customers most 
vulnerable to climate risk. 
58
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
the assessment of physical impacts of climate change was 
qualitative. for transitional impacts, stress testing was used 
by introducing uniform increases in the greenhouse gas emis-
sions tax over a period of three years. the tax was applied as 
an increased cost to corporate borrowers using sector aver-
age statistics sourced from eurostat for the intensity of emis-
sions from fuel combustion.
norwegian mortgage pilot
in 2020, we piloted physical risk identification for our norwe-
gian mortgage portfolio. the exercise highlighted the number 
of properties and total value of collateral exposures in the 
locations most vulnerable to flooding and risk of landslide. 
out of the assessed mortgage portfolio, the largest concen-
trations of exposed collaterals were in zones at low risk of 
landslide (26.4%), in flood zones with a 1,000-year return 
interval (17.8%), in flood zones with 200-year return intervals 
(11.4%) and in zones at high risk of landslide (4.1%). currently, 
damage from these hazards is covered by insurance in nor-
way. recognising that property valuations may be impacted 
by market perception of heightened physical risk, we are con-
sidering proactive mitigation measures as a next step. due to 
the materiality of mortgage exposures at group level, a work-
ing group was established to support nordea’s four mortgage 
banks in collecting and utilising comparable data for assess-
ment of the physical and transitional impacts of climate 
change on collateral valuations. 
physical risk heatmapping
in 2020, we participated in phase ii of the un environmental 
programme finance initiative (unep fi) tcfd (task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures) banking pilot. leverag-
ing on that participation, we adopted a bespoke method to 
classify sectors most vulnerable to physical hazards in our 
four home markets. the method has been scientifically 
reviewed from a climatological perspective in terms of its 
geographical applicability by the swedish meteorological and 
hydrological institute (smhi). according to our classification, 
sectors vulnerable to physical hazards include animal hus-
bandry, paper and forest products, oil, gas and offshore, fish-
ing and aquaculture, materials, retail trade, mining and sup-
porting activities, power production, accommodation and lei-
sure and land transportation. the analysis considers also the 
vulnerability of mortgage exposures to physical hazards 
based on geographical location. the method will potentially 
guide more granular assessments and initiation of proactive 
mitigation measures.
transition risk classification 
in 2020, a bespoke approach was developed to classify eco-
nomic activities according to their impact on the climate, 
accounting both for business models that are resilient and 
those that are vulnerable to market and policy changes in the 
nordic market. according to our classification, sectors likely 
to be impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy 
include oil, gas and offshore, animal husbandry, shipping, 
land transportation, utilities, distribution and waste manage-
ment, materials, mining and supporting activities, capital 
goods, power production and construction. subject to further 
development and testing, the classification will be integrated 
into the credit risk framework and processes in 2021.
integrating climate risk in investment decision-making
in 2020, nordea life & pension ("nlp") further advanced its 
models and capabilities for assessing and integrating climate 
risk into its investment decision-making and risk manage-
ment processes. for listed equity and corporate debt expo-
sures, nlp uses the msci climate value at risk ("cvar")1 
methodology to assess both transition (policy) and physical 
risks in various climate scenarios. as at the end of 2020, nlp’s 
total listed equity exposure, measured against a 1.5ºc trajec-
tory, had a policy risk cvar of -12% and a physical risk cvar 
of -7.9%. for corporate debt exposure, the cvar results were 
-3.5% for policy risk and -0.7% for physical risk. in the real 
estate portfolios, nlp uses the carbon risk real estate moni-
tor ("crrem") to assess the risk of stranded assets from a 
transition to a low-carbon economy. nlp is a member of 
crrem’s european investor committee and has been 
involved in developing the model. during 2020, nlp made an 
initial assessment of the swedish and finnish real estate 
portfolios using crrem’s methodology and 1.5ºc decarboni-
sation pathways on end-of-year 2019 data. the assessment 
showed an aggregated carbon value at risk of +0.4% and 
-0.6% respectively with the majority of buildings in both port-
folios aligned with a 1.5ºc trajectory up to 2030. 
climate action
our climate action agenda is acting in line with our plan to 
deliver on our targets and enable our customers to choose 
sustainable solutions. as such, our objectives for our business 
are to achieve net zero emissions by the end of 2050 at the 
latest and to reduce carbon emissions from our lending and 
investment portfolios by 40-50% by the end of 2030 com-
pared to 2019. to support our target setting and to deliver on 
our long-term objectives we joined the partnership for car-
bon accounting financials ("pcaf") in december 2020 and 
have accordingly measured our financed emissions on busi-
ness loans, listed equity, corporate fixed income and commer-
cial real estate investment asset classes. 
policies and guidelines
our commitments in relation to climate change are described 
in our position statement on climate change. it states, among 
other things, our position in relation to thermal coal, coal min-
ing and extraction of oil sands. in addition, we have several 
sector guidelines addressing the climate issue. in 2020, we 
updated our sector guidelines for the fossil fuels industry to 
allow for heightening demands on our climate work. these 
guidelines set out our expectations on customers and invest-
ee companies in the fossil fuels industry in terms of their 
commitment to fulfilling the objectives of the paris agree-
ment and investing in and working towards the necessary 
energy transition. among other things, the guidelines now 
explicitly states that we do not provide project financing dedi-
cated to the extraction of unconventional oil and gas.
during the year, nordea asset management ("nam") pub-
lished a policy relating to fossil fuel for the sustainability-
enhanced funds, requiring all fossil fuel companies to demon-
strate that they have a decarbonisation strategy that is con-
sistent with 2 degrees global warming or lower. these 
companies are put on the paris-aligned fossil fuel list and 
are eligible for inclusion in any of nordea’s sustainability-
enhanced funds. companies that are not on the list are 
excluded from such funds.
internal carbon footprint
although nordea’s greatest impact on climate is through 
financing and investments, we also work with reducing cli-
mate impact from our internal operations. our 2030 objective 
is to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by 
more than 50% compared to 2019, and with a 30% reduction 
by the end of 2023. already in 2019 we reduced our carbon

footprint, despite an increase in scope in 2019 to also include 
postal services, paper and water. following this reduction, our 
total emissions of 15,898 tonnes co2e2 in 2020 marked a 62% 
reduction from 2019, even though waste was added to the 
scope in 2020. the reduction in carbon emissions was mainly 
due to nordea’s travel policy in response to the covid-19 
pandemic.
social responsibility
social responsibility is about taking sustainability issues such 
as human rights, labour rights, employment, gender equality 
and education into consideration throughout our entire value 
chain.
human rights
human rights are included in our code of conduct, sustain-
ability policy, responsible investment policy, supplier code of 
conduct and in our sector guidelines as relevant for specific 
industries. to ensure adequate awareness of human rights as 
included in our ethical principles, all nordea employees are 
required to complete annual code of conduct training as part 
of their licence to work. at nordea, we address human rights 
in all parts of the organisation and due diligence processes. 
we have identified our most critical areas in terms of human 
rights as being within investing, financing, transactions and 
sourcing. 
the esg assessments included in our investment and 
financing decision-making processes include human and 
labour rights, as does the norm-based screening of all nordea 
funds. as per december 2020, we have 10 companies on our 
exclusion list due to violations of human rights-related norms, 
including norms violation of the rights of indigenous peoples. 
from a financing perspective, identified adverse human rights 
violations might affect a customer’s credit assessment.
human rights is one perspective taken into account when 
monitoring customer transactions for a wide range of behav-
iours that can be indicative of potential financial crime risk. 
individual transaction behaviour and monitoring scenarios 
such as transactions with certain high-risk jurisdictions or 
indications of funnel account behaviour can relate to many 
types of financial and predicate crime including modern slav-
ery and human trafficking. 
from a sourcing perspective, in 2020 we performed a pre-
liminary assessment of the human rights risk picture of 
nordea’s supply chain based on country, sector and actual 
spend. the assessment revealed that 92% of our spend is 
placed in countries and sectors at low risk of human rights 
breaches. in 2021 onwards we will deep-dive into high-risk 
areas like modern slavery and conflict minerals, via engage-
ment and collaboration with stakeholders. we have set a tar-
get, that by 2023, we will have a human rights impact assess-
ment of our supply chain in place, where high-risk areas are 
identified and where appropriate actions have been taken to 
mitigate and manage these.
inclusive work environment
our ambition is to ensure that equality, being a fundamental 
human right, is embedded in our business and operation. this 
means that we work to ensure equal opportunities for all our 
people and that we offer a safe and inclusive workplace 
where all people are respected and can thrive and contribute 
to the development of nordea. 
our ambition is to strive for gender balance in all parts of 
the organisation, in the total workforce as well as on every 
leadership level. during 2020, we have succeeded in main-
taining the gender balance in the total workforce with 49% 
women (49%) and 51% (51%) men. in the glt, the gender 
balance has improved to 36% (22%) women and 64% (78%) 
men during 2020. four out of the five latest glt appoint-
ments have been female. to further improve the gender bal-
ance at all senior manager levels, we are actively working to 
improve the balance in succession pipelines and when 
recruiting.
we have a broad definition of diversity and aim to attract 
and retain people of different gender, gender identity, age, 
ethnicity and national backgrounds, cultural affiliation, sexual 
orientation, physical ability and other aspects. our diversity 
and inclusion committee was established to discuss, monitor 
and influence the overall strategic direction and key efforts 
within the area of diversity and inclusion across nordea and 
ensure anchoring in top executive management. we have 
also embedded bias awareness in leadership programmes to 
counter potential biases in people-related decisions and train-
ing activities that will continue to support our diversity and 
inclusion efforts. 
nordea is committed to ensure that all employees are sub-
ject to fair and unbiased remuneration decisions. we analyse 
annually potential equal pay gaps, and we continue to sup-
port people leaders through communication and training to 
mitigate risk of discrimination in remuneration or other 
employment terms.
at nordea we condemn all forms of discrimination. we 
have zero tolerance for any form of harassment, bullying or 
victimisation. in 2020, 1% (2%) of the respondents to our peo-
ple pulse survey stated that they have been subjected to 
some sort of harassment or other mistreatment. we are 
happy to see that the number of incidents has decreased 
since 2019 and understand that our ongoing work with proac-
tive measures to ensure safe and inclusive workplaces makes 
a difference and needs to continue. in 2020, 10 (28) harass-
ment cases were reported through our whistleblowing func-
tion raise your concern ("ryc").
employment
our employee survey, people pulse, enables us to measure 
the engagement levels and wellbeing of our people and also 
to monitor signs of changing trends to enable taking swift 
action. the response rate to people pulse increased to 81% in 
2020 compared to 78% in 2019 with a positive trend in all 
questions. we encourage our people to be physically active 
and take care of their health and our leaders to take a genu-
ine interest in the wellbeing of our people. this is particularly 
important now during the pandemic and in times of working 
from home and social distancing, as we know that the situa-
tion can be both physically and mentally challenging. moni-
tored quarterly, the sick leave rate of 3.02% shows a slight 
downward trend from 3.49% in 2019. 91% (91%) of our people 
feel they are always or often in good shape to carry out their 
work, with 80% (79%) feeling they have a good balance 
between work and other aspects of life. 
nordea continuously follows the development of the 
covid-19 situation and reviews the guidelines from local, 
european and global health authorities. as the situation and 
mitigating actions vary between countries, local groups were 
set up in addition to the group level coordination team. to 
reduce the risks and protect both our employees and custom-
ers, nordea took several measures such as restrictions in 
business travelling, general recommendation for remote 
work, planning office work in shifts, organised distance at the 
office, increased cleaning and disinfection at all nordea prem-

ises. extra communication efforts have been taken to ensure 
that the latest information is always available to our employ-
ees, and leaders have been offered training in remote leader-
ship, wellbeing and communication.
the covid-19 crisis proved to be a fast-track for nordea to 
trial new practices for flexible work, with many of our col-
leagues finding new ways to collaborate and communicate 
both internally and with customers. while there are several 
positive indications, nordea will need to monitor and assess 
the long-term impact of flexible working on wellbeing, per-
formance, culture, innovation and productivity. being a uni-
versal bank comes with specific conditions whereby some 
roles and tasks cannot be executed outside of company 
premises. this applies especially for employees in customer-
facing roles, with financial transactions and/or working with 
sensitive data. all these aspects are taken into consideration 
as part of the flexible working initiatives started at the end of 
2020, aiming to support nordea in becoming a sustainable 
employer for the future. 
as communicated in 2019, income development, digitalisa-
tion and automation will most likely drive a need for adjust-
ments and changes in how we organise and how we work. in 
cases where this could lead to certain job changes, we will 
play a key role in securing the right strategic approach for 
engaging our people during times of change, while respect-
ing labour market conditions. together with the trade unions 
and through constructive discussions, we are committed to 
treating our people with respect and care, and we aim to sup-
port any affected people with developing the right skills and 
finding new job opportunities inside and outside nordea.
community engagement
community engagement at nordea is about creating positive 
change through our employees. in over 20 programmes and 
partnerships, we focus on building financial skills and foster-
ing entrepreneurship, thus enabling our core competencies to 
have a positive impact in society. between 2017 and 2019, vol-
unteering at nordea grew almost 250% to a participation rate 
(share of engaged employees) of 18%. for 2020, the ambition 
was to continue with a high level of engagement. however, 
after societies started to close down in march the number of 
volunteering opportunities fell significantly. despite this, close 
to 1,500 nordea employees delivered 6,000 hours of volun-
teering in 2020, corresponding to a little more than 25% of 
2019 levels. 
governance and culture
sound corporate governance means ensuring that companies 
are run sustainably, responsibly and as efficiently as possible 
on behalf of their shareholders. confidence of legislators and 
the public in companies acting sustainably and responsibly is 
crucial if companies are to have the freedom to realise their 
strategies to create value. 
sustainability governance
to support the approach suggested by the task force on cli-
mate-related and environmental risks– to establish a steady-
state esg risk governance – we decided to transform our sus-
tainability governance model to tie sustainability and risk 
closer together. 
at board level the board operations and sustainability 
committee ("bosc") assists the board in fulfilling its over-
sight responsibilities concerning sustainability, which includes 
the strategy, operational model, reporting and frameworks. 
the board is also assisted by bric in the fulfilment of its 
oversight responsibilities concerning the management of 
risks, related frameworks, controls and processes (including 
esg factors as drivers of existing risk). 
at an executive level, in 2020 our governance structure 
included the group-wide bevc as a sub-committee of the 
ceo’s glt. bevc consisted of representatives from the busi-
ness areas and group functions, including group risk and 
compliance, and acted as an executive preparatory body for 
the president and group ceo and the board. bevc monitored 
and reviewed relevant group policies related to sustainability. 
it was also responsible for recommending to the group ceo 
participation in and exit from commitments to sustainability 
as well as approving external position statements and sector 
guidelines. the bevc also had a role in preparing the sustain-
ability strategy, targets and the sustainability report for the 
president and group ceo and the board. the rc also provid-
ed input for our sustainability agenda from the risk perspec-
tive. the role of the rc in relation to sustainability will remain 
in place in 2021, but bevc will be replaced by the sustainabil-
ity and ethics committee ("sec") in january 2021. sec will 
have a stronger mandate to facilitate further integration of 
sustainability into our business strategy and to support the 
integration of esg factors in 1st lod risk management. 
business ethics
nordea’s code of conduct, together with nordea’s sustain-
ability policy, defines the high-level principles that guide our 
business, how we treat our customers and the conduct 
expected from our employees. they underpin our culture and 
set the parameters for our conduct in areas such as care for 
the environment, labour rights, how we treat our customers, 
human rights, the right to privacy, fair competition, anti-brib-
ery and anti-corruption. the code of conduct is reviewed 
annually and was last updated in june 2020. compliance with 
the code of conduct is monitored by way of regular reporting 
to the chief compliance officer, chief risk officer, president 
and group ceo and the board. all our employees are 
required to complete annual training on the code of conduct 
as part of their licence to work to ensure proper awareness 
and knowledge of the ethical principles. in 2020, 93.9 (98.5%) 
of all employees (excluding those on long-term leave) com-
pleted their licence to work during the year. the 2020 train-
ing also included security and financial crime in addition to 
the general code of conduct-related contents such as anti-
corruption and bribery to mention some. 
preventing financial crime
nordea fully recognises the threat that societies face from 
human trafficking, terrorism, corruption, drug smuggling, tax 
evasion and other forms of illegal activities. tracking down 
and stopping the money flows from these activities is a key 
way to disrupt the criminals involved. 
at nordea, we are doing our utmost to ensure that our 
resources, products and services are not used to facilitate 
financial crime. we also commit to complying with the laws 
and regulations relevant to anti-money laundering ("aml"), 
counter terrorist financing ("ctf"), sanctions and bribery and 
corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. in addi-
tion, we have maintained and increased our continuous 
engagement with the regulators throughout the year, demon-
strating progress made towards increasing our defences.
over the years, we have significantly increased our focus to 
ensure we have the right people and effective tools in place 
to help combat financial crime, and have established strong 
risk management policies and practices to support our com-
mitment to protect our customers and society from financial 
crime. with over eur 850m invested since 2015, we have 
strengthened our risk and compliance platforms, providing 
non-financial statement
61
board of directors’ report
nordea annual report 2020 
vital support to our financial crime prevention efforts, and 
today we have more than 1,600 employees working on com-
batting money laundering and other types of financial crime. 
in addition, across the organisation, the culture of risk man-
agement has been accelerated the past couple of years 
through compulsory training for all employees and 
consultants. 
each year, approximately 2.5 billion transactions pass 
through nordea, which are monitored through our systems 
and processes. to handle these volumes, we have strength-
ened our monitoring capabilities through investments in tech-
nology, more sophisticated assessment techniques and addi-
tional employees. from this monitoring, we investigate any 
concern identified and in cases where we detect suspicious 
activity, we report it to the authorities for them to take it for-
ward. we also continuously strengthen our sanctions screen-
ing capabilities on both our customers and their transactions, 
each year expanding our coverage of sanctions lists and 
strengthening our automated controls. we also continuously 
develop our know your customers (kyc) tools and processes 
to secure an understanding of our customers’ behaviour and 
improve efficiency, all the while enhancing our customers’ 
experience. additionally, through increasingly sophisticated 
investigations and analytical capabilities, in 2020 we have 
conducted investigations on matters such as complex cross-
border money laundering schemes, human trafficking and 
terrorist financing-related cases, and on suspicious transac-
tions related to covid-19.

cyber security
nordea, like any other bank, is introducing new technologies 
and exploring new ways of doing business and connecting 
with customers. this enlarges the bank’s attack surface. at 
the same time, entities that pose cyber threats are becoming 
better organised, resourced and experienced. adding to this 
is the asymmetry of banks having to protect all assets appro-
priately, while entities engaged in cyber threats merely need 
to find one weak spot. this poses an unprecedented risk to 
the banking industry. nordea is not just focusing on the ade-
quacy of the basics of information security controls, but also 
enhancing cyber capabilities with security detection and 
response defences. we are investing in our cyber defence 
with new tools and functions, and we continue to focus on 
ensuring that our basic controls are operating effectively. 
innovative security practices are developed to encompass 
new business demands such as robust mobile banking appli-
cations and proactive customer support for fraud detection 
and prevention.
the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of 
employees working remotely in order to continue servicing 
customers. in this situation, nordea has continuously been 
assessing the risks and introduced remediation activities. this 
includes technical and organisational controls, as well as an 
increased focus on security awareness and training for all 
staff. whilst we noticed many covid-related cyber-attacks 
across the industry, nordea has maintained the high resil-
ience level in protecting customer data and services.
whistleblowing
the whistleblowing function, ryc, ensures that all of 
nordea’s stakeholders, including customers, partners, affect-
ed communities as well as our own employees, have the right 
to speak up and always feel safe in doing so if they have con-
cerns about suspected misconduct such as breaches of 
human rights, or irregularities such as fraudulent, inappropri-
ate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activity or behaviour in our 
operations, products or services. this includes any action that 
constitutes a violation of laws or regulations, or of nordea’s 
internal policies, instructions or guidelines. 
we offer the possibility to report openly, by providing 
name and contact details, as all reports are handled with 
strict confidentiality. however, we also provide an electronic 
reporting channel, whistleb, which is managed by an exter-
nal party. the system is separate from nordea’s it systems 
and does not track ip addresses or other data that could iden-
tify the sender of a message. reports can be in danish, eng-
lish, finnish, norwegian and swedish. 
cases reported through ryc form part of the monitoring of 
compliance with the code of conduct and are reported to the 
chief people officer in addition to being included in the 
aforementioned regular management reports and reports to 
the board.

tainability, see our sustainability report 2020 at nordea.com.

conflicts of interest policy 
as a global financial services provider, nordea bank abp and 
its subsidiaries (“nordea”) regularly face potential or actual 
conflict of interest situations. managing conflicts of interest is 
relevant at both the individual and institutional level of 
nordea’s organisation. nordea is committed to promoting 
market integrity and fair treatment of customers. all employ-
ees are required to act in a fair, honest and professional man-
ner and in the best interests of nordea’s customers. in order 
to act upon these commitments and ensure appropriate gov-
ernance of nordea, it is essential to have effective controls in 
place regarding conflicts of interest. the purpose of the 
group board directive on conflicts of interest (the “direc-
tive”) is to outline nordea’s approach to managing conflicts of 
interest and to enable developing and maintaining an effec-
tive control environment. 
the directive applies to all employees and people working 
on behalf of nordea, senior management, group board 
 members and the preseident and group ceo of nordea. the 
directive also applies to all branches and subsidiaries.
both actual and potential conflicts of interest must be iden-
tified and effective measures decided upon to prevent or 
manage risks in respect of nordea or its customers. conflicts 
of interest arising with regards to an employee’s private inter-
est or their past or present personal or professional relation-
ships are individual conflicts of interest. conflicts of interest 
that do not arise from a private interest but in connection 
with nordea’s organisation, group structure, governance, 
 different activities, roles, products, services or any other 
 circumstances are institutional conflicts of interest. in connec-
tion with each identified conflict of interest, the potential cus-
tomer impact is assessed to ensure fair treatment of 
customers.
all potential or actual conflicts of interest must be identi-
fied and assessed. appropriate preventive or mitigating 
 measures must be implemented in the form of effective 
organisational and administrative measures. identified 
 conflicts of interest are documented in a register. 
all identified individual conflicts of interest or changed 
 circumstances must be reported to the manager of the indi-
vidual employee involved. all conflicts of interest or changed 
circumstances regarding an institutional conflict of interest 
must be reported to the manager responsible for the area 
that the conflict of interest potentially impacts. senior man-
agement will receive recurring, at least annual, reporting on 
institutional conflicts of interest.
the group board approves the directive and is responsible 
for overseeing its implementation. to ensure objective and 
impartial decision-making, group board members are also 
subject to the requirements of the directive. the president 
and group ceo and group leadership team members are 
accountable for implementing the directive at nordea while 
also being subject to the requirements of the directive.

board of directors’ report
nordea annual report 2020 
remuneration
nordea has a clear remuneration policy, instructions and processes, supporting sound 
remuneration structures throughout the organisation.
aim of nordea’s remuneration policy
nordea’s remuneration policy (internally referred to as the 
group board directive on remuneration) will:
• support nordea’s ability to recruit, develop and retain 
highly motivated, competent and performance-oriented 
employees and hence support the group strategy;
• ensure that employees are offered a competitive and  
market-aligned total reward offering;
• support sustainable results and the long-term interests of 
shareholders by including goals directly linked to the per-
formance of nordea and by awarding parts of variable 
remuneration in shares or other instruments; and
• ensure that remuneration at nordea is aligned with effi-
cient risk management, the nordea purpose and values 
and applicable regulations.
nordea has a total remuneration approach to compensation 
that recognises the importance of well-balanced but differen-
tiated remuneration structures, based on business and local 
market needs, as well as the importance of having remunera-
tion that is consistent with and promotes sound and effective 
risk management, and that does not encourage excessive 
risk-taking or counteract nordea’s long-term interests.
the link between performance, risk and variable remuner-
ation in nordea’s remuneration components is assessed 
annually to ensure business relevance, to ensure that all risks 
are addressed appropriately, and to ensure compliance with 
applicable international and local regulations. this includes 
non-financial risks related to operational risks, compliance 
risks, reputational risks and specific remuneration-related 
risks. most remuneration-related risks concern variable remu-
neration which, if not appropriately considered, could lead to 
excessive risk-taking. risks are addressed through the regular 
reviews of both remuneration structures as well as individual 
remuneration components, participants in variable remunera-
tion plans and the potential size of potential awards, and by 
disclosing relevant information. 
decision-making process for the remuneration policy
nordea’s remuneration policy sets out principles for remu-
neration within the nordea group including how the policy is 
to be applied, remuneration governance and risk manage-
ment, as well as how employees with a material impact on 
the risk profile of nordea (“material risk takers”) are defined. 
the board of directors decides on the remuneration poli-
cy, taking possible risks into account, and oversees its func-
tionality by ensuring that it is applied and followed up as pro-
posed by the board remuneration committee (“brc”). 
in addition to nordea’s internal remuneration policy, 
nordea’s shareholders adopted, through an advisory vote, the 
remuneration policy for governing bodies at the 2020 annual 
general meeting, which applies to the remuneration to the 
board of directors, the ceo and the interim deputy managing 
director and remains in force until the 2024 annual general 
meeting.
the brc is responsible for preparing and presenting pro-
posals to the board of directors on remuneration issues, con-
sidering the adopted remuneration policy for governing bod-
ies, including proposals about nordea’s remuneration policy 
and supplementary instructions. these preparations include 
assessment of the remuneration policy and the remuneration 
system. appropriate control functions participate in this pro-
cess and provide input within their area of expertise to ensure 
that the remuneration policy is up to date and compliant. 
furthermore, in collaboration with the board risk committee, 
the brc performs assessments to ensure that nordea’s remu-
neration systems properly account for all types of risks, that 
liquidity and capital levels are consistent and that remunera-
tion systems promote sound and effective risk management. 
more information about the composition of the brc and its 
responsibilities is provided in a separate section of the “cor-
porate governance statement”, page 51.
alignment with business strategy
nordea has processes to align the business and individual 
goal and target-setting across nordea with the overall strat-
egy and predefined risk-adjusted criteria. 
financial and non-financial goals are based on the busi-
ness’s expectations and forecast and stretched targets are 
approved by the board of directors to ensure alignment with 
shareholders and business priorities. hence, the main perfor-
mance goals in variable remuneration for the nordea group 
in 2020 were financial goals and targets as well as customer 
satisfaction and employee engagement goals and targets. 
when assessing performance against the pre-determined 
set of well-defined goals and targets, nordea applies an 
aligned structure with clear expectations for our people. indi-
vidual performance is assessed on not only ‘what’ is delivered 
but also ‘how’ it is delivered. a key aspect is performance in 
relation to specific risk and compliance targets as well as 
general compliance and risk conduct, which must be appro-
priately considered when determining variable remuneration 
awards. 
to guarantee fair and objective remuneration decisions 
and to support sound governance, all individual remuneration 
decisions are subject to separate processes and approved in 
line with the grandparent principle (four-eyes approval by the 
manager’s manager). 
supporting sound risk management
nordea performs an ongoing risk assessment of remunera-
tion risks conducted within the framework of the compliance, 
conduct and product committee (ccpc) and the non-finan-
cial risk forums of each business area and group functions as 
well as the risk and control self-assessment. nordea also mit-
igates relevant risks by means of our internal control frame-
work, which is based on the control environment and includes 
the following elements: values and management culture, 
goal orientation and follow-up, a clear and transparent 
organisational structure, three lines of defence, the four eyes 
principle, the quality and efficiency of internal communication 
and an independent assessment process. 
the following principles are further examples of how 
sound risk management is supported 
• applying a group variable remuneration funding mecha-
nism which considers prudential and appropriate risk-
adjustments when setting a group pool for each perfor-
mance year;
• ensuring that the board of directors approves the total 
outcome of variable remuneration before award, which 
allows for adjustments in outcome if deemed appropriate 
by the board of directors e.g. considering risk limits;
• there is an appropriate balance between fixed and vari-
able remuneration; 
• relevant control functions provide input on the setting of a 
group variable remuneration pool, performance goals and 
64
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
the outcome of such, to ensure that the impact on staff 
behaviour and the risks of the business undertaken are 
fully addressed;
• the effect on long-term results is considered when deter-
mining goals and targets for variable remuneration;
• no employee at nordea can earn variable remuneration 
exceeding 200% of their annual fixed remuneration. the 
maximum ratio between the fixed and the variable remu-
neration for material risk takers was 200% in 2020 in 
accordance with the 2019 agm’s decision. in practice, how-
ever, a ratio between the fixed and the variable remunera-
tion above 100% of their annual fixed remuneration only 
applies to a very limited number of employees due to the 
outcome from nordea’s variable remuneration plans being 
capped at certain levels;
• the risks set out in nordea’s risk appetite statement are 
linked to forfeiture conditions to ensure that breaches of 
risk limits influence variable remuneration awards;
• payments related to early termination of employment 
should reflect performance achieved over time and should 
be designed to not reward failure or misconduct; and 
• employees engaged in control functions are compensated 
independently of the performance of the business unit(s) 
they control and predominantly through fixed 
remuneration. 
principles for deferral of variable remuneration 
awards and awards in instruments
nordea ensures that a substantial part of variable remunera-
tion, as a minimum for material risk takers and certain other 
categories of staff, is deferred and afterwards retained over 
an appropriate period in line with regulatory requirements. 
this means that 40-60% of variable remuneration awards are 
deferred for three to five years, with vesting and subsequent 
disbursement over the deferral period on a pro-rata basis. 
the first disbursement of deferred variable remuneration can 
take place one year into the deferral period at the earliest. 
deviations may occur subject to local regulation. 
for material risk takers and certain other categories of 
staff, 50% of variable remuneration awards (both deferred 
and non-deferred amounts) is awarded in instruments (as a 
main rule in nordea shares, alternatively linked to nordea’s 
price) and subject to a 12 month retention period. variable 
remuneration awards for a limited number of staff are subject 
to a six-month retention period. dividends are excluded from 
any shares or other instruments during a deferral period. 
risk adjustments, malus and claw-back provisions
general provisions for malus and claw-back at nordea are set 
out in nordea’s remuneration policy. the consequence man-
agement committee (“cmc”), comprising the heads of con-
trol functions, the head of group legal and the head of 
group people, provides governance and oversight of risk per-
formance related adjustments of selected staff in scope in the 
first line of defence. ex-ante and ex-post adjustments can be 
proposed by the cmc to individually or collectively adjust or 
claw back variable remuneration awards due to risk and com-
pliance related performance. 
payment of variable remuneration awards under nordea’s 
main variable remuneration plans is based on an assessment 
of the results of the nordea group, the concerned nordea 
entity, the relevant business unit and the individual employee. 
reductions, partly or down to zero, can occur if an employee 
eligible for variable remuneration has for example violated 
internal or external regulations, participated in or been 
responsible for an action that has caused nordea significant 
losses, or in the event of a significant downturn in nordea’s or 
the relevant business unit’s financial results.
employees must not use personal hedging strategies to 
undermine or eliminate the effects of deferred variable remu-
neration being partly or fully removed. 
audit of nordea’s remuneration policy
the brc follows up on the application of the remuneration 
policy and supplementary instructions within nordea through 
an independent review by group internal audit. this audit is 
conducted at least annually. 
remuneration to the board of directors
by proposal of the shareholders' nomination board and in 
accordance with the remuneration policy for governing bod-
ies, the agm annually decides on the remuneration to the 
board of directors. in 2020, remuneration was offered in cash 
to the board members. board members are not part of any 
variable or incentive programme. remuneration for board 
work is not paid to board members who are employees of the 
nordea group. further information is provided in note g8 on 
page 142. 
remuneration to the ceo and the members 
of the group leadership team (glt)
by proposal of the brc, the board of directors decides on the 
remuneration for the ceo and the members of the glt, con-
sidering the adopted remuneration policy for governing bod-
ies. this also applies to the group chief audit executive and 
the chief compliance officer to be approved by the board of 
directors, even though they are not members of the glt. this 
includes a decision on fixed and variable remuneration as 
well as pension and other employment terms and conditions.
nordea maintains competitive and market-aligned total 
reward offering and other employment conditions needed to 
recruit, motivate and retain the ceo and the members of the 
glt and in consideration of their leadership, expertise and 
strategic decision-making enabling nordea to deliver on its 
strategy and targets. a key concept is pay-for-performance.
remuneration for the ceo and members of the glt in 2020 
was decided by the board of directors considering the remu-
neration policy for governing bodies, and in accordance with 
nordea’s internal policies and procedures, which are based on 
the applicable regulations on remuneration systems and 
other relevant regulations and guidelines.
salaries and other remuneration in line with market levels 
constitute the overriding principle for the remuneration to the 
ceo and the members of the glt at nordea. the remunera-
tion to the ceo and the members of the glt will be consis-
tent with and promote sound and effective risk management 
and not encourage excessive risk-taking or counteract 
nordea’s long-term interests. 
annual remuneration consists of fixed salary, benefits, vari-
able remuneration (short- and long-term), pension and 
insurances.
variable remuneration to the members of the glt 
variable remuneration to the members of the glt was offered 
as participation in a short term incentive programme called 
executive incentive programme (“eip 2020”), and to the 
members of the glt who are not independent control func-
tions, a long term incentive programme called long term 
incentive programme 2020-2022 (“ltip 2020-2022”).
executive incentive programme (eip 2020) for glt members 
has a one-year performance period and includes predeter-
mined performance goals and targets at group, business 
remuneration
65
board of directors’ report
nordea annual report 2020 
area/group function (“ba/gf”) and individual level. the 
effect on long-term results was considered when determining 
the targets.
the outcome from eip 2020 has been based on the board 
of director’s assessment of performance against the prede-
termined targets. the outcome from eip 2020 will be paid 
over a five-year period in cash and in nordea shares, and will 
be subject to forfeiture clauses. no dividends are paid during 
the deferral period. nordea shares will be subject to 12 
months' retention. the maximum outcome of eip 2020 for 
glt members participating in ltip 2020-2022 was reduced 
from 100% of the annual fixed base salary to 75% as part of a 
rebalancing of the glt’s remuneration structure.
the ceo and the members of the glt have been offered 
participation in programmes similar to eip 2020 since 2013. 
performance goals at group level included financial goals 
measuring return on equity, income and cost/income ratio as 
well as non-financial goals measuring employee engagement 
and customer satisfaction. ba/gf goals included ba/gf-spe-
cific financial goals. at the individual level, performance was 
measured in relation to the individually agreed goals and tar-
gets including risk and compliance. the weight of group, ba/
gf and individual goals are determined individually for the 
ceo, reflecting his overall responsibility for the nordea group, 
as well as for the members heading a business area or a 
group function. the overall ambition for 2020 was to deliver 
on nordea’s strategic priorities. any awards were determined 
on the basis of achievement in relation to the agreed goals 
and targets following appropriate risk adjustments. 
long-term incentive programme 2020-2022  
in 2020, the board of directors decided to launch ltip 2020-
2022 for glt.
the main purpose of the ltip 2020-2022 is to further align 
the glt’s interests with those of shareholders. the ltip 2020-
2022 has a three-year performance period from 1 january 
2020 to 31 december 2022 and deferral and retention periods 
according to regulations. 
the total maximum number of shares that can be granted 
under the ltip 2020-2022 was nominally allocated to the par-
ticipants in 2020 as conditional share awards. in 2023, based 
on nordea’s performance against pre-established perfor-
mance criteria, the maximum number of shares or a propor-
tion of the shares will be awarded to the participants. 
the first portion of shares of the potential award will be 
delivered in 2023. the rest of the shares will be deferred and 
delivered annually in five equal portions during 2024-2028. 
each share delivery is subject to a 12-month retention period. 
unvested shares will not be delivered where employment 
terminates before the award payment, however, subject to 
local regulations and leaver provisions. share grants may be 
reduced in part or full subject to risk and compliance adjust-
ments. the nominal allotment of conditional share awards in 
2020 corresponded on average to approximately 75 % of the 
fixed base salary for the glt.
the ltip 2020-2022 performance requirements have been 
set so that the maximum outcome will require achieving 
exceptional performance from a shareholder perspective. the 
assessment of performance during the performance period 
will be based equally on the following performance criteria: 
• relative total shareholder return (rtsr) measured against 
selected nordic and european peer banks
• absolute total shareholder return (absolute tsr)
• absolute cumulative earnings per share (absolute eps)
a risk-adjustment underpin is also included.
furthermore, the glt members must hold a significant 
number of shares granted until the total value of the glt 
member’s shareholding in nordea in total corresponds to 100 
% of the glt member’s annual gross salary. such shares must 
be held until the glt member steps down from the glt 
position.
benefits are given to support the overall wellbeing of the 
ceo and glt members. the levels of these benefits are deter-
mined by what is considered fair in relation to general market 
practice. fixed salary during the period of notice and sever-
ance pay will not exceed 24 months of fixed salary in total. 
pension and insurances are offered to ensure an appropriate 
standard of living after retirement as well as personal insur-
ance coverage during employment. the ceo and the mem-
bers of the glt are offered pension benefits in accordance 
with market practice in their country of permanent residence. 
pension and insurance provisions are in accordance with local 
laws, regulations and market practice. pension is generally 
offered as defined contribution pension plans, but can also be 
offered by means of a pension allowance. discretionary pen-
sion benefits are not used.
nordea’s remuneration structures
nordea’s remuneration structure comprises fixed remunera-
tion and variable remuneration. 
fixed remuneration components
fixed base salary should remunerate for role and position 
and is affected by job complexity, responsibility, performance 
and local market conditions. 
allowance is a predetermined fixed remuneration component 
tied to the employee’s role and position. fixed base salary is, 
however, the cornerstone of all fixed remuneration. allowances 
are not linked to performance and do not incentivise risk taking. 
pension and insurance aims at ensuring an appropriate stan-
dard of living for employees after retirement, as well as per-
sonal insurance coverage during employment. pension and 
insurance provisions are in accordance with local laws, regu-
lations and market practice, and are either collectively agreed 
schemes or company-determined schemes or a combination 
thereof. nordea aims to have defined contribution pension 
schemes. 
benefits at nordea are awarded as part of the total reward 
offering that is either individually agreed or based on local 
laws, market practice, collective bargaining agreements and 
company-determined practice. 
nordea’s variable remuneration programmes 
for others than the ceo and the glt
as of 2020, a group variable remuneration funding mecha-
nism is used to fund variable remuneration programmes at 
nordea, except for the profit sharing plan and ltip 2020-
2022. the group variable remuneration funding mechanism is 
a pool-based approach which creates a strong link between 
nordea’s overall performance and the accrual of variable 
remuneration. the group variable remuneration pool deter-
mines the overall variable remuneration for the respective 
performance year, based on a target /expected pool adjusted 
by group performance, which is subsequently distributed to 
ba/gfs based on their performance (scorecards). the final 
allocation is based on individual performance as per set indi-
vidual goals under the individual variable remuneration pro-
grammes. with the group variable remuneration funding 
mechanism, nordea ensures compliance with requirements 
remuneration
66
board of directors’ report
annual report 2020 nordea
on variable remuneration and risk-adjustments under e.g. 
crd iv and eba guidelines on sound remuneration policies, 
including assessing prudential and risk. 
in 2020, the following other variable remuneration pro-
grammes were offered to nordea employees:
executive incentive programme (eip) was offered to recruit, 
motivate and retain selected people leaders and key employ-
ees outside of the glt and aims to reward strong perfor-
mance and efforts. the assessment of individual performance 
is based on a predetermined set of well-defined financial as 
well as non-financial goals. individual eip awards will not 
exceed the annual fixed salary. awards from 2020 eip are 
normally, and always for material risk takers, allocated partly 
in cash and partly in instruments with subsequent retention. 
parts of the awards for participants in eip are subject to a 
three-to-five-year pro-rata deferral period with forfeiture 
conditions applying during the deferral period. 
variable salary part (vsp) was offered to selected people 
leaders and specialists to reward strong performance. the 
assessment of individual performance is based on a predeter-
mined set of well-defined financial as well as non-financial 
goals. the vsp maximum outcome for 2020 should normally 
not exceed a maximum outcome of 25% of the annual fixed 
salary, except for a few selected managers and specialists 
within specific areas of nordea. awards from vsp will not 
exceed the annual fixed salary. awards from vsp are paid in 
cash. for material risk takers, vsp awards are partly deliv-
ered in instruments with subsequent retention. parts of the 
awards for material risk takers from vsp are subject to at 
least three-year pro-rata deferral period with forfeiture condi-
tions applying during the deferral period. 
bonus schemes were offered only to selected groups of 
employees in specific business areas or units as approved by 
the board of directors, e.g. in large corporates & institutions, 
nordea asset management, in nordea funds and within 
group treasury. the aim is to ensure strong performance and 
maintain cost flexibility for nordea. individual awards are 
determined based on detailed performance assessments cov-
ering a range of financial and non-financial goals. 2020 bonus 
awards from bonus schemes are paid in cash. for material 
risk takers, awards are partly delivered in instruments with 
subsequent retention. parts of the awards for material risk 
takers in a bonus scheme are subject to a three-to-five-year 
pro-rata deferral period with forfeiture conditions applying 
during the deferral period.
recognition scheme was offered to employees to recognise 
extraordinary performance. the individual performance is 
assessed based on a predetermined set of goals. material 
risk takers and employees eligible for other formal annual 
variable remuneration plans, excluding the profit sharing 
plan, are not eligible for recognition scheme awards. 
profit sharing plan (psp) is offered group-wide to all nordea 
employees but not to employees who are eligible for any of 
nordea’s other formal annual variable remuneration plans. 
for eligible employees, the profit sharing plan is offered irre-
spective of position and salary and aims to collectively 
reward employees based on achievement in relation to pre-
determined financial goals as well as goals relating to cus-
tomer satisfaction. the profit sharing plan is capped finan-
cially, and the outcome is not linked to the value of nordea’s 
share price. 
guaranteed variable remuneration (sign-on) can be offered in 
exceptional cases only, limited to the first year of employment 
when hiring new staff. sign-on can only be paid if nordea and 
the employing company have a sound and strong capital base. 
compensation for contracts in previous employments (buy-
outs) can be offered in exceptional cases only, in the context 
of hiring new staff, limited to the first year of employment and 
if nordea and the employing company have a sound and 
strong capital base. 
retention bonus can be offered in exceptional cases only if 
nordea has a legitimate interest in retaining employees for a 
predetermined period of time or until a certain event occurs 
and if nordea and the employing company have a sound and 
strong capital base. 
other qualitative and quantitative information
the actual cost of variable remuneration for 
executive officers (excluding social cost)
for eip 2020 for glt members eur 3.2m is to be paid over a 
five-year period. the estimated maximum cost of eip for glt 
members in 2021 is eur 5.7m and the estimated cost assuming 
50% fulfilment of the performance goals is eur 2.8m. 
cost of variable remuneration for non-
glt members (excluding social cost):
the actual cost of eip, vsp and bonus 2020 is eur 181.8m not 
including awards to glt members, which is paid partly now in 
cash, and partly over a three-to-five-year period as outlined in 
the sections above. in 2020, a total of eur 32.4m was provided 
under nordea’s profit sharing plan. each employee can 
receive a maximum of eur 3,200. if all stretched performance 
goals were met, the cost of the profit sharing plan for eligible 
participants in 2020 would have amounted to a maximum of 
approximately eur 63.0m.

proposed distribution of earnings
events after the financial period
on 31 december 2020, nordea bank abp’s distributable earn-
ings, including profit for the financial year − after subtracting 
the dividend to be paid on 1 march 2021 (at the earliest) 
based on the balance sheet for the financial year ended 31 
december 2019 and capitalised development expenses − 
were eur 19,694,163,764.901 and other unrestricted equity 
amounted to eur 4,573,347,620.91. 
the board of directors has proposed that the 24 march 
2021 annual general meeting (agm) authorises it to decide 
on a dividend payment of a maximum of eur 0.72 per share. 
the payment would be distributed based on the balance 
sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended 31 december 
2020, in one or several instalments. the authorisation would 
remain in force until the beginning of the next agm.
the nordea bank abp’s number of shares is 4,049,951,919. 
the total dividend amount calculated based on the maximum 
of eur 0.72 per share, excluding dividend for treasury shares, 
would then be eur 2,907,097,050.96 and it would be paid 
from retained earnings. after the maximum dividend pay-out, 
eur 16,787,066,713.942 would be carried forward as distribut-
able retained earnings.
the total amount of the dividend payment and the amount 
carried forward as distributable retained earnings after the divi-
dend pay-out, will be adjusted based on the amount of treasury 
shares held by nordea bank abp at the record date for the divi-
dend payment.
it is the assessment of the board of directors that the pro-
posed dividend is justifiable considering the demands with 
respect to the size of the company’s and the group’s equity, 
which are imposed by the nature, scope and risks, associated 
with the business, and the company’s and the group’s need 
for consolidation, liquidity and financial position in general.
for information on changes in the financial position of the 
nordea bank abp since the end of the financial period see 
events after the financial period. no other significant events 
or material changes have taken place in the financial position 
of the nordea bank abp since the end of the financial period 
and the proposed dividend does not compromise the com-
pany’s solvency.
according to the parent company’s balance sheet, the

on 15 december 2020 the european central bank (“ecb”) 
issued an updated dividend recommendation to banks. the 
ecb in general expects dividends and share buy-backs to 
remain below 15% of the cumulated profit for 2019-2020 and 
not to exceed 20bp of the cet1 ratio until the end of septem-
ber 2021. the board of directors of nordea bank abp decided 
on 16 december 2020 to follow the updated ecb recommen-
dation. based on the recommendation and after a dialogue 
with the ecb, the board of directors has on 18 february 2021 
decided to distribute a dividend of eur 0.07 per share to 
shareholders in accordance with the mandate received from 
the agm in 2020.
 the dividend of eur 0.07 per share is paid to shareholders 
who on the record date for the dividend payment on 22 feb-
ruary 2021 were recorded in nordea’s shareholders’ register 
maintained by euroclear finland oy in finland, euroclear 
sweden ab in sweden or vp securities a/s in denmark. the 
dividend payment date is 1 march 2021 or as soon as possible 
thereafter.

and pension products . the nordea group also distributes 
general insurance products .
nordea’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as endorsed by the eu commission . in addition, cer-
tain complementary rules in the finnish accounting act, the 
finnish credit institutions act, the financial supervision 
authority’s regulations and guidelines and the decree of the 
ministry of finance on the financial statements and consoli-
dated statements of credit institutions and investment firms 
have also been applied .
the disclosures, required in the standards, recommenda-
tions and legislation above, have been included in the notes, 
the capital management section or in other parts of the 
financial statements .
on 24 february 2021 the board of directors approved the 
financial statements, subject to final adoption by the annual 
general meeting on 24 march 2021 . 
the accounting policies, the basis for calculations and pre-
sentations are unchanged in comparison with the annual 
report 2019, except from the changed accounting policies 
and presentation described below in the section “changed 
accounting policies and presentation” . 
all amounts are in euro million unless otherwise stated .
2. changed accounting policies and presentation
the new accounting requirements implemented during 2020 
and their impact on nordea’s financial statements are 
described below .
net result on loans in hold portfolios 
mandatorily held at fair value
changes have been made to the presentation of fair value 
adjustments to the margin component of loans in “hold” port-
folios mandatorily held at fair value . the margin component is 
the interest paid by customers on top of the interest charged 
to compensate nordea for the related funding cost . as from 
2020, these adjustments are being presented separately on a 
new row in the income statement entitled “net result on 
loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value” . the 
earlier policy was to present such fair value adjustments to 
the row “net result from items at fair value”, together with 
fair value adjustments to instruments in “sell” and “hold and 
sell” portfolios . loans in “hold” portfolios that are mandatorily 
held at fair value only due to their failing the solely payment 
of principal and interest (sppi) test are more similar to amor-
tised cost loans than to instruments in “sell” or “hold and sell” 
portfolios . for this reason, the presentation should to the 
extent possible be aligned with the presentation for loans 
held at amortised cost . fair value adjustments to the margin 
component, which are largely driven by changes in credit risk, 
are therefore presented separately next to the row “net loan 
losses” in the income statement, where similar adjustments to 
loans held at amortised cost are presented . comparative fig-
ures have been restated accordingly . the impact on the 
income statement can be found in the table below .

reclassification of accrued interest on loans
accrued interest on loans has previously been presented on 
the line “prepaid expenses and accrued income” on the bal-
ance sheet . as from 2020, accrued income on loans is pre-
sented together with the loans on the lines “loans to credit 
institutions” and “loans to the public” on the balance sheet . 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly . the 
impact on the balance sheet can be found in the table below .

changed presentation of trading in 
own shares (treasury shares)
from 1 january 2020 acquisitions of own shares have been 
reported as a reduction in “invested unrestricted equity” and 
sales of own shares as an increase in “invested unrestricted 
equity” . nordea’s earlier policy was to present acquisitions 
and sales in “retained earnings” . comparative figures have 
not been restated .
changed presentation of reportable operating segments
to reflect its current reporting and decision-making process-
es, nordea changed the presentation of reportable operating 
segments and the definition of the chief operating decision-
maker . for more information see note g3 “segment report-
ing” in the section “changes in basis of segmentation” .
other amended requirements
the following new and amended standards and interpreta-
tions were implemented by nordea on 1 january 2020 but 
have not had any significant impact on the financial state-
ments of nordea:
• amendments to references to the conceptual framework 
in ifrs standards 
• amendments to ifrs 3: definition of business
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8: definition of material
• annual improvements to ifrs 16: leases covid-19-related 
rent concessions
changes to the finnish accounting act, the finnish credit 
institutions act, the financial supervision authority’s regula-
tions and guidelines and the decree of the ministry of 
finance on the financial statements and consolidated state-
ments of credit institutions and investment firms have not had 
any significant impact on nordea’s financial statements .
3. changes in ifrss not yet applied 
amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28 “sale or 
contribution of assets between an investor 
and its associate or joint venture”
the iasb has amended the requirements in ifrs 10 and ias 
28 regarding sales and contributions of assets between an 
investor and its associated undertaking or joint venture due to 
inconsistent treatment of gains and losses of such transac-
tions in those standards . the iasb has thereafter proposed to 
defer indefinitely the effective date and permit earlier appli-
cation . the amendments are not yet endorsed by the eu 
commission . nordea does not currently intend to early adopt 
the amendments . the new requirements are not expected to 
have any impact on nordea’s financial statements, capital 
adequacy, or large exposures in the period of initial applica-
tion as the new requirements are in line with nordea’s current 
accounting policies . 
ifrs 17 “insurance contracts”
the iasb has published the new standard ifrs 17 “insurance 
contracts” . the new standard will change the accounting 
requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation 
and disclosure of insurance contracts .
the measurement principles will change from a non-uni-
form accounting policy based on the local accounting policies 
in the life insurance subsidiaries to a uniform accounting poli-
cy based on the three measurement models building block 
approach (bba), variable fee approach (vfa) and premium 
allocation approach (paa) . the model application depends 
on the terms of the contracts (long term, long term with vari-
able fee or short term) . the three measurement models 
include consistent definitions of contractual cash flows, the 
risk adjustment margin and discounting . these definitions are 
based on principles similar to the measurement principles for 
technical provisions in the solvency ii capital requirements 
directives . unearned future premiums will be recognised as a 
provision on the balance sheet and released to revenue when 
the insurance service is provided . any unprofitable contracts 
will be recognised in the income statement at the time when 
the contract is signed and approved .
ifrs 17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 january 2023 with earlier application permitted . 
the standard is not yet endorsed by the eu commission . 
nordea does not currently intend to adopt the standard early . 
nordea’s current assessment is that the new standard will not 
have any significant impact on its capital adequacy or large 
exposures in the period of initial application . it is not yet pos-
sible to conclude on the impact on nordea’s financial 
statements .

interest rate benchmark reform - phase 2
the iasb has published amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39, ifrs 
7, ifrs 4 and ifrs 16 in “interest rate benchmark reform – 
phase 2” . phase 2 of the ibor reform includes three major 
areas: hedge accounting, modifications and disclosures .
the amendments clarify that hedge accounting does not 
have to be discontinued just because hedged items and 
hedging instruments are modified due to the ibor reform . 
hedging relationships (and related documentation) must be 
amended to reflect modifications to the hedged item, hedg-
ing instrument and hedged risk . any valuation adjustments 
resulting from the amendments are recognised as part of 
hedge ineffectiveness .
it is clarified that modifications required as a direct conse-
quence of the ibor reform and made on an economically 
equivalent basis are not accounted for as modifications to 
instruments measured at amortised cost . for such modifica-
tions, the effective interest rate is amended in line with the 
modified cash flows .
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 january 2021 with earlier application 
permitted .
the amendments are expected to result in hedge relation-
ships in nordea being able to continue as before and no 
material modification gains or losses being recognised . for 
this reason the amendments are not assessed to have any 
significant impact on nordea’s financial statements, capital 
adequacy or large exposures in the period of initial applica-
tion of the amendments in comparison with the current 
situation .
other changes in ifrs 
the iasb has published the following new or amended stan-
dards that are assessed to have no significant impact on 
nordea’s financial statements, capital adequacy or large 
exposures in the period of initial application:
• amendments to ias 1 presentation of financial statements
• amendments to ifrs 3 business combinations
• amendments to ias 16 property, plant and equipment
• amendments to ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets
• annual improvement 2018–2020
• amendments to ifrs 4 insurance contracts – extension of 
the temporary exemption from applying ifrs 9”
4. critical judgements and estimation uncertainty
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires, in some 
cases, the use of judgements and estimates by management . 
the actual outcome can later, to some extent, differ from the 
estimates and the assumptions made . in this section a 
description is made of:
• the sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 
reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets andli-
abilities within the next financial year, and
• the judgements made when applying accounting policies 
(apart from those involving estimations) that have the 
most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements . 
critical judgements and estimates are in particular  
associated with:
• the fair value measurement of certain financial instruments
• the classification of financial assets
• the derecognition of financial assets
• the impairment testing of:
 
– goodwill and other intangible assets and
 
– loans to the public/credit institutions
• the amortisation period for capitalised software
• the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
• the actuarial calculations of pension liabilities and plan 
assets related to employees
• the actuarial calculations of insurance contracts
• the valuation of investment properties
• the assessment of expected lease terms and classification 
of leases
• the classification of additional tier 1 instruments 
• assessing control for consolidation purposes
• the valuation of deferred tax assets
• claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines
• critical judgements emphasised by covid-19 .
fair value measurement of certain financial instruments
nordea’s accounting policy for determining the fair value of 
financial instruments is described in section 11 “determination 
of fair value of financial instruments” and note g41 “assets 
and liabilities at fair value” . critical judgements that have a 
significant impact on the recognised amounts for financial 
instruments are exercised when determining fair value of otc 
derivatives and other financial instruments that lack quoted 
prices or recently observed market prices, such as unlisted 
equities . those judgements relate to the following areas:
• the choice of valuation techniques .
• the determination of when quoted prices fail to represent 
fair value (including the judgement of whether markets are 
active) .
• the construction of fair value adjustments in order to 
incorporate relevant risk factors such as credit risk, model 
risk and liquidity risk .
• the judgement of which market parameters are 
observable .
the critical judgements required when determining the fair 
value of financial instruments that lack quoted prices or 
recently observed market prices also introduce a high degree 
of estimation uncertainty . 
in all of these instances, decisions are based upon profes-
sional judgement in accordance with nordea’s accounting 
and valuation policies . the fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value using a valuation technique, 
levels 2 and 3 in the fair value hierarchy, was eur 167,700m 
(eur 185,198m) and eur 112,755m (eur 151,751m), respec-
tively, at the end of the year . valuation adjustments (cva, 
dva, ffva, nfva, close-out cost adjustment, model risk 
adjustment and ipv variance) made when determining the 
value of financial instruments (including those measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income) amount to 
eur 224m (eur 193m) .
sensitivity analysis disclosures covering fair values of 
financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs 
can be found in note g41 “assets and liabilities at fair value” .
estimation uncertainty also arises at initial recognition of 
financial instruments that are part of larger structural trans-
actions . although subsequently not necessarily held at fair 
value such instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
and as there is normally no separate transaction price or 
active market for such individual instruments, the fair value 
has to be estimated . 
classification of financial assets
nordea classifies financial assets based on nordea’s business 
model for managing the assets . when determining the busi-
ness model for the bonds within the liquidity buffer nordea 
makes critical judgements . the bonds within the liquidity buf-
fer is split in two portfolios . for the first portfolio nordea has 
determined that the business model is to keep the bonds and 
collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets . for 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
83
nordea annual report 2020
g1. accounting policies, cont.
the second portfolio, nordea has determined that the busi-
ness model is to manage the bonds with the objective of real-
ising cash flows through sale . the bonds within the first port-
folio are measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (fvoci) and the bonds within the second portfolio 
are measured at fair value through profit and loss (fvpl) . 
interest-bearing securities and financial instruments pledged 
as collateral in the liquidity buffer measured at fvoci (the 
first portfolio) amount to eur 33,726m (eur 29,779m) and 
interest-bearing securities measured at fvpl (the second 
portfolio) amount to eur 25,069m (eur 34,725m) .
derecognition of financial assets
loans and other financial assets where cash flows are modi-
fied, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised, and a new 
loan recognised, if the terms and conditions of the new loan 
are substantially different from the old loan . nordea applies 
judgements to determine if the terms and conditions of the 
new loan are substantially different from the old loan . nordea 
considers the terms and conditions to be substantially differ-
ent if the present value of the cash flows of the new loan dis-
counted by the original interest rate differs by more than 10% 
from the present value of the remaining expected cash flows 
of the old loan or if the modified cash flows are sppi, but the 
original cash flows were not sppi and vice versa . the carrying 
amount of loans, interest-bearing securities and financial 
instruments pledged as collateral on the asset side of the bal-
ance sheet amounts to eur 402,315m (eur 412,898m) .
impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets
nordea’s accounting policy for goodwill is described in sec-
tion 16 “intangible assets” and note g21 “intangible assets” 
lists the cash-generating units (cgus) to which goodwill has 
been allocated . also internally developed software for which 
amortisation has not yet started is included in the impairment 
test and allocated to the cgus . nordea’s total goodwill 
amounted to eur 1,938m (eur 1,969m) at the end of the 
year . software for which amortisation has not yet started 
amounted to eur 505m (eur 768m) at the end of the year .
the estimation of future cash flows and the calculation of 
the rate used to discount those cash flows are subject to esti-
mation uncertainty . the forecast of future cash flows is sensi-
tive to the cash flow projections for the near future (generally 
3-5 years) and to the estimated sector growth rate for the 
period beyond 3-5 years . the growth rates are based on his-
torical data, updated to reflect the current situation, which 
implies estimation uncertainty .
the rates used to discount future expected cash flows are 
based on the long-term risk-free interest rate plus a risk pre-
mium . the risk premium is based on external information of 
overall risk premiums in the relevant countries .
for information on the sensitivity to changes in relevant 
parameters, see note g21 “intangible assets” .
impairment testing of loans to the 
public/credit institutions
nordea’s accounting policy for impairment testing of loans is 
described in section 14 “loans to the public/credit 
institutions” .
management is required to exercise critical judgements 
and estimates when calculating loan impairment allowances . 
nordea’s total lending before impairment allowances was 
eur 338,459m (eur 343,000m) at the end of the year . for 
more information, see note g14 “loans and impairment” .
when calculating allowances for individually significant 
impaired loans, judgement is exercised to estimate the 
amount and timing of the expected cash flows to be received 
from the customers under different scenarios, including the 
valuation of any collateral received . judgement is also 
applied when assigning the likelihood of the different scenar-
ios occurring .
judgement is exercised to assess when an exposure has 
experienced a significant increase in credit risk . if this is the 
case, the provision should reflect the lifetime expected losses, 
as opposed to a 12-month expected loss for exposures not 
having increased significantly in credit risk . judgement is also 
exercised in the choice of modelling approaches covering 
other parameters used when calculating the expected losses, 
such as the expected lifetime used in stage 2 as well as in the 
assessment of whether the parameters based on historical 
experience are relevant for estimating future losses .
the statistical models used to calculate provisions are 
based on macroeconomic scenarios, which requires manage-
ment to exercise judgement when identifying such scenarios 
and when assigning the likelihood of the different scenarios 
occurring . judgement is also exercised in the assessment of 
to what extent the parameters for the different scenarios, 
based on historical experience, are relevant for estimating 
future losses .
the amortisation period for capitalised software
internally developed software is capitalised and amortised 
over the useful life of the software . as the it landscape devel-
ops rapidly, management exercises judgment to estimate the 
useful life of the software, which affects the yearly amortisa-
tion charge .
effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
nordea’s accounting policy for cash flow hedges is described 
in section 10 “hedge accounting” .
one important judgement in connection with cash flow 
hedge accounting is the choice of method used for effective-
ness testing .
where nordea applies cash flow hedge accounting the 
hedging instruments used are predominantly cross currency 
interest rate swaps, which are always held at fair value . the 
currency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of 
the currency risk and the interest component as a fair value 
hedge of the interest rate risk . the hypothetical derivative 
method is used when measuring the effectiveness of these 
cash flow hedges, meaning that the change in a perfect 
hypothetical swap is used as proxy for the present value of 
the cumulative change in expected future cash flows on the 
hedged transaction (the currency component) . critical judge-
ment has to be exercised when defining the characteristics of 
the perfect hypothetical swap .
actuarial calculations of pension liabilities 
and plan assets related to employees
nordea’s accounting policy for post-employment benefits is 
described in section 24 “employee benefits” . 
the defined benefit obligation for major pension plans is 
calculated by external actuaries using demographic assump-
tions based on the current population . as a basis for these 
calculations a number of actuarial and financial parameters 
are used .
the estimation of the discount rate is subject to uncertainty 
around whether corporate bond markets are deep enough, of 
high quality and also in connection to the extrapolation of 
yield curves to relevant maturities . in sweden, norway and 
denmark the discount rate is determined with reference to 
covered bonds and in finland with reference to corporate 
bonds . other parameters, like assumptions about salary 
increases and inflation, are based on the expected long-term 
development of these parameters and also subject to estima-
tion uncertainty . the main parameters used at year-end are 
disclosed in note g34 “retirement benefit obligations” 
together with a description of the sensitivity to changes in 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
84
annual report 2020 nordea
assumptions . the defined benefit obligation was eur 3,871m 
(eur 3,790m) at the end of the year .
actuarial calculations of insurance contracts
nordea’s accounting policy for insurance contracts is 
described in section 19 “liabilities to policyholders” .
a valuation of insurance liabilities includes estimations and 
assumptions, both financial and actuarial . one of the impor-
tant financial assumptions is the interest rate used for dis-
counting future cash flows . important actuarial assumptions 
are those on mortality and disability, which affect the size and 
timing of the future cash flows . the financial and actuarial 
assumptions are, to a large extent, stipulated in local legisla-
tion and therefore not under nordea’s discretion . also, 
assumptions about future administrative and tax expenses 
have an impact on the calculation of policyholder liabilities .
the insurance liability was eur 15,792m (eur 15,928m) at 
the end of the year . the carrying amount’s sensitivity to differ-
ent assumptions is disclosed in note g29 “liabilities to 
policyholders” . 
valuation of investment properties
nordea’s accounting policy for investment properties is 
described in section 18 “investment properties” .
investment properties are measured at fair value . as there 
are normally no active markets for investment properties, the 
fair values are estimated based on discounted cash flow mod-
els . these models are based on assumptions on future rents, 
vacancy levels, operating and maintenance costs, yield 
requirements and interest rates .
the carrying amounts of investment properties were eur 
1,535m (eur 1,585m) at the end of the year . see note g24 
“investment properties” for more information on amounts 
and parameters used in these models .
assessment of expected lease terms 
and classification of leases
nordea’s accounting policy for leases is described in section 
15 “leasing” . 
critical judgement has to be exercised as a lessee when 
estimating the expected lease term by considering all facts 
and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exer-
cise an extension or termination option . the expected lease 
term for contracts with no end date is estimated in the same 
way . backstop rules on the average expected lifetime for dif-
ferent types of real estate contracts are used as a guidance 
when making the estimate for banking branches . a more 
detailed analysis is performed for large head office contracts . 
the head office contracts are estimated to be more long term 
in nature than those of the branches where the environment 
is changing at a more rapid pace . the expected lease term of 
head office contracts is currently generally close to 25 years . 
the backstop rule of banking branches is currently limiting 
the expected lease term of contracts with no end date, or 
contracts with extension options, to 5 years . it is possible to 
deviate from the backstop rule if the circumstances show that 
it is likely that nordea will stay for a longer/shorter period .
for a lessor, critical judgement has to be exercised when 
classifying lease contracts . a lease is classified as a finance 
lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
related to ownership . a lease is classified as an operating 
lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards related to ownership .
the carrying amount of right of-use assets was eur 
1,459m (eur 1,506m) at the end of the year .
more information on lease contracts can be found in note 
g23 “leasing” .
classification of additional tier 1 instruments
nordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where 
the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of 
nordea and non-accumulating . some of these instruments 
also include a requirement for nordea to pay interest if the 
instruments are no longer allowed to be included in tier 1 
capital . if there is a requirement to pay interest based on the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event 
that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of 
the instrument, the instrument will be classified as a financial 
liability . the inclusion of the subordinated loan in tier 1 capi-
tal is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the control 
of nordea and the holders of the instrument . nordea classi-
fies the instruments as financial liabilities . instruments with-
out such clauses are classified as equity as there is no require-
ment for nordea to pay interest or principal to the holders of 
the instrument .
assessing control for consolidation purposes
one decisive variable when assessing if nordea controls 
another entity is whether nordea is exposed to variability in 
returns from the investment . for structured entities where 
voting rights are not the dominant factor when determining 
control, critical judgement has to be exercised when defining 
when nordea is exposed to significant variability in returns . 
nordea’s critical judgement is that nordea is normally 
exposed to variability in returns when nordea receives more 
than 30% of the return produced by the structured entity . this 
is only relevant for structured entities where nordea is also 
the investment manager and thus has influence over the 
return produced by the structured entity .
another judgement relating to control is whether nordea 
acts as an agent or as a principal . for unit-linked and other 
contracts where the policyholder/depositor decides both the 
amount and which assets to invest in, nordea is considered to 
act as an agent and thus does not have control .
judgement also has to be exercised when assessing if a 
holding of a significant, but less than majority, share of voting 
rights constitute a so-called de facto control and to what 
extent potential voting rights need to be considered in the 
control assessment . nordea’s assessment is that nordea does 
currently not control any entities where the share of voting 
rights is below 50% .
valuation of deferred tax assets
nordea’s accounting policy for the recognition of deferred tax 
assets is described in section 21 “taxes” and note g12 “taxes” .
the valuation of deferred tax assets is influenced by man-
agement’s assessment of nordea’s future profitability and 
sufficiency of future taxable profits and future reversals of 
existing taxable temporary differences . these assessments 
are updated and reviewed at each balance sheet date, and 
are, if necessary, revised to reflect the current situation . 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets was eur 406m 
(eur 487m) at the end of the year .
claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines
within the framework of normal business operations, nordea 
faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and disputes, most 
of which involve relatively limited amounts, as well as pos-
sible fines due to e .g . weak anti-money laundering processes 
and procedures in the past . presently, none of the current dis-
putes are considered likely to have any significant adverse 
effect on nordea or its financial position . as previously stated, 
nordea expects to be fined in denmark for weak aml pro-
cesses and procedures in the past and has made a provision 
for ongoing aml-related matters . nordea cannot exclude the 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

possibility of fines, which could impact the bank’s financial 
performance . in addition, some of these proceedings could 
lead to litigation . see also note g2 “risk and liquidity man-
agement, note g33 “provisions” and note g38 “contingent 
liabilities” .
critical judgements emphasised by covid-19
nordea applied significant critical judgements in the prepara-
tion of the annual report 2020 due to significant uncertainty 
concerning the potential long-term impact of covid-19 on 
nordea’s financial statements . areas particularly important 
were the fair value measurement of certain financial instru-
ments, impairment testing of goodwill and loans to the pub-
lic/credit institutions, and assessment of expected lease 
terms .
critical judgements are applied when determining the fair 
value of financial instruments that lack quoted prices or 
recently observed market prices . in all of these instances, 
decisions are based on professional judgement in accordance 
with nordea’s accounting and valuation policies . more infor-
mation on financial instruments held at fair value on nordea’s 
balance sheet can be found in note g41 .
no impairment of goodwill was identified during the year, 
but significant estimation uncertainty exists in relation to the 
long-term impact on nordea’s financial statements and the 
impairment need will be continually reassessed . nordea 
updated the cash flow projections to reflect the best estimate 
of the impact of covid-19 . cash flows were projected up 
until the end of 2023 and the long-term growth assumption 
was used for subsequent periods . the discount rate used for 
the test in the fourth quarter was on average 5 .8% post-tax 
and the long-term growth was on average 1 .4% . both an 
increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point and a 
reduction in the future growth rate of 1 percentage point are 
considered to be reasonably possible changes in key assump-
tions . such changes would not result in any impairment . more 
information on the impairment testing of goodwill can be 
found in note g21 “intangible assets” .
critical judgement was applied in the assessment of when 
loans had experienced a significant increase in credit risk 
(staging) and in the application of macro scenarios when 
estimating the increase in expected credit losses . more infor-
mation on the impairment testing of loans to the public/credit 
institutions can be found in section 14 “loans to the public/
credit institutions“ and in note g2 “risk and liquidity man-
agement” . information on sensitivities to rating and scoring 
migrations can be found in the section “sensitivities” in note 
g2 “risk and liquidity management” .
no changes in expected lease terms for premises lease 
contracts or impairments of right-of-use assets were identi-
fied during 2020, but the impact of the covid-19 on the 
future premises strategies will be closely monitored going 
forward . more information on leasing can be found in note 
g23 “leasing” .
5. principles of consolidation
consolidated entities
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
the parent company nordea bank abp and those entities that 
the parent company controls . control exists when nordea is 
exposed to variability in returns from its investments in 
another entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the other entity . control is generally 
achieved when the parent company owns, directly or indi-
rectly through group undertakings, more than 50% of the vot-
ing rights . for entities where voting rights do not decide con-
trol, see the section “structured entities” below .
all group undertakings are consolidated using the acquisi-
tion method . under the acquisition method, the acquisition is 
regarded as a transaction whereby the parent company indi-
rectly acquires the group undertaking’s assets and assumes 
its liabilities and contingent liabilities . the group’s acquisition 
cost is established in a purchase price allocation analysis . in 
such analysis, the cost of the business combination is the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the acquirer, in exchange for the identifiable net 
assets acquired . costs directly attributable to the business 
combination are expensed . 
as at the acquisition date nordea recognises the identifi-
able assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their 
acquisition date fair values . 
for each business combination nordea measures the non-
controlling interest in the acquired business either at fair 
value or at their proportionate share of the acquired identifi-
able net assets .
when the aggregate of the consideration transferred in a 
business combination and the amount recognised for non-
controlling interest exceed the net fair value of the identifi-
able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, the excess is 
reported as goodwill . if the difference is negative, such differ-
ence is recognised immediately in the income statement .
equity and net income attributable to non-controlling 
interests are separately disclosed on the balance sheet, the 
income statement and the statement of comprehensive 
income .
intra-group transactions and balances between the con-
solidated group undertakings are eliminated .
the group undertakings are included in the consolidated 
accounts as from the date on which control is transferred to 
nordea and are no longer consolidated as from the date on 
which control ceases . 
in the consolidation process the reporting from the group 
undertakings is adjusted to ensure consistency with the ifrs 
principles applied by nordea .
note g47 “group structure” lists the major group undertak-
ings of the nordea group .
investments in associated undertakings and joint ventures 
the equity method of accounting is used for associated 
undertakings where the share of voting rights is between 
20% and 50% and/or where nordea has significant 
influence . significant influence is the power to participate 
in the financial and operating decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies . 
the equity method of accounting is also used for joint ven-
tures where nordea has joint control . joint control is the con-
tractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which 
exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control .
investments within nordea’s investment activities, which 
are classified as a venture capital organisations within 
nordea, are measured at fair value in accordance with the 
rules set out in ias 28 and ifrs 9 . further information on the 
equity method is disclosed in section 6 “recognition of oper-
ating income and impairment” .
profits from companies accounted for under the equity 
method are reported post-taxes in the income statement . 
consequently, the tax expense related to these profits is not 
included in the income tax expense for nordea .
nordea does generally not have any sales or contribution 
of assets to or from associated undertakings or joint ventures . 
other transactions between nordea and its associated under-
takings or joint ventures are not eliminated .
note g20 “investments in associated undertakings and 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
86
annual report 2020 nordea
joint ventures” lists the major associated undertakings of the 
nordea group .
structured entities
a structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a nar-
row and well-defined objective where voting rights are not 
the dominant factor in determining control . often legal 
arrangements impose strict limits on the decision-making 
powers of the management over the ongoing activities of a 
structured entity . the same consolidation requirements apply 
to these entities, but as voting rights do not decide whether 
control exists, other factors are used to determine control . 
power can exist due to agreements or other types of influ-
ence over a structured entity . nordea normally has power 
over entities sponsored or established by nordea . nordea has 
created a number of structured entities to allow customers to 
invest in assets invested in by the structured entity . some 
structured entities invest in tradable financial instruments, 
such as shares and bonds (mutual funds) . structured entities 
can also invest in structured credit products or acquire assets 
from customers of nordea, although only one such structured 
entity currently exists . nordea is generally the investment 
manager and has sole discretion about investments and other 
administrative decisions and thus has power over these 
entities . 
typically, nordea will receive service and commission fees 
in connection with the creation of the structured entity, or 
because it acts as an investment manager, a custodian or in 
some other function . such income is normally not significant 
enough to expose nordea to variability in returns and will 
thus not trigger consolidation . in some structured entities 
nordea has also supplied substantial parts of the funding in 
the form of fund units, loans or credit commitments . in these 
structured entities nordea is exposed to variability in returns 
and as the power over these entities affects the return, these 
structured entities are consolidated . nordea normally consid-
ers a share of more than 30% of the return produced by a 
structured entity to give rise to variability and thus give con-
trol . variability is measured as the sum of fees received and 
revaluation of assets held . for unit-linked and other contracts 
where the policyholder/depositor decides both the amount 
and which assets to invest in, nordea is considered to act as 
an agent and does thus not have control .
further information about consolidated and unconsolidat-
ed structured entities is disclosed in note g46 “interests in 
structured entities” .
currency translation of foreign entities/branches
the consolidated financial statements are presented in euro 
(eur) . when translating the financial statements of foreign 
entities and branches into eur from their functional currency, 
the assets and liabilities of foreign entities and branches have 
been translated at the closing rates, while items in the income 
statement and the statement of comprehensive income are 
translated at the average exchange rate for the year . the 
average exchange rates are calculated based on daily 
exchange rates divided by the number of banking days in the 
period . translation differences are recognised in other com-
prehensive income and are accumulated in the translation 
reserve in equity .
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acqui-
sition of group undertakings are treated as items in the same 
functional currency as the cash-generating unit to which they 
belong and are also translated at the closing rate . 
any remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at 
the closing rates with translation differences recognised in 
other comprehensive income .
information on the most important exchange rates is dis-
closed in the separate section 30 “exchange rates” .
6. recognition of operating income and impairment
net interest income
interest income and expense are calculated and recognised 
based on the effective interest rate method or, if considered 
appropriate, based on a method that results in an interest 
income or interest expense that is a reasonable approxima-
tion of using the effective interest rate method as the basis for 
the calculation . the effective interest includes fees considered 
to be an integral part of the effective interest rate of a finan-
cial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for 
risk) . the effective interest rate equals the rate that discounts 
the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of 
the financial asset or financial liability . 
interest income and expenses from financial instruments 
are, with the exceptions described below, classified as “net 
interest income” .
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value in markets and nordea life & 
pensions are classified as “net result from items at fair value” 
in the income statement . also, interest on the net funding of 
operations in markets and on assets measured at amortised 
cost in nordea life & pensions is recognised on this line to 
ensure that income and expense within these operations are 
presented in a consistent manner .
the interest component in foreign exchange swaps, and 
interest paid and received in interest rate swaps plus changes 
in accrued interest, is classified as “net result from items at 
fair value”, except for derivatives used for hedging, including 
economic hedges of nordea’s funding, where such compo-
nents are classified as “net interest income” . 
the yield on financial assets is presented on three lines in 
the income statement, interest income calculated using the 
effective interest rate method, other interest income and 
negative yield on financial assets . on the line interest income 
calculated using the effective interest method, nordea pres-
ents interest income from financial assets measured at amor-
tised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive 
income . this line item also includes the effect from hedge 
accounting relating to these assets . all other interest income 
is presented on the income statement line “other interest 
income”, except negative yield on financial assets which is 
presented on a separate line . negative yield on financial lia-
bilities is also disclosed separately in the income statement .
net fee and commission income
nordea earns commission income from different services pro-
vided to customers . the recognition of commission income 
depends on the purpose for which the fees are received . 
the major part of the revenues classified as “commission 
income” constitutes revenue from contracts with customers 
according to ifrs 15 . fee income is recognised either when or 
as performance obligations are satisfied . 
asset management commissions are generally recognised 
over time as services are performed and are normally based 
on assets under management . these fees are recognised 
based on the passage of time as the amount, and the right to 
the fee, corresponds to the value received by the customer . 
the fees are recognised monthly when the market value of 
the assets under management is determined . variable fees 
that are based on relative performance compared with a 
benchmark are in asset management rare, and they are nor-
mally fixed and recognised at least each reporting date . vari-
able fees that are not fixed on the reporting date cannot gen-
erally be recognised as the outcome is uncertain and subject 
to market development . 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
87
nordea annual report 2020
life & pension commission income includes fee income, 
referred to as expense loading, from insurance contracts and 
investment contracts with policyholders . investments con-
tracts are contracts that do not include enough insurance risk 
to be classified as insurance contracts . the expense loading is 
the part of the premium income considered to be compensa-
tion for the contract administration . the fee income is recog-
nised over time when the services are performed . these con-
tracts do generally not include any upfront fees .
fees categorised as deposit products, brokerage, securities 
issues and corporate finance, custody and issuer service and 
payment commissions are recognised both over time and at a 
point of time dependent on when the performance obliga-
tions are satisfied . brokerage, securities issues and corporate 
finance are mainly transactional driven for advising clients or 
for executing customer transactions in securities where the 
services are recognised at a point of time when the services 
related to the transaction are completed . payment commis-
sions include fees for cash management and payment solu-
tions that are recognised over time and transaction based 
fees for services like domestic and foreign payments that are 
recognised at a point of time . card fees are categorised as 
interchange fees which are recognised at a point of time 
when the customer uses the services, or as cardholder fees 
which are recognised over time or at a point of time if the fee 
is transaction based . 
lending fees that are not part of the effective interest of a 
financial instrument are recognised at a point of time . the 
amount of loan syndication fees as well as other transaction-
based fees received are recognised at a point of time when 
the performance obligation is satisfied, i .e . when the syndica-
tion or transaction has been performed . fees received for 
bilateral transactions are generally amortised as part of the 
effective interest of the financial instruments recognised . 
income from issued financial guarantees, and expenses for 
bought financial guarantees, are amortised over the duration 
of the instruments and classified as “fee and commission 
income” and “fee and commission expense”, respectively . 
other fee income is generally transaction based .
for transactional services which are performed at a point 
in time, payments are generally made instantly when the ser-
vices are performed . for services performed over time the 
service period is normally short . examples of such services 
are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset 
management services . for the services performed over time 
the right to payment generally arises at the end of the service 
period when the performance obligations are completed and 
it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consid-
eration will occur . however, for some services with fixed 
monthly fees the right to payment arises in advance . account 
receivables are recognised as other assets while unbilled 
receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract 
assets are recognised as prepaid expenses and accrued 
income . short-term advances received where the perfor-
mance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised 
as accrued expenses and prepaid income .
commission expenses are normally transaction based and 
recognised in the period when the services are received . 
initial contract costs for obtaining contracts are recognised 
as an asset and amortised if the costs are expected to be 
recovered . 
net result from items at fair value
realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instru-
ments and investment properties measured at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognised in the item “net result 
from items at fair value” . 
realised and unrealised gains and losses derive from:
• shares/participations and other share-related instruments
• interest-bearing securities and other interest-related 
instruments
• other financial instruments, including credit derivatives as 
well as commodity instruments/derivatives
• foreign exchange gains/losses
• investment properties, which include realised and unre-
alised income, for instance revaluation gains and losses . 
this line also includes realised results from disposals as 
well as the running property yield stemming from the 
holding of investment properties .
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value in markets and nordea life & 
pensions are classified as “net result from items at fair value” 
in the income statement . also, interest on the net funding of 
operations in markets and on assets measured at amortised 
cost in nordea life & pensions is recognised on this line to 
ensure that income and expense within these operations are 
presented in a consistent manner . 
also, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges and net 
investment hedges as well as recycled gains and losses on 
financial instruments classified into the category financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
recognised in “net result from items at fair value” . 
this item also includes realised gains and losses from 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost, such as 
interest compensation received and realised gains/losses on 
buybacks of issued own debt .
“net result from items at fair value” also includes fair value 
changes of hedged assets and liabilities at amortised cost in 
portfolio hedge of interest rate risk .
“net result from items at fair value” also includes losses 
from counterparty risk on instruments classified into the cat-
egory financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
except for loans in “hold” portfolios mandatorily held at fair 
value (sppi fails) which are presented on the row “net result 
on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair value” (see 
below) . impairment losses from instruments within other cat-
egories are recognised in the item “net loan losses” (see also 
the sub-section “net loan losses” below) . 
dividends received are recognised in the income statement 
as “net result from items at fair value” and classified as 
“shares/participations and other share-related instruments” 
in the note . income is recognised in the period in which the 
right to receive payment is established .
the income recognition and descriptions of the lines relat-
ing to life insurance are described in section 7 “income recog-
nition life insurance” below .
profit from companies accounted for 
under the equity method
profit from companies accounted for under the equity meth-
od is defined as the post-acquisition change in nordea’s share 
of net assets in associated undertakings and joint ventures . 
nordea’s share of items accounted for in other comprehensive 
income in associated undertakings and joint ventures is 
accounted for in other comprehensive income in nordea . 
profit from companies accounted for under the equity meth-
od is, as stated in section 5 “principles of consolidation”, 
reported in the income statement post-taxes . consequently, 
the tax expense related to this profit is excluded from the 
income tax expense for nordea . 
fair values are, at acquisition, allocated to the associated 
undertaking’s and the joint venture’s identifiable assets, liabil-
ities and contingent liabilities . any difference between 
nordea’s share of the fair values of the acquired identifiable 
net assets and the purchase price is goodwill or negative 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

88
annual report 2020 nordea
goodwill . goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
associated undertaking and the joint venture . subsequently 
the investment in the associated undertaking and the joint 
venture increases/decreases with nordea’s share of the post-
acquisition change in net assets in the associated undertak-
ing and the joint venture and decreases through received  
dividends and impairment . an impairment charge can be 
reversed in a subsequent period .
the change in nordea’s share of the net assets is generally 
based on monthly reporting from the associated undertak-
ings and joint ventures . for some associated undertakings 
and joint ventures not individually significant the change in 
nordea’s share of the net assets is based on the external 
reporting of the associated undertakings and the joint ven-
tures and affects the financial statements of nordea in the 
period in which the information is available . the reporting 
from the associated undertakings and the joint ventures is,  
if applicable, adjusted to comply with nordea’s accounting 
policies .
also, impairment on investments in associated undertak-
ings and joint ventures is classified as “profit from companies 
accounted for under the equity method” in the income state-
ment . the policies covering impairment of financial assets 
classified into the category amortised cost are disclosed in 
section 13 “financial instruments” and section 14 “loans to 
the public/credit institutions” . 
if observable indicators (loss events) indicate that an asso-
ciated undertaking or a joint ventures is impaired, an impair-
ment test is performed to assess whether there is objective 
evidence of impairment . the carrying amount of the invest-
ment in the associated undertaking or the joint venture is 
compared with the recoverable amount (higher of value in 
use and fair value less cost to sell) and the carrying amount  
is written down to the recoverable amount if required . 
impairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount 
increases . the carrying amount is then increased to the recov-
erable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised .
other operating income and other expenses
net gains from divestments of shares in group undertakings, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains on 
sale of tangible assets as well as other operating income, not 
related to any other income line, are generally recognised 
when it is probable that the benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to nordea and if the significant risks and 
rewards have been transferred to the buyer (generally when 
the transactions are finalised) .
resolution fees are presented as other expenses in the 
income statement .
net result on loans in hold portfolios 
mandatorily held at fair value
the item “net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily 
held at fair value” includes fair value adjustments of the mar-
gin component on loans in “hold” portfolios mandatorily held 
at fair value (sppi fails) . the loans are classified into the cat-
egory financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and 
presented in the item “loans to the public” on the balance 
sheet . the fair value adjustments are largely driven by chang-
es in credit risk .
losses from counterparty risk on other instruments classi-
fied into the category financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are presented as “net results from items at fair 
value” .
impairment losses from instruments within other catego-
ries than the category financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognised in the item “net loan losses” (see 
also the sub-sections “net loan losses” below) .
net loan losses
impairment losses from financial assets classified into the 
categories amortised cost and fair value through other com-
prehensive income (see section 13 “financial instruments”), in 
the items “loans to central banks”, “loans to credit institu-
tions”, “loans to the public” and “interest-bearing securities” 
on the balance sheet, are reported as ”net loan losses” 
together with losses from financial guarantees . losses are 
reported net of any collateral and other credit enhancements . 
nordea’s accounting policies for the calculation of impairment 
losses on loans can be found in section 14 “loans to the pub-
lic/credit institutions” .
counterparty losses on instruments classified into the cat-
egory financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
including credit derivatives but excluding loans held at fair 
value as described above, are reported under “net result from 
items at fair value” or, if related to loans in “hold” portfolios 
mandatorily held at fair value (sppi fails), on the line “net 
result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily held at fair 
value”, see above .
7. income recognition life insurance 
premiums received, and repayments to policyholders, related 
to the savings part of life insurance contracts are reported as 
increases or decreases of liabilities to policyholders . see fur-
ther information in section 19 “liabilities to policyholders” .
the total income from life insurance mainly consists of the 
following components:
• cost result
• insurance risk result
• risk and performance margin
• investment return on additional capital in life insurance
the result from these components is, except for the cost 
result and the risk and performance margin relating to unit-
linked and investment contracts, included in “net result from 
items at fair value” .
the cost result is the result of expense loading from policy-
holders and is included in the item “fee and commission 
income” together with the risk and performance margin relat-
ing to unit-linked and investment contracts . the related 
expenses are included in the items “fee and commission 
expense” and “operating expenses” . the policyholders’ part 
of a positive or negative cost result (profit sharing) is included 
on the note line “change in technical provisions, life insur-
ance” within note g6 “total net result from items at fair 
value” .
the insurance risk result consists of income from individual 
risk products and from unbundled life insurance contracts as 
well as health and personal accident insurance . the risk pre-
miums are amortised over the coverage period as the provi-
sions are reduced when insurance risk is released . a large 
part of the unbundled risk result from traditional life insur-
ance is subject to profit sharing, which means that the policy-
holders receive part of the net income or net deficit . risk 
income and the risk expenses are presented gross on the lines 
“insurance risk income, life insurance” and “insurance risk 
expense, life insurance” in note g6 “total net result from 
items at fair value” . the policyholders’ part of the result is 
included on the line “change in technical provisions, life 
insurance” in the note .
gains and losses derived from investments at nordea life 
& pensions are split between the relevant lines in note g6 
“total net result from items at fair value” as for any other 
investment at nordea . the lines include investment returns on 
assets held to cover liabilities to policyholders and return on 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – nordea group

nordea annual report 2020
the additional capital allocated to nordea life & pensions 
(shareholders capital in the nordea life & pensions group) .
the note line “change in technical provisions, life insur-
ance” in note g6 “total net result from items at fair value” 
includes: 
• investment returns on assets held to cover liabilities to pol-
icyholders (including liabilities from traditional life insur-
ance, unit-linked insurance and investment contracts), indi-
vidually transferred to policyholders’ accounts according to 
the contracts . 
• additional bonus (discretionary participation feature) to 
policyholders concerning traditional life insurance con-
tracts or any other transfers to the policyholders to cover a 
periodical deficit between the investment result and any 
agreed minimum benefit to policyholders .
• the risk and performance margin regarding traditional life 
insurance products according to local allocation rules in 
each nordea life & pensions unit and according to con-
tracts with policyholders . the recognition of a risk and per-
formance margin in the income statement is mainly condi-
tional on a positive result for traditional life insurance con-
tracts . risk and performance margins not possible to 
recognise in the current period due to poor investment 
results can, in some countries, partly or wholly be deferred 
to years with higher returns .
• the policyholders’ part of the cost- and risk result regard-
ing traditional life insurance contracts or unit-linked 
contracts .
the note line “change in collective bonus potential, life insur-
ance” in note g6 “total net result from items at fair value” 
relates only to traditional life insurance contracts . the line 
includes policyholders’ share of investment returns not yet 
individualised . the line also includes additional bonus (discre-
tionary participation feature) and amounts needed to cover a 
periodical deficit between the investment result and any min-
imum benefits to the policyholders .
8. recognition and derecognition of financial 
instruments on the balance sheet
derivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign 
exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecog-
nised from (and an asset or a liability is recognised as “other 
assets” or “other liabilities” on the balance sheet between 
the trade date and the settlement date) the balance sheet on 
the trade date . other financial instruments are recognised on 
the balance sheet on the settlement date .
financial assets, other than those for which trade date 
accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance 
sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial assets expire or are transferred to another party . the 
rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred 
when the counterparty has performed by e .g . repaying a loan 
to nordea, i .e . on the settlement date .
loans and other financial assets where cash flows are 
modified, or part of a restructuring, are derecognised, and a 
new loan recognised, if the terms and conditions of the new 
loan are substantially different from the old loan . this is nor-
mally the case if the present value of the cash flows of the 
new loan discounted by the original interest rate differs by 
more than 10% from the present value of the remaining 
expected cash flows of the old loan . the same principles 
apply to financial liabilities . the terms and conditions are also 
considered to be significantly different for financial assets 
where the modified cash flows are sppi, but the original cash 
flows were not sppi and vice versa .
in some cases, nordea enters into transactions where it 
transfers assets that are recognised on the balance sheet but 
retains either all or a portion of risks and rewards from the 
transferred assets . if all or substantially all risks and rewards 
are retained, the transferred assets are not derecognised from 
the balance sheet . if nordea’s counterparty can sell or 
repledge the transferred assets, the assets are reclassified to 
the item “financial instruments pledged as collateral” on the 
balance sheet . transfers of assets with retention of all or sub-
stantially all risks and rewards include e .g . securities lending 
agreements and repurchase agreements .
financial liabilities are derecognised from the balance 
sheet when the liability is extinguished . normally this occurs 
when nordea performs, for example when nordea repays a 
deposit to the counterparty, i .e . on the settlement date . finan-
cial liabilities under trade date accounting are generally 
derecognised and a liability is recognised as “other liabilities” 
on the balance sheet on the trade date . 
for further information, see sections “securities borrowing 
and lending agreements” and “repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements” within section 13 “financial instru-
ments”, as well as note g43 “transferred assets and obtained 
collaterals” .
9. translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies
the functional currency of each entity (subsidiary or branch) 
is decided based upon the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates . foreign currency is defined as any 
currency other than the functional currency of the entity . for-
eign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate 
on the date of the transaction . monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate on the balance sheet date .
exchange differences arising on the settlement of transac-
tions at rates different from those at the date of the transac-
tion, and unrealised translation differences on unsettled for-
eign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised 
in the income statement in the item “net result from items at 
fair value” .
10. hedge accounting
as part of nordea’s risk management policy, nordea has iden-
tified a series of risk categories with corresponding hedging 
strategies using derivative instruments, as set out in note g2 
“risk and liquidity management” (the market risk section) 
and note g19 “derivatives and hedge accounting” . 
when a hedging relationship meets the specified hedge 
accounting criteria set out in ias 39, nordea applies one of 
three types of hedge accounting: 
• fair value hedge accounting
• cash flow hedge accounting 
• hedges of net investments 
nordea has elected, as a policy choice permitted under ifrs 
9, to continue to apply hedge accounting in accordance with 
the carve-out version of ias 39 . 
the eu carve-out version enables a group of derivatives 
(or proportions thereof) to be viewed in combination and be 
designated as the hedging instrument . it also removes some 
of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting relating to 
hedging core deposits and under-hedging strategies . 
at inception, nordea formally documents how the hedging 
relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, including 
the economic relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk manage-
ment objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and 
the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of 
the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis .
the application of hedge accounting requires the hedge to

be highly effective . a hedge is regarded as highly effective if 
at inception and throughout its life it can be expected that 
changes in fair value of the hedged item, as regards the 
hedged risk, can be essentially offset by changes in fair value 
of the hedging instrument . the result should be within a 
range of 80–125% .
transactions that are entered into in accordance with 
nordea’s hedging objectives but do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, are economic hedge relationships .
fair value hedge accounting
fair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are 
hedging changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
attributable to a specific risk in accordance with nordea’s risk 
management policies set out in note g2 “risk and liquidity 
management” (the market risk section) and note g19 “deriv-
atives and hedge accounting” . the risk of changes in fair 
value of assets and liabilities in nordea’s financial statements 
originates mainly from loans, securities and deposits with a 
fixed interest rate, causing interest rate risk . changes in fair 
value from derivatives as well as changes in fair value of the 
hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged are recog-
nised separately in the income statement in the item “net 
result from items at fair value” . given that the hedge is effec-
tive, the change in fair value of the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument will offset . 
the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable 
to the risks hedged with the derivative instrument are reflect-
ed in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged 
item, which is also recognised in the income statement . the 
fair value changes of the hedged items held at amortised cost 
in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risks are reported sepa-
rately from the portfolio in the item “fair value changes of the 
hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk” on the 
balance sheet .
fair value hedge accounting in nordea is performed mainly 
on a portfolio basis . any ineffectiveness is recognised in the 
income statement under the item “net result from items at 
fair value” . 
hedged items
a hedged item in a fair value hedge can be a recognised sin-
gle asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment or a 
portion thereof . the hedged item can also be a group of 
assets, liabilities or firm commitments with similar risk char-
acteristics . hedged items in nordea consist of both individual 
assets or liabilities and portfolios of assets and/or liabilities .
hedging instruments
the hedging instruments used in nordea are predominantly 
interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, 
which are always held at fair value . 
hedge effectiveness
when assessing hedge effectiveness retrospectively, nordea 
measures the fair value of the hedging instruments and com-
pares the change in fair value of the hedging instrument to 
the change in fair value of the hedged item . the effectiveness 
measurement is made on a cumulative basis . 
if the hedging relationship does not fulfil the hedge 
accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued . 
for fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is measured at 
fair value through profit and loss and the change in fair value 
of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge relation-
ship is terminated, is amortised to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of the hedged 
item .
hedge ineffectiveness can arise from: 
• differences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and 
hedging instruments
• different interest rate curves applied to discount the 
hedged items and hedging instruments
• the effect of changes in nordea’s or a counterparty’s credit 
risk on the fair value of the hedging instrument or hedged 
items
• disparity between expected and actual prepayments of the 
loan portfolio . 
cash flow hedge accounting
in accordance with nordea’s risk management policies set 
out in note g2 “risk and liquidity management” (the market 
risk section) and note g19 “derivatives and hedge account-
ing”, cash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging 
the exposure to variability in future interest payments on 
instruments with variable interest rates and for hedging cur-
rency exposures . the portion of the gain or loss on the hedg-
ing instrument, determined to be an effective hedge, is recog-
nised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
cash flow hedge reserve in equity . the ineffective portion of 
the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recycled to the 
item “net result from items at fair value” in the income 
statement . 
gains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the 
cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other comprehen-
sive income are recycled and recognised in the income state-
ment in the same period as the hedged item affects profit or 
loss, normally in the period that interest income or interest 
expense is recognised .
hedged items
a hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable 
floating interest rate cash flows from recognised assets or lia-
bilities or from future assets or liabilities . nordea uses cash 
flow hedges when hedging currency risk in future payments 
of interest and principal in foreign currency and when hedg-
ing interest rate risk in lending with floating interest rates .
hedging instruments
the hedging instruments used at nordea are predominantly 
cross currency interest rate swaps, which are always held at 
fair value, where the currency component is designated as a 
cash flow hedge of currency risk and the interest component 
as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk . when hedging the 
interest rate risk in lending with floating interest rates, 
nordea uses interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments, 
which are always held at fair value .
hedge effectiveness
the hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring 
the effectiveness retrospectively of cash flow hedges, mean-
ing that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as 
proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in 
expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction (the 
currency component) . 
if the hedging relationship does not fulfil the hedge 
accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued . 
changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument 
will prospectively from the last time it was proven effective 
be accounted for in the income statement . the cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recog-
nised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity through other 
comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was 
effective is reclassified from equity to “net result from items 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
91
nordea annual report 2020
at fair value” in the income statement if the expected transac-
tion is no longer expected to occur . 
if the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, 
but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was 
effective remains in other comprehensive income until the 
transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur .
the possible sources of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedg-
es are generally the same as for those for fair value hedges 
described above . however, for cash flow hedges, prepayment 
risk is less relevant, and the causes of hedging ineffectiveness 
arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of fore-
cast future cash flows . 
hedges of net investments
in accordance with nordea’s risk management policies set 
out in the market risk section in note g2 “risk and liquidity 
management” and note g19 “derivatives and hedge account-
ing”, nordea hedges its foreign currency translation risk . 
translation risk is defined as the risk of loss from investments 
in foreign operations which have a functional currency differ-
ent from that of the group reporting currency (eur) . the 
hedging instruments used by nordea are foreign exchange 
forwards where only the spot component is designated in the 
hedging relationship . 
translation differences on financial instruments that are 
designated hedging instruments in a hedge of a net invest-
ment in a group undertaking are recognised in other compre-
hensive income, to the extent that the hedge is effective . this 
is performed in order to offset the translation differences 
affecting other comprehensive income when consolidating 
the group undertaking into nordea . hedge ineffectiveness 
can arise to the extent that the hedging instruments exceed in 
nominal terms the risk exposure from foreign operations . any 
ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in the 
item “net result from items at fair value” .
see also section 9 “translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies” .
11. determination of fair value of financial instruments
fair value is defined as the price that at the measurement 
date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
under current market conditions in the principal market for 
the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the asset or liability .
the existence of published price quotations in an active 
market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist 
they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabili-
ties . an active market for the asset or liability is a market in 
which transactions for the asset or liability occur with suffi-
cient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on 
an ongoing basis . the absolute level for liquidity and volume 
required for a market to be considered active varies with the 
instrument classes . for some classes low price volatility is 
seen, also for those instruments within the class where the 
trade frequency is high . for instruments in such a class the 
liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the 
age limit for the prices used for establishing fair value is 
higher .
the trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly in 
order to assess if markets are active or non-active . nordea is 
predominantly using published price quotations to establish 
fair value for items disclosed under the following balance 
sheet items:
• interest-bearing securities
• shares (listed)
• derivatives (listed)
• debt securities in issue (issued mortgage bonds in nordea 
kredit  realkreditaktieselskab)
if quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent actu-
al and regularly occurring market transactions or if quoted pric-
es are not available, fair value is established by using an appro-
priate valuation technique . the adequacy of the valuation tech-
nique, including an assessment of whether to use quoted prices 
or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular basis .
valuation techniques can range from simple discounted 
cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models . valua-
tion models are designed to apply observable market prices 
and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use 
of unobservable model parameters . the adequacy of the val-
uation model is assessed by measuring its capability to hit 
market prices . this is done by comparison of calculated prices 
to relevant benchmark data, e .g . quoted prices from exchang-
es, the counterparty´s valuations, price data from consensus 
services etc .
nordea is predominantly using valuation techniques to 
establish fair value for items disclosed under the following 
balance sheet items:
• loans to the public (mortgage loans in nordea kredit  
realkreditaktieselskab)
• interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an 
active market are not available)
• shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not 
available)
• derivatives (otc derivatives)
for financial instruments, where fair value is estimated by a 
valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables 
used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data 
from observable markets . by data from observable markets, 
nordea considers data that can be collected from generally 
available external sources and where this data is judged to 
represent realistic market prices . if non-observable data has a 
significant impact on the valuation, the instrument cannot be 
recognised initially at the fair value estimated by the valua-
tion technique and any upfront gains are thereby deferred 
and amortised through the income statement over the con-
tractual life of the instrument . the deferred upfront gains are 
subsequently released to income if the non-observable data 
becomes observable .
note g41 “assets and liabilities at fair value” provides a 
breakdown of fair values of financial instruments measured 
on the basis of:
• quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument 
(level 1), 
• valuation technique using observable data (level 2), and 
• valuation technique using non-observable data (level 3) .
the valuation models applied by nordea are consistent with 
accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instru-
ments and incorporate the factors that market participants 
consider when setting a price .
new valuation models are subject to approval by the 
model risk committee and all models are reviewed on a reg-
ular basis .
for further information, see note g41 “assets and liabilities 
at fair value” .
12. cash and balances with central banks
cash comprises legal tender and bank notes in foreign cur-
rencies . balances with central banks consist of deposits in 
accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

government authority, where the following conditions are 
fulfilled:
• the central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in 
the country where the institutions are established
• the balance is readily available at any time
13. financial instruments
classification of financial instruments
each financial instrument has been classified into one of the 
following categories:
financial assets:
• amortised cost 
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss:
 - mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and 
loss
 - designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value 
option)
• financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income
financial liabilities:
• amortised cost 
• financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:
 - mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and 
loss
 - designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value 
option)
the classification of a financial asset is dependent on the 
business model for the portfolio where the instrument is 
included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments 
of principal and interest (sppi) .
financial assets with cash flows that are not solely pay-
ments of principle and interest (sppi) are measured at fair 
value through profit and loss . all other assets are classified 
based on the business model . instruments included in a port-
folio with a business model where the intention is to keep the 
instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured 
at amortised cost . instruments included in a business model 
where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect 
the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income . 
financial assets included in any other business model are 
measured at fair value through profit and loss . 
in order to assess the business model, nordea has divided 
its financial assets into portfolios and/or sub-portfolios based 
on how groups of financial assets are managed together to 
achieve a particular business objective . to derive the right 
level on which portfolios are determined, nordea has taken 
the current business area structure into account . when deter-
mining the business model for each portfolio nordea has ana-
lysed the objective for the financial assets, as well as for 
instance past sales behaviour and management 
compensation . 
all financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value . the classification of financial instruments into dif-
ferent categories forms the basis for how each instrument is 
subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how 
changes in its value are recognised . in the table “classifica-
tion of financial instruments in note g40”, the classification of 
the financial instruments on nordea’s balance sheet into the 
different categories under ifrs 9 is presented .
amortised cost
financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are 
initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, includ-
ing transaction costs . subsequent to initial recognition, the 
instruments within this category are measured at amortised 
cost . in an amortised cost measurement, the difference 
between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised 
in the income statement over the remaining term using the 
effective interest rate method . amortised cost is defined as 
the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is 
measured at initial recognition minus the principal repay-
ments plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the 
effective interest method of any difference between that ini-
tial amount and the maturity amount and for financial assets, 
adjusted for any loss allowance . for more information about 
the effective interest rate method see section 6, “net interest 
income” . for information about impairment under ifrs 9, see 
section 14 below .
interest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost 
is recognised in the items “interest income” and “interest 
expense” in the income statement . 
this category consists of mainly all loans and deposits, 
except for reversed repurchase/repurchase agreements and 
securities borrowing/lending agreements in markets and 
mortgage loans in nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab . this 
category also includes interest bearing securities mainly relat-
ed to a portfolio of interest-bearing securities in life & pen-
sions in norway, subordinated liabilities and debt securities in 
issue, except for bonds issued in nordea kredit realkreditak-
tieselskab and issued structured bonds in markets .
financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction 
costs . all changes in fair values are recognised directly in the 
income statement in the item “net result from items at fair 
value” . however, fair value adjustments of the margin compo-
nent on loans in “hold” portfolios mandatorily held at fair 
value (sppi fails) are recognised in the income statement on 
the line “net result on loans in hold portfolios mandatorily 
held at fair value” .
the category consists of two sub-categories: mandatorily 
measured at fair value through profit and loss and designat-
ed at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option) .
the sub-category mandatorily measured at fair value 
through profit and loss contains mainly all assets in markets, 
trading liabilities in markets, interest-bearing securities 
included in part of the liquidity buffer, derivative instruments, 
shares, mortgage loans in the danish subsidiary nordea 
kredit realkreditaktieselskab and financial assets under 
“assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment con-
tracts” . deposits in pooled schemes and unit-linked invest-
ment contracts are contracts with customers and policyhold-
ers where the total risk is born by the policyholders . the 
deposits are invested in different types of financial assets on 
behalf of customers and policyholders . 
the major parts of the financial assets/liabilities classified 
into the category designated at fair value through profit or 
loss are issued bonds in nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab 
and assets and liabilities in nordea life & pensions . 
liabilities in nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab are clas-
sified into the category designated at fair value through profit 
or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mis-
match . when nordea grants mortgage loans to customers in 
accordance with the danish mortgage finance law nordea at 
the same time issues bonds with matching terms, so-called 
“match funding” . the customers can repay the loans either 
through repayments of the principal or by purchasing the 
issued bonds and returning them to nordea as a settlement 
of the loan . the bonds play an important part in the danish 
money market and nordea consequently buys and sells own 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

bonds in the market . the loans are measured at fair value 
through profit and loss because they fail the sppi (solely pay-
ments of principle and interest) criteria, and if the bonds 
were measured at amortised cost, this would give rise to an 
accounting mismatch . to avoid such an accounting mismatch 
nordea measures the bonds at fair value with all changes in 
fair value including changes in credit risk recognised in profit 
or loss . 
all assets in nordea life & pensions held under investment 
contracts are classified into the category designated at fair 
value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly 
reduce an accounting mismatch with the liabilities to the poli-
cyholders that are measured at fair value . the investment 
contracts (unit-linked) classified as “liabilities to policyhold-
ers” on the balance sheet are managed at fair value and con-
sequently classified into the category designated at fair value 
through profit or loss . changes in own credit risk are recog-
nised in profit and loss as recognising such changes in other 
comprehensive income would create an accounting mis-
match . assets held under insurance contracts (defined in sec-
tion 19 “liabilities to policyholders”), except for a portfolio of 
interest-bearing securities in norway, are classified into the 
category designated at fair value through profit or loss to 
reduce an accounting mismatch with the liabilities to policy-
holders that are generally measured at current value .
also, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment 
contracts that are not mandatorily measured at fair value 
through profit and loss are classified into the category desig-
nated at fair value through profit or loss to avoid an account-
ing mismatch with the related deposits . deposits in pooled 
schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are managed 
at fair value and consequently also classified into the catego-
ry designated at fair value through profit or loss . the value of 
these deposits is directly linked to assets in the contacts and 
there is consequently no effect from changes in own credit 
risk in these contracts . 
nordea also applies the fair value option on issued struc-
tured bonds in markets as these instruments include embed-
ded derivatives not closely related to the host contract . the 
change in fair value of these issued structured bonds is recog-
nised in profit and loss except for the changes in credit risk 
that are recognised in other comprehensive income .
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value through profit and loss in mar-
kets and nordea life & pensions are classified as “net result 
from items at fair value” .
financial asset at fair value through 
other comprehensive income
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs . this category mainly consists of the interest-bearing 
securities included in part of the liquidity buffer . changes in 
fair values, except for interest, foreign exchange effects and 
impairment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in 
equity through other comprehensive income . interest is rec-
ognised in the item “interest income”, foreign exchange 
effects in “net result from items at fair value” and impairment 
losses in the item “net loan losses” in the income statement . 
when an instrument is disposed of, the fair value changes 
previously accumulated in the fair value reserve in other com-
prehensive income are removed from equity and recognised 
in the income statement in the item “net result from items at 
fair value” . for information about impairment under ifrs 9, 
see section 14 below .
hybrid (combined) financial instruments
hybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts con-
taining a host contract and an embedded derivative instru-
ment . such combinations arise predominantly from the issu-
ance of structured debt instruments, such as issued index-
linked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps .
index-linked bonds issued by group treasury are consid-
ered to be part of the funding activities . the host, the zero-
coupon bond, is measured at amortised cost . the embedded 
derivatives in those instruments are separated from the host 
contract and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives at fair 
value, if the economic characteristics and risks of the embed-
ded derivative are not closely related to the economic charac-
teristics and risks of the host contract, and the embedded 
derivative meets the definition of a derivative instrument . 
changes in fair values of the embedded derivatives are rec-
ognised in the income statement in the item “net result from 
items at fair value” .
for structured bonds issued by markets, nordea applies 
the fair value option, and the entire combined instrument, the 
host contract together with the embedded derivative, is mea-
sured at fair value through profit or loss . changes in fair val-
ues are recognised in the income statement in the item “net 
result from items at fair value” and presented as “debt securi-
ties in issue” on the balance sheet .
securities borrowing and lending agreements
generally, securities borrowings and securities lending trans-
actions are entered into on a collateralised basis . unless the 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, the securities 
are not recognised on or derecognised from the balance 
sheet . in cases where the counterparty is entitled to resell or 
repledge the securities, the securities are reclassified to the 
balance sheet item “financial instruments pledged as 
collateral” .
securities in securities lending transactions are also dis-
closed in the item “assets pledged as security for own 
liabilities” . 
cash collateral advanced (securities borrowing) to coun-
terparties is recognised on the balance sheet as “loans to 
central banks”, “loans to credit institutions” or as “loans to 
the public” . cash collateral received (securities lending) from 
counterparties is recognised on the balance sheet as “depos-
its by credit institutions” or as “deposits and borrowings from 
the public” .
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
securities delivered under repurchase agreements and secu-
rities received under reverse repurchase agreements are not 
derecognised from or recognised on the balance sheet . in 
cases where the counterparty has the right to resell or 
repledge the securities, the securities are reclassified to the 
balance sheet line “financial instruments pledged as 
collateral” .
securities delivered under repurchase agreements are also 
disclosed in the item “assets pledged as security for own 
liabilities” . 
cash received under repurchase agreements is recognised 
on the balance sheet as “deposits by credit institutions” or as 
“deposits and borrowings from the public” . cash delivered 
under reverse repurchase agreements is recognised on the 
balance sheet as “loans to central banks”, “loans to credit 
institutions” or as “loans to the public” .
a sale of a security not owned by nordea is defined as a 
short sale and triggers the recognition of a trading liability 
(sold not held securities) presented as “other liabilities” on 
the balance sheet . the short sale is generally covered through 
a securities financing transaction (sft), normally a reverse 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

annual report 2020 nordea
repurchase agreement or other forms of securities borrowing 
agreements .
derivatives
all derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet and mea-
sured at fair value . derivatives with total positive fair values, 
including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the 
item “derivatives” on the asset side . derivatives with total 
negative fair values, including any accrued interest, are recog-
nised as liabilities in the item “derivatives” on the liability 
side .
realised and unrealised gains and losses from derivatives 
are recognised in the income statement in the item “net 
result from items at fair value” . 
offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
nordea offsets financial assets and liabilities on the balance 
sheet if there is a legal right to offset, in the ordinary course 
of business and in case of default, bankruptcy and insolvency 
of nordea and the counterparties, and if the intent is to settle 
the items net or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously . 
exchanged-traded derivatives are generally accounted for 
as settled on a daily basis when cash is paid or received, and 
the instrument is reset to market terms . derivative assets, 
derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash col-
lateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses 
are offset on the balance sheet if the transaction currency 
and the central counterparty is the same . derivative assets, 
derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash col-
lateral liabilities related to bilateral otc derivative transac-
tions are not offset on the balance sheet .
in addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and 
reverse repurchase transaction with ccp are offset on the 
balance sheet if the assets and liabilities relate to the same 
central counterparty, are settled in the same currency and 
have the same maturity date . loans and deposits related to 
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that are 
made in accordance with the global master repurchase 
agreement (gmra) are offset on the balance sheet if the 
assets and liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are set-
tled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and 
are settled through the same settlement institution .
issued debt and equity instruments
a financial instrument issued by nordea is either classified as 
a financial liability or equity . issued financial instruments are 
classified as a financial liability if the contractual arrangement 
results in nordea having a present obligation to either deliver 
cash or another financial asset or a variable number of equity 
instruments to the holder of the instrument . if this is not the 
case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and 
classified as equity, net of transaction costs . where issued 
financial instruments contain both liability and equity compo-
nents, these are accounted for separately . 
14. loans to the public/credit institutions
scope
financial instruments classified as amortised cost or fair 
value through other comprehensive income are in scope for 
recognising impairment due to credit risk . this includes assets 
recognised on the balance sheet as “loans to central banks”, 
loans to credit institutions”, “loans to the public” and “inter-
est-bearing securities” . these balance sheet lines also include 
assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, which are 
not in scope for impairment calculations . see section 13 above 
and note g40 on “classification of financial instruments” .
off-balance-sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and 
loan commitments are also in scope for impairment 
calculations .
recognition and presentation
amortised cost assets are recognised gross with an offsetting 
allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not 
regarded as final . the allowance account is disclosed net on 
the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is 
disclosed separately in the notes . changes in the allowance 
account are recognised in the income statement and classi-
fied as “net loan losses” .
if the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as 
a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the 
related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised . an 
impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has 
filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the 
economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when 
nordea forgives its claims either through a legally based or 
voluntary reconstruction, or when nordea, for other reasons, 
deem it unlikely that the claim will be recovered . 
provisions for off-balance sheet exposures are classified as 
“provisions” on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions 
classified as “net loan losses” .
assets classified as fair value through other comprehen-
sive income are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet . 
impairment losses calculated in accordance with ifrs 9 are 
recognised in the income statement and classified as “net 
loan losses” . any fair value adjustments are recognised in 
“other comprehensive income” .
impairment testing 
nordea classifies all exposures into stages on an individual 
basis . stage 1 includes assets where there has been no signifi-
cant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, stage 2 
includes assets where there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets . nordea 
monitors whether there are indicators of exposures being 
credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying events that have a 
detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows (loss 
event) . nordea applies the same definition of default as the 
capital requirements regulation . more information on the 
identification of loss events can be found in note g2 “risk and 
liquidity management” . exposures without individually calcu-
lated allowances will be covered by the model-based impair-
ment calculation .
for significant exposures that have been individually iden-
tified as credit impaired, the measurement of the impairment 
loss is made on an individual basis . the carrying amount of 
the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present 
value of expected future cash flows . if the carrying amount is 
higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss . 
the expected cash flows are discounted with the original 
effective interest rate and include the fair value of the collat-
eral and other credit enhancements . the estimate is based on 
three different forward-looking scenarios that are probability 
weighted to derive the net present value .
for insignificant exposures that have been individually 
identified as credit impaired, the measurement of the impair-
ment loss is measured using the model described below but 
based on the fact that the exposures are already in default . 
model-based allowance calculation
for exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical 
model is used for calculating impairment losses . the provi-
sions are calculated as the exposure at default times the 
probability of default times the loss given default . for assets 
in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

months, while it for assets in stages 2 and 3 are based on the 
expected lifetime of the asset .
the provisions for exposures where there has been no sig-
nificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are 
based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1) . provisions for 
exposures where there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit 
impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2) . 
this is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired expo-
sures in stage 3 .
nordea uses two different models to identify whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk or not . for assets 
held at transition on 1 january 2018, the change in internal 
rating and scoring data is used to determine whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk or not . internal 
rating/scoring information is used to assess the risk of the 
customers and a deterioration in rating/scoring indicates an 
increase in the credit risk of the customer . nordea has con-
cluded that it is not possible to calculate the lifetime pds at 
origination without the use of hindsight for assets already 
recognised on the balance sheet at transition . changes to the 
lifetime probability of default (pd) is used as the trigger for 
assets recognised after transition .
for assets evaluated based on lifetime pds, nordea uses a 
mix of absolute and relative changes in pd as the transfer 
criterion . 
• retail customers with an initial 12-month pd below 1%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
100% and an absolute increase in 12-month pd above  
45 bp are transferred to stage 2 . 
•  retail customers with an initial 12-month pd above or 
equal to 1%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
100% or an absolute increase in 12-month pd above 300 
bp are transferred to stage 2 . 
• nonretail customers with an initial 12-month pd below 
0 .5%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
150% and an absolute increase in 12-month pd above  
20 bp are transferred to stage 2 . 
• nonretail customers with an initial 12-month pd above or 
equal to 0 .5%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
150% or an absolute increase in 12-month pd above  
400 bps are transferred to stage 2 .
for assets where rating and scoring models are used, the 
change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the 
significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime pd . in 
addition, customers with forbearance measures and custom-
ers with payments more than thirty days past due are also 
transferred to stage 2, unless already identified as credit 
impaired (stage 3) . exposures with forbearance measures will 
stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when 
the measures were introduced . once transferred back to 
stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated 
as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant 
increase in credit risk . exposures more than 90 days past due 
will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification 
will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in 
default . such exposures will be classified as stage 2 .
nordea does not use the “low credit risk exemption” in the 
banking operations but uses it for a minor portfolio of inter-
est-bearing securities in the insurance operations . 
when calculating provisions, including the staging assess-
ment, the calculation is based on probability weighted for-
ward-looking information . nordea applies three macroeco-
nomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in expected cred-
g1. accounting policies, cont.
it losses . the different scenarios are used to adjust the relevant 
parameters for calculating expected losses and a probability 
weighted average of the expected losses under each scenario 
is recognised as provisions . the model is based on data col-
lected before the reporting date, requiring nordea to identify 
events that should affect the provisions after the data is 
sourced to the model calculation . management evaluates 
these events and adjusts the provisions if deemed necessary .
write-offs
a write-off is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the 
balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision . 
when assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be 
written off as soon as possible, regardless of whether the 
legal claim remains or not . a write-off can take place before 
legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have 
been concluded in full . although an uncollectable asset is 
removed or written off from the balance sheet, the customer 
remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt . when 
assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and 
determining if write-offs are required, exposures with the fol-
lowing characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not 
exhaustive):
• exposures past due more than 90 days . if, following this 
assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed 
as unrecoverable, it is written off .
• exposures under insolvency procedure where the collater-
alisation of the exposure is low .
• exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb 
proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and therefore 
estimated recoveries are expected to be low .
• a partial write-off may be warranted where there is rea-
sonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of 
the borrower to repay the full amount, i .e . a significant 
level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to 
be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the 
execution of collateral .
• restructuring cases .
discount rate
the discount rate used to measure impairment is the original 
effective interest rate for loans attached to an individual cus-
tomer or, if applicable, to a group of loans . if considered 
appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that 
results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation 
of using the effective interest rate method as basis for the 
calculation .
restructured loans and modifications
in this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where 
nordea has granted concessions to the obligor due to their 
financial difficulties and where this concession has resulted in 
an impairment loss for nordea . after a reconstruction the loan 
is normally regarded as not impaired if it performs according 
to the new conditions . in the event of a recovery, the payment 
is reported as a recovery of loan losses . 
modifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to 
customers in financial difficulties (forbearance) reduce the 
gross carrying amount of the loan . normally this reduction is 
less than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in 
the income statement due to modifications . if significant, the 
gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced . 
assets taken over for protection of claims
in a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans 
to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an 
asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the 
obligor or other assets . assets taken over for protection of 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
96
annual report 2020 nordea
claims are reported on the same balance sheet line as similar 
assets already held by nordea . for example, a property taken 
over, not held for nordea’s own use, is reported together with 
other investment properties .
at initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of 
claims are recognised at fair value and the possible difference 
between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of 
the assets taken over is recognised as “net loan losses” . the 
fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its 
cost or amortised cost value, as applicable . in subsequent 
periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued 
in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropri-
ate type of asset . investment properties are then measured at 
fair value . financial assets that are foreclosed are generally 
classified into the categories “fair value through profit or 
loss” and measured at fair value . changes in fair values are 
recognised in the income statement under the line “net result 
from items at fair value” .
any change in value, after the initial recognition of the 
asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line 
with the group’s presentation policies for the appropriate 
asset . the item ” net loan losses” in the income statement is, 
after the initial recognition of the asset taken over, conse-
quently not affected by any subsequent remeasurement of 
the asset .
15. leasing
nordea as lessor
finance leases
nordea’s leasing operations mainly comprise finance leases . a 
finance lease is reported as a receivable from the lessee in 
the balance sheet item “loans to the public” at an amount 
equal to the net investment in the lease . the lease payment, 
excluding cost of services, is recorded as repayment of princi-
pal and interest income . the income allocation is based on a 
pattern reflecting a constant periodic return on the net invest-
ment outstanding in respect of the finance lease . 
operating leases
assets subject to operating leases on the balance sheet are 
reported in accordance with the nature of the assets, in gen-
eral as properties and equipment . leasing income is recog-
nised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
and classified as “net interest income” . the depreciation of 
the leased assets is calculated based on nordea’s deprecia-
tion policy for similar assets and reported as “depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment charges of tangible and intan-
gible assets” in the income statement . 
nordea as lessee
at inception nordea assesses whether a contract is or con-
tains a lease . a lease is a contract that conveys the user the 
right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration . 
the right to use an asset in a lease contract is recognised 
on the commencement date as a right-of-use (rou) asset 
and the obligation to pay lease payments is recognised as a 
lease liability . the rou asset is initially measured as the pres-
ent value of the lease payments plus initial direct costs and 
the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset less any lease 
incentives received . non-lease components are separated . 
the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each 
contract is the incremental borrowing rate at commencement 
of the contract . in significant premises contracts the rate 
implicit in the contract may be used if available . 
the rou assets are presented as similar owned assets and 
the lease liabilities as “other liabilities” on the balance sheet . 
the depreciation policy is consistent with that of similar 
owned assets, but the depreciation period is normally capped 
at the end of the lease term . impairment testing of the right-
of-use assets is performed following the same principles as 
for similar owned assets . interest expense on lease liabilities 
is presented as “interest expense” in the income statement . 
the assets are classified as land and buildings and equip-
ment . equipment mainly comprises vehicles and it hardware . 
nordea applies the practical expedient for short-term con-
tracts (with a contract term of 12 months or less) both for 
land and buildings and for equipment . the practical expedi-
ent for low value assets is applied to equipment . short-term 
and low value contracts are not recognised on the balance 
sheet and the payments are recognised as expenses in the 
income statement as “other expenses” on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term unless another systematic way better 
reflects the time pattern of nordea’s benefit . 
leases are mainly related to office premises contracts but 
also to company cars, it hardware and other assets normal to 
the business . the premises are mainly divided into banking 
branches and headoffices . the premises contracts are actively 
managed with focus on the effective use of the premises and 
the changes in the business environment . the lease payments 
generally include fixed payments and especially in premises 
contracts also variable payments that depend on an index . 
residual value guarantees, or purchase options are generally 
not used .
the lease term is the expected lease term . this comprises 
the non-cancellable period of lease contracts and any options 
that nordea is reasonably certain to exercise . the length of 
contracts with no end date is estimated by considering all 
facts and circumstances . 
the expected lease term of most of the premises contracts 
is 1–10 years whereas the expected lease term of the main 
head office contracts in the nordic countries is 15–25 years . 
these contracts generally have renewal options . 
embedded leases
agreements can contain a right to use an asset in return for a 
payment, or a series of payments, although the agreement is 
not in the legal form of a leasing contract . if applicable, these 
assets are separated from the contract and accounted for as 
leased assets .
16. intangible assets
intangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets with-
out physical substance . the assets are under nordea’s control, 
which means that nordea has the power and rights to obtain 
the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying 
resource . the intangible assets in nordea mainly consist of 
goodwill, it development/computer software and customer-
related intangible assets .
goodwill
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of nordea’s share of net identifiable assets 
of the acquired group undertaking/associated undertaking/
joint venture at the date of acquisition . goodwill on acquisi-
tion of group undertakings and joint ventures is included in 
“intangible assets” . goodwill on acquisitions of associated 
undertaking is not recognised as a separate asset but includ-
ed in “investments in associated undertakings” . goodwill is 
tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired . goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impair-
ment losses . impairment losses on goodwill cannot be 
reversed in subsequent periods . goodwill related to associ-
ated undertakings and joint ventures is not tested for impair-
ment separately but included in the total carrying amount of 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

97
nordea annual report 2020
the associated undertakings and the joint ventures . the poli-
cies covering impairment testing of associated undertakings 
and joint ventures are disclosed in section 6 “recognition of 
operating income and impairment” .
it development/computer software
costs associated with maintaining computer software pro-
grams are expensed as incurred . costs directly associated 
with major software development investments, with the abil-
ity to generate future economic benefits, are recognised as 
intangible assets . these costs include software development 
staff costs and overhead expenditures directly attributable to 
preparing the asset for use . computer software also includes 
acquired software licences not related to the function of a 
tangible asset .
amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
useful life of the software, generally a period of 3 to 5 years, 
and in some circumstances for strategic infrastructure up to a 
maximum of 10 years .
customer-related intangible assets
in business combinations a portion of the purchase price is 
normally allocated to a customer-related intangible asset, if 
the asset is identifiable and under nordea’s control . an intan-
gible asset is identifiable if it arises from contractual or legal 
rights, or could be separated from the entity and sold, trans-
ferred, licensed, rented or exchanged . the asset is amortised 
over its useful life, generally over 10 years .
impairment 
goodwill and it development not yet taken into use are not 
amortised but tested for impairment annually irrespective of 
any indications of impairment . impairment testing is also per-
formed more frequently if required due to any indication of 
impairment . the impairment charge is calculated as the dif-
ference between the carrying amount and the recoverable 
amount . 
at each balance sheet date, all intangible assets with defi-
nite useful lives, including it development taken into use, are 
reviewed for indications of impairment . if such indications 
exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying 
amount of the intangible asset is fully recoverable . 
the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or the cash-gen-
erating unit, which is defined as the smallest identifiable 
group of assets that generate largely independent cash flows 
in relation to other assets . for goodwill and it development 
not yet taken into use, the cash generating units are defined 
as the operating segments . the value in use is the present 
value of the cash flows expected to be realised from the asset 
or the cash-generating unit . the cash flows are assessed 
based on the asset or cash-generating unit in its current con-
dition and discounted at a rate based on the long-term risk-
free interest rate plus a risk premium . if the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss 
is recognised . see note g21 “intangible assets” for more infor-
mation on the impairment testing .
17. properties and equipment
properties and equipment include own-used properties, 
leasehold improvements, it equipment, furniture and other 
equipment . items of properties and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses . the cost of an item of properties and 
equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any direct-
ly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working con-
dition for its intended use . when parts of an item of property 
and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items .
properties and equipment are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets . the esti-
mates of the useful life of different assets are reassessed on a 
yearly basis . below follow the current estimates:
buildings  
30–75 years
equipment 
3–5 years
leasehold  
improvements  
 changes within buildings the shorter of 10 
years and the remaining leasing term . new 
construction the shorter of the principles 
used for owned buildings and the remain-
ing leasing term . fixtures installed in 
leased properties are depreciated over the 
shorter of 10–20 years and the remaining 
leasing term .
at each balance sheet date, nordea assesses whether there is 
any indication that an item of property and equipment may 
be impaired . if any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated, and any impairment loss is 
recognised .
impairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount 
increases . the carrying amount is then increased to the recov-
erable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised .
18. investment properties
investment properties are primarily properties held to earn 
rent and/or capital appreciation . the majority of the proper-
ties in nordea are attributable to nordea life & pensions . 
nordea applies the fair value model for subsequent measure-
ment of investment properties . the best evidence of a fair 
value is normally given by quoted prices in an active market 
for similar properties in the same location and condition . as 
these prices are rarely available, discounted cash flow projec-
tion models based on reliable estimates of future cash flows 
are also used . 
net rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value 
adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement 
as “net result from items at fair value” .
19. liabilities to policyholders
liabilities to policyholders include obligations according to 
insurance contracts and investment contracts with policy-
holders for all the companies in nordea life & pensions, 
including companies in sweden, norway, finland and 
denmark .
an insurance contract is defined as “a contract under 
which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance 
risks from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to 
compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future 
event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder” .
investment contracts are contracts with policyholders that 
have the legal form of insurance contracts but where the 
insurance risk transfer has been assessed to be insignificant .
the insurance risk is generally calculated as the risk sum 
payable as a percentage of the reserve behind the contract at 
the beginning of the contract period .

the contracts can be divided into the following classes:
•  insurance contracts:
 - traditional life insurance contracts with and without dis-
cretionary participation feature
 - unit-linked contracts with significant insurance risk
 - health and personal accident 
• investment contracts:
 - investment contracts with discretionary participation 
feature
 - investment contracts without discretionary participation 
feature
insurance contracts 
the measurement principles under local gaap have been 
maintained, consequently resulting in a non-uniform account-
ing policies method on consolidation .
the measurement of traditional life insurance provisions in 
denmark and finland are prepared by calculating the present 
value of future benefits, to which the policyholders are enti-
tled . the calculation includes assumptions about market con-
sistent discounting rates as well as expenses and life risk . the 
discount rate is based on the liabilities’ current term . in den-
mark, the provision also includes bonus potential on paid pol-
icies and on future premiums .
in norway the traditional life insurance provisions are 
mainly calculated on the basis of a prospective method . the 
discount rate used is equal to the original tariff rates adjusted 
for assumptions about expenses and risk . 
the accounting policy for each company is based on the 
local structure of the business and is related to the solvency 
rules and national regulations concerning profit sharing and 
other requirements about collective bonus potential (not allo-
cated provisions that protect the policyholders) .
unit-linked contracts represent life insurance provisions 
relating to unit-linked policies written either with or without 
an investment guarantee . unit-linked contracts classified as 
insurance contracts include the same insurance risk elements 
as traditional insurance contracts . these contracts are mainly 
recognised and measured at fair value on the basis of: 
• the fair value of the assets linked to the unit-linked con-
tracts, and
• the estimated present value of the insurance risk which is 
calculated in the same way as traditional insurance con-
tracts considering the impact on every risk element includ-
ed in the cash flows .
health and personal accident provisions include premium 
reserves and claims outstanding . this item is recognised and 
measured on deferred basis, the same principle as used for 
general insurance contracts . 
investment contracts 
contracts classified as investment contracts are contracts 
with policyholders which do not transfer sufficient insurance 
risk to be classified as insurance contracts and are written 
with an investment guarantee or a discretionary participation 
feature .
investment contracts with discretionary participation fea-
tures are, in line with ifrs 4, accounted for as insurance con-
tracts using local accounting principles . nordea life & pen-
sions has only a small number of these contracts .
investment contracts without discretionary participation 
features are recognised and measured at fair value in accor-
dance with ifrs 9 “financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement”, equal to fair value of the assets linked to 
these contracts . these assets are classified into the category 
designated at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or 
significantly reduce an accounting mismatch .
discretionary participating features (dpf)
some traditional life insurance contracts and investment con-
tracts include a contractual right for the policyholder to 
receive significant benefits in addition to guaranteed benefits . 
nordea has discretion to pay these additional benefits as 
bonus on risk result, expense result and interest rate . these 
dpf-contracts (collective bonus potential) are classified as 
liabilities on the balance sheet .
collective bonus potential includes amounts allocated but 
not attributed to the policyholders . in finland, collective bonus 
potential includes the policyholder’s part of the total unre-
alised investment gains and bonus potential on paid policies 
and future premiums (the difference between retrospective 
and market consistent prospective measurement principles of 
the insurance contracts) . in norway, collective bonus potential 
includes the policyholder’s part of both the total unrealised 
investment gains and additional reserves . in sweden and den-
mark, the main valuation principle is fair value (insurance con-
tracts) . the policyholder’s part of both realised and unrealised 
investment gains is therefore included on the balance sheet 
representing either “change in technical provisions, life insur-
ance” and/or “change in collective bonus potentials, life 
insurance”, depending on whether the investment result is 
allocated or not . both the mentioned lines are included on  
the balance sheet line “liabilities to policyholders” .
liability adequacy test
the adequacy of insurance provisions is assessed at each 
reporting date to ensure that the carrying amount of the lia-
bilities is higher than the best estimate of future cash flows 
discounted with current interest rates . if needed, additional 
provisions are accounted for and recognised in the income 
statement . 
20. assets and deposits in pooled schemes 
and unit-linked investment contracts
deposit in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment con-
tracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where 
the total risk is born by the customers or the policyholders . 
the deposits are invested in different types of financial assets 
on behalf of the customers and policyholders . 
unit-linked investment contracts include investment con-
tracts written without any investment guarantees and that do 
not transfer sufficient insurance risk to be classified as insur-
ance contracts .
the assets and deposits in these contracts are recognised 
and measured at fair value as described in section 13 “finan-
cial instrument” above .
21. taxes
the item “income tax expense” in the income statement com-
prises current and deferred income tax . the income tax expense 
is recognised in the income statement, unless the tax effect 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case the tax effect is recognised in 
other comprehensive income or in equity respectively . 
current tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax pay-
able in respect of previous years .
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, using the 
balance sheet method, for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation pur-
poses . deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry for-
ward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits . deferred 
tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising on ini-
tial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is 
g1. accounting policies, cont.

not a business combination and that affects neither account-
ing nor taxable profit, nor for differences relating to invest-
ments in group undertakings, associated undertakings and 
joint ventures to the extent that it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future . in addition, deferred tax 
is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on 
the initial recognition of goodwill .
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date . deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties are not discounted . a deferred tax asset is recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the temporary differences, tax 
losses carry forward and unused tax credits can be utilised . 
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and 
are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised . 
tax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations 
where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will 
accept the treatment used in the tax filings . uncertain tax posi-
tions are considered independently or as a group, depending 
on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncer-
tainty . if nordea concludes it is not probable that the taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of 
uncertainty is reflected when determining the related taxable 
profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax cred-
its or tax rates . this is done by using either the most likely 
amount or the expected value, depending on which method 
better predicts the outcome of the uncertainty . uncertain tax 
treatment can affect both current tax and deferred tax .
current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
when the legal right to offset exists and nordea intends to 
either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or to recover 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously . deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally offset if there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities .
22. provisions
provisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised 
when nordea has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event if it is probable (i .e . more likely than 
not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic ben-
efits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation . the 
amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the 
end of the reporting period .
provisions relating to employee benefits are further 
described in section 24 and provisions relating to financial 
guarantees contract and credit commitments are described in 
section 26 . 
contingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on the 
balance sheet but disclosed in note g38 “contingent liabili-
ties” unless the possibility of an outflow is remote . a contin-
gent liability is a possible obligation whose existence will be 
confirmed only by future event(s) not wholly within nordea’s 
control or a present obligation that is not recognised because 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot 
be measured within sufficient reliability . 
23. earnings per share
basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit 
or loss attributable to shareholders of nordea bank abp by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
during the period . 
diluted earnings per share are determined by adjusting the 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for 
the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, consisting 
of rights to performance shares in the long-term incentive 
programmes and contracts on nordea shares that can be set-
tled in nordea shares, i .e . derivatives such as options and 
warrants and their equivalents . such contracts affect diluted 
earnings per share when and only when the average price of 
ordinary shares during the period exceeds the exercise price 
of the options or warrants (i .e . they are in the money) . 
the potential ordinary shares are only considered to be 
dilutive on the balance sheet date, if all performance condi-
tions are fulfilled and if a conversion to ordinary shares would 
decrease earnings per share . the rights are furthermore con-
sidered dilutive only when the exercise price, with the addi-
tion of future services, is lower than the period’s average 
share price .
24. employee benefits
all forms of consideration given by nordea to its employees 
as compensation for services performed are employee ben-
efits . short-term benefits are to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period when the services have 
been performed . post-employment benefits are benefits pay-
able after the termination of the employment . post-employ-
ment benefits in nordea consist only of pensions . termination 
benefits normally arise if an employment is terminated before 
the normal retirement date, or if an employee accepts an offer 
of voluntary redundancy .
short-term benefits
short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable sal-
ary . both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the peri-
od when the employees have performed services to nordea . 
nordea has also issued share-based payment programmes, 
which are further described in section 27 “share-based 
payment” . 
more information can be found in note g8 “staff costs” .
post-employment benefits
pension plans
the companies within nordea have various pension plans, 
consisting of both defined benefit pension plans and defined 
contribution pension plans, reflecting national practices and 
conditions in the countries where nordea operates . defined 
benefit pension plans are predominantly sponsored in swe-
den, norway and finland . the major defined benefit pension 
plans are funded schemes covered by assets in pension 
funds/foundations . if the fair value of plan assets, associated 
with a specific pension plan, is lower than the gross present 
value of the defined benefit obligation determined using the 
projected unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as 
a liability (“retirement benefit liabilities”) . if not, the net 
amount is recognised as an asset (“retirement benefit 
assets”) . non-funded pension plans are recognised as 
“retirement benefit liabilities” .
most pensions in denmark, but also plans in other coun-
tries, are based on defined contribution arrangements that 
hold no pension liability for nordea . all defined benefit pen-
sion plans are closed for new employees . nordea also con-
tributes to public pension systems .
pension costs
obligations for defined contribution pension plans are recog-
nised as an expense as the employee renders services to the 
entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that ser-
vice becomes due . nordea’s net obligation for defined benefit 
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by esti-
mating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned for their service in the current and prior periods . that 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group

annual report 2020 nordea
benefit is discounted to determine its present value . actuarial 
calculations including the projected unit credit method are 
applied to assess the present value of defined benefit obliga-
tions and related costs, based on several actuarial and finan-
cial assumptions (as disclosed in note g34 “retirement ben-
efit obligations”) . 
when establishing the present value of the obligation and 
the fair value of any plan assets, remeasurement effects may 
arise as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions and 
experience effects (actual outcome compared to assump-
tions) . the remeasurement effects are recognised immedi-
ately in equity through other comprehensive income . 
when the calculation results in a benefit the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan .
social security contribution is calculated and accounted for 
based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and are 
included on the balance sheet as “retirement benefit liabili-
ties” or “retirement benefit assets” .
discount rate in defined benefit pension plans
the discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality 
corporate bonds, where a deep enough market for such 
bonds exists . covered bonds are in this context considered to 
be corporate bonds . in countries where no such market exists 
the discount rate is determined by reference to government 
bond yields . in sweden, norway and denmark the discount 
rate is determined with reference to covered bonds and in 
finland with reference to corporate bonds . in sweden, nor-
way and denmark the observed covered bond credit spreads 
over the swap curve are derived from the most liquid long-
dated covered bonds and extrapolated to the same duration 
as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves . in 
finland the corporate bond credit spread over the govern-
ment bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the 
pension obligation using the government bond curve . 
termination benefits
as mentioned above termination benefits normally arise if an 
employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, 
or if an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy . 
termination benefits do not arise if the employees have to 
continue performing services and the termination benefits can 
be considered to be normal compensation for those services . 
termination benefits are expensed when nordea has an 
obligation to make the payment . an obligation arises when 
there is a formal plan committed to on the appropriate organ-
isational level and when nordea is without realistic possibility 
of withdrawal, which normally occurs when the plan has 
been communicated to the group affected or to their 
representatives . 
termination benefits can include both short-term benefits, for 
instance a number of months’ salary, and post-employment 
benefits, normally in the form of early retirement . short-term 
benefits are classified as “salaries and remuneration” and post-
employment benefits as “pension costs” in note g8 “staff costs” . 
25. equity
non-controlling interests
non-controlling interests comprise the portion of net assets 
of group undertakings not owned directly or indirectly by 
nordea bank abp .
for each business combination, nordea measures the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at 
their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets .
additional tier 1 capital holders
nordea has issued perpetual subordinated instruments where 
the interest payments to the holders are at the discretion of 
nordea and non-accumulating . some of these instruments 
also include a requirement for nordea to pay interest if the 
instruments are no longer allowed to be included in tier 1 
capital . if there is a requirement to pay interest based on the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of an uncertain future event 
that is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder of 
the instrument, the instrument shall be classified as a finan-
cial liability . the inclusion of the subordinated loan in tier 1 
capital is decided by the regulators and is thus beyond the 
control of nordea and the holders of the instrument . nordea 
classifies the instruments as financial liabilities . instruments 
without such clauses are classified as equity as there is no 
requirement for nordea to pay interest or principal to the 
holders of the instrument .
nordea determines payments on financial instrument clas-
sified as equity (i .e . additional tier 1 instruments) as distribu-
tions of profits and for that reason such payments are 
accounted for as dividends .  
 
invested unrestricted equity 
the reserve consists of the difference between the subscrip-
tion price and the quota value of the shares in nordea’s rights 
issue in 2009 . transaction costs in connection with the rights 
issue have been deducted . also acquisitions and sales of own 
shares are recognised under “invested unrestricted equity”, 
for more information see section 25 “treasury shares” .
other reserves
other reserves comprise income and expenses, net of tax 
effects, which are reported in equity through other compre-
hensive income . these reserves include reserves for cash flow 
hedges, financial assets classified into the category financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and 
accumulated remeasurements of defined benefit pension 
plans, as well as a reserve for translation differences . 
retained earnings
apart from undistributed profits from previous years, retained 
earnings include the equity portion of untaxed reserves . 
untaxed reserves according to national rules are accounted 
for as equity net of deferred tax at prevailing tax rates in the 
respective country .
in addition, nordea’s share of the earnings in associated 
undertakings and joint ventures, after the acquisition date, 
that have not been distributed is included in retained 
earnings .
treasury shares
treasury shares are not accounted for as assets . acquisitions 
of treasury shares are recognised as a reduction in “invested 
unrestricted equity” and sales of own shares as an increase in 
“invested unrestricted equity” . also own shares in trading 
portfolios are classified as treasury shares .
contracts on nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, 
i .e . derivatives such as options and warrants and their equiva-
lents, are either presented as financial assets or financial 
liabilities . 
26. financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments
upon initial recognition, premiums received in issued finan-
cial guarantee contracts and credit commitments are recog-
nised as prepaid income on the balance sheet . the guaran-
tees and irrevocable credit commitments are subsequently 
measured and recognised as a provision on the balance sheet 
at the higher of either the received fee less amortisation, or 
an amount calculated in accordance with ifrs 9 . changes in 
g1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – nordea group

nordea annual report 2020
g1. accounting policies, cont.
provisions are recognised in the income statement in the item 
“net loan losses” . 
premiums received for financial guarantees are, as stated 
in section 6 “recognition of operating income and impair-
ment”, amortised over the guarantee period and recognised 
as “fee and commission income” in the income statement . 
premiums received on credit commitments are generally 
amortised over the loan commitment period . the contractual 
amounts are recognised off-balance sheet, net of any provi-
sions . financial guarantees are disclosed in the item “contin-
gent liabilities” and irrevocable credit commitments in the 
item “commitments” .
27. share-based payment
equity-settled programmes
nordea has annually issued programmes where employees 
participating in these programmes are granted share-based 
equity-settled rights, i .e . rights to receive shares for free or to 
acquire shares in nordea at a significant discount compared 
to the share price at grant date . 
the grant date fair value of these rights is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period . the fair value per 
right is estimated at grant date and not subsequently updated . 
the vesting period is the period over which the employees have 
to remain in service in nordea in order for their rights to vest . 
for rights with non-market performance conditions, the 
amount expensed is the grant date fair value per right multi-
plied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, 
which is reassessed at each reporting date . for rights with 
market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimat-
ed based on the fair value of each right times the maximum 
number of rights at grant date . market conditions are taken 
into account when estimating the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted . therefore, if all other vesting conditions 
(e .g . service condition) are met, nordea recognises the 
expense for grants of equity instruments with market condi-
tions irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied . 
social security costs are also allocated over the vesting 
period . the provision for social security costs is reassessed on 
each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on 
the rights’ fair value at the reporting date .
for more information see note g8 “staff costs” .
cash-settled programmes
nordea has to defer payment of variable salaries under nor-
dic fsas’ regulations and general guidelines, as is also the 
case with the executive incentive programme (eip) . the 
deferred amounts are to some extent indexed using nordea’s 
tsr (total shareholders’ return) and these “programmes” 
are cash-settled share-based programmes . these pro-
grammes are fully vested when the payments of variable sal-
aries are initially deferred, and the fair value of the obligation 
is remeasured on a continuous basis over the deferral period 
using the nordea tsr . the remeasurements are, together 
with the related social charges, recognised in the income 
statement in the item “net result from items at fair value” . 
for more information see note g8 “staff costs” .
28. related party transactions
nordea defines related parties as:
• shareholders with significant influence
• associated undertakings and joint ventures
• key management personnel
• other related parties
all transactions with related parties are made on the same 
criteria and terms as those of comparable transactions with 
external parties of similar standing, apart from loans granted 
to employees as well as certain other commitments to key 
management, see note g8 “staff costs” and note g38 ”con-
tingent liabilities” .
shareholders with significant influence
shareholders with significant influence are shareholders that 
have the power to participate in the financial and operating 
decisions of nordea but do not control those policies .
associated undertakings and joint ventures
for the definition of associated undertakings and joint ven-
tures, see section 5 “principles of consolidation” . 
further information on the associated undertakings and 
the joint ventures included in the nordea group is found in 
note g20 “investments in associated undertakings and joint 
ventures” .
key management personnel
key management personnel includes the following positions:
• board of directors
• chief executive officer (ceo)
• group leadership team (glt)
for information about compensation, pensions and other 
transactions with key management personnel, see note g8 
“staff costs” . 
other related parties
other related parties comprise shareholders with significant 
influence (including its subsidiaries) and close family mem-
bers of key management personnel at nordea, as well as 
companies controlled or jointly controlled by key manage-
ment personnel or by close family members of key manage-
ment personnel at nordea .
information concerning transactions between nordea and 
other related parties is found in note g45 “related-party 
transactions” .
29. presentation of disposal groups held for sale
if applicable, assets and liabilities related to disposal groups 
are presented on the separate balance sheet lines “assets 
held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale”, respectively, as 
from the classification date . financial instruments continue to 
be measured under ifrs 9, while non-financial assets are 
held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value . compara-
tive figures are not restated .

g2. risk and liquidity management
maintaining risk awareness in the organisation is engrained in 
nordea’s business strategies . nordea has defined clear risk 
and liquidity management frameworks including policies and 
instructions for different risk types, capital adequacy and cap-
ital structure .
covid-19 has been a major risk factor over the course of 
2020 leading to increased volatility in markets and reduced 
liquidity in wholesale funding at the outset of the global lock-
down . in addition, with anticipation of the impacts on the 
broader economy, banks made large increases in loan loss 
provisions with nordea being no exception . market volatility 
and expected credit migration arising from the impact of 
covid-19 translated to an increase in risk exposure amount 
(rea) for nordea .
in response to the impact of covid-19 on the economy, 
central banks and regulatory bodies reacted strongly with 
regulators reducing capital requirements through the so-
called capital requirement regulation (crr) “quick fix” . 
central banks cut interest rates, increased their quantitative 
easing (qe) activities and offered long-term financing facili-
ties at low rates .
to protect its balance sheet, nordea increased its loan loss 
provisions in the first half of the year and took advantage of 
term funding facilities from central banks . in addition, the 
group board followed the european central bank (ecb) 
direction to withhold payment of any dividends in 2020 . with 
its strong financial position nordea is able to continue to 
actively support its customers during this challenging time .
in order to continuously monitor potential adverse out-
comes, nordea has executed a number of internal stress tests 
during 2020 with focus on the covid-19 situation . in these 
stress tests, nordea’s capital and liquidity situation has shown 
good resilience even in the most severe scenarios . 
internal control framework
the internal control framework covers the whole group and 
it sets out the group board’s and senior management’s 
responsibilities towards internal control, all group functions 
and business areas including outsourced activities and distri-
bution channels . under the internal control framework, all 
business areas, group functions and units are responsible  
for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities 
and to have controls in place that aim to ensure compliance 
with internal and external requirements . as part of the inter-
nal control framework, nordea has established group con-
trol functions with appropriate and sufficient authority, stat-
ure and access to the group board to fulfil their mission, as 
well as the risk management framework .
the internal control framework ensures effective and effi-
cient operations, adequate identification, measurement and 
mitigation of risks, prudent conduct of business, sound 
administrative and accounting procedures, reliability of finan-
cial and non-financial information (both internal and exter-
nal) and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, super-
visory requirements and the group internal rules .
the internal control process is carried out by the governing 
bodies, risk management functions, management and other 
staff at nordea . the internal control process is based on five 
main components: control environment, risk assessment, con-
trol activities, information and communication as well as 
monitoring . the internal control process is created to ensure 
the necessary fundamentals for the entire organisation to 
contribute to the effectiveness and high quality of internal 
control through, for instance, clear definitions, assignments of 
roles and responsibilities and common tools and procedures .
governing bodies for risk, liquidity 
and capital management 
the group board, the board risk committee (bric), the 
group ceo in group leadership team (glt), the asset and 
liability committee (alco) and the risk committee (rc) are 
the key decision-making bodies for risk, liquidity and capital 
management in nordea . in addition, the ceo credit commit-
tee, the executive credit committee and business area credit 
committees are the key bodies for credit decision-making . 
group board and board risk committee
the group board has following overarching risk management 
responsibilities .
• it decides on the group risk strategy and the risk appetite 
framework, including the risk appetite statements, with 
annual reviews and additional updates when needed .
• it oversees and monitors the implementation of the risk 
strategy, risk appetite framework and risk management 
framework, including breaches of risk appetite . 
the group board decides on the group board directive on 
capital including dividend policy, which ensures adequate 
capital levels within the group, on an ongoing and forward-
looking basis in accordance with nordea’s business model, 
risk appetite and regulatory requirements and expectations .
board risk committee (bric) assists the group board in 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities concerning manage-
ment and control of the risk, risk frameworks, controls and 
processes associated with the group’s operations, including 
credit, market, liquidity, business, life and operational risk, as 
well as conduct and compliance risk and related frameworks 
and processes . 
president and chief executive officer
the group ceo is responsible to the group board for the 
overall management of the group's operations and risks . 
responsibilities include ensuring that the risk strategy and 
risk management decided by the group board is implement-
ed, the necessary practical measures are taken and risks are 
monitored and limited . the group ceo is supported in deci-
sion making by senior management within the group glt .
group-wide committees have been established in order to 
promote coordination within the group, thus ensuring com-
mitment to and ownership of group-wide prioritisations, 
decisions and implementation . the composition and the areas 
of responsibility of each committee are established in the 
group board directives or group ceo instructions for the 
respective committees .
asset and liability committee
asset and liability committee (alco) is sub-ordinated to the 
group ceo in glt and chaired by the chief financial officer 
(cfo) . alco decides on changes to the financial operations 
and the risk profile of the balance sheet, including asset and 
liability management (alm), balance sheet management and 
liquidity management . alco also decides on certain issuanc-
es and capital injections for all wholly-owned legal entities 
within the group . alco has established sub-committees for 
its work and decision-making within specific risk areas . 
risk committee
risk committee (rc) is sub-ordinated to the group ceo in 
glt and chaired by the chief risk officer (cro) . it has been 
established in order to manage the overall risk management 
framework and prepares or provides guidance regarding 
proposals to the group ceo in glt and/or the relevant board 
of directors on issues of major importance concerning 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
103
nordea annual report 2020
nordea’s risk management framework . given the group 
board decided risk appetite framework, rc decides on the 
allocation of cascaded risks limits to risk-taking units and on 
actions relating to the management of all risks . the first line 
of defence (1st lod) is responsible for ensuring that limits are 
further cascaded and operationally implemented . rc has 
established sub-committees for its work and decision-making 
within specific risk areas . 
credit decision-making bodies
the governing bodies for credit risk and/or the credit risk 
management framework are the group board and bric . the 
group board and the local board of directors delegate credit 
decision-making according to the powers to act as described 
in the group board directive for risk:
• ceo credit committee is chaired by the group ceo and its 
members include the members of the executive credit 
committee .
• executive credit committee is chaired by the head of 
group credit management, and bric appoints the mem-
bers of the executive credit committee .
• the executive credit committee establishes credit commit-
tees for each business area as required by organisational 
and customer segmentation .
bric reviews decisions of the ceo credit committee and the 
executive credit committee, as well as other strategic credit 
policy matters and development of the credit portfolio . bric 
confirms industry group strategies approved by the rc .
all credit limits within the nordea group are based on 
credit decisions or authorizations made by an ultimate deci-
sion-making authority with the right to decide upon that 
limit . credit decisions include, inter alia, pricing, risk mitiga-
tion and any terms and conditions related to the limit or 
expected utilisation . credit decisions also serve to delegate 
decision making within the approved limit to lower decision 
makers, unless otherwise explicitly decided .
subsidiary governance
at subsidiary level, the local board of director is responsible 
for approving risk appetite limits and capital actions . the pro-
posals for such items are the joint responsibilities of relevant 
subsidiary management and group functions . 
the subsidiary board of director has oversight responsibili-
ties concerning the management and control of risk, risk 
management frameworks as well as the processes associated 
with the subsidiary’s operations . in addition, there are risk 
management functions responsible for the risk management 
framework and processes within the subsidiary . 
the subsidiary ceo is part of the decision-making process 
at the subsidiary level and is responsible for the daily 
operations .
governance of risk management and compliance
group risk and compliance (grc) represents nordea’s inde-
pendent second line of defence (2nd lod) function . grc 
oversees the implementation of the financial and the non-
financial risk policies and according to a risk-based approach, 
monitors and controls the risk management framework 
including the compliance risk management framework and 
oversees that risks that nordea is or could be exposed to, are 
identified, assessed, monitored, managed and reported on . 
grc is organised in divisions with individual risk type respon-
sibility . the risk management framework ensures consistent 
processes for identifying, assessing and measuring, respond-
ing to and mitigating, controlling and monitoring and report-
ing risks to enable informed decisions on risk-taking . 
the risk management framework encompasses all risks 
to which nordea is or could be exposed, including off-balance 
sheet risks and risks in a stressed situation . detailed risk infor-
mation covering all risks is regularly reported to the rc, glt, 
bric and the group board . in addition to this nordea’s com-
pliance with regulatory requirements is reported to the glt 
and the group board . the group board and the ceo in each 
legal entity regularly receive local risk reporting .
the risk identification and materiality assessment process 
starts with identifying risks to which nordea is or could be 
exposed . risks are then assessed for relevance, classified, and 
included in the common risk taxonomy .
all risks within the nordea common risk taxonomy need 
to be classified as material or not material for risk manage-
ment and capital purposes . material risks are those assessed 
as having a material impact on nordea’s current and future 
financial position, its customers and stakeholders . these risks 
will typically, though not always, refer to a higher-level risk 
within the risk taxonomy which captures a number of under-
lying risks in which losses arise from a common source . 
risk appetite
the risk appetite framework (raf) supports effective risk 
management and a sound risk culture by enabling informed 
decisions on risk-taking, with the objective of ensuring that 
risk-taking activities are conducted within the organisation’s 
risk appetite and that emerging risks are identified and 
addressed in a timely way .
risk capacity is the maximum level of risk nordea is 
deemed able to assume given its capital (own funds), its risk 
management and control capabilities and its regulatory con-
straints . risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risk 
nordea is willing to assume within its risk capacity, in line 
with its business model, to achieve its strategic objectives . 
the risk appetite statements (ras) are the articulation of 
the group board approved risk appetite and comprises the 
qualitative statements and quantitative limits and triggers by 
main risk type, which are deemed appropriate to be able to 
operate with a prudent risk profile . 
credit concentration metrics cover e .g . sectors and geo-
graphic regions of size or importance . stress test metrics are 
applied to credit, market and liquidity risk metrics to ensure a 
forward-looking approach to risk management . operational 
risk metrics cover both residual risk levels and requirements 
for mitigating actions as well as limits for incidents and 
losses . 
risk appetite processes
the raf contains all processes and controls to establish, 
monitor and communicate nordea’s risk appetite:
• risk capacity setting based on capital position: on at least 
an annual basis, the group’s overall risk capacity is aligned 
with the financial and capital planning process, based on 
nordea’s risk strategy . risk capacity is set in line with 
nordea’s capital position, including an appropriate shock 
absorbing capacity .
• risk appetite allocation by risk type: risk appetite includes 
risk appetite limits for the main risk types that nordea is 
or could be exposed to in line with the risk taxonomy . risk 
appetite triggers are also set for these main risk types, to 
act as early indicators for key decision-makers that the risk 
profile for a particular risk type is approaching its risk 
appetite limit .
• risk limit setting: measurable risk limits are established 
and set at an appropriate level to manage risk-taking 
effectively . risk appetite limits are set by the group board . 
these inform the risk limits which are established and 
g2. risk and liquidity management, cont.

g2. risk and liquidity management, cont.
approved at lower decision-making levels at nordea, 
including rc and sub-rc levels, and also other levels as 
appropriate . subsidiary risk limits must be set by the 
appropriate governing body in alignment with local regula-
tory requirements and consistent with the group risk 
limits .
• controlling and monitoring risk exposures against risk lim-
its: regular controlling and monitoring of risk exposures 
compared to risk limits is carried out to ensure that risk-
taking activity remains within risk appetite .
• risk appetite limit breach management process: grc over-
sees that any risk appetite limit breaches are appropri-
ately escalated to rc and bric . grc reports monthly on 
any breaches of the risk appetite to the group board and 
other relevant governing bodies including a follow-up on 
the status of actions to be taken, until the relevant risk 
exposure is within appetite . the reporting includes a con-
sistent status indicator to communicate the current risk 
exposure compared to risk appetite limit for all risk types 
covered by the ras .
embedding risk appetite in business processes
the end-to-end risk appetite process cycle is aligned with 
other strategic processes, including the internal capital ade-
quacy assessment process (icaap), internal liquidity ade-
quacy assessment process (ilaap) and the recovery plan . 
moreover, the risk appetite is embedded in business pro-
cesses and communicated across the organisation in order to 
meet nordea’s objectives of maintaining a sound risk culture . 
this includes but is not limited to ensuring a strong link 
between the assessed risk appetite and the business plans 
and budgets, the capital and liquidity position, the systemic 
risk profile, the recoverability and resolvability assessments 
as well as the incentive structures and remuneration 
framework .
strengthened esg governance
at nordea, the group board has a leading role in driving the 
climate strategy and is assisted by the board operations and 
sustainability committee (bosc) in the fulfilment of its over-
sight responsibilities concerning sustainability, related frame-
works and processes . the group board is also assisted by the 
bric in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities concern-
ing the management of risks, related frameworks, controls 
and processes including environmental, social and gover-
nance (esg) factors as drivers of existing risks . qualitative 
progress updates on the integration of esg factors in the risk 
management frameworks form part of the regular board risk 
appetite reporting . organisationally, esg is integrated in 
existing processes for decision-making, risk management and 
control, and escalation including committee structures . 
in response to the heightened supervisory and regulatory 
expectations on esg, a group-wide task force led by the 
head of group credit risk control as chair was established in 
june reporting to risk committee and the chief risk officer . 
the task force objectives were to assess nordea's ability to 
comply with the ecb guide on climate-related and environ-
mental risks and to address any required developments .
disclosure requirements of the crr – capital 
and risk management report 2020
additional information on risk and capital management is 
presented in the capital and risk management report 2020, 
in accordance with the capital requirements regulation 
(crr), which is based on the basel iii framework issued by 
the basel committee on banking supervision .

credits granted within the group shall conform to the com- 
mon principles established for the group . nordea strives to 
have a well-diversified credit portfolio that is adapted to the 
structure of its home markets and economies . the key prin- 
ciples for managing nordea’s risk exposures are:
• risk-based approach, i .e . the risk management functions 
should be aligned to the nature, size and complexity of 
nordea’s business, ensuring that efforts undertaken are 
proportional to the risks in question;
• independence, i .e . the risk control function should be inde- 
pendent of the business it controls; and
• the three lines of defence (lod), as further described in 
the group board directive on internal governance .
group credit management in 1st lod is responsible for the 
credit process and industry credit policies . group credit risk 
control in 2nd lod is responsible for the credit risk frame- work, 
consisting of instructions and guidelines for the group . group 
credit risk control is also responsible for controlling and moni-
toring the quality of the credit portfolio and the credit process .
the basis of credit risk management in nordea is allocating 
limits to customers and customer groups that are aggregated 
and assigned to units responsible for their continuous moni-
toring and development . in addition to the procedures for 
allocating customer and customer group limits, nordea’s cred-
it risk management framework also includes the credit raf 
which provides a comprehensive and risk-based portfolio per-
spective through relevant asset quality and concentration risk 
measures . each division/unit is primarily responsible for man-
aging the credit risks in its operations within the applicable 
framework and limits, including identification, control and 
reporting .
within the powers to act granted by the board of direc- 
tors, internal credit risk limits are approved by credit decision 
making authorities on different levels in the organisation con- 
stituting the maximum risk appetite on the customer in ques- 
tion . individual credit decisions within the approved internal 
credit risk limit are taken within the customer responsible unit 
(cru) . the risk categorisation together with the exposure of 
the customer decides at what level the credit decision will be 
made . responsibility for a credit risk lies with the customer 
responsible unit . customers are risk-categorized by a rating 
or score in accordance with nordea’s rating and scoring 
guidelines . the rating and scoring of customers aim to predict 
their probability of default and consequently rank them 
according to their respective default risk . rating and scoring 
are used as integrated parts of credit risk management and 
the credit decision-making process . representatives from 1st 
lod credit organization approve the rating independently .
credit risk definition and identification
credit risk is defined as the potential for loss due to failure of 
a borrower(s) to meet its obligations to clear a debt in accor- 
dance with agreed terms and conditions . the potential for 
loss is lowered by credit risk mitigation techniques . credit risk 
stems mainly from various forms of lending, but also from 
issued guarantees and documentary credits and includes 
counterparty credit risk, transfer risk and settlement risk .
nordea’s loan portfolio is furthermore broken down by 
segment, industry and geography . industry credit policies are 
established for those industries that have a significant weight 
in the portfolio and are either highly cyclical or volatile or 
require special industry competencies .
credit decisions are reached after a credit risk assessment, 
based on principles that are defined consistently across the 
group . these principles emphasize the need to adjust the 
depth and scope of the assessment according to the risk . the 
same credit risk assessments are used as input for determining 
the internal ratings . credit decisions in nordea reflect nordea’s 
view of both the customer relationship and credit risk .
the esg evaluation of large corporate borrowers is cur-
rently integrated in the credit process through the nordea 
group credit risk framework .
there are different types of esg evaluations performed 
dependent on the  type and size of the transaction and cus-
tomer’s internal segmentation .
esg-related risks identified in the esg evaluation process 
are integrated into the credit risk assessment . a credit memo-
randum is produced, which contains a conclusion on the level 
of esg-related risk associated with the customer . approval 
follows the established credit decision making process . for 
customers classified as having high esg-related risk, the deci-
sion is escalated to the executive credit committee (ecc) .

ery position . the risk conclusion must be sufficiently forward- 
looking as compared to the risk profile of the customer and 
maturity of the transaction .
in addition to credit risk assessment in conjunction with new 
or changed exposure towards a customer, an annual or con-
tinuous credit review process is in place . the review process is 
an important part of the continuous credit assessment process .
if credit weakness is identified in relation to a customer 
exposure, the customer is categorized as “high risk” and 
receives special attention in terms of more frequent reviews . 
in addition to continuous monitoring, an action plan is estab- 
lished outlining how to minimise the potential credit loss . if 
necessary, a work-out team is set up to support the customer 
responsible unit .
credit risk mitigation
credit risk mitigation is an inherent part of the credit decision 
process . in every credit decision and review, the valuation of 
collaterals is considered as well as the adequacy of covenants 
and other risk mitigations . pledge of collateral is a fundamen- 
tal credit risk mitigation technique in the bank and collaterals 
are always sought, when reasonable and possible, to mini-
mize the potential for credit losses .
in corporate exposures, the main collateral types are real 
estate, floating charges and leasing objects . collateral cover-
age should generally be higher for exposures of financially 
weaker customers than for those who are financially strong .
independent from the strength of collateral position, the 
repayment capacity is the starting point in credit assessment 
and assigning credit limits . regarding large exposures, syndi-
cation of loans is the primary tool for managing concentration 
risk, while credit risk mitigation using credit default swaps is 
applied to a limited extent . covenants included in credit 
agreements are complementary to collateral protection . most 
exposures of substantial size and complexity include appro-
priate covenants . covenants provide early warning signs that 
enable nordea to detect, and react on, a deterioration in the 
borrower’s credit quality or overall performance . covenant 
breaches, allow nordea to cancel the credit facility and 
demand repayment of the outstanding credits .
the collateral value shall always be based on the market 
value . the market value is defined as the estimated amount for 
which the asset or liability would exchange on the date of valua-
tion between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s 
length transaction, after proper marketing and where the par-
ties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without com-
pulsion . from this market value, a haircut is applied . the haircut 
is defined as a percentage by which the asset’s market value is 
reduced ensuring a margin against loss . the margin reflects the 
adjustments needed to assess the cash proceeds when the col-
lateral is liquidated in a forced sale situation . a minimum haircut 
is set for each collateral type . in addition to the haircut potential 
higher ranking claims are also deducted from the market value 
when calculating the maximum collateral value .
the same principles of calculation must be used for all 
exposures . for high risk customers, the foreclosure value 
may differ from the maximum collateral values and should be 
based on a realistic assessment for the particular asset at that 
time . risk transfer to other creditworthy parties, through 
guarantees and insurance, shall be based on legally enforce-
able documentation .
collateral distribution
distribution of collateral has remained stable during 2020, 
with the majority of the collateral stemming from residential 
and commercial real estate . the shares of financial collateral, 
receivables, and other physical collaterals have slightly 
decreased during 2020, while the share of real estate has 
increased by 1% in 2020 .

1) in accordance with nordea’s policy for taking over assets for protection of claims, 
which is in compliance with the local banking business acts, wherever nordea is 
located . assets used as collateral for the loan are generally taken over when the cus- 
tomer is not able to fulfil its obligations to nordea . the assets taken over are at the 
latest disposed when full recovery is reached .
loan-to-value
the loan-to-value (ltv) ratio is considered a useful measure 
to evaluate collateral's quality, i .e . the credit extended divided 
by the market value of the collateral pledged . in the table, 
irb retail mortgage exposures are distributed by ltv buckets 
based on the ltv ratio .

individual and collective assessment of impairment
requirements for impairment are set forth in ifrs 9 and are 
based on an expected credit loss model .
impairment testing (individual and collective) applies to 
three forward looking and weighted scenarios, where assets 
tested for impairment are divided into three groups depend-
ing on the stage of credit deterioration . stage 1 includes 
assets where there has been no significant increase in credit 
risk, stage 2 includes assets where there has been a signifi-
cant increase in credit risk, and stage 3 includes defaulted 
assets . all assets are assessed individually for staging . signifi- 
cant assets in stage 3 are assessed for impairment individu- 
ally . assets in stage 1, stage 2 and insignificant assets in stage 
3 are assessed for impairment collectively .
throughout the process of identifying and mitigating credit 
impairment, nordea continuously reviews the quality of credit  
exposures . weak and credit impaired exposures are closely 
monitored and reviewed at least on a quarterly basis in terms 
of current performance, business outlook, future debt service 
capacity, and the possible need for provisions .
nordea recognises only certain specific credit risk adjust-
ments (scras) . scras comprise individually and collectively 
assessed provisions . scras in the profit and loss statement 
are referred to as loan losses, while scras in the balance 
sheet are referred to as allowances and provisions .
g2. risk and liquidity management, cont.
individual provisioning
a need for individual provisioning is recognised if, based on 
credit events and observable data, a negative impact is likely on 
the customer’s expected future cash flow to the extent that full 
repayment is unlikely (pledged collaterals taken into account) .
exposures with individually assigned provisions are credit 
impaired and in stage 3 . the size of the provision is equal to 
the estimated loss, which is the difference between the book 
value of the outstanding exposure and the discounted value 
of the expected future cash flow, including the value of 
pledged collateral .
collective provisioning
the collective model is executed quarterly and assessed for 
each legal unit/branch . one important driver for provisions is 
the trigger for the transferring of assets from stage 1 to stage 2 . 
for assets recognised from 1 january 2018, changes to the life-
time probability of default (pd) are used as the trigger . in addi-
tion, customers with forbearance measures and customers with 
payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to 
stage 2 . in stage 1, the provisions equal the 12 months expected 
loss . in stages 2 and 3, the provisions equal the lifetime expect-
ed loss . the output is complemented with an expert-based ana-
lysis process to ensure adequate provisioning . defaulted cus-
tomers without individual provisions have collective provisions .
default
customers with exposures that are past due more than 90 
days, in bankruptcy or considered unlikely to pay are regard-
ed as defaulted and non-performing . such customers can be 
either servicing debt or non-servicing .
if a customer recovers from being in default, the customer 
is seen as cured . typically, this situation occurs if the customer 
succeeds in creating a balance in financials . in order to be 
cured, the recovery should include the customer’s total liabili-
ties, an established satisfactory repayment plan and an 
assessment that the recovery is underway .
forbearance
forbearance is eased terms or restructuring due to the bor-
rower experiencing or about to experience financial difficul-
ties . the intention with granting forbearance for a limited 
time period is to ensure full repayment of the outstanding 
debt . examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation 
profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as ease 
of financial covenants . forbearance is undertaken on a selec-
tive and individual basis, approved according to powers to 
act and followed by impairment testing . forborne exposures 
can be performing or non-performing . individual loan loss 
provisions are recognised if necessary . 
on 13 march 2020 nordea announced that it would offer 
covid-19-related instalment-free periods in all nordic coun-
tries to those mortgage and car finance household customers 
and smes who were experiencing temporary liquidity prob-
lems due to the covid-19 situation . nordea did not register 
covid-19- related instalment-free periods as forbearance, 
and consequently did not automatically transfer the expo-
sures to stage 2, due to the temporary nature of the instal-
ment-free periods and as interest continued to accrue . on 1 
october 2020 nordea ended all temporary amendments to 
the credit risk framework and returned to its standard credit 
processes, including normal forbearance registration proce-
dures, while still continuing to support customers through the 
crisis . 
the carrying amount of loans on which nordea had grant-
ed covid-19-related instalment-free periods at the end of 
2020 amounted to eur 18 .6bn, of which 91 .2% was classified 
as stage 1, 7 .7% as stage 2 and 1 .1% as stage 3 .

sensitivities
one important factor in estimating expected credit losses in 
accordance with ifrs 9 is to assess what constitutes a signifi-
cant increase in credit risk . to understand the sensitivities to 
these triggers, nordea has calculated model-based provisions 
under two different scenarios:

the provisions would have increased by eur 34m (eur 38m) 
in scenario 1 and decreased by eur 36m (eur 44m) in sce-
nario 2 . for more information on the rating scale and average 
pds, see table “rating/scoring information on loans measured 
at amortised cost” on page 124 .
the provisions are sensitive to rating migration even if trig-
gers are not reached . the table below shows the impact on 
provisions from a one notch downgrade on all exposures in 
the bank . it includes both the impact of the higher risk for all 
exposures as well as the impact of transferring exposures 
from stage 1 to stage 2 that reach the trigger . it also includes 
the impact from the exposures with one rating grade above 
default becoming default, which is estimated at eur 139m 
(eur 141m) . this figure is based on calculations with the sta-
tistical model rather than individual estimates that would be 
the case in reality for material defaulted loans .
forward looking information
forward-looking information is used both for assessing sig-
nificant increases in credit risk and calculating expected credit 
losses . nordea uses three macroeconomic scenarios: a base-
line scenario, a favourable scenario and an adverse scenario . 
for the fourth quarter of 2020, the scenarios were weighted 
into the final expected credit losses (ecl) using baseline 50%, 
adverse 45% and favourable 5% (baseline 60%, adverse 20% 
and favourable 20% at year-end 2019) . the weight on the 
adverse scenario was increased as of the third quarter and 
maintained in the fourth quarter of 2020 to give more weight 
to the downside risks surrounding the expiry of customer sup-
port measures and the continuation of the pandemic . the 
baseline scenario was still maintained as the most probable 
one .
the macroeconomic scenarios are provided by group risk 
and compliance (grc) in nordea, based on the oxford eco-
nomics model . the forecast is a combination of modelling and 
expert judgement, subject to thorough checks and quality 
control processes . the model has been built to give a good 
description of the historical relationships between economic 
variables and to capture the key linkages between those vari-
ables . the forecast period in the model is ten years, and for 
periods beyond, a long-term average is used in the ecl 
calculations .

nordea annual report 2020
the macroeconomic scenarios reflect nordea’s view of 
how the covid-19 virus and lockdowns will potentially 
impact the economic outlook . the scenarios also reflect the 
macroeconomic effects of government and central bank sup-
port measures . when developing the scenarios, nordea took 
into account projections made by nordic governments and 
central banks, nordea research and the ecb’s macroeconom-
ic forecasts for the euro area . 
following one of the largest contractions in output since 
the second world war, the nordic economies experienced a 
significant recovery in activity in the third quarter of 2020 . 
although the economic recovery during the second half of 
2020 appeared to be relatively strong, growth in 2021 is pre-
dicted to be slow, as the outlook is still clouded by a very high 
level of uncertainty . the resurgence of the covid-19 pan-
demic in the autumn of 2020, with renewed and widespread 
lockdowns in most of europe, poses a serious threat to the 
export-dependent nordic economies . the high level of uncer-
tainty is also weighing on business investments . on the other 
hand, the eventual roll-out of vaccines, and the willingness of 
nordic governments to extend special support measures for 
sectors hit by lockdowns, point to a continued but modest 
recovery in the baseline . this implies that the economic out-
put of the nordic countries will not return to pre-pandemic 
levels before 2022 . the significant loss of output will continue 
to weigh on labour markets, leading to an additional rise in 
unemployment in 2021 . the rise in unemployment and the 
impact on consumer confidence are also expected to weigh 
on housing markets in spite of the strong price increases seen 
in 2020 and the low interest rates .
adjustments to model-based provisions amount to eur 
697m, including management judgements of eur 650m and 
late corrections of eur 47m . the management judgement is 
divided into two groups; cyclical and structural management 
judgements . the cyclical management judgement covers pro-
jected individual loan losses and expected loan losses that 
are not yet captured by the collective provisioning models, 
this amounts to eur 450m end of the year . the cyclical 
reserve is supported by additional portfolio modelling and is 
triggered by the substantial uncertainty in the macroeconom-
ic development, as well as the need to account for future rat-
ing downgrades potentially underestimated by the ifrs 9 
model through the updated macroeconomic scenarios .
one important source of information in the estimation of 
the cyclical reserve is the internal stress testing model, adjust-
ed for the impact of government support schemes . for the 
retail portfolio, the most important public sector actions have 
been the various forms of labour market support schemes, 
which have significantly decreased expected defaults and 
losses among households . due to the wide scope of these 
schemes, nordea decreased the modelled development of 
new defaults originally predicted by the internal stress testing 
models, leading to lower predicted loan losses . these models 
are based on historical observations and correlations . thus, 
they are not capable of replicating the impact of the current 
government support schemes .
the structural management judgement covers identified 
issues in the ifrs 9 model to be later covered in model 
updates (structural reserve) amounted to eur 200m .
with regard to the expected rating migration in the corpo-
rate portfolio, nordea took into consideration the positive 
impact of the various government guarantee and support 
schemes, primarily addressing the liquidity shock caused by 
the lockdowns and quarantines . at the same time, additional 
negative rating migration was assumed for the industries 
affected by covid-19 . this was based on a widescale bottom-
up review of large counterparties in particularly sensitive 
industries (e .g . retail trade, accommodation and leisure, and 
air transportation), and incorporated the main findings into 
the scenario projections .
the stress test model-based scenario simulations support-
ed loan loss forecasts by the business areas, and helped 
nordea ensure that its loan loss projections are appropriately 
conservative . the cyclical reserve reflects management’s 
expectation of future credit losses .

loans to corporate customers
loans to corporate customers at the end of 2020 amounted to 
eur 149bn (eur 152bn) . the sector that increased the most 
in 2020 was real estate while maritime decreased the most . 
the contribution of the three largest industries (real estate, 
financial institutions and industrials) is approximately 70% of 
total corporate lending . real estate remains the largest indus-
try in nordea’s lending portfolio, at eur 46 .6bn (eur 43 .9bn) . 
the real estate (commercial & residential) portfolio predomi-
nantly consists of relatively large and financially strong com-
panies, with 93% (92%) of the exposure in rating grades 4– 
and higher . loans to maritime decreased to eur 6 .4bn (eur 
7 .7bn) during the year . the distribution of loans to corporate 
customers by size of loans, seen in the table below, shows a 
high degree of diversification where approximately 64% 
(65%) of the corporate volume represents loans up to eur 
50m per customer .

loans to household customers 
in 2020 lending to household customers increased by 5 .0% to 
eur 176bn (eur 167bn) . the increase was primarily driven by 
sweden, but with increases in all countries . mortgage lending 
increased to eur 151bn (eur 142bn) and consumer lending 
unchanged at eur 25m (eur 25bn) . the proportion of mort-
gage lending of total household lending increased to 86% 
(85%) .
geographical distribution 
the portfolio is geographically well diversified with no mar-
ket accounting for more than 30% of total lending measured 
by the geography of the customer handling unit . other eu 
countries represent the largest part of lending outside the 
nordic countries . lending to the public distributed by borrow-
er domicile shows that the customers residing in the nordic 
countries account for 93% (93%) . 
rating and scoring distribution 
one way of assessing credit quality is through analysis of the 
distribution across rating grades, for rated corporate custom-
ers and institutions, as well as risk grades for scored house-
hold and small business customers, i .e . retail exposures . the 
average credit quality was stable in both the corporate and 
retail portfolios in 2020 . 20% of the number of corporate cus-
tomers migrated upwards (19%) while 23% was down-rated 
(33%) . exposure-wise, 17% (16%) of the corporate customer 
exposure migrated upwards while 18% (20%) was down-rat-
ed . 88% (87%) of the corporate exposure was rated 4– or 
higher, with an average rating for the portfolio of 4+ .

1) the stage classification and calculated provision for each exposure are based on the situation as per end of october 2020 (october 2019), while the exposure amount and rating 
grades are based on the situation as per end of december 2020 (december 2019) . some of the exposures in default according to the rating grade as per end of december were 
not in default as per end of october, and hence this is reflected in the stage classification .
2) average pd excluding nordea finance equipment as .
3) the main driver for the increase from 2019 is the acquisition of nordea finance equipment as .

institutions and retail customers on the other hand show a 
distribution that is biased towards the higher rating grades . 
93% (92%) of the retail exposures is scored c– or higher, 
which indicates a probability of default of 1% or lower . the 
total effect on credit risk exposure amount (rea) from migra-
tion was an increase of approx . 0 .98% during the full year 
2020 .
impaired loans (stage 3) 
impaired loans gross at amortised cost in the group decreased 
to eur 3,979m (eur 4,610m), corresponding to 151 basis 
points of total loans . 45% of impaired loans gross are servicing 
and 55% are non-servicing . impaired loans net, after allowanc-
es for stage 3 loans amount to eur 2,305m, corresponding to 
87 basis points of total loans . allowances for stage 3 loans 
amount to eur 1,674m . allowances for stages 1 & 2 loans 
amount to eur 775m . the ratio of allowances in relation to 
impaired loans is 42% and the allowance ratio for loans in 
stages 1 & 2 is 30 basis points . the decrease in impaired loans 
was mainly related to oil, gas and offshore and shipping . this 
is mainly due to restructurings and write-offs . the portfolios 
with the largest impaired loan amounts were household 32%, 
industrials of 17%, natural resources and maritime of 14% each .
past due loans 
past due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers make 
up eur 909m, down from eur 978m one year ago, and past 
due loans to household sum up to eur 1,543m in 2020, down 
from eur 2,229m one year ago . the table below shows loans 
past due 6 days or more, split by corporate and household 
customers . past due is defined as a loan payment that has not 
been made as of its due date . past due loans to corporate cus-
tomers, were at end of 2020 eur 909m, down from eur 978m 
one year ago, and past due loans for household customers 
decreased to eur 1,543m from eur 2,229m one year ago .

net loan losses 
net loan losses for 2020 was eur 908m (eur 536m), corre-
sponding to an annual net loan loss ratio at 35 bps for amor-
tised cost loans and when including loans held at fair value 
26bps (16bp) . eur 443m is due to increased management 
judgements mainly to cover for the uncertainty on future loss-
es related to covid-19 . the individual provisions are driven 
by oil, gas and offshore as well as maritime mainly due to 
changed collateral values . there are also large net loan losses 
for consumer lending, but this is mainly related to the man-
agement judgements decided during the year . net loan losses 
increased in personal banking to eur 296m (eur 130m) and 
business banking to eur 328m (eur 141m) and in large cor-
porates & institutions to eur 277m (eur 251m) . of the net 
loan losses, eur 547m relates to corporate customers (eur 
157m), and eur 362m (eur 377m) to household customers .

in an fx, interest, commodity, equity or credit derivative con-
tract defaults prior to maturity of the contract and that 
nordea at that time has a claim on the counterpart . counter-
party credit risk can also exist in repurchasing agreements 
and other securities financing transactions . current exposure 
net (after close-out netting and collateral reduction) repre-
sents eur 7 .3bn of which 28% was towards financial institu-
tions . for information about financial instruments subject to

ments set off on balance or subject to netting agreements“ .

nordea annual report 2020
g2. risk and liquidity management, cont.
market risk
market risk is the risk of loss in nordea’s positions in either 
the trading book or non-trading book as a result of changes 
in market rates and parameters that affect the market values 
or net interest income flows . market risk exists irrespective of 
the accounting treatment of the positions .
the market risk appetite for the group is expressed 
through risk appetite statements issued by the board of 
directors . the statements are defined for trading and banking 
books .
the 2nd lod ensures that the risk appetite is appropriately 
translated through the risk committee into specific risk 
appetite limits for the business areas and group treasury and 
alm (talm) .
as part of the overall risk appetite framework (raf), holis-
tic and bespoke stress tests are used to measure the market 
risk appetite and calibrate limits to monitor and control the 
full set of material market risk factors to which the bank is 
exposed .
traded market risk
traded market risk arises mainly from client-driven trading 
activities and related hedges in nordea markets which is part 
of nordea large corporates & institutions .
nordea markets takes market risks as part of its business 
model to support corporate and institutional clients through a 
range of fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, commodity 
and structured products . the market risks nordea markets is 
exposed to include interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity 
risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and inflation risk .
furthermore, nordea is one of the major mortgage lenders 
in the nordics and market makers in nordic corporate and 
government bonds . holding inventory is a consequence of 
providing secondary market liquidity . as a result, nordea’s 
business model naturally gives rise to a concentration in nor-
dic mortgage and corporate bonds as well as in local market 
currencies .
non-traded market risk
non-traded market risk arises from the core banking business 
of nordea, related hedges and regulatory or other external 
requirements (e .g . liquid asset buffer) .
talm is responsible for the risk management of all non-
traded market risk exposures in the group’s balance sheet . to 
ensure a clear division of responsibilities within talm the 
banking book risk management is divided across several 
frameworks – each with a clear risk mandate and specific 
limits and controls .
the non-traded market risks that nordea is exposed to are 
interest rate risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk 
(both structural and non-structural) and equity risk .
interest rate risk in the banking book (irrbb) is the current 
or prospective risk to nordea’s capital and earnings arising 
from adverse movements in interest rates . business areas 
transfer their banking book risk exposures to talm through 
an internal funds transfer pricing framework . the market risks 
are managed centrally and include gap risk, spread risks, 
basis risks, credit spread risk, behavioural risk and non-linear 
risks . these risks are delineated by currency .
liquid assets are managed in accordance with the liquid-
ity buffer and pledge/collateral frameworks . most of the 
directional interest rate risk arising from bond holdings is 
hedged primarily with maturity matched irs payer swaps 
and to a smaller degree with ois payer swaps . forward rate 
agreements and listed futures contracts are also used to 
hedge credit spread and interest rate fixing risks .
the tail hedging framework operates a running portfolio of 
tail hedges across listed equity futures and options, main 
credit indices and interest rate swaps and options .
measurement of market risk
nordea uses several quantitative risk measurement methods 
for traded market risk: value-at-risk (var), stress testing, 
sensitivity analysis, parametric methods and monte carlo 
simulation .
var is based on historical scenarios and is the primary 
market risk measurement metric, complemented by stress 
testing . nordea calculates var using historical simulation . the 
current portfolio is revalued based on historical daily changes 
in market prices, rates and other market risk factors observed 
during the last 500 business days and translated to changes 
in the current market risk factors . nordea uses absolute, rela-
tive and mixed translation methods for different risk catego-
ries . the revaluation of the current portfolio is performed for 
each position using either a linear approximation method or a 
full revaluation method, depending on the nature of the 
position .
parametric methods are used to capture equity event risk 
including the impact of defaults on equity related positions 
(these risks are part of specific equity risk) .
monte carlo simulation is used in the incremental risk 
measure model and the comprehensive risk measure model 
to capture the default and migration risks .
the value-at-risk, stressed value-at-risk, equity event 
risk, incremental risk measure and the comprehensive risk 
measure models were all approved by the bank’s previous 
regulator, the swedish fsa, for use in calculating market risk 
own funds requirements under the internal model approach 
(ima) . the same models, with same calibration and settings, 
as used for regulatory capital requirements are used for inter-
nal risk management purposes .
the standardised approach is applied to risk exposure 
which is not covered by the ima . it is used for calculating 
market risk exposures for commodity related products, spe-
cific risk for mortgage and government bonds, commercial 
papers, credit/rate hybrids and credit spread options, as well 
as for equity risk related to structured equity and tier 1 and 
tier 2 bonds .
nordea bank abp is the only legal entity for which this 
model is in use . after the relocation to finland in october 
2018, nordea is operating under a temporary tolerance deci-
sion from the ecb, allowing the bank to continue to use its 
ima approved by the swedish fsa . the ecb’s temporary tol-
erance is conditioned on nordea applying to the ecb for a 
new permanent ima approval, which was submitted in 
december 2020 .
irrbb is measured, monitored and managed using three 
key risk metrics:
• economic value (ev),
• fair value (fv), and
• structural interest income risk (siir) .
the three different risk metrics are used to assess differing 
aspects of the manifestation of interest rate risk . these are 
described in more detail below .
economic value (ev) of equity stress tests consider the 
change in the economic value of banking book assets, liabili-
ties and interest-bearing derivative exposures resulting from 
interest rate movements, independently of accounting clas-
sification and ignoring credit spreads and commercial mar-
gins . the model assumes a run-off balance sheet and 
includes behavioural modelling for non-maturing deposits 
and prepayments . changes in the economic value of equity 
of the banking book are measured using the six standardised 
scenarios defined by the basel committee on banking super-
vision (bcbs) plus a range of internal parallel shocks . the 
exposure limit under ev is measured against the worst out-
come out of the six basel scenarios measured . the ev basel 
scenarios are estimated daily for management information 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
130
annual report 2020 nordea
purposes, but fully calculated and monitored monthly against 
the risk appetite limits . the fair value risk stress measure con-
siders the potential revaluation risk relating to positions held 
under fair value accounting classifications . fair value sensi-
tivities in the banking book are monitored against five severe 
but plausible market stress scenarios . the scenarios are cali-
brated to reflect severe events designed to test specific expo-
sures that are or may be held under the approved mandate . 
the risk is measured daily, and a risk appetite limit is set 
against the worst outcome of the five scenarios . the fv sce-
narios are applied to both the banking book and trading book 
portfolios, and the board risk appetite limit considers the 
combined impact across both . the fv stress metric is moni-
tored daily .
the earnings risk metric measures the change in net inter-
est income relative to a base scenario, creating a structural 
interest income risk (siir) value over a one-year horizon . the 
model uses a constant balance sheet assumption, implied for-
ward rates and behavioural modelling for the non-maturing 
deposits and prepayments . similarly to ev, siir is measured 
using the six standardised scenarios defined by the basel 
committee on banking supervision (bcbs) for management 
information, plus a range of internal parallel shocks . the siir 
risk appetite limit is set against a +/– 50bps parallel shock . 
the siir earnings metric is monitored monthly .
the measurement of irrbb is dependent on key assump-
tions applied in the models . the most material assumptions 
relate to the modelling of embedded behavioural options in 
both assets and liabilities . the behavioural option held by 
nordea’s lending customers to execute early loan prepay-
ments is estimated using prepayment models . on the liability 
side, nordea has an option to change deposit rates, and cus-
tomers have an option to withdraw non-maturing deposits 
(nmd) at any given day . both embedded options are mod-
elled using nmd models . both assumptions are calculated 
based on historical average by core asset and liability class 
features . assets and liabilities are grouped according to key 
metrics including product type, geography and customer seg-
ment . assumptions are based on historically observed values . 
regular back-testing and model monitoring are performed 
for both prepayment models and nmd models to ensure that 
the models remain accurate .
the pillar 2 irrbb capital allocations consist of a fair 
value risk component and an earnings risk component . the 
fair value risk component covers the impact on the bank’s 
equity due to adverse movements in the mtm values of posi-
tions accounted for at fair value through profit and loss 
(fvtpl) or fair value through other comprehensive income 
(fvoci) . the earnings risk component covers the impact of 
rate changes on future earnings capacity, and the resulting 
implications for internal capital buffer levels .
nordea is exposed to structural fx risk defined as the mis-
match between the currency composition of its common 
equity tier 1 (cet1) and risk exposure amounts . cet1 is large-
ly denominated in euro with the only significant non-euro 
equity amounts stemming from mortgage subsidiaries and 
nordea bank russia . changes in fx rates can therefore nega-
tively impact nordea’s cet1 ratio .
market risk analysis
the market risk for the nordea trading book is presented in 
the table below .
the market risk measured by var showed an average utili-
sation of eur 31 .6m in 2020 (average in 2019 was eur 14 .8m) 
and was primarily driven by interest rate var . stressed var 
showed an average utilisation of eur 46 .7m which is similar 
to 2019 (average in 2019 was eur 46 .6m) and primarily driv-
en by interest rate stressed var with additional contributions 
from credit spread stressed var . the highs in var and 
stressed var were reached in q1 2020 . var and stressed var 
are primarily driven by market risk in northern european and 
nordic countries .
the incremental risk charge (irc) at the end of 2020 was 
lower than at the end of 2019 which was driven by reduced 
default exposure . the lowest exposure occurred during 
q2 2020, while irc was the highest in q1 2020 . average irc 
increased by eur 4 .4m compared to the previous year, pri-
marily driven by higher contribution from the migration 
component . 
comprehensive risk charge (crc) at the end of 2020 was 
slightly higher than at the end of 2019 . the lowest exposure 
occurred during q1 2020, while crc peaked during q2 2020 
at the start of the covid-19 crisis . average crc for 2020

increased by eur 19 .9m compared to 2019 as it was dragged 
up by the peak at the start of the covid-19 crisis .
the var for banking book has increased materially during 
the year, driven by volatility relating to covid-19 . volatility of 
underlying market movements is directly carried into the met-
rics used to model var . overall banking book market risk, 
however, remains within appetite and no fundamental chang-
es in the portfolio have taken place during the year to 
increase risk materially .
the exposure to long term illiquid investment holdings was 
eur 1,268m at the end of 2020 (eur 1,171m at the end of 
2019), of which:
• private equity funds eur 435m (eur 347m), 
• hedge funds eur 1m (eur 1m), 
• credit funds eur 300m (eur 256m), 
• seed-money investments eur 192m (eur 260m), 
• unlisted equity investments of eur 236m (eur 262m), 
• structured loans of eur 42m (eur 0m), and 
• ventures eur 62m (eur 44m) . 
all types of investments, excluding structured loans, are 
spread over a number of funds .
structural interest income risk (siir)/ev
at the end of the year, the worst loss out of the six basel sce-
narios for siir was driven by the steepening basel scenario, 
where the potential reduction of one year interest income due 
to interest rate movements was eur 655m (against the worst 
case income reduction at the end of 2019 of eur 1,030m, also 
taken from the steepening basel scenario) . nordea’s balance 
sheet is structured such that net interest income would 
decrease if short term interest rates fall while long rates rise .
ev risk across all scenarios is currently zero, due to the 
beneficial impact of rate floors on assets and liabilities that 
apply due to the low/negative rate environment . 
other market risks/pension risk
pension risk (including market and longevity risks) arises 
from nordea-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes for 
past and current employees . the ability of the pension 
schemes to meet the projected pension payments is main-
tained through investments and ongoing scheme 
contributions .
pension risks can manifest through increases in the value 
of liabilities or through falls in the values of assets . these 
risks are regularly reported and monitored and include con-
sideration of sub components of market risk such as interest 
rate, inflation, credit spread, real estate and equity risk . to 
minimise the risks to nordea, limits are imposed on potential 
losses under severe but plausible stress events and by limits 
on capital drawdown . in addition, regular reviews of the 
schemes strategic asset allocation are undertaken to ensure 
the investment approach reflects nordea’s risk appetite . see 
note g34 for more information .
operational risk
nordea defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and sys-
tems or from external events, and includes legal risk . 
operational risks are inherent in all of nordea’s businesses 
and operations . managers throughout nordea are account-
able for the operational risks related to their mandate and for 
managing these risks within risk limits and risk appetite in 
accordance with the operational risk management 
framework . 
group operational risk (gor) within group risk and com-
pliance (grc) constitutes the second line of defence (2nd 
lod) risk control function for operational risk and is respon-
sible for developing and maintaining the overall operational 
risk management framework as well as for monitoring and 
controlling the operational risk management of the first line 
of defence (1st lod) . gor monitors and controls that opera-
tional risks are appropriately identified, assessed and mitigat-
ed, follows-up risk exposures towards risk appetite and 
assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the operational 
risk management framework and the implementation of the 
frameworks .
the focus areas of the monitoring and control work per-
formed by gor are decided during an annual planning pro-
cess that includes business areas, key risk areas and opera-
tional risk processes . gor is responsible for preparing and 
submitting regular risk reports on all material risk exposures 
including risk appetite limit utilisation and incidents to the 
chief risk officer (cro), who thereafter reports to the chief 
executive officer (ceo) in group leadership team (glt), the 
group board and relevant committees .

annual report 2020 nordea
while the covid-19 crisis has presented nordea with a 
heightened level of operational risk, this has not materialised 
in the form of increased losses due to operational risks for 
2020 . events such as fraud, large scale processing errors and 
data breaches are all more likely given the current situation . 
however, the root cause of these may derive from a variety of 
different factors, including but not limited to employees work-
ing from home . as a preventive measure, the risk appetite 
limit for losses due to operational risk was temporarily 
increased in december 2020 to ensure the needed flexibility 
in nordea’s operations in light of the uncertain covid-19 
environment . 
the risk appetite for losses is within appetite as of decem-
ber 2020 based on the 4-quarter rolling loss number . 
the risk appetite statement (ras) for operational risk is 
expressed in terms of:
• residual risk level in breach of risk appetite and require-
ments for mitigating actions for risks; and 
• total loss amount from incidents and management of 
incidents . 
management of operational risk
management of operational risk includes all activities aimed 
at identifying; assessing and measuring; responding and miti-
gating; controlling and monitoring; and reporting on risks . 
the risk management is supported by various processes 
including e .g . the risk and control self-assessment, change 
risk management and approval, incident management, sce-
nario analysis, business continuity and crisis management, 
information security management, technology and data risk 
management, third party risk management, insurance relat-
ed risk diversification and significant operating processes . 
some of these processes are described below and addi-
tional details on processes for managing and controlling 
operational risks are included in the operational and compli-
ance risk section of the capital and risk management report 
2020 published in accordance with the capital requirements 
regulation (crr) . 
risk and control self-assessment 
the risk and control self-assessment (rcsa) process pro-
vides a risk-based view of operational and compliance risks 
across nordea . the process improves risk awareness and 
enables effective assessment, control, and mitigation of iden-
tified risks . for risks identified in the rcsa process, the level 
of inherent risk and the controls in place to mitigate the inher-
ent risks are assessed . if mitigating actions are required to 
reduce the risk exposure, these are identified and 
implemented . 
change risk management and approval framework 
the objective of the change risk management and approval 
(crma) framework is to ensure that there is a full under-
standing of both financial and non-financial risks arising from 
the change, and that risks have been adequately managed 
consistent with nordea’s risk strategy, risk appetite and cor-
responding risk limits before a change is approved, executed 
or implemented .
changes in scope of the crma framework include e .g . new 
or significant changes to products, services, markets, process-
es and it systems as well as exceptional transactions and 
decommissioning . 
incident management 
the objective of incident management is to ensure appropri-
ate handling and reporting of detected incidents to minimise 
the impact on nordea and its customers . incident manage-
ment is designed to prevent reoccurrence and to reduce the 
probability and impact of future incidents . in addition, the 
incident management shall secure timely notification to 
defined external bodies and parties, including relevant super-
visory authorities .
business continuity and crisis management 
the objective of the business continuity and crisis manage-
ment is the overall risk management under which nordea 
ensures building and maintaining the appropriate levels of 
resiliency, readiness, response and management of extraordi-
nary events and crises . business continuity plan sets out the 
procedures to respond, recover, resume and restore opera-
tions following an extraordinary event . crisis management 
provides the governance to execute plans and enhance deci-
sion making during a crisis .
third party risk management 
the objective of the third party risk management (tprm) is 
to ensure that risks related to third parties and third party 
activities, including but not limited to outsourcing and intra-
group outsourcing, are appropriately identified, assessed and 
managed before entering into, during, as well as when exiting 
a third party arrangement . tprm shall ensure risks associ-
ated with third parties and third party activities are kept with-
in risk appetite and risk limits . 
financial reporting risk
financial reporting risk is defined as the risk of misstatements 
or deficiencies in financial reporting and regulatory reporting 
and disclosures . the risk arises from erroneous interpretation 
and implementation of accounting standards and regulation, 
the use of judgement in reporting, as well as from inadequate 
governance and control frameworks around financial report-
ing . the framework for managing financial reporting risk is 
based on the committee of sponsoring organizations of the 
treadway commission (coso) framework, which provides 
the structure and guidance for designing, operating and eval-
uating the system of internal control over financial reporting 
across the group . the framework is the mechanism through 
which management expresses its various assertions over its 
financial statements . group risk and compliance is the risk 
control function for financial reporting risk and is responsible 
for the independent monitoring, assessment and oversight of 
the risks and the group’s implementation of the framework, 
and reports to board audit committee on a quarterly basis .
compliance risk
nordea defines compliance risk as the risk of failure to com-
ply with applicable regulations and related internal rules . 
managers throughout nordea are accountable for the 
compliance risks related to their mandate and for managing 
these risks within risk limits and risk appetite in accordance 
with the compliance risk management framework .
group compliance within group risk and compliance 
(grc) constitutes the independent second line of defence 
(2nd lod) compliance function and is responsible for devel-
oping and maintaining the risk management framework for 
compliance risks and for guiding the business in their imple-
mentation of and adherence to the framework . 
compliance activities are presented in the form of an  
annual compliance oversight plan to the president of nordea 
bank abp and chief executive officer of the nordea group 
(group ceo) and the board of directors (group board) . the 
annual compliance oversight plan represents the compliance 
activities of nordea, combining group compliance’s overall 
approach to key risk areas . the plan is comprised of detailed 
plans for business areas, group functions, consolidated 
group subsidiaries, branches and for each risk area . group

in 2020, covid-19 has had a massive impact on society at 
large including our customers and nordea . in order to main-
tain service levels towards our customers and comply with 
government instructions regarding covid-19, nordea 
employees have increasingly operated remotely, which has 
had a bearing on current operating models and thus intro-
duced potential new risks . nordea has actively monitored 
these risks and implemented mitigating procedures to ensure 
that customers and markets remain as unaffected as possible . 
covid-19 has also brought with it an increased volatility in 
financial markets, and nordea has monitored activities closely 
to ensure fair treatment of our customers and integrity in the 
market . this has been largely supported by an increased 
focus on employee trainings and the enhancement of 
nordea’s market abuse surveillance capabilities . 
nordea’s management of the covid-19 situation meant 
that nordea was also able to keep the financial crime preven-
tion operational processes running as well . development of 
covid-19 was monitored from an early stage enabling a pro-
active approach as the situation developed . accordingly 
nordea was able to maintain the four main capability areas in 
financial crime prevention: sanctions screening, transaction 
monitoring, know your customers (kyc) and fraud 
management .
nordea also continued to strengthen the compliance func-
tion and formally mobilised an enhancement programme to 
look to further reinforce the compliance risk management 
framework during 2020 .
during 2020, nordea continued to work on ensuring that 
nordea’s culture and behaviours are consistent with nordea’s 
values and that nordea delivers fair outcomes for its custom-
ers throughout the entire stage of the customer lifecycle . 
nordea has also progressed in its development of the con-
duct risk framework through improved reporting, risk identi-
fication and raised awareness . nordea has established a com-
mittee to oversee the prudent management of compliance 
and conduct risks . management of conflicts of interest in 
relation to products and services has remained a key area of 
focus .
nordea’s code of conduct and corporate values underpin 
nordea’s culture and set the parameters for how nordea's 
employees should conduct themselves . all nordea’s employ-
ees are required to complete annual training in the code of 
conduct to ensure proper awareness and knowledge of the 
ethical principles . 
nordea is committed to conducting business with the high-
est ethical standards and according to applicable laws, rules 
and regulations . nordea’s internal controls and operating pro-
cedures are designed to detect and prevent misconduct and 
fraudulent actions . 
nordea’s whistleblowing function, raising your concern 
(ryc), ensures that all of nordea’s stakeholders, including 
customers, partners, affected communities as well as our own 
employees, have the right to speak up and always feel safe in 
doing so if they have concerns about suspected misconduct 
such as breaches of human rights, or irregularities such as 
fraudulent, inappropriate, dishonest, illegal or negligent activ-
ity or behaviour in our operations, products or services . 
nordea is subject to various legal regimes and require-
ments, including but not limited to those of the nordic coun-
tries, the european union and the united states . the supervi-
sory and governmental authorities administering and enforc-
ing these regimes make regular enquiries and conduct 
investigations with regard to nordea’s compliance . areas sub-
ject to investigation include investment advice, anti-money 
laundering (aml), trade regulation and sanctions adherence, 
external tax rules, competition law, and governance and con-
trol . the outcome and timing of these enquiries and investi-
gations are unclear and pending . accordingly, it cannot be 
ruled out that these enquiries and investigations could lead to 
criticism against the bank, reputation loss, fines, sanctions, 
disputes and/or litigation . 
in june 2015 the danish financial supervisory authority 
investigated how nordea bank danmark a/s had followed 
the regulations regarding aml . the outcome resulted in criti-
cism and, in accordance with danish administrative practice, 
the matter was handed over to the police for further handling 
and possible sanctions . as previously stated, nordea expects 
to be fined in denmark for weak aml processes and proce-
dures in the past and has made a provision for ongoing aml-
related matters .
there is a risk that, in the event the authorities issue fines, 
these could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current 
provision, and that this could also impact the nordea’s finan-
cial performance . in addition, some of these proceedings 
could lead to litigation . given this uncertainty, nordea will 
maintain the level of provision for ongoing aml-related mat-
ters while also continuing the dialogue with the danish 
authorities regarding their allegations concerning historical 
aml weaknesses . nordea has made significant investments 
to address the deficiencies highlighted by the investigations . 
among other actions, nordea established in 2015 the finan-
cial crime change programme, and has strengthened its 
organisation significantly to enhance the aml and sanction 
management risk frameworks . nordea has also established 
the sustainability and ethics committee and a culture trans-
formation programme to embed stronger ethical standards 
into its corporate culture . the group is also investing in 
enhanced compliance standards, processes and resources in 
both the first and second lines of defence . 
the danish tax authorities have raised a claim for damages 
against nordea of approximately dkk 900m relating to 
nordea's provision of assistance to a foreign bank in connec-
tion with the said bank’s reclaim of dividend tax on behalf of 
one of its customers . it is nordea’s assessment that it is not 
liable, and nordea disputes the claim .
financial crime prevention
nordea continued to strengthen its financial crime defences 
in 2020 . significant compliance enhancements have been 
achieved within the areas of: i) governance, ii) it support of 
customer due diligence processes, iii) acceleration of kyc 
files remediation, iv) transaction monitoring capabilities, v) 
updating nordea’s policies in light of changes in regulation, 
and vi) strengthening of nordea’s sanctions programme .
during the year nordea closely followed issued warnings 
from international advisory bodies and national nordic regu-
lators regarding potential impact of the pandemic on finan-
cial crime (fraud, cybercrime, exploitation of government 
funds etc .) . nordea has also initiated proactive and reactive 
case reviews through risk assessment process, looking into 
patters and reg flags in addition to existing controls (e .g . 
false/fraudulent claims of government aid, unusual transac-
tion patterns during lockdown period) . furthermore, nordea 
has increased its cooperation with local financial intelligent 
units due to higher numbers of urgent inquiries from these .

details on key processes for managing and controlling 
compliance risks are included in the operational and compli-
ance risk section of the capital and risk management report 
2020 published in accordance with the capital requirements 
regulation (crr) .
life insurance risk and market risks in the life &  
pensions operations
the life insurance business of nordea life & pensions (nlp) 
consists of a range of different life & health products, from 
endowments with duration of a few years to very long-term 
pension savings contracts, with durations of more than 40 
years . market return products (unit-linked products) clearly 
dominate nlp’s business . traditional products (participating 
savings and life insurance products) and health insurance 
take minor roles in nlp’s business profile .
the main risks that nlp is exposed to are market risks and 
life & health insurance risks .
market risks at nlp arise from the sensitivity of the values 
of assets and liabilities to changes in the level or volatility of 
market prices or interest rates . within market risk, the interest 
rate risk, equity risk, credit spread risk and currency risk are 
the most relevant risks .
market risks are measured and monitored through expo-
sure calculations and adequate limit setting . in addition, nlp 
regularly performs stress tests and macroeconomic scenario 
analyses to assess the need for future capitalisation . the 
results of stress tests and scenario analysis are monitored 
against limits specified in the internal policies . 
market risk is mitigated by applying hedging and asset 
allocation strategies .
life & health insurance risk is the risk of unexpected losses 
due to changes in the level, trend or volatility of mortality, 
longevity, disability and surrender/ lapse rates . the risks are 
measured and monitored through calculations of the solven-
cy ii capital requirements . to assess the resilience of the busi-
ness to sudden changes in the lapse rate, regular sensitivity 
tests are performed at nlp group and local entity level . life & 
health insurance risk is mitigated using actuarial methods, i .e . 
through tariffs, rules for acceptance of customers, reinsurance 
contracts, stress tests and setting up adequate provisions for 
risks .
liquidity risk management
during 2020, nordea continued to benefit from its prudent 
liquidity risk management, in terms of maintaining a diversi-
fied and strong funding base and a diversified liquidity buffer . 
nordea maintained a strong liquidity position throughout the 
period of covid-19-related market stress .
nordea issued approximately eur 23 .4bn in long-term 
funding in 2020 (excluding danish covered bonds), of which 
approximately eur 8 .4bn was issued in the form of covered 
bonds and eur 15 .0bn was issued as senior debt .
throughout 2020, nordea remained compliant with the 
requirement in liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) in all curren-
cies on a combined basis . 
in the course of 2020, nordea participated in ecb and local 
central bank facilities, for example the targeted longer-term 
refinancing operation (tltro iii) provided by the ecb in the 
second quarter, to further support customer needs .
nordea has borrowed eur 7bn under the tltro iii pro-
gramme . the negative interest expense amounted to eur 
19m in 2020 . nordea recognises negative interest expense 
based on the current applicable interest rate fixed by the ecb . 
the interest rate on the funding is currently –0 .5%, and may in 
the future decrease to –1% with retroactive impact . the inter-
est rate on the liability depends on the rate fixed by the ecb 
and also on the development of the credit volume in a bench-
mark portfolio . if certain thresholds are reached, nordea will 
receive a discount on the interest rate paid, at which time 
nordea will alter the effective interest rate under ifrs 9 . in 
2020 nordea did not include any such alteration of the effec-
tive interest rate, as it could not be assumed with adequate 
certainty that the thresholds would be reached . any impact 
from an alteration of the effective interest rate will be recog-
nised as “net interest income” .
liquidity risk definition and identification
liquidity risk is the risk that nordea is unable to service its 
cash flow obligations when they fall due; or unable to meet 
its cash flow obligations without incurring significant addi-
tional funding costs . nordea is exposed to liquidity risk in its 
lending, investment, funding, off-balance-sheet exposures 
and other activities which result in a negative cash flow mis-
match . cash flow mismatches can occur at the end of a day or 
intraday .
management principles and control
liquidity risk at nordea is managed across three lines of 
defence: 
the first line of defence comprises group treasury & 
asset liability management (talm) and the business areas . 
talm is responsible for the day to day management of the 
group’s liquidity positions, liquidity buffers, external and 
internal funding including the mobilisation of cash around the 
group, and funds transfer pricing (ftp) .
the second line of defence, group risk and compliance, 
is responsible for providing independent oversight of and 
challenge to the first line of defence .
the third line of defence includes group internal audit 
(gia), which is responsible for providing independent over-
sight of the first – and second lines of defence .
the board of directors defines the liquidity risk appetite by 
setting limits for applied liquidity risk metrics . the most cen-
tral metric is the liquidity stress horizon, which defines the 
risk appetite by setting a minimum survival of 90 days under 
institution-specific and market-wide stress scenarios with 
limited mitigation actions .
a framework of limits and monitoring metrics is in place to 
ensure nordea stays within various risk parameters including 
the risk appetite .
a funds transfer pricing (ftp) framework is in place that 
recognises that liquidity is a scarce and costly resource . by 
quantifying and allocating the liquidity and funding costs and 
benefits to the respective business areas, behaviours and 
strategic decisions are appropriately incentivised .
liquidity risk management strategy 
nordea’s liquidity management strategy is based on 
policy statements resulting in various liquidity risk 
measures, limits and organisational procedures .
policy statements stipulate that nordea’s liquidity manage-
ment reflects a conservative attitude towards liquidity risk . 
nordea strives to diversify its sources of funding and seeks to 
establish and maintain relationships with investors in order to 
ensure market access . a broad and diversified funding struc-
ture is reflected by the strong presence in the group’s four 
domestic markets in the form of a strong and stable retail 
notes to the financial statements – nordea group
135
nordea annual report 2020
customer base and the variety of funding programmes . the 
funding programmes are both short-term (us – and europe-
an commercial paper, and certificates of deposits) and long-
term (covered bonds, european medium-term notes,  
medium-term notes) and cover a range of currencies .
trust is fundamental in the funding market; therefore, 
nordea periodically publishes information on the liquidity sit-
uation of the group . furthermore, nordea regularly performs 
stress testing of the liquidity risk position, e .g . nordea devel-
oped specific covid-19 liquidity stress scenarios to capture 
relevant risk drivers, and has put in place business contingen-
cy plans for liquidity crisis management .
liquidity risk measurement
to ensure funding in situations where nordea is in urgent 
need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, 
nordea holds a liquidity buffer . the liquidity buffer consists of 
central bank eligible, high credit quality and liquid securities 
and central bank cash that can be readily sold or used as col-
lateral in funding operations .
liquidity risk management focuses on both short-term 
liquidity risk and long-term structural liquidity risk . liquidity 
risk is limited by the board of directors via liquidity stress 
coverage and liquidity stress horizon metrics stipulating 
that the liquidity buffer needs to be sufficient to cover peak 
cumulative stressed outflows experienced over the first 90 
days of a combined stress event, whereby nordea is subject 
to a market-wide stress similar to what many banks experi-
enced in 2007–08; and an idiosyncratic stress corresponding 
to a three-notch credit rating downgrade . these metrics form 
the basis for nordea’s liquidity risk appetite, which is 
reviewed and approved by the board at least annually .
furthermore, short-term funding risk is measured via the 
liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and a funding gap risk metric . 
the funding gap risk metric expresses the expected maxi-
mum accumulated need for raising liquidity in the course of 
the next 30 days . funding gap risk is measured and limited 
for each currency and as a total figure for all currencies 
combined . 
structural liquidity risk of nordea is measured via many 
metrics of which the net stable funding ratio (nsfr) and 
the internally defined net balance of stable funding (nbsf) 
are very important . furthermore, the loan to deposit ratio is 
closely monitored together with the wholesale funding refi-
nancing profile and rating agency metrics . 
liquidity risk analysis
nordea continues to have a strong and prudent liquidity risk 
profile with a strong funding base . as of year-end 2020, the 
total volume utilised under cd and cp programmes was eur 
33 .7bn (eur 44 .3bn) with an average maturity of 0 .4 (0 .3) 
years . the total volume under long-term programmes was 
eur 147 .6bn (eur 159 .3bn) with an average maturity being 
6 .8 (6 .3) years . nordea’s funding sources are presented in a 
table below .
the liquidity risk position remained at a low level through-
out 2020 . the liquidity stress horizon was 530 days as of 
year-end 2020 (504 days as of year-end 2019) with a yearly 
average of 671 days (642 days) – the group limit is not below 
90 days . 
the yearly average of the funding gap risk was eur 
+35 .8bn (eur +29 .7bn in 2019) against a limit of eur –15bn . 
nordea’s liquidity buffer ranged between eur 88 .3bn and 
129 .8bn throughout 2020 (eur 88 .1bn and 108 .2bn) with an 
average liquidity buffer of eur 103 .7bn (eur 97 .2bn) .
the combined lcr according to eba delegated act rules 
for the nordea group was at the end of 2020 158% (166%) 
with a yearly average of 166% (188%) . at the end of 2020 the 
lcr in eur was 278% (236%) and in usd 119% (146%), with 
yearly averages of 209% (201%) and 199% (187%), respec-
tively . at the end of 2020 nordea’s nsfr was 110 .3% 
(108 .6%) .

annual report 2020 nordea
operating segments 
measurement of operating segments’ performance
the measurement principles and allocation between operat-
ing segments follow the information reported to the chief 
operating decision maker (codm), as required by ifrs 8 . in 
nordea the codm has been defined as the chief executive 
officer (ceo), who is supported by the other members of the 
group leadership team .
the main difference between the segment reporting in 
note g3 and “business areas” presented elsewhere in this 
report is that the information in note g3 follows the reporting 
to the codm prepared using plan exchange rates, while the 
reporting under “business areas” is prepared using actual fx 
rates . the comparatives are annually restated to reflect the 
plan exchange rates for the current period as reflected in the 
internal reporting used by the codm . 
basis of segmentation
nordea's main business areas personal banking, business 
banking, large corporates & institutions and asset & wealth 
management are identified as operating segments and report-
ed separately as they are operating segments exceeding the 
quantitative thresholds in ifrs 8 . other operating segments 
below the thresholds are included in other operating seg-
ments . group functions (and eliminations) as well as the result 
that is not fully allocated to any of the operating segments, are 
shown separately as reconciling items .
changes in basis of segmentation in 2020
up until 2019 the group leadership team was defined as the 
codm . in 2020 the codm has been changed to the ceo, to 
better reflect the current decision making process in nordea . 
the ceo is supported by the group leadership team . 
the operating segments, as well as the reportable operating 
segments, have also been changed as from 2020, in order to reflect 
the current reporting to the codm and the decision making  
process in nordea . the change is driven by the level of informa-
tion reviewed by the codm, which resulted in fewer operating 
segments than in 2019 . the main business areas are, as from 
2020, defined as reportable operating segments and the break-
downs of the different main areas disclosed in previous years 
have consequently been removed . group finance is in addition 
included in other operating segments as it is below the thresh-
old to be disclosed separately . comparative figures have been 
restated accordingly, in line with the reporting to the codm, 
including minor organisational changes, updates to current plan 
exchange rates and updates to current allocation principles .
reportable operating segments
personal banking serves nordea’s household customers .  
personal banking offers customers a full range of financial  
services that fulfil the customers' day-to-day financial needs .

1)  ifrs 8 requires information on revenues from transactions between operating segments . nordea has defined inter-segment revenues as internal interest income and expense related 
to the funding of the operating segments by the internal bank in group finance . 
2)  the codm reviews “loans to the public” and “deposits and borrowings from the public” as measures of reportable segments' total assets and liabilities and these line items are 
 consequently separately reported .

1)  ifrs 8 requires information on revenues from transactions between operating segments . nordea has defined inter-segment revenues as internal interest income and expense related 
to the funding of the operating segments by the internal bank in group finance . 
2)  the codm reviews “loans to the public” and “deposits and borrowings from the public” as measures of reportable segments' total assets and liabilities and these line items are 
consequently separately reported .
3)  comparable figures have been restated following the changes in reportable segments and the use of current year plan exchange rates .

pension obligations
the pension plans are funded, meaning that the pension plan 
obligations are backed with plan assets with fair value gener-
ally on a similar level as the obligations .
the pension obligation (value of defined benefit pension 
plan liabilities) is calculated in accordance with ias 19 . the 
obligation is dependent on changes in actuarial assumptions 
and inter-annual variations can therefore be significant . 
ias 19 includes an assumption about future increases in 
salary, so that the pension obligations disclosed are the 
earned pension rights calculated using the expected salary 
levels at retirement . 
the pension obligation is the ias 19 valuation on  
31 december 2020 .

notice period and severance pay
in accordance with the employment contract the ceo has a 
notice period of 12 months and nordea a notice period of 12 
months . the ceo has severance pay equal to 12 months’ sal-
ary, to be reduced by any salary he receives from other 
employment during these 12 months .
the interim deputy managing director and nine glt mem-
bers have a notice period of six months and nordea a notice 
period of 12 months . severance pay of up to 12 months’ salary 
is provided to be reduced by any salary the executive receives 
from other employment during the severance pay period . 
no severance pay commitment has been agreed with 
members of glt in 2020 . severance pay commitments to glt 
members agreed and recognised in 2019 amounted to eur 
2,427,212 . 
total remuneration paid in 2020 during the notice period 
amounted to eur 3,599,889, of which eur 1,537,148 related 
to the former ceo . the payments during the notice period 
have been included where relevant in the 2020 disclosure, but 
covered by provisions recognised in 2019 and consequently 
not recognised as an expense in 2020 .
indemnification
nordea bank abp has undertaken to indemnify the members 
of the glt against legal expenses incurred in relation to legal 
advice in defending or disputing certain claims or investiga-
tions from third parties, excluding crimes or actions made 
with intent or gross negligence . for each glt member, the 
indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of eur 37 .5m, 
unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-
case basis . the indemnity is secondary to any other insurance 
coverage .
loans and deposits to key management personnel
loans to key management personnel (defined in note g1 sec-
tion 28) amount to eur 3m (eur 2m) and interest income on 
these loans amount to eur 0m (eur 0m) . deposits from key 
management personnel amount to eur 14m (eur 18m) and 
interest on these deposit amount to eur 0m (eur 0m) .  
loan commitments to key management personnel amount  
to eur 0m (eur 0m) .
for key management personnel who are employed by 
nordea the same credit terms apply as for other employees . 
in finland the employee interest rate for loans corresponds to 
nordea's funding cost with a margin of 30 basis points . in 
denmark the employee interest rate for loans is variable and 
was 2 .25 % at 31 december 2020 . in norway the employee 
interest rate for loans is variable and was 1 .15% at 31 decem-
ber 2020 . in sweden the employee interest rate on fixed and 
variable interest rate loans is 215 basis points lower than the 
corresponding interest rate for external customers (with a 
lower limit of 50 basis points) . there is currently a cap of 57 
swedish price base amounts both on fixed and variable inter-
est rate loans . for interest on loans above the defined caps, 
the same terms apply as for premium customers . loans to 
family members of key management personnel are granted 
on normal market terms, as well as loans to key management 
personnel who are not employed by nordea .
share-based transactions
nordea has several variable remuneration programmes for 
selected nordea employees (participants) . the terms of the 
programmes vary depending on the target group . disclosures 
related to the share-based programmes can be found below . 
all remuneration programmes are also described in the sepa-
rate remuneration section on page 63 in the board of direc-
tors report and in more details below . 
in 2020, nordea introduced a new long term incentive 
plan (ltip) for glt members, which is an equity settled plan . 
for more info on this plan, see “long term incentive plan 
2020–2022” below .
up until 2018 nordea in addition deferred variable pay 
using a total shareholder return (tsr) indexation (excluding 
dividends) . the programme was consequently all settled in 
cash and the portion indexed with nordea’s tsr was account-
ed for as a cash-settled share-based payment programme .  
as from the 2019 program it was changed so that 50% of the 
program is paid in cash and 50% settled in nordea shares, 
which makes the portion paid in nordea shares an equity- 
settled share-based programme .

annual report 2020 nordea
the 2019 variable remuneration plans were in 2019 
expensed by eur 20m for compensation to be paid in cash 
and eur 20m for the share-based programme part . these 
have during 2020 been adjusted down to eur 14m for the 
portion paid in cash and eur 7m for the share-based pro-
gramme part . in 2020 1,331,083 shares in nordea were allot-
ted to the participants in these programmes, equalling eur 
7m based on the share price at the award date . another 
1,219,284 shares were granted to the participants but 
deferred . these deferred shares had a fair value of eur 6m 
based on the share price at the award date .
the following table covers all programs with share-based 
programme expenses recognised in 2020, or in the compara-
tive figures for 2019 . figures for 2020 are based on expected 
2020 outcome and all figures are excluding social security 
expenses . the expense for 2020 is based on an assumption 
on the number of shares that will be granted and deferred  
for delivery in later years .
long term incentive plan 2020–2022
the nordea board decided on 11 june 2020 to issue a new 
ltip for senior management (glt) . the plan delivers condi-
tional share awards, i .e . a promise to deliver shares if certain 
conditions are met . the plan includes a three year perfor-
mance period, from 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2022 . 
the maximum number of shares allocated to the partici-
pants was decided when the program was launched and the 
final number of shares to be awarded to each participant will 
be calculated in q2 2023 based on the outcome of three per-
formance criteria as per december 31 2022, where each crite-
ria has a weight of 1/3:
• absolute total shareholders return (atsr), 
• relative total shareholders return (rtsr),
• cumulative earnings per share (eps) .

reinvested) compared to a group of 9 peers . 
maximum allotment for rtsr if nordea is first 
among peers . no allotment for rtsr if nordea is 
6th or lower among peers .
performance 
condition eps
total earnings per share for the period 2021–2022 . 
maximum allotment for eps above eur 1 .80 . no 
allotment for eps below eur 1 .20 .
cap
total allocation cannot exceed 200%  
of participants salary .
40% of the shares awarded are delivered to the participants 
in q2 2023 . the remaining 60% will be delivered to the par-
ticipants in equal numbers in the period of q2 2024 to 
q2 2028 if the participants are still employed in nordea . all 
shares that have been delivered is subject to a 12 month 
retention period, where the participant cannot access or sell 
the shares . unvested shares will not be delivered if the 
employment is terminated before the award payment, how-
ever, subject to local regulations and leaver provisions, unless 
the criteria for a “good leaver” is fulfilled .
if the financial circumstances of nordea deteriorates or if 
the participant breaches internal policies, the awards to be 
given can be reduced or cancelled . there are also possibilities 
for clawbacks of deferred shares in similar situations . these 
conditions do not affect the assessment of the grant date 
being 11 june 2020 as the likelihood is low and all partici-
pants are aware of these conditions from the start .

the expected volatility is based on nordea’s historic daily 
share price volatility over a historical period of 3 .0 years of 
33 .9% and has been adjusted for one-off events (covid-19) 
which are not expected to be repeated in the future, i .e . the 
company’s historical volatility from pre march 2020 is used . 
taking this into account nordea has excluded the period of 
highest share price volatility from the calculation of the 
expected volatility at the grant date (being the period from  
9 march 2020 to 25 march 2020) . removing this period 
results in a historical share price volatility of 29 .1% .

the nordea group has eur 406m (eur 487m) deferred tax 
assets on the balance sheet at the end of 2020 . the recogni-
tion of deferred tax assets is based on an assessment of the 
probability and amount of future taxable profits and on future 
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, which 
include estimation uncertainty . the estimation uncertainties 
that are assessed to pose significant risks of resulting in 
material adjustments to the carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets are described below .
the balance includes a gross asset of eur 104m (eur 
104m) recognised in relation to danish tax losses of nordea 
bank abp . these losses can be carried forward with no expiry . 
management expects the tax losses to be utilised within the 
next three to four years based on estimated taxable profits 
available under currently applied capitalisation policies for 
tax purposes, and sooner if the company opts out from recog-
nising expenses for tax purposes in excess of expenses under 
accounting rules . furthermore, nordea bank abp's head 
office in finland has recognised a eur 249m (eur 225m)
deferred tax asset in relation to unused foreign tax credits 
that management expects to be utilised within the expiry 
period of five years . this expectation is based on estimated 
future taxable profits from foreign operations, reversal of 
temporary differences and upfront taxation in finland of cer-
tain types of income compared to relevant branch 
jurisdictions .
additionally, the group has unrecognised deferred tax 
assets of eur 3m (eur 54m) in relation to tax loss carry for-
wards in various entities as well as eur 375m (eur 334m) in 
relation to unused foreign tax credits in nordea bank abp,

nordea enters into derivatives for trading and risk manage-
ment purposes . nordea may take positions with the expecta-
tion of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates 
or indices . the trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for 
risk management purposes . derivatives held for risk manage-
ment purposes include hedges that either meet the hedge 
accounting requirements or hedges that are economic hedg-
es, but do not meet the hedge accounting requirements . the 
table below shows the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments together with their notional amounts . the notion-
al amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding 
at the year end and are not indicative of either the market or

risk management
nordea manages its identified market risks according to the 
risk management framework and strategy described in the 
market risk section in note g2 “risk and liquidity manage-
ment” . 
 
 
 
nordea classifies its exposures to market risk into either 
trading (the trading book) or non-trading (the banking book) 
portfolios that are managed separately .  
 
the trading book consists of all positions in financial 
instruments held by nordea either with trading intent, or in 
order to hedge positions held with trading intent . positions 
held with trading intent are those held intentionally for short-
term resale or with the intention of benefiting from actual or 
expected short-term price differences between buying and 
selling prices, or from other price or interest rate variations . 
the banking book comprises all positions not held in the 
trading book . all hedges qualifying for hedge accounting are 
performed in the banking book . the hedging instruments and 
risks hedged are further described below per risk and hedge 
accounting type . 
 
 
interest rate risk
nordea’s primary business model is to collect deposits and 
use these funds to provide loans and other funding products 
and debt instruments to its customers . interest rate risk is the 
impact that changes in interest rates could have on nordea’s 
margins, profit or loss and equity . interest risk arises from 
mismatch of interest from interest-bearing liabilities and 
assets such as deposits, issued debt securities and loan port-
folio .  
 
 
as part of nordea’s risk management strategy, the board 
has established limits on the non-trading interest rate gaps 
for the interest rate sensitivities . these limits are consistent 
with nordea’s risk appetite and nordea aligns its hedge 
accounting objectives to keep exposures within those limits . 
nordea’s policy is to monitor positions on a daily basis . for 
further information on measurement of risks, see the market 
risk section in note g2 “risk and liquidity management” .
for hedge accounting relationships related to interest rate 
risk, the hedged item is the benchmark rate . the hedging 
ratio is established by matching the notional of the deriva-
tives against the principal of the hedged item .
interest risk arises from mismatch of interest from interest-
bearing liabilities and assets such as deposits, issued debt 
securities, interest-bearing securities and loan portfolio . in 
order to hedge the risk, the group uses the hedging instru-
ments, which are interest rate derivatives to swap interest 
rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates, in order to 
manage the risk, and limit the impact on nordea's margins, 
profit or loss, and equity .
 the group designates risk component of hedged items as 
follows:
• benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest 
rate risk, such as the libor and stibor . using the bench-
mark interest rate risk can result in other risks, such as 
credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge 
accounting relationship; and 
• components of cashflows of hedged items .
the benchmark rate is determined as a change in present 
value of the future cash flows using benchmark rate discount 
curves . the benchmark rate is separately identifiable and reli-
ably measurable and is typically the most significant compo-
nent of the overall change in fair value or cash flows . 
 
 
fair value hedges 
in order to reduce or eliminate changes in the fair value of 
financial assets and financial liabilities due to movements in 
interest rates, nordea enters into fair value hedge relation-
ships by transforming the fixed interest rate risk in recognised 
financial assets and financial liabilities to floating with inter-
est rate swaps .  
 
 
there is an economic relationship between the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the interest 
rate swap match the terms of the fixed rate assets or liabili-
ties (i .e . notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates) . 
the hedged item notional amount is the core stable volume 
and its maturity is based on expected repricing dates, rather 
than contractual terms . 
 
 
the below table presents the accumulated fair value 
adjustments arising from continuing hedge relationships, irre-
spective of whether or not there has been a change in hedge 
designation during the year .

source of ineffectiveness include the following:
i) mismatch between the reset frequency of the swap and the 
benchmark frequency
ii) the fair value of the floating leg of the swap on a date 
other than the reset date
cash flow hedges
for nordea’s cash flow hedge of interest rate risk relate to 
exposures to the variability in future interest payments and 
receipts due to the movement of benchmark interest rates on 
forecast transactions and on recognised financial assets and 
financial liabilities . this variability in cash flows is hedged by 
interest rate swaps, fixing the hedged cashflows according to 
nordea’s policies and risk management strategy described in 
note g1, section 10, and in the market risk section in note g2 
“risk and liquidity management” .  
 
 
there is an economic relationship between the hedged 
items and the hedging instruments as the terms of the inter-
est rate swaps match the terms of the future interest cash 
flows (i .e . notional amount and expected payment date) . 
changes in the valuation of swaps that are part of effective 
cash flow hedge relationships are recognised in cash flow 
hedge reserves .
the below tables provide information about the hedging 
instruments as well as the outcome of the cash flow hedges 
addressing interest rate risk including the notional and the

es in fair values used for measuring hedge ineffectiveness

average rate of instruments hedging interest rate risk 
the average interest rate on the fixed leg of instruments  
hedging interest rate risk per 31 december 2020 is 0 .84%  
(0 .78%) .
currency risk
currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instru-
ment will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates . 
foreign exchange risk (fx risk) from trading activities is lim-
ited through a var limit while fx risk from structural expo-
sures as described below is limited through a stress loss limit 
for the cet1-ratio impact from fx fluctuations in a severed 
but plausible stress scenario (see the market risk section in 
note g2 “risk and liquidity management”) . 
nordea’s issuance of credits and borrowing can be denom-
inated in the currency of the borrower or investor . borrowing, 
investing and lending are not always executed in the same 
currency, thus exposing nordea to a foreign exchange risk . 
differences in exposures to individual currencies that exist 
between different transactions are predominantly matched 
by entering into cross currency interest rate swaps . the cur-
rency component is designated as a cash flow hedge of cur-
rency risk and the interest component as a fair value hedge of 
interest rate risk .    
in addition to the above, nordea also has exposure to 
structural foreign currency risk through its foreign operations 
that have a functional currency other than nordea’s presenta-
tion currency, eur (i .e . a translation risk) . fluctuation of the 
spot exchange rates will cause nordea’s reported net invest-
ment in foreign operations to vary and the cet1-ratio to fluc-
tuate from the currency mismatch between equity and risk 
exposure amounts (rea) . nordea applies hedge accounting 
when it hedges its investments in fully consolidated foreign 
operations whose functional currency is not eur .  
for hedge accounting relationships related to currency risk, 
the hedged item is a foreign currency component . the hedg-
ing ratio is one-to-one and is established by matching the 
notional of the derivatives against the principal of the hedged 
item .
the currency component is determined as the change in 
present value of the future cash flows using foreign exchange 
curves . the foreign currency component is separately identifi-
able and reliably measurable and is typically the most signifi-
cant component of the overall change in fair value or cash 
flows .
cash flow and net investment hedges 
the below tables provide information about the hedging 
instruments as well as the outcome of the cash flow and net 
investment hedges addressing currency risks including the 
notional and the carrying amounts of the hedging instru-
ments and the changes in fair values used for measuring 
hedge ineffectiveness separately showing the effective and 
ineffective portions .

nordea has one material associate, luminor holding as . the 
company is the result of the merger of nordea's and dnb's 
operations in the baltics . in 2018 the investment was classi-
fied as a joint venture as nordea held 50 .0% of the voting 
rights . in 2019 nordea sold shares in luminor and the current 
ownership is 19 .9% of the shares in luminor . 
as communicated in connection with the announcement of 
the deal on 13 september 2018, nordea and blackstone have 
additionally entered into a forward sale agreement for the 
sale of nordea's remaining 20 per cent stake . the forward 
sale is subject to certain conditions but is expected to com-
plete over the next two financial years .
luminor is included in the consolidated accounts of nordea 
via the equity method . luminor applies ifrs in its consolidated 
accounts and the balance sheet and income statements below 
are based on ifrs . the disclosed figures show the entire lumi-
nor group, not just nordea's share . the full-year figures for 
2020 were not available when this report was published .

the ibor reform 
the ibor transition is a global reform with significant 
impact on the financial industry . it will affect a large 
variety of financial services and thus individuals, 
companies and institutions . the transition will influence 
products, market liquidity, risk management, data and 
technology infrastructure as well as financials and the 
balance sheet . ibors are embedded in a vast range 
of financial instruments including loans, mortgages, 
bonds, trading product and derivative contracts .
current expectations are that some ibors will be replaced, 
while others may continue to exist but with a reformed meth-
odology . there is currently uncertainty as to the timing and 
the methods of transition for the different ibors and whether 
some existing benchmarks will continue to be supported . 
eonia (for eur) as well as gbp, jpy, chf and eur libor 
will likely cease to exist after 2021, usd libor will likely 
cease to exist mid 2023, while euribor and the nordic 
ibors are expected to be available beyond 2021 in reformed 
formats .
g19. derivatives and hedge accounting, cont.
nordea has established an ibor transition programme 
sponsored by the cfo and group treasurer to prepare and 
coordinate group-wide efforts to manage the operational 
impacts and financial risks caused by the transition from 
existing ibor rates to alternative near risk-free rates . an ibor 
transition office is responsible for the group-wide coordina-
tion of transition activities and reports to a steering commit-
tee with participation from senior management in business 
areas and group functions to ensure a centralised nordea 
strategy and senior management steering and oversight . 
business areas and group functions are responsible for, and 
drive, the execution of changes required for a successful tran-
sition to alternative near risk-free rates .
nordea has adopted the amendments to ifrs 7 and ias 39 
in phase i and in the table below, nominal amounts of the 
hedging derivatives in scope for the relief are disclosed . 
nordea has not yet adopted the amendments in phase ii .

impairment testing of goodwill and computer software
a cash-generating unit, defined as the operating segment, is 
the basis for the impairment test .
the impairment test is performed for each cash generating 
unit by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets, 
including goodwill, with the recoverable amount . the recov-
erable amount is the value in use and is estimated based on 
discounted cash flows . due to the long-term nature of the 
investments, cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely . 
cash flows for the coming three years are based on finan-
cial forecasts . the forecasts are based on nordea's macro-
economic outlook, including information on gdp growth, 
inflation and benchmark rates for relevant countries . based 
on these macro forecasts, business areas project how mar-
gins, volumes, sales and costs will develop over the coming 
years . credit losses are estimated using the long term aver-
age for the different business areas . this results in an income 
statement for each year . the projected cash flow for each 
year is the forecasted net result in these income statements, 
reduced by the capital needed to grow the business in accor-
dance with the long term growth assumptions . the projec-
tions take into consideration the major projects initiated in 
nordea, e .g . the transformation programme . there is also an 
allocation of central costs to business areas to make sure the 
cash flows for the cgus include all indirect costs . tax costs 
are estimated based on the standard tax rate . cash flows for 
the period beyond the forecasting period are based on esti-
mated sector growth rates . growth rates are based on histori-
cal data, updated to reflect the current situation . 
the derived cash flows are discounted at a rate based on 
the market’s long-term risk-free rate of interest and yield 
requirements . the following growth rates and discount rates 
have been used:

the impairment tests conducted in 2020 did not indicate any 
need for goodwill impairment . see also note g1 “accounting 
policies” section 4 for more information . 
both an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point 
and a reduction in the future growth rate of 1 percentage 
point are considered to be reasonably possible changes in key 
assumptions . such a change would not result in any 
impairment . 
during the year nordea recognised an impairment of non-
core it-systems following a decision to decommission or 
replace the functionality . the impairment amounted to eur 
45m and was recognised in group business support, which is 
included in group functions in the reconciliation between 
total operating segments and financial statements in the seg-
ment reporting in note g3 . the carrying amounts after 
impairment for the it assets are disclosed per cgu in the 
table above, based on the receiving unit .

see note g22 “properties and equipment” for further infor-
mation related to right of use assets .
see note g44 “maturity analysis for assets and liabilities” 
for further infromation on the maturity profile .
the lease liability does not include the future estimated 
cash flows for significant committed leases that have not yet 
commenced amounting to approximately eur 100m . 
nordea operates in leased premises . the premises are 
mainly divided into head-office contracts, banking branches 
and other contracts . 
the head office contracts in the different nordic countries 
generally have fixed lease terms of 10–25 years . usually these 
contracts have either continuation options or they are auto-
matically continued unless separately terminated at the end 
of the lease term .   
banking branch contracts generally either have fixed lease 
terms of 1–10 years or are without an end date with the right 
to terminate . the termination clauses are generally 6–24 
months . the main principle is that the premises contracts do 
not contain purchase options . the company car contracts 
generally have a fixed lease term of less than 5 years .

1) included in net result from items at fair value . 
 
2) including also fair value adjustments on investment properties presented as “assets in 
pooled schemes and unit-linked investments contracts” on the balance sheet .  
the method applied when calculating fair value is a rate of 
return calculation, based on internal models . as a supplement 
to these values, appraisals were obtained from independent 
external valuers for parts of the investment properties . 
approximately 75% of the investment properties are val-
ued using internal models based on a rate of return calcula-
tion . for the remaining 25% of the investment properties, 
appraisals were obtained from independent external valuers .

provisions for restructuring costs have been utilised by eur 
138m in 2020, and an increase of eur 83m has been account-
ed for . the provision is related to staff restructuring (eur 
200m) and premises related obligations (eur 45m) . the staff 
related provision is related to the new group business plan, 
including new financial targets . these activities were largely 
initiated already in 2019, but have continued also in 2020 . 
approximately eur 150m of the eur 245m is expected to be 
utilised in 2021 . staff related activities are expected to be exe-
cuted on during 2021, but payments are expected to extend to 
2022 . like for any other provision, there is uncertainty sur-
rounding timing and amount . the uncertainty is expected to 
decrease as the plans are executed .
loan loss provisions on off-balance sheet items amount to 
eur 236m (eur 144m) . more information on these provisions 
can be found in note g2 “risk and liquidity management” .
the provision related to aml related matters (eur 95m) 
remains unchanged compared with 2019 .

nordea sponsors both defined contribution plans (dcp) and 
defined benefit plans (dbp) . ias 19 ensures that the pension 
obligations net of plan assets backing these obligations are 
reflected on the group's balance sheet . the major plans in 
each country are funded schemes covered by assets in pen-
sion funds/foundations .
the plans are structured in accordance with local regula-
tions and legislation, local practice and, where applicable, 
collective agreements . nordea's main dbps in sweden, nor-
way and finland are all employer financed final salary and 
service-based pension plans providing pension benefits on 
top of the statutory systems . all dbps are closed for new 
entrants; new employees are offered dcps . 
dbps in sweden are mainly offered in accordance with  
collective agreements and follow the regulations in the  
pension obligations vesting act (tryggandelagen) . plan 
assets are held in a separate pension foundation . 
in norway the dbps are in accordance with the nordea 
norway occupational pension plan and follow the occupa-
tional pension act (foretakspensjonloven) . in norway, plan 
assets are also held in a separate pension fund . 
in finland, nordea provides additional pension benefits on 
top of the statutory system in accordance with the nordea 
finland occupational pension plan and follows the regula-
tions in the employees' pension act (tyel) . plan assets are 
generally held in a separate pension foundation . 
minimum funding requirements differ between plans but 
where such requirements are based on collective agreements 
or internal policies the funding requirement is generally that 
the pension obligations measured using local requirements 
shall be covered in full, with a predefined surplus or alterna-
tively safeguarded by a credit insurance contract (sweden 
only) . some pension plans are not covered by funding 
requirements and are generally unfunded . quarterly assess-
ments are performed to monitor the likely level of future 
contributions .
defined benefit plans may impact nordea via changes in 
the net present value of obligations and/or changes in the 
market value of plan assets . changes in the obligation are 
most importantly driven by changes in assumptions on dis-
count rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, salary 
increases, turnover and mortality as well as relevant experi-
ence adjustments where the actual outcome differs from the 
assumptions . 
assets are invested in diversified portfolios as further dis-
closed below, with bond exposures mitigating the interest 
rate risk in the obligations and a fair amount of real assets 
(inflation protected) to reduce the long term inflationary risk 
in liabilities .
ias 19 pension calculations and assumptions
calculations on major plans are performed by external  
liability calculators and are based on different actuarial 
assumptions .

year-end 2020, while the assumptions disclosed for 2019 are used for calculating the 
pension expense in 2020 .
2)  more information on the discount rate can be found in note g1 “accounting poli-

the sensitivity analyses are prepared by changing one actu-
arial assumption while keeping the other assumptions 
unchanged . this is a simplified approach because the actu-
arial assumptions are usually correlated . however, it enables 
isolating one effect from another . the method used for calcu-
lating the impact on the obligation is the same as when cal-
culating the obligation accounted for in the financial state-
ments . the sensitivity analysis includes the impact on the lia-
bilities held for future swt (special wage tax) or ssc (social 
security contributions) in sweden and norway, respectively . 
as all pensions in denmark are salary-indexed, inflation 
has no impact on the dbo in denmark .

asset composition
the combined return on assets in 2020 was 4 .8% (8 .8%) . 
despite challenging asset returns, particularly in equities, 
strong performance of fixed income assets and interest rate 
hedging instruments led to a positive total return . at the end 
of the year, the equity exposure in nordea´s pension funds/
foundations represented 19% (19%) of total assets .
the group expects to contribute eur 2m to its defined 
benefit plans in 2021 .

1) cost related to special wage tax (swt) in sweden and social security contribution (ssc) in norway . 
defined benefit pension cost
the total net pension cost related to defined benefit plans 
recognised in the group's income statement (as staff costs) 
for the year is eur 61m (eur 46m) . total pension costs 
 comprise defined benefit pension costs as well as costs relat-
ed to defined contribution plans (see specification in note g8 
“staff costs”) .
compared with the pension cost in 2019, excluding past service cost and related swt and ssc, the pension cost remained 
largely unchanged in 2020 . 
notes to the financial statement – nordea group

nordea annual report 2020
multiemployer plans
in 2010 the norwegian parliament decided to change the afp 
(avtalefestet pensjon) plan in norway as from 2011 . the 
change gave rise to a new multiemployer defined benefit 
plan that cannot be calculated as such, as information on 
nordea's share of the liabilities and pension costs in the plan 
is not available from fellesordningen (the administrator) . 
consequently the afp plan has to be accounted for as a 
defined contribution plan in accordance with ias 19 . informa-
tion on the funded status in the plan is not available .
the afp plan gives the entitled employees a lifelong addi-
tion to regular pensions from the age of 62 . furthermore, the 
scheme allows employees to continue working while receiv-
ing afp without this affecting their pension rights . the plan is 
founded on the basis of a tripartite cooperation between 
employer organisations, employee organisations and the nor-
wegian government . the government covers one third of the 
pension expense for the afp plan while the member compa-
nies collectively cover the remaining two thirds of the pension 
expense . the premium the member firms pay to the plan is 
determined to be sufficient to cover on-going pension 
expenses and provide a basis for building up a pension fund . 
the purpose of the pension fund is to ensure sufficient ability 
to cover expected future pension obligations .
the premium rate for 2020 was 2 .5% of employees’ wages 
between 1 and 7 .1 times the average base amount according 
to the norwegian national insurance act . the premium is cal-
culated based on the average wages and average base 
amounts from the previous year, excluding employees over 
the age of 61 . total premiums paid in 2020 amount to eur 
3m . payments into the plan in 2020 covered 2,373 employees . 
the premium rate for 2020 will be 2 .5% of the employees’ 
wages between 1 and 7 .1 times the average base amount 
according to the norwegian national insurance act . the 
expected premiums in 2021 amount to eur 3m .
the employees that meet the requirements for afp are 
guaranteed afp payments regardless of the solvency of their 
employers . consequently, the employer members have joint 
responsibility for two thirds of the pensions payable to 
employees who, at any given time meet the requirements for 
afp . any deficit or surplus on windup of the plan or the with-
drawal of entities from the plan will not have any impact on 
nordea .
key management personnel
the group’s total pension obligations regarding key manage-
ment personnel amounted to eur 7m (eur 7m) at the end of 
the year . these obligations are largely covered by plan assets . 
defined benefit pension costs (current service cost as well as 
past service cost and settlements as defined in ias 19) related 
to key management personnel in 2020 were eur 0m (eur 
0m) . complete information concerning key management per-
sonnel is disclosed in note g8 “staff costs” .

the balance sheet and pledged for other than own liabilities 
are reported in note g37 “other assets pledged” . securities 
borrowed and then used as collateral are reported in note 
g43 “transferred assets and obtained collaterals” .
assets pledged for own liabilities contain securities 
pledged as security in repurchase agreements and in securi-
ties lending . the transactions are conducted under standard 
agreements employed by financial markets participants . 
counterparts in those transactions are credit institutions and 
the public . the transactions are typically short term with 
maturity within three months .
securities in the life operations are also pledged as secu-
rity for the corresponding insurance liabilities .
loans to the public have been registered as collateral for 
issued covered bonds and mortgage bonds in line with local 
legislation . in the event of the company´s insolvency, the 
holders of these bonds have priority to the assets registered 
as collateral .
other assets pledged relate to certificates of deposits 
pledged by nordea to comply with authority requirements .

assets recognised on the balance sheet and pledged on 
behalf of other items than nordea’s liabilities are disclosed

sheet and pledged for own liabilities are disclosed in note 
g36 “assets pledged as securities for own liabilities” . securi-
ties borrowed and then used as collateral are reported in

other assets pledged are mainly related to securities, 
which include interest-bearing securities pledged as securi-
ties for payment settlements within the central banks and 
clearing institutions in the amount of eur 267m (eur 20m) . 
from 2020 only securities that are pledged for overnight 
liquidity are disclosed (pledged securities for intraday liquid-
ity are excluded) . comparative figures have been restated . 
collateral pledged on behalf of other items other than the 
company´s own liabilities, e .g . on behalf of a third party or  
on behalf of the company´s own contingent liabilities is also 
accounted for under this item .

in its normal business, nordea issues various forms of guar-
antees in favour of its customers . loan guarantees are given 
for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit and 
pension institutions . other guarantees consist mainly of com-
mercial guarantees such as bid guarantees, advance payment 
guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related guaran-
tees . contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevocable 
import documentary credits and confirmed export documen-
tary credits . these transactions are part of the bank's services 
and support nordea´s customers . guarantees and documen-
tary credits are off-balance-sheet items, unless there is a 
need for a provision to cover a probable loan loss that arises 
from the judgement that reimbursement will not be received . 
the table above includes all issued guarantees, also those for 
which the possibility of an outflow of resources is considered 
remote .
nordea bank abp has undertaken, in relation to certain 
individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for 
the potential payment liability against them in their capacity 
of managing directors or board member in group undertak-
ings of nordea bank abp .
nordea bank abp has undertaken to indemnify the mem-
bers of the glt against legal expenses incurred in relation to 
legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or inves-
tigations from third parties, excluding crimes or actions made 
with intent or gross negligence . for each glt member, the 
indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of eur 37 .5m, 
unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-
case basis . the indemnity is secondary to any other insurance 
coverage .
a limited number of employees are entitled to severance 
pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retire-
ment age . for further disclosures, see note g8 “staff costs” .
claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines
within the framework of its normal business operations, 
nordea faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits and dis-
putes, most of which involve relatively limited amounts, as 
well as possible fines due to e .g . weak anti-money laundering 
processes and procedures in the past . presently, none of the 
current disputes are considered likely to have any significant 
adverse effect on nordea or its financial position . as previ-
ously stated, nordea expects to be fined in denmark for weak 
aml processes and procedures in the past and has made a 
provision for ongoing aml-related matters . nordea cannot 
exclude the possibility of fines, which could impact the bank’s 
financial performance . in addition, some of these proceedings 
could lead to litigation . see also note g2 “risk and liquidity 
management” and note g33 “provisions” .

assets designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair 
value option) consist of all assets in nordea life and pension 
held under investment contracts, eur 4,216m (eur 4,088m) . 
also, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment 
contracts in life, eur 215m (eur 169m), are designated at fair 
value through profit or loss . for more information see note g1 
section 13 . nordea does not disclose the effect of changes in 
credit risk on the fair values of these assets and the fair value 
change in related credit derivatives; as such, changes in value 
will directly result in essentially the same change in the carry-
ing amount of the corresponding liabilities to policyholders . 
there is thus no significant impact on the income statement or 
equity due to changes in credit risk of these assets in life . for 
this reason nordea does not either disclose the nominal 
amount of credit derivatives used to mitigate the maximum 
exposure to credit risk per end of the year .
financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit 
or loss consist of issued bonds in the danish group undertak-
ings nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab, eur 54,411m (eur 
55,766m), issued structured bonds in markets operation, eur 
1,796m (eur 2,737m), deposits linked to the investment 
return of separate assets, eur 4,421m (eur 4,377m) and 
investment contracts and pooled schemes in life, eur 
35,499m (eur 30,800m) . for issued structured bonds in mar-
kets, changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and nordea 
calculates the change in own credit spread based on the 
change in nordea’s funding spread by assuming the liquidity 
premium for the issuance to be constant over time . the 
change in the credit spread is estimated by comparing the 
value of the trades using the initial funding spread on issu-
ance date and actual funding spread on the reporting date . 
this model is assessed to provide the best estimate of the 
impact of own credit risk . the value of the investment con-
tracts in life and asset linked deposits is directly linked to the 
assets in the contracts and there is consequently no effect 
from changes in own credit risk in these contracts .
changes in fair value due to changes in own credit risk of 
bonds issued in nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab, are  
calculated by determining the amount of changes in its fair 
value that are not attributable to changes in market condi-
tions . the method used to estimate the amount of changes  
in market conditions is based on relevant benchmark interest 
rates, which are the average yields on danish and german 
(eur) government bonds . this model is assessed to provide 
the best estimate of the impact of own credit risk . the chang-
es in own credit risk on issued mortgage bonds in nordea 
kredit realkreditaktieselskab are not recognised in other 
comprehensive income as that would create an accounting 
missmatch with the corresponding change in fair value of the 
mortgage loans that is recognised in profit or loss . for this 
reason, the whole change in the fair value of issued mortgage 
bonds in nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab is recognised 
in the income statement . for the issued mortgage bonds, a 
change in the liability's credit risk and price will have a corre-
sponding effect on the value of the loans as a change in the 
price of the bonds will be offset by the opposite change in the 
value of the prepayment option of the loans .

nordea annual report 2020
determination of fair values for items measured 
at fair value on the balance sheet
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities carried at 
fair value have been categorised under the three levels of the 
ifrs fair value hierarchy . the fair value hierarchy gives the 
highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active mar-
kets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest 
priority to unobservable inputs (level 3) . the categorisation 
of these instruments is based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety .
level 1 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and lia-
bilities valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active mar-
kets for identical assets or liabilities . an active market for the 
asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the 
asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume 
to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis . this cat-
egory includes listed derivatives, listed equities, government 
bonds in developed countries, and most liquid mortgage 
bonds and corporate bonds where direct tradable price 
quotes exist .
level 2 in the fair value hierarchy consists of assets and lia-
bilities that do not have directly quoted market prices avail-
able from active markets . the fair values are based on quoted 
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quot-
ed prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 
that are not active . alternatively, the fair values are estimated 
using valuation techniques or valuation models based on 
market prices or inputs prevailing at the balance sheet date 
and where any unobservable inputs have had an insignificant 
impact on the fair values . this is the case for the majority of 
nordea’s otc derivatives, securities purchased/sold under 
resale/repurchase agreements, securities borrowed/lent and 
other instruments where active markets supply the input to 
the valuation techniques or models . 
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy consists of those types of 
assets and liabilities for which fair values cannot be obtained 
directly from quoted market prices or indirectly using valua-
tion techniques or models supported by observable market 
prices or rates . this is generally the case for investments in 
unlisted securities, private equity funds, hedge funds, invest-
ment properties, more complex otc derivatives where unob-
servable input has a significant impact on the fair values, cer-
tain complex or structured financial instruments and illiquid 
interest-bearing securities . complex valuation models are 
generally characterised by the use of unobservable and 
model specific inputs .
all valuation models, both complex and simple models, 
make use of market prices and inputs . these market prices 
and inputs comprise interest rates, volatilities, correlations 
etc . some of these prices and inputs are observable while 
others are not . for most non-exotic currencies the interest 
rates are all observable, and implied volatilities and the cor-
relations of the interest rates and fx rates may be observable 
through option prices up to a certain maturity . implied vola-
tilities and correlations may also be observable for the most 
liquid equity instruments . for less liquid equity names the 
option market is fairly illiquid, and hence implied volatilities 
and correlations are unobservable .
for interest-bearing securities the categorisation into the 
three levels is based on the internal valuation methodology .

the valuation of these instruments can either be based on 
direct quotes in active markets (level 1) or measured using a 
methodology giving a quote based on observable inputs 
(level 2) . if the impact from unobservable parameters on the 
valuation of the bond is significant the bond is categorised as 
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy .
for otc derivatives valuation models are used for estab-
lishing fair value . the models are usually in-house developed 
and based on assumptions about the behaviour of the under-
lying asset and statistical scenario analysis . most otc deriva-
tives are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 
implying that all significant model inputs are observable in 
active markets .
valuations of private equity funds, credit funds and 
unlisted equity instruments are by nature more uncertain 
than valuations of more actively traded equity instruments . 
emphasis is put on using a consistent approach across all 
assets and over time . the methods used are consistent with 
the guideline “international private equity and venture capi-
tal valuation guidelines” issued by ipev board . the guide-
lines are considered as best practice in the industry . for us-
based funds, similar methods are applied . 
furthermore nordea holds loans and issued debt securities 
in the subsidiary nordea kredit realkreditaktieselskab at fair 
value . when nordea grants mortgage loans to borrowers, in 
accordance with the danish mortgage finance law, nordea at 
the same time issues debt securities with matching terms, so 
called “match funding” . fair value of the issued debt securi-
ties is based on quoted prices . as the borrowers have the 
right to purchase debt securities issued by nordea in the mar-
ket and return these as repayment for their loans, the fair 
value of the loans is the same as the fair value of the issued 
bonds (due to the revaluation of the repayment option 
embedded in the loan) adjusted for changes in the credit risk 
of the borrower and the fair value of the margin associated 
with each loan . 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities are generally 
calculated as the theoretical net present value of the individu-
al instruments . this calculation is supplemented by portfolio 
adjustments . 
nordea incorporates credit valuation adjustments (cva) 
and debit valuation adjustments (dva) into derivative valua-
tions . cva and dva reflect the impact on fair value from the 
counterparty´s credit risk and nordea’s own credit quality, 
respectively . calculations are based on estimates of exposure 
at default, probability of default and recovery rates, on a 
counterparty basis . generally, exposure at default for cva and 
dva is based on expected exposure and estimated through 
the simulation of underlying risk factors . where possible, 
nordea obtains credit spreads from the credit default swap 
(cds) market, and probabilities of defaults (pds) are inferred 
from this data . for counterparties that do not have a liquid 
cds, pds are estimated using a cross-sectional regression 
model, which calculates an appropriate proxy cds spread 
given each counterparty's rating region and industry .
the impact of funding costs and funding benefits on valua-
tion of uncollateralised and imperfectly collateralised deriva-
tives is recognised as a funding fair valuation adjustment 
(ffva) . in addition, nordea applies in its fair value measure-
ment close-out-cost valuation adjustments and model risk 
adjustments for identified model deficiencies . starting from 
q2 2020, adjustments for ipv variances are also included in 
fair value .
the fair value measurement of the investment properties 
takes into account a market participant's ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the investment properties in its 
highest and best use, i .e . taking into account the use of the 
investment properties that is physically possible, legally per-
missible and financially feasible . the current use of the 
investment properties in nordea is in accordance with the 
highest and best use . the valuation of the investment proper-
ties is carried out taking into account the purpose and the 
nature of the property by using the most appropriate valua-
tion methods . the primary valuation approach is a discounted 
cash flow model using current cash flows, market interest 
rates and the current yield requirements .
transfers between level 1 and 2
during the year, nordea transferred “interest-bearing securi-
ties” (including such financial instruments pledged as collat-
eral) of eur 1,113m (eur 4,272m) from level 1 to level 2 and 
eur 11,448m (eur 701m) from level 2 to level 1 in the fair 
value hierarchy . further nordea transferred “debt securities 
in issue” of eur 735m (eur 4,455m) from level 1 to level 2 
and eur 32,916m (eur 0m) from level 2 to level 1 . nordea 
also transferred “other liabilities” of eur 10m (eur 1,426m) 
from level 1 to level 2 and eur 1,040m (eur 1m) from level 
2 to level 1 . the main driver for the transfers during the year 
was an update to the rules for categorisation of financial 
instruments into levels 1, 2 and 3 . this update had a signifi-
cant impact on the categorisation of “interest-bearing securi-
ties” and “debt securities in issue”, where the volume and fre-
quency of trading for the individual instruments (isins) are 
now considered . transfers between levels are considered to 
have occurred at the end of the year .

1) reclassification related to early conversion of visa c-shares into visa a-shares .
unrealised gains and losses relate to those assets and liabili-
ties held at the end of the year . the main driver for the trans-
fers into and out of level 3 during the year was an update to 
the rules for categorisation of financial instruments into lev-
els 1, 2 and 3 . this mainly impacted the categorisation of 
“derivatives”, “interest-bearing securities”, “shares” and 
“debt securities in issue”, where the volume and frequency of 
trading for the individual instruments (isins) are now consid-
ered . transfers between levels are considered to have 
occurred at the end of the year . fair value gains and losses in 
the income statement during the year are included in “net 
result from items at fair value” (see note g6) . assets and lia-
bilities related to derivatives are presented net .

unrealised gains and losses relate to those assets and 
liabilities held at the end of the year . the reason for the 
transfer out of level 3 was that observable market data 
became available . the reason for the transfer into level 3 
was that observable market data was no longer available . 
transfers between levels are considered to have occurred 
at the end of the year . fair value gains and losses in the 
income statement during the year are included in “net 
result from items at fair value” (see note g6) . assets 
and liabilities related to derivatives are presented net .
the valuation processes for fair value measurements 
financial instruments
the valuation process in nordea consists of several steps . the 
first step is to determine the end-of-day (eod) marking of 
mid-prices . it is the responsibility of the business areas to 
determine correct prices used for the valuation process . these 
prices are either internally marked prices set by a trading unit 
or externally sourced prices . the valuation prices and valua-
tion approaches are then controlled and tested by a valuation 
control function within the 1st line of defence, which is inde-
pendent from the risk-taking units in the front office . the cor-
nerstone in the control process is the independent price veri-
fication (ipv) . the ipv test comprises verification of the cor-
rectness of valuations by comparing the prices to 
independently sourced data . the result of the ipv is analysed 
and any findings are escalated as appropriate . also, adjust-
ments for ipv variances are included in fair value . the verifi-
cation of the correctness of prices and inputs is as a minimum 
carried out on a monthly basis and is for many products car-
ried out daily . third-party information, such as broker quotes 
and pricing services, is used as benchmark data in the verifi-
cation . the quality of the benchmark data is assessed on a 
regular basis .
the valuation adjustment at portfolio level and the defer-
rals of day 1 p/l on level 3 trades are calculated and reported 
on a monthly basis . the actual assessment of instruments in 
the fair value hierarchy is performed on a continuous basis .
specialised teams within the unit balance sheet risk con-
trol (bsrc) are responsible for overseeing and independently 
assessing the valuations performed by the 1st line of defence . 
these teams are responsible for 2nd line of defence oversight 
for valuations, with independent reporting responsibilities 
towards the cro and the bac .
investment properties
the main part of the investment properties in nordea is held 
by nordea life and pension (nlp) . the valuation of the 
investment properties in nlp is performed quarterly by the 
real estate departments in each entity within nlp with full or 
partial assistance from external valuers . for the departments 
that use their own methodologies the changes in price levels 
of the properties are compared with valuations of similar 
properties assessed by external valuers . the result of the val-
uation is presented to, and approved by, the local manage-
ment in each entity . the cfo in each entity within nlp is 
responsible for the approval of the concepts and for the val-
ues used . the principles used in all entities are in accordance 
with regulations provided by the local financial supervisory 
authorities (fsa) which is in accordance with international 
valuation principles and in accordance with ifrs .
in addition there is an investment operation committee 
(ioc) which is a joint forum focusing on valuation and 
accounting of investment operations issues within nlp . the 
entities within nlp report regularly to ioc and ioc reports 
quarterly to the nordea group valuation committee .
investment properties in nlp are backing the liabilities to 
policyholders in life insurance contracts, unit-linked contracts 
and investment contracts, which means that the impact on 
nordea’s income statement and on shareholders’ equity 
depends on the financial buffers and the profit sharing agree-
ments in the actual unit that owns the property .

g41. assets and liabilities at fair value, cont.
the tables above shows, for each class of assets and liabilities 
categorised in level 3, the fair value, the valuation techniques 
used to estimate the fair value, significant unobservable 
inputs used in the valuation techniques and for financial 
assets and liabilities the fair value sensitivity to changes in 
key assumptions .
the column “range of fair value” in the tables above shows 
the sensitivity of the fair values of level 3 financial instru-
ments to changes in key assumptions . where the exposure to 
an unobservable parameter is offset across different instru-
ments then only the net impact is disclosed in the table . the 
range disclosed are likely to be greater than the true uncer-
tainty in fair value of these instruments, as it is unlikely in 
practice that all unobservable parameters would be simulta-
neously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possi-
ble alternatives . the disclosure is neither predictive nor indic-
ative of future movements in fair value .
in order to calculate the sensitivity (range) in fair value of 
derivatives a range of different modelling approaches are 
applied to determine an uncertainty interval around the 
reported fair value . the different approaches applied target 
various aspects of derivatives pricing . two common compo-
nents of derivative valuation models are volatility of underly-
ing risk factors and correlation between the relevant risk fac-
tors . each of these is addressed by applying different 
assumptions to input and/or the choice of modelling 
valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements in level 3

in order to calculate the sensitivity (range) in fair value of 
shares and interest-bearing securities the fair value was 
increased and decreased within a total range of 2–10 percent-
age units depending on the valuation uncertainty and under-
lying assumptions . higher ranges are applied to instruments 
with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded

the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value 
measurement of the investment properties are market rent 
and yield requirement . significant increases (decreases) in 
market rate or yield requirement in isolation would result in a 
significant lower (higher) fair value .
movements in deferred day 1 profit 
the transaction price for financial instruments in some cases 
differs from the fair value at initial recognition measured 
using a valuation model, mainly due to the transaction price 
not beeing established in an active market . if there are signifi-
cant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique 
(level 3), the financial instrument is recognised at the trans-
action price and any difference between the transaction price 
and fair value at initial recognition measured using a valua-
tion model (day 1 profit) is deferred . for more information see 
note g1 “accounting policies” . the table below shows the 
aggregate difference yet to be recognised in the income 
statement at the beginning and end of the period and a rec-
onciliation of how this aggregated difference has changed 
during the year (movements in deferred day 1 profit) .

cash and balances with central banks
the fair value of “cash and balances with central banks” is 
due to its short term nature assumed to equal the carrying 
amount and is thus is categorised into level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy .
loans
the fair value of “loans to central banks”, “loans to credit 
institutions” and “loans to the public” has been estimated by 
discounting the expected future cash flows with an assumed 
customer interest rate that would have been used on the mar-
ket if the loans had been issued at the time of the measure-
ment . the assumed customer interest rate is calculated as the 
benchmark interest rate plus the average margin on new 
lending in personal banking, commercial & business banking 
and wholesale banking respectively . 
the fair value measurement is categorised into level 3 in 
the fair value hierarchy .
interest bearing-securities 
the fair value is eur 3,548m (eur 3,606m), of which eur 
136m (eur 237m) is categorised in level 1 and eur 3,332m 
(eur 3,369m) in level 2 and eur 80m (eur –m) in level 3 . 
the measurement principles follow those for similar instru-
ments that are held at fair value on the balance sheet .
other assets and prepaid expenses and accrued income
the balance sheet items “other assets” and “prepaid expens-
es and accrued income” consist of short receivables . the fair 
value is therefore considered to equal the carrying amount 
and is categorised into level 3 in the fair value hierarchy .
deposits and debt instruments
the fair value of “deposits by credit institutions”, “deposits 
and borrowings from the public”, “debt securities in issue” 
and “subordinated liabilities” has been calculated as the car-
rying amount adjusted for fair value changes in interest rate 
risk and in own credit risk . the fair value is categorised into 
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy . the fair value changes 
related to interest rate risk are based on changes in relevant 
interest rates compared with corresponding nominal interest 
rate in the portfolios . the fair value changes in the credit risk 
are calculated as the difference between the credit spread in 
the nominal interest rate compared with the current spread 
that is observed in the market . this calculation is performed 
on an aggregated level for all long-term issuances recognised 
in the balance sheet items “debt securities in issue” and 
“subordinated liabilities” . as the contractual maturity is short 
for “deposits by credit institutions” and “deposits and bor-
rowing from the public” the changes in nordea´s own credit 
risk related to these items are assumed not to be significant . 
this is also the case for short-term issuances recognised in 
the balance sheet items “debt securities in issue” and “subor-
dinated liabilities” . 
other liabilities and accrued expenses 
and prepaid income
the balance sheet items “other liabilities” and “accrued 
expenses and prepaid income” consist of short-term liabili-
ties, mainly liabilities on securities settlement . the fair value is 
therefore considered to be equal to the carrying amount and 
is categorised into level 3 in the fair value hierarchy .

g42. financial instruments set off on balance 
or subject to netting agreements, cont.
enforceable master netting arrangements  
and similar agreements
the fact that financial instruments are accounted for on a 
gross basis on the balance sheet, would not imply that the 
financial instruments are not subject to master netting agree-
ments or similar arrangements . generally financial instru-
ments (derivatives, repos and securities lending transactions), 
would be subject to master netting agreements, and nordea 
would consequently be able to benefit from netting, in the 
event of its counter-parties defaulting, in any calculations 
involving counterparty credit risk .
for a description of counterparty risk see the section coun-
terparty risk in note g2 “risk and liquidity management” .
g43. transferred assets 
and obtained collaterals
transferred assets that are not derecognised 
in their entirety and associated liabilities
assets are considered to be transferred from nordea if 
nordea either transfer the contractual right to receive the 
cash flows from the asset or to retain that right, but has a 
contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more 
entities .
all assets transferred continue to be recognised on the bal-
ance sheet if nordea is still exposed to changes in the fair 
value of the assets . this is the case for repurchase agree-
ments and securities lending transactions .
repurchase agreements are a form of collateralised bor-
rowing whereby nordea sells securities with an agreement to 
repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price . the cash 
received is recognised as a deposit (liability) . securities deliv-
ered under repurchase agreements are not derecognised 
from the balance sheet .
securities lending transactions are transactions where 
nordea lends securities it holds to a counterpart and receives 
a fee .
as both repurchase agreements and securities lending 
transactions result in the securities being returned to nordea, 
all risks and rewards of the instruments transferred is 
retained by nordea, although they are not available to 
nordea during the period during which they are transferred . 
the counterpart in the transactions hold the securities as col-
lateral, but have no recourse to other assets in nordea .
the securities still reported on the balance sheet and 
the corresponding liabilities are measured at fair value .

obtained collaterals that are permitted  
to be sold or repledged
nordea obtains collaterals under reverse repurchase and 
securities borrowing agreements which, under the terms of 
the agreements, can be sold or repledged . the transactions 
are conducted under standard agreements employed by 
financial markets participants . generally, the agreements 
require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the 
securities falls below a predetermined level . under standard 
terms for most repurchase transactions, the recipient of col-
lateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject 
to returning equivalent securities upon settlement of the 
transactions . the fair value of the securities obtained as col-
lateral under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing 
agreements is disclosed below . nordea also obtains collater-
als under other agreements which, under the terms of the 
agreements, can be sold or repledged . those are mainly relat-
ed to collaterals received under csa agreements covering 
derivative transactions .

1)  shareholders with significant influence (including its subsidiaries) and close family 
members of key management personnel at nordea, as well as companies con-
trolled or jointly controlled by key management personnel or by close family mem-
bers of key management personnel at nordea, are considered to be related parties 
to nordea . this group of related parties includes sampo plc, which has a signifi-
cant influence over nordea, and the subsidiaries of sampo plc . liabilities to sampo 
plc and its subsidiaries consist mainly of deposits and long-term investments in 
bonds issued by nordea . the transactions with sampo plc and its subsidiaries also 
include several ongoing derivative contracts . other related parties also include 
nordea's pension foundations . 
with the exception of compensation, certain loans and other 
commitments to key management, all related party transac-
tions are made on the same criteria and terms as those of 
comparable transactions with external parties of similar 
standing .
compensation, loans and deposits to 
key management personnel
compensation, loans, deposits and loan commitments to key 
management personnel are specified in note g8 “staff costs” . 
certain other commitments to key management are noted in 
note g38 “contingent liabilities” .
g45. related-party transactions
g46. interests in structured entities
structured entities are entities designed so that voting or sim-
ilar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who con-
trols the entity . it normally has restricted activities with a nar-
row and well-defined objective . if nordea controls such an 
entity, it is consolidated .  
 
consolidated structured entities 
the viking abcp conduit (viking) has been established with 
the purpose of supporting trade receivable or accounts pay-
able securitisations to core nordic customers . the spes pur-
chase trade receivables from the approved sellers and fund 
the purchases either by issuing commercial papers (cp) via 
the established asset backed commercial papers programme 
or by drawing funds on the liquidity facilities available . 
nordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of 
eur 857m (eur 952m) and at year-end eur 755m  
(eur 871m) was utilised . total assets in the conduit were 
eur 821m (eur 904m) at year-end . the spe is consolidated 
as it is closely linked to the activities within nordea . also, 
nordea is exposed to credit risk through the liquidity facility . 
there are no significant restrictions on repayment of loans 
from viking apart from the payments being dependent on the 
rate at which viking releases its assets .
ar finance invests in notes backed by trade receivables . 
nordea has provided liquidity facilities to a maximum of eur 
125m (eur 125m) and at year-end eur 81m (eur 83m) was 
utilised . the entity holds assets of eur 81m (eur 84m) at 
year-end .
unconsolidated structured entities
for structured entities in which nordea has an interest but 
not control, disclosures are provided . to be considered to 
have an interest in such an entity, nordea must be exposed to 
variability in returns on the investment in the structured enti-
ty . investment funds are the only interests in unconsolidated 
structured entities nordea currently holds . variability in 
returns is assessed based on both fees received and revalua-
tion of holdings in the funds . 
there are several different products in which nordea 
invests in investment funds:
a) on behalf of policyholders in nordea life & pensions
b)  on behalf of depositors where the return is based  
the investment
c)  hedge exposures in structured products issued  
to customers 
d) illiquid investments in private equity and credit funds   
as nordea is exposed to variability in returns on a gross basis, 
information about these funds is disclosed although the net 
exposure is considerably less . any change in value on invest-
ment funds acquired on behalf of policyholders and deposi-
tors where the policyholder/depositor stands the investment 
risk are reflected in the value of the related liability and the 
maximum net exposure to losses is zero . the change in value 
in investment funds held on behalf of other policyholders is 
largely passed on to the policyholders, but as nordea has 
issued guarantees in some of these products, nordea is 
exposed to the changes in value . 
notes to the financial statements
193
nordea annual report 2020
investment funds acquired to hedge exposures in struc-
tured products reduce the exposures and, to the extent hedg-
es are effective, nordea is not exposed to changes in value .
investments in illiquid private equity and credit funds are an 
integral part of managing balance sheet risks in nordea . the 
maximum loss on these funds is estimated at eur 735m (eur 
600m), equal to the investment in the funds .
nordeas interests in unconsolidated structured entities and 
any related liability are disclosed in the table below . the car-
rying amount is the maximum exposure to credit loss, before 
considering any hedges . income related to these investments 
is recognised in “net result from items at fair value” .

nordea holds approximately 2,500 different funds that are 
classified as unconsolidated structured entities, approximate-
ly 400 of which are managed by nordea . these have different 
investment mandates and risk appetites, ranging from low-
risk government bond funds to high-risk leveraged equity 
funds . total assets in funds managed by nordea are eur 
194bn (eur 177bn) . all funds are financed by deposits from 
units holders . the total assets in investment funds not man-
aged by nordea are not considered meaningful for the pur-
pose of understanding the related risks and are thus not 
disclosed .
nordea has sponsored two unconsolidated structured enti-
ties in which nordea does not currently have an interest, 
archean and thulite . nordea has established the entities but 
has no influence over them, and is thus considered to have 
sponsored them . during 2020, nordea entered into a new 
transactions with thulite, where thulite issued a guarantee in 
favour of nordea . nordea also bought protection in the form 
of a cds from thulite in 2019 . nordea has not received any 
income from thulite in 2019 or 2020 . the guarantee issued by 
archean has been terminated in 2020 . nordea has not 
received any compensation in 2020 from archean (eur 18m 
in 2019) .

1) in december 2020, nordea announced the decision to wind down the operations in russia . the legal process has been initiated for the closing of the subsidiaries .
g47. group structure
there are different types of restriction in the way nordea can 
access and transfer assets within the group: 
• dividends are used to transfer excess capital in the subsid-
iaries of nbabp to the parent company . the specific divi-
dend amount is determined for each legal entity based on 
distributable funds, capital adequacy regulations and 
ratios, capital and business planning, local tax consider-
ations and group-internal policies . regulatory restrictions, 
both general and local, for dividends as well as projected 
changes in the entities’ capital requirements and risk expo-
sure amounts are incorporated in the analysis regarding 
the dividend decisions .
• the crr requires credit institutions to hold liquid assets, 
the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity out-
flows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so 
as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity 
buffers which are adequate . there are also local liquidity 
requirements that restricts the movement of funds 
between legal entities .
• the group has pledged assets to collateralise its obliga-
tions under repurchase agreements, securities financing 
transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for mar-
gining purposes for otc derivative liabilities . further infor-
mation is disclosed in notes g36 and g37 .
• for banks under resolution, which is not applicable in 
nordea at the balance sheet date, there are potential 
restrictions as the regulators would have far-reaching reso-
lution tools they could impose if deemed necessary
• statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well 
as protective rights of non-controlling interests might 
restrict the ability of the group to access and transfer 
assets freely to or from other entities within the group and 
to settle liabilities of the group . since the group did not 
have any material non-controlling interests at the balance 
sheet date, any protective rights associated with these did 
not give rise to significant restrictions .

g48. acquisitions

on 1 october 2020 the acquisition of 100% of the shares in

pleted . nordea finance equipment as is a norwegian domi-
ciled company that provides equipment finance and factoring 
solutions . the company has 350 employees and operates in 
denmark, norway and sweden . the acquisition of nordea 
finance equipment as supports nordea’s strategy to focus

ences, drive income growth initiatives and optimise opera-
tional efficiency .

société générale . the current estimate is that there will be an 
additional purchase price of nok 5m (eur 0m), to be paid in

tingent consideration of nok 200m (eur 19m, converted

1) including fair value adjustments for loans measured at amortised cost .
2) goodwill is not expected to be tax deductible .
the fair value of loans in the table above includes allowances 
for the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected . 
the allowances amount to eur 49m .   
nordea identified two intangible assets in the acquisition . 
one intangible asset related to the customers and the distri-
bution network acquired and the other related to technology . 
the customer intangible asset reflects the profit expected to 
be generated from extensions and renewals of acquired con-
tracts due to the existing relationships nordea finance equip-
ment has with customers and distributors . the customer 
intangible will be amortised over twelve years, reflecting the 
pace at which customers can be expected to leave . the tech-
nology intangible consists of the value of the existing it plat-
form . nordea plans to continue using it also in the future and 
to transfer existing contracts to the new platform . the devel-
opment cost for the platform, has to a large degree, been 
expensed in the company and there is now a surplus value,  
as the replacement cost exceeds the carrying amount . the 
technology intangible asset will be amortised over five years . 
goodwill is mainly related to the value of the assembled 
workforce, which cannot be accounted for as a separate 
intangible asset under ifrs 3 . the goodwill is expected to 
have an indefinite life and will consequently not be amor-
tised . 
 
 
 
 
“total operating income” for the three months during 
which the company was consolidated amounted to eur 37m . 
“operating profit” for the same period was eur –15m includ-
ing the recognition of restructuring provisions . the corre-
sponding pro forma figures had the company been consoli-
dated from 1 january 2020 onwards were eur 140m and eur 
27m, respectively .

ments of credit institutions and investment firms as well as

2. accounting policies and presentation
the new accounting requirements and their impact on the 
financial statements are described below .
changed presentation of trading in 
own shares (treasury shares)
acquisitions of own shares are, as from 1 january 2020, 
reported as a deduction in “invested unrestricted equity” and 
sales of own shares as an increase of “invested unrestricted 
equity” . the earlier policy was to present acquisitions and 
sales in “retained earnings” . comparative figures have not 
been restated .
3. recognition of operating income 
net interest income
interest income and expense are calculated and recognised 
based on the effective interest rate method or, if considered 
appropriate, based on a method that results in an interest 
income or interest expense that is a reasonable approxima-
tion of using the effective interest rate method as the basis for 
the calculation . the effective interest includes fees considered 
to be an integral part of the effective interest rate of a finan-
cial instrument (generally fees received as compensation for 
risk) . the effective interest rate equals the rate that discounts 
the estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of 
the financial asset or financial liability . 
negative interest on liabilities is presented in the line item 
“interest income” and negative interest on assets in “interest 
expense” . in the line item “interest income”, nordea bank abp 
presents interest income from financial assets measured at 
amortised cost or at fair value through fair value reserve . this 
line items also includes the effect from hedge accounting 
relating to these assets . 
interest income and expense from financial instruments 
are, with the exceptions described below, classified as “net 
interest income” .
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value in markets is classified as “net 
result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing” 
in the income statement . also, interest on the net funding of 
the operations in markets is recognised on this line item . 
interest component in foreign exchange swaps, and interest 
paid and received in interest rate swaps plus changes in 
accrued interest, is classified as “net result from securities trad-
ing and foreign exchange dealing”, except for derivatives used 
for hedging, including economical hedges of nordea bank 
abp's funding, where such components are classified as “net 
interest income” . 
net fee and commission income
nordea bank abp earns commission income from different 
services provided to customers and other group companies . 
asset management commissions and life & pension commis-
sions are mainly generated from the services provided to 
other group companies . 
the recognition of commission income depends on the 
purpose for which the fees are received . fees are either rec-
ognised as revenue when services are provided or in connec-
tion to the execution of a significant act . fees received in con-
nection to performed services are recognised as income in 
the period these services are provided . 
fees categorised as deposit products, brokerage, securities 
issues and corporate finance, custody and issuer service and 
payment commissions are recognised both over time and at a 
point of time dependent on when the performance obligations 
are satisfied . brokerage, securities issues and corporate 
finance are mainly transactional driven for advising customer

or for executing client transactions in securities where the ser-
vices are recognised at a point of time when the services relat-
ed to the transaction are completed . payment commissions 
include fees for cash management and payment solutions that 
are recognised over time and transaction based fees for ser-
vices like domestic and foreign payments that are recognised 
at a point of time . card fees are categorised as interchange 
fees which are recognised at a point of time, when the cus-
tomer uses the services, or as cardholder fees  are recognised 
over time or at a point of time if the fee is transaction based . 
lending fees that are not part of the effective interest of a 
financial instrument are recognised at a point of time . the 
amount of loan syndication fees as well as other transaction-
based fees, received are recognised at a point when the per-
formance obligation is satisfied, i .e . when the syndication or 
transaction has been performed . fees received on bilateral 
transactions are generally amortised as part of the effective 
interest of the financial instruments recognised . 
income from issued financial guarantees and expenses for 
bought financial guarantees are amortised over the duration 
of the instruments and classified as “fee and commission 
income” and “fee and commission expense”, respectively . 
other fee income is generally transaction based .
for transactional services which are performed at a point 
of time, payments are generally made instantly when the ser-
vices are performed . for services performed over time the 
service period is normally short . examples of such services 
are monthly payment services and monthly or quarterly asset 
management services . for the services performed over time 
the right to payment generally arises at the end of the service 
period when the performance obligations are completed and 
it is highly probable that no significant reversal of the consid-
eration will occur . however, for some services with fixed 
monthly fees the right to payment arises in advance . account 
receivables are recognised as other assets while unbilled 
receivables for satisfied performance obligations and contract 
assets are recognised as prepaid expenses and accrued 
income . short-term advances received where the perfor-
mance obligations have not yet been satisfied are recognised 
as accrued expenses and prepaid income . 
commission expenses are normally transaction based and 
recognised in the period when the services are received . 
initial contract costs for obtaining contracts are recognised 
as an asset and amortised if the costs are expected to be 
recovered . 
net result from securities trading and 
foreign exchange dealing
realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial instru-
ments measured at fair value through profit or loss are recog-
nised in the item “net result from securities trading and for-
eign exchange dealing” realised and unrealised gains and 
losses derive from:
• shares/participations and other share-related instruments
• interest-bearing securities and other interest-related 
instruments
• other financial instruments, including credit derivatives as 
well as commodity instruments/derivatives
• foreign exchange gains/losses
net result from securities trading 
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value in markets is classified as “net 
result from securities trading” in the income statement . also, 
interest on the net funding of operations in markets is recog-
nised on this line .
this item also includes realised gains and losses from 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost, such as 
interest compensation received and realised gains/losses on 
buybacks of issued own debt .
“net result from securities trading” also includes losses 
from counterparty risk on instruments classified into the cat-
egory financial assets at fair value through profit or loss . 
impairment losses from instruments within other categories 
are recognised in the items “net loan losses” or “impairment 
on other financial assets” (see also the sub-sections “net loan 
losses” and “impairment on other financial assets” below) .
dividends received from trading shares are recognised in 
the income statement as “net result from securities trading” 
and classified as “shares/participations and other share relat-
ed instruments” in the note . income is recognised in the peri-
od in which the right to receive the payment is established .
net result from foreign exchange dealing
net gains and losses on trading in foreign currencies and  
the positive and negative exchange differences arising from 
translation into euro of assets, liabilities and the principal of 
currency swaps are recognised in “net result from foreign 
exchange dealing” . the period’s proportion of gains and loss-
es on measurement of forward foreign exchange contracts, 
currency futures and currency options are also included in 
this item . foreign exchange differences arising from non-
monetary held-for-sale assets are recognised in the fair  
value reserve under equity . 
net result from securities at fair value 
through fair value reserve
the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges and net invest-
ment hedges as well as recycled gains and losses on financial 
instruments classified into the category financial assets at 
fair value through fair value reserve are recognised in “net 
result from securities at fair value through fair value reserve” . 
net result from hedge accounting
income from hedge accounting is described in the section 7 
“hedge accounting” .
net result from investment properties
income and expenses from investment properties, such as 
rental income and expenses and sales gains and losses, 
regardless of whether the property is measured using the fair 
value method or the acquisition cost less depreciation and 
impairment loss are recognised in “net result from invest-
ment properties” . this item also includes items recognisable 
in profit or loss due to measurement method (depreciation 
according to plan and impairments, reversals of impairment 
or fair value changes) . 
income from equity investments
dividends received from other than trading shares as well as 
group contributions are recognised in the income statement 
as “income from equity investments” . income is recognised in 
the period in which the right to receive payment is 
established . 
other operating income and other expenses
net gains from divestments of shares in group undertakings, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures and net gains on 
the sale of tangible assets as well as other operating income, 
not related to any other income line item, are generally recog-
nised when it is probable that the benefits associated with 
the transaction will flow to nordea bank abp and if the sig-
nificant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer 
(generally when the transactions are finalised) .
resolution fees are presented as “other expenses” in the 
income statement .

4. impairment
net loan losses
impairment losses from financial assets classified into the cat-
egory amortised cost (see section 11 “financial instruments”), 
in the line items, “loans to credit institutions” and “loans to 
the public” on the balance sheet, are reported as “net loan 
losses” in the income statement together with losses from 
financial guarantees . losses are reported net of any collateral 
and other credit enhancements . nordea bank abp’s accounting 
policies for the calculation of impairment losses on loans can 
be found in section 12 “loans to the public/credit institutions” .
counterparty losses on instruments classified into the cat-
egory financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
including credit derivatives but excluding loans held at fair 
value as described above, are reported under “net result from 
securities trading” .
impairment losses on other financial assets 
impairment on investments in interest-bearing securities, 
classified into the category financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (see section 11 “finan-
cial instruments”), and impairments on investments in group 
undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures are 
presented in the line item “impairment losses on other finan-
cial assets” in the income statement . the policies covering 
impairment of financial assets classified into the category 
amortised cost are disclosed in section 11 “financial instru-
ments” and section 12 “loans to the public/credit institutions” . 
impairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount 
increases . the carrying amount is then increased to the recov-
erable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised .
5. recognition and derecognition of financial 
instruments on the balance sheet
derivative instruments, quoted securities and foreign 
exchange spot transactions are recognised on and derecog-
nised from (and an asset or a liability is recognised as “other 
assets” or “other liabilities” on the balance sheet between 
the trade date and settlement date) the balance sheet on the 
trade date . other financial instruments are recognised on the 
balance sheet on the settlement date .
financial assets, other than those for which trade date 
accounting is applied, are derecognised from the balance 
sheet when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial assets expire or are transferred to another party . the 
rights to the cash flows normally expire or are transferred 
when the counterparty has performed by e .g . repaying a loan 
to nordea bank abp, i .e . on the settlement date .
loans and other financial assets where cash flows are 
modified or part of a restructuring is derecognised, and a new 
loan recognised, if the terms and conditions of the new loan 
are substantially different from the old loan . this is normally 
the case if the present value of the cash flows of the new loan 
discounted by the original interest rate is more than 10% dif-
ferent from the present value of the remaining expected cash 
flows of the old loan . the same principles apply to financial 
liabilities . the terms and conditions are also considered to be 
significantly different for financial assets where the modified 
cash flows are sppi, but the original cash flows were not 
sppi and vice versa .
in some cases, nordea bank abp enters into transactions 
where it transfers assets that are recognised on the balance 
sheet but retains either all or a portion of risks and rewards 
from the transferred assets . if all or substantially all risks and 
rewards are retained, the transferred assets are not derecog-
nised from the balance sheet .
financial liabilities are derecognised from the balance 
sheet when the liability is extinguished . normally this occurs 
when nordea bank abp performs, for example when nordea 
bank abp repays a deposit to the counterparty, i .e . on the set-
tlement date . financial liabilities under trade date accounting 
are generally derecognised and a liability is recognised as 
“other liabilities” on the balance sheet on the trade date . 
for further information, see sections “securities borrowing 
and lending agreements” and “repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements” within section 11 “financial instru-
ments”, as well as note p43 “transferred assets and obtained 
collaterals” .
6. translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies
nordea bank abp presents its financial statements in euro 
(eur) . foreign currency is defined as any currency other than 
euro . foreign currency transactions are recorded at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction . monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are trans-
lated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date .
exchange differences arising on the settlement of transac-
tions at rates different from those at the date of the transac-
tion, and unrealised translation differences on unsettled for-
eign currency monetary assets and liabilities, are recognised 
in the income statement in the line item “net result from 
securities trading and foreign exchange dealing” .
translation of foreign entities/branches 
the assets and liabilities of foreign branches have been trans-
lated at the closing rates, while items in the income statement 
are translated at the average exchange rate for the year . the 
average exchange rates are calculated based on daily 
exchange rates divided by the number of banking days in the 
period . translation differences are recognised in the fair value 
reserve in equity .
any remaining equity in foreign branches is converted at 
the closing rates with translation differences recognised in 
equity .
information on the most important exchange rates is dis-
closed in the separate section 26 “exchange rates” .
7. hedge accounting
as a part of nordea’s risk management policy, nordea bank 
abp has identified a series of risk categories with correspond-
ing hedging strategies using derivative instruments, as set out 
in note p2 “risk and liquidity management” (the market risk 
section) and note p21 “derivatives and hedge accounting” . 
when a hedging relationship meets the specified hedge 
accounting criteria set out in ias 39, nordea bank abp 
applies two types of hedge accounting: 
• fair value hedge accounting
• cash flow hedge accounting 
nordea bank abp has elected, as a policy choice permitted 
under ifrs 9, to continue to apply hedge accounting in accor-
dance with the carve out version of ias 39 . 
the eu carve out version enables a group of derivatives (or 
proportions thereof) to be viewed in combination and be des-
ignated as the hedging instrument . it also removes some of 
the limitations in fair value hedge accounting relating to 
hedging core deposits and under-hedging strategies . 
at inception, nordea bank abp formally documents how 
the hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, 
including the economic relationship between the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 
p1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – parent company
205
nordea annual report 2020
hedge and the method that will be used to assess the effec-
tiveness of the hedging relationship on an ongoing basis .
the application of hedge accounting requires the hedge  
to be highly effective . a hedge is regarded as highly effective 
if at inception and throughout its life it can be expected that 
changes in fair value of the hedged item, as regards the 
hedged risk can be essentially offset by changes in fair value 
of the hedging instrument . the result should be within a 
range of 80–125 per cent .
transactions that are entered into in accordance with 
nordea bank abp’s hedging objectives but do not qualify for 
hedge accounting, are economic hedge relationships .
fair value hedge accounting
fair value hedge accounting is applied when derivatives are 
hedging changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
attributable to a specific risk in accordance with nordea’s risk 
management policies set out note p2 “risk and liquidity man-
agement” (the market risk section) and note p21 “derivatives 
and hedge accounting” . the risk of changes in fair value of 
assets and liabilities in nordea bank abp’s financial state-
ments originates mainly from loans, securities and deposits 
with a fixed interest rate, causing interest rate risk . changes in 
fair value from derivatives as well as changes in fair value of 
the hedged item attributable to the risks being hedged are 
recognised separately in the income statement in the line 
item “net income from hedge accounting” . given that the 
hedge is effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item 
and the hedging instrument will offset . 
the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable 
to the risks hedged with the derivative instrument are reflect-
ed in an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged 
item, which is also recognised in the income statement . the 
fair value change of the hedged items held at amortised cost 
in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risks is presented sepa-
rately from the portfolio in the line item “fair value changes 
of the hedged items in portfolio hedge of interest rate risk”  
on the balance sheet and in the line item “net income from 
hedge accounting” in the income statement .
fair value hedge accounting in nordea bank abp is per-
formed mainly on a portfolio basis . any ineffectiveness is rec-
ognised in the income statement under the item “net income 
from hedge accounting” .
hedged items
a hedged item in a fair value hedge can be a recognised sin-
gle asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment, or a 
portion thereof . the hedged item can also be a group of 
assets, liabilities or firm commitments with similar risk char-
acteristics . hedged items in nordea bank abp consist of both 
individual assets or liabilities and portfolios of assets and/or 
liabilities .
hedging instruments
the hedging instruments used in nordea bank abp are pre-
dominantly interest rate swaps and cross currency interest 
rate swaps, which are always held at fair value . 
hedge effectiveness
when assessing hedge effectiveness retrospectively, nordea 
bank abp measures the fair value of the hedging instruments 
and compares the change in fair value of the hedging instru-
ment to the change in fair value of the hedged item . the 
effectiveness measurement is made on a cumulative basis . 
if the hedging relationship does not fulfil the hedge 
accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued . 
for fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is measured at 
fair value through profit or loss and the change in the fair 
value of the hedged item, up to the point when the hedge 
relationship is terminated, is amortised to the income state-
ment on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of 
the hedged item .
hedge ineffectiveness can arise from: 
• differences in timing of cash flows of hedged items and 
hedging instruments
• different interest rate curves applied to discount the 
hedged items and hedging instruments
• the effect of changes in nordea bank abp’s or a counter-
party’s credit risk on the fair value of the hedging instru-
ment or hedged items
• disparity between expected and actual prepayments of the 
loan portfolio 
cash flow hedge accounting
in accordance with nordea’s risk management policies set 
out in note p2 “risk and liquidity management” (the market 
risk section) and note p21 “derivatives and hedge account-
ing”, cash flow hedge accounting is applied when hedging 
the exposure to variability in future interest payments on 
instruments with variable interest rates and for the hedging 
of currency exposures . the portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument, determined to be an effective hedge, is 
recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity . the inef-
fective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
is recycled to the item “net result from hedge accounting” in 
the income statement . 
gains or losses on hedging instruments recognised in the 
cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recycled and recog-
nised in the income statement in the same period as the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, normally in the period that 
interest income or interest expense is recognised .
hedged items
a hedged item in a cash flow hedge can be highly probable 
floating interest rate cash flows from recognised assets or lia-
bilities or from future assets or liabilities . nordea bank abp 
uses cash flow hedges when hedging currency risk in future 
payments of interest and principal in foreign currency and 
when hedging interest rate risk in lending with floating inter-
est rates .
hedging instruments
the hedging instruments used in nordea bank abp are pre-
dominantly cross currency interest rate swaps, which are 
always held at fair value, where the currency component is 
designated as a cash flow hedge of currency risk and the 
interest component as a fair value hedge of interest rate risk . 
when hedging the interest rate risk on lending with floating 
interest rates nordea bank abp uses interest derivatives as 
hedging instruments, which are always held at fair value .
hedge effectiveness
the hypothetical derivative method is used when measuring 
the effectiveness retrospectively of cash flow hedges, mean-
ing that the change in a perfect hypothetical swap is used as 
proxy for the present value of the cumulative change in 
expected future cash flows from the hedged transaction (the 
currency component) . 
if the hedging relationship does not fulfil the hedge 
accounting requirements, hedge accounting is discontinued . 
changes in the unrealised value of the hedging instrument 
will prospectively from the last time it was proven effective 
be accounted for in the income statement . the cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recog-
nised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity from the period 
when the hedge was effective is reclassified from equity to 
p1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – parent company

annual report 2020 nordea
“net result from hedge accounting” in the income statement 
if the expected transaction is no longer expected to occur . 
if the expected transaction is no longer highly probable, 
but is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument that has been recognised in the cash 
flow hedge reserve in equity from the period when the hedge 
was effective remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until the 
transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur .
the possible sources of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedg-
es are generally the same as for those for fair value hedges 
described above . however, for cash flow hedges, prepayment 
risk is less relevant, and the causes of hedging ineffectiveness 
arise from the changes in the timing and the amount of fore-
casted future cash flows . 
8. determination of fair value of financial instruments
fair value is defined as the price that at the measurement 
date would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
under current market conditions in the principal market for 
the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market,  
in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability .
the existence of published price quotations in an active 
market is the best evidence of fair value and when they exist, 
they are used to measure financial assets and financial liabili-
ties . an active market for the asset or liability is a market in 
which transactions for the asset or liability occur with suffi-
cient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on 
an ongoing basis . the absolute level for liquidity and volume 
required for a market to be considered active varies with the 
instrument classes . for some classes low price volatility is 
seen, also for those instruments within the class where the 
trade frequency is high . for instruments in such a class the 
liquidity requirements are lower and, correspondingly, the age 
limit for the prices used for establishing fair value is higher .
the trade frequency and volume are monitored regularly  
in order to assess if markets are active or non-active . nordea 
bank abp is predominantly using published price quotations 
to establish fair value for items disclosed under the following 
balance sheet line items:
• debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks
• interest-bearing securities 
• shares (listed)
• derivatives (listed)
if quoted prices for a financial instrument fail to represent 
actual and regularly occurring market transactions or if quot-
ed prices are not available, fair value is established by using 
an appropriate valuation technique . the adequacy of the val-
uation technique, including an assessment of whether to use 
quoted prices or theoretical prices, is monitored on a regular 
basis .
valuation techniques can range from simple discounted 
cash flow analysis to complex option pricing models . valua-
tion models are designed to apply observable market prices 
and rates as input whenever possible but can also make use 
of unobservable model parameters . the adequacy of the val-
uation model is assessed by measuring its capability to hit 
market prices . this is done by comparison of calculated prices 
to relevant benchmark data, e .g . quoted prices from exchang-
es, the counterparty´s valuations, price data from consensus 
services etc .
nordea bank abp is predominantly using valuation tech-
niques to establish fair value for items disclosed under the 
following balance sheet items:
• debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks 
(when quoted prices in an active market are not available)
• interest-bearing securities (when quoted prices in an 
active market are not available)
• shares (when quoted prices in an active market are not 
available)
• derivatives (otc derivatives)
for financial instruments, where fair value is estimated by a 
valuation technique, it is investigated whether the variables 
used in the valuation model are predominantly based on data 
from observable markets . by data from observable markets, 
nordea bank abp considers data that can be collected from 
generally available external sources and where this data is 
judged to represent realistic market prices . if non-observable 
data has a significant impact on the valuation, the instrument 
cannot be recognised initially at the fair value estimated by 
the valuation technique and any upfront gains are thereby 
deferred and amortised through the income statement over 
the contractual life of the instrument . the deferred upfront 
gains are subsequently released to income if the non-observ-
able data becomes observable .
note p41 “assets and liabilities at fair value” provides a 
breakdown of fair values of financial instruments measured 
on the basis of:
• quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument 
(level 1), 
• valuation technique using observable data (level 2), and 
• valuation technique using non-observable data (level 3) .
the valuation models applied by nordea bank abp are con-
sistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing 
financial instruments and incorporate the factors that market 
participants consider when setting a price .
new valuation models are subject to approval by the 
model risk committee and all models are reviewed on a reg-
ular basis .
for further information, see note p41 “assets and liabilities 
at fair value” .
9. cash and balances with central banks
cash comprises legal tender and bank notes in foreign cur-
rencies . balances with central banks consist of deposits in 
accounts with central banks and postal giro systems under 
government authority, where the following conditions are 
fulfilled:
• the central bank or the postal giro system is domiciled in 
the country where the institutions are established
• the balance is readily available at any time
10. debt securities eligible for 
refinancing with central banks 
debt securities eligible as collateral in central bank monetary 
operations are recognised as “debt securities eligible for refi-
nancing with central banks” . debt securities are recognised in 
this line item based on the nature of the securities and not 
based on whether the entity itself is eligible for refinancing 
with central banks . 
debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks 
can be classified as financial assets as amortised cost, finan-
cial assets at fair value through profit or loss or financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income .
11. financial instruments
classification of financial instruments
each financial instrument has been classified into one of the 
following categories:
financial assets:
• amortised cost 
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss:
 -  mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss
 -   designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value 
option)
p1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – parent company
207
nordea annual report 2020
• financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, “fvoci” (recognised through the fair value reserve 
in equity) .
financial liabilities:
• amortised cost 
• financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:
 -  mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss
 -  designated at fair value through profit or loss (fair value 
option)
the classification of a financial asset is dependent on the 
business model for the portfolio where the instrument is 
included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments 
of principal and interest (sppi) .
financial assets with cash flows that are not solely pay-
ments of principle and interest (sppi) are measured at fair 
value through profit or loss . all other assets are classified 
based on the business model . instruments included in a port-
folio with a business model where the intention is to keep the 
instruments and collect contractual cash flows are measured 
at amortised cost . instruments included in a business model 
where the intention is both to keep the instruments to collect 
the contractual cash flows and to sell the instruments are 
measured at fair value through the fair value reserve in equi-
ty . financial assets included in any other business model are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss . 
in order to assess the business model, nordea bank abp 
has divided its financial assets into portfolios and/or sub-
portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are man-
aged together to achieve a particular business objective . to 
derive the right level on which portfolios are determined, 
nordea bank abp has taken the current business area struc-
ture into account . when determining the business model for 
each portfolio, nordea bank abp has analysed the objective 
with the financial assets as well as for instance past sales 
behaviour and management compensation . 
all financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value . the classification of financial instruments into dif-
ferent categories forms the basis for how each instrument is 
subsequently measured on the balance sheet and how 
changes in its value are recognised . in the table “classifica-
tion of financial instruments” in note p40, the classification of 
the financial instruments on nordea bank abp’s balance 
sheet into the different categories under ifrs 9 is presented .
amortised cost
financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost are 
initially recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, includ-
ing transaction costs . subsequent to initial recognition, the 
instruments within this category are measured at amortised 
cost . in an amortised cost measurement, the difference 
between acquisition cost and redemption value is amortised 
in the income statement over the remaining term using the 
effective interest rate method . amortised cost is defined as 
the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is 
measured at initial recognition minus the principal repay-
ments plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the 
effective interest method of any difference between that ini-
tial amount and the maturity amount and for financial assets, 
adjusted for any loss allowance . for more information about 
the effective interest rate method see section 3 “recognition 
of other operating income”, subsection “net interest income” . 
for information about impairment under ifrs 9, see section 
12 below .
interest on assets and liabilities classified at amortised cost 
is recognised in the line items “interest income” and “interest 
expense” in the income statement . 
this category consists of mainly all loans and deposits, 
except for reversed repurchase/repurchase agreements and 
securities borrowing/lending agreements in markets . this 
category also includes subordinated liabilities and debt secu-
rities in issue, except for issued structured bonds in markets .
financial assets and financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are measured at fair value, excluding transaction 
costs . all changes in fair values are recognised directly in the 
income statement in the item “net result from securities trad-
ing and foreign exchange dealing” .
the category consists of two sub-categories: mandatorily 
measured at fair value through profit or loss and designated 
at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option) .
the sub-category mandatorily measured at fair value 
through profit or loss contains mainly all assets in markets, 
trading liabilities in markets, interest-bearing securities 
included in part of the liquidity buffer, derivative instruments, 
shares and financial assets under “assets in pooled schemes 
and unit-linked investment contracts” . deposits in pooled 
schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are contracts 
with customers and policyholders where the total risk is born 
by the policyholders . the deposits are invested in different 
types of financial assets on behalf of customers and policy-
holders . assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked invest-
ments are presented in the respective line item in the balance 
sheet . 
also, assets in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment 
contracts that are not mandatorily measured at fair value 
through profit or loss are classified into the category desig-
nated at fair value through profit or loss to avoid an account-
ing mismatch with the related deposits . deposits in pooled 
schemes and unit-linked investment contracts are managed 
at fair value and consequently also classified into the catego-
ry designated at fair value through profit or loss . the value of 
these deposits is directly linked to assets in the contacts and 
there is consequently no effect from changes in own credit 
risk in these contracts . 
nordea bank abp also applies the fair value option of 
issued structured bonds in markets as these instruments 
include embedded derivatives not closely related to the host 
contract . the change in fair value of these issued structured 
bonds is recognised in profit or loss except for the changes in 
credit risk that are recognised through the fair value reserve 
in equity .
interest income and interest expense related to all balance 
sheet items held at fair value through profit or loss in markets 
are classified as “net result from securities trading and for-
eign exchange dealing” .
financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income
financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income are initially measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs . this category mainly consists of interest-bearing securi-
ties included in part of the liquidity buffer . changes in fair val-
ues, except for interest, foreign exchange effects and impair-
ment losses, are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity . 
interest is recognised in the item “interest income”, foreign 
exchange effects in “net result from securities trading and 
foreign exchange dealing” and impairment losses in the item 
“impairment on other financial assets” in the income state-
ment . when an instrument is disposed of, the fair value 
changes that previously have been accumulated in the fair 
value reserve are removed from equity and recognised in the 
income statement in the item “net result from securities clas-
p1. accounting policies, cont.

sified at fair value through fair value reserve” . for information 
about impairment under ifrs 9, see section 12 below .
hybrid (combined) financial instruments
hybrid (combined) financial instruments are contracts con-
taining a host contract and an embedded derivative instru-
ment . such combinations arise predominantly from the issu-
ance of structured debt instruments, such as issued index-
linked bonds and loans with embedded collars and caps .
index-linked bonds issued by group treasury are consid-
ered to be part of the funding activities . the host, the zero-
coupon bond, is measured at amortised cost . the embedded 
derivatives in those instruments are separated from the host 
contract and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives at fair 
value, if the economic characteristics and risks of the embed-
ded derivative are not closely related to the economic charac-
teristics and risks of the host contract, and the embedded 
derivative meets the definition of a derivative instrument . 
changes in fair values, of the embedded derivatives, are rec-
ognised in the income statement in the item “net result from 
securities trading and foreign exchange dealing” .
for structured bonds issued by markets nordea bank abp 
applies the fair value option and the entire combined instru-
ment, the host contract together with the embedded deriva-
tive, is measured at fair value through profit or loss . changes 
in fair values are recognised in the income statement in the 
item “net result from securities trading and foreign exchange 
dealing” and presented as “debt securities in issue” on the 
balance sheet .
securities borrowing and lending agreements
generally, securities borrowing and securities lending trans-
actions are entered into on a collateralised basis . unless the 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, the securities 
are not recognised on or derecognised from the balance 
sheet . securities in securities lending transactions are dis-
closed in note p43 “transferred assets and obtained collater-
als” and securities pledged as security in securities lending in 
note p36 “assets pledged as security for own liabilities” . 
cash collateral advanced (securities borrowing) to the 
counterparts is recognised on the balance sheet as “loans to 
credit institutions” or as “loans to the public” . cash collateral 
received (securities lending) from the counterpart is recog-
nised on the balance sheet as “deposits by credit institutions 
and central banks” or as “deposits and borrowings from the 
public” .
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
securities delivered under repurchase agreements and secu-
rities received under reverse repurchase agreements are not 
derecognised from or recognised on the balance sheet . 
securities delivered under repurchase agreements are dis-
closed note p43 “transferred assets and obtained collater-
als” . cash received under repurchase agreements is recog-
nised on the balance sheet as “deposits by credit institutions 
and central banks” or as “deposits and borrowings from the 
public” . liabilities recognised from repurchase agreements 
are disclosed in note p43 “transferred assets and obtained 
collaterals” . 
cash delivered under reverse repurchase agreements is 
recognised on the balance sheet as “loans to credit institu-
tions” or as “loans to the public” . 
a sale of a security not owned by nordea bank abp is 
defined as a short sale and triggers the recognition of a trad-
ing liability (sold not held securities) presented as “other lia-
bilities” on the balance sheet . the short sale is generally cov-
ered through a securities financing transaction (sft), nor-
mally a reverse repurchase agreement or other forms of 
securities borrowing agreements .
derivatives
all derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet and mea-
sured at fair value . derivatives with total positive fair values, 
including any accrued interest, are recognised as assets in the 
item “derivatives” on the asset side . derivatives with total 
negative fair values, including any accrued interest, are recog-
nised as liabilities in the item “derivatives” on the liability side .
realised and unrealised gains and losses from derivatives 
are recognised in the income statement in the line item “net 
result from securities trading and foreign exchange dealing” . 
offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
nordea bank abp offsets financial assets and liabilities on the 
balance sheet if there is a legal right to offset, in the ordinary 
course of business and in case of default, bankruptcy and 
insolvency of nordea bank abp and the counterparties, and if 
the intent is to settle the items net or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously . 
exchanged traded derivatives are generally accounted for 
as settled on a daily basis when cash is paid or received, and 
the instruments are reset to market terms . derivative assets, 
derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash col-
lateral liabilities against central counterparty clearing houses 
are offset on the balance sheet if the transaction currency 
and the central counterparty is the same . derivative assets, 
derivative liabilities, cash collateral receivables and cash col-
lateral liabilities related to bilateral otc derivative transac-
tions are not offset on the balance sheet .
in addition, loans and deposits related to repurchase and 
reverse repurchase transactions with central counterparties 
are offset on the balance sheet if the assets and liabilities 
relate to the same central counterparty, are settled in the same 
currency and have the same maturity date . loans and deposits 
related to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that 
are made in accordance with the global master repurchase 
agreement (gmra) are offset on the balance sheet if the 
assets and the liabilities relate to the same counterparty, are 
settled in the same currency, have the same maturity date and 
are settled through the same settlement institution .
issued debt and equity instruments
a financial instrument issued by nordea bank abp is either 
classified as a financial liability or equity . issued financial 
instruments are classified as a financial liability if the contrac-
tual arrangement results in nordea bank abp having a present 
obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset or a 
variable number of equity instruments to the holder of the 
instrument . if this is not the case, the instrument is generally an 
equity instrument and classified as equity, net of transaction 
costs . where issued financial instruments contain both liability 
and equity components, these are accounted for separately . 
12. loans to the public/credit institutions
scope
financial instruments classified as amortised cost or fair 
value through other comprehensive income are in scope for 
recognising impairment due to credit risk . this includes assets 
recognised on the balance sheet as “cash and balances with 
central banks”, “debt securities eligible for refinancing with 
central banks”, “loans to credit institutions”, “loans to the 
public” and “interest-bearing securities” . these balance sheet 
line items also include assets classified as fair value through 
profit or loss, which are not in scope for impairment calcula-
tions . see section 11 above and note p40 “classification of 
financial instruments” for more information .
off-balance-sheet commitments, contingent liabilities and 
loan commitments are also in scope for impairment 
calculations .

recognition and presentation
amortised cost assets are recognised gross with an offsetting 
allowance for the expected credit losses if the loss is not 
regarded as final . the allowance account is disclosed net on 
the face of the balance sheet, but the allowance account is 
disclosed separately in note p16 “loans and impairment” . 
changes in the allowance account are recognised in the 
income statement and presented in “net loan losses” .
if the impairment loss is regarded as final, it is reported as 
a realised loss and the carrying amount of the loan and the 
related allowance for impairment loss are derecognised . an 
impairment loss is regarded as final when the obligor has 
filed for bankruptcy and the administrator has declared the 
economic outcome of the bankruptcy procedure, or when 
nordea bank abp forgives its claims either through a legal 
based or voluntary reconstruction, or when nordea bank abp, 
for other reasons, deem it unlikely that the claim will be 
recovered . 
provisions for off-balance-sheet exposures are classified as 
“provisions” on the balance sheet, with changes in provisions 
classified as “net loan losses” . see note p32 “provisions” for 
more information .
assets classified as fair value through other comprehen-
sive income are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet . 
impairment losses calculated in accordance with ifrs 9 are 
recognised in the income statement and classified as “impair-
ment on other financial assets” . any fair value adjustments 
are recognised in equity .
impairment testing
nordea bank abp classifies all exposures into stages on an 
individual basis . stage 1 includes assets where there has been 
no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, 
stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets . 
nordea bank abp monitors whether there are indicators of 
exposures being credit impaired (stage 3) by identifying 
events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated 
future cash flows (loss event) . nordea bank abp applies the 
same definition of default as the capital requirements regu-
lation . more information on the identification of loss events 
can be found in note p2 “risk and liquidity management” . 
exposures without individually calculated allowances will be 
covered by the model-based impairment calculation .
for significant exposures that have been individually iden-
tified as credit impaired, the measurement of the impairment 
loss is made on an individual basis . the carrying amount of 
the exposure is compared with the sum of the net present 
value of expected future cash flows . if the carrying amount is 
higher, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss . 
the expected cash flows are discounted with the original 
effective interest rate and include the fair value of the collat-
eral and other credit enhancements . the estimate is based on 
three different forward-looking scenarios that are probability 
weighted to derive the net present value .
for insignificant exposures that have been individually iden-
tified as credit impaired, the measurement of the impairment 
loss is measured using the collective model described below 
but based on the fact that the exposures are already in default . 
model-based allowance calculation
for exposures not impaired on an individual basis, a statistical 
model is used for calculating impairment losses . the provi-
sions are calculated as the exposure at default times the 
probability of default times the loss given default . for assets 
in stage 1 this calculation is only based on the coming 12 
months, while it for assets in stages 2 and 3 are based on the 
expected lifetime of the asset .
the provisions for exposures where there has been no sig-
nificant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are 
based on the 12-month expected loss (stage 1) . provisions for 
exposures where there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, but that are not credit 
impaired, are based on the lifetime expected losses (stage 2) . 
this is also the case for the insignificant credit impaired expo-
sures in stage 3 .
nordea bank abp uses two different models to identify 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk or 
not . the change in internal rating and scoring data is used to 
determine whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk or not . internal rating/scoring information is used 
to assess the risk of the customers and a deterioration in rat-
ing/scoring indicates an increase in the credit risk of the cus-
tomer . nordea bank abp has concluded that it is not possible 
to calculate the lifetime pds at origination without the use of 
hindsight for assets already recognised on the balance sheet 
at transition . changes to the lifetime probability of default 
(pd) is used as the trigger for assets recognised after 
transition .
for assets evaluated based on lifetime pds, nordea bank 
abp uses a mix of absolute and relative changes in the pd as 
the transfer criterion:
• retail customers with an initial 12-month pd below 1%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
100% and an absolute increase in 12 month pd above 45 
bps are transferred to stage 2 . 
• retail customers with an initial 12-month pd above or 
equal to 1%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
100% or an absolute increase in 12 month pd above 300 
bps are transferred to stage 2 . 
• non-retail customers with an initial 12-month pd below 
0 .5%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
150% and an absolute increase in 12 month pd above 20 
bps are transferred to stage 2 . 
• non-retail customers with an initial 12-month pd above or 
equal to 0 .5%: 
exposures with a relative increase in lifetime pd above 
150% or an absolute increase in 12 month pd above 400 
bps are transferred to stage 2 .
for assets where rating and scoring models are used, the 
change in rating/scoring notches is calibrated to match the 
significant increase in credit risk based on lifetime pd . in 
addition, customers with forbearance measures and custom-
ers with payments more than thirty days past due are also 
transferred to stage 2, unless already identified as credit 
impaired (stage 3) . exposures with forbearance measures will 
stay in stage 2 for a probation period of 24 months from when 
the measures were introduced . once transferred back to 
stage 1, after the probation period, the exposures are treated 
as any other stage 1 exposure when assessing significant 
increase in credit risk . exposures more than 90 days past due 
will normally be classified as stage 3, but this classification 
will be rebutted if there is evidence that the customer is not in 
default . such exposures will be classified as stage 2 .
nordea bank abp does not use the “low credit risk exemp-
tion” in the banking operations . 
when calculating provisions, including the staging assess-
ment, the calculation is based on probability weighted for-
ward looking information . nordea bank abp  applies three 
macroeconomic scenarios to address the non-linearity in 
expected credit losses . the different scenarios are used to 
adjust the relevant parameters for calculating expected losses 
and a probability weighted average of the expected losses 
p1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – parent company
210
annual report 2020 nordea
under each scenario is recognised as provisions . the model is 
based on data collected before the reporting date requiring 
nordea to identify events that should affect the provisions 
after the data is sourced to the model calculation . manage-
ment evaluates these events and adjusts the provisions if 
deemed necessary .
write-offs
a write-off is a derecognition of a loan or receivable from the 
balance sheet and a final realisation of a credit loss provision . 
when assets are considered as uncollectable, they should be 
written off as soon as possible, regardless of whether the 
legal claim remains or not . a write-off can take place before 
legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have 
been concluded in full . although an uncollectable asset is 
removed or written off from the balance sheet, the customer 
remains legally obligated to pay the outstanding debt . when 
assessing the recoverability of non-performing loans and 
determining if write-offs are required, exposures with the fol-
lowing characteristics are in particular focus (the list is not 
exhaustive):
• exposures past due more than 90 days . if, following this 
assessment, an exposure or part of an exposure is deemed 
as unrecoverable, it is written off .
• exposures under insolvency procedure where the collater-
alisation of the exposure is low .
• exposures where legal expenses are expected to absorb 
proceeds from the bankruptcy procedure and therefore 
estimated recoveries are expected to be low .
• a partial write-off may be warranted where there is rea-
sonable financial evidence to demonstrate an inability of 
the borrower to repay the full amount, i .e . a significant 
level of debt which cannot be reasonably demonstrated to 
be recoverable following forbearance treatment and/or the 
execution of collateral .
• restructuring cases .
discount rate
the discount rate used to measure impairment is the original 
effective interest rate for loans attached to an individual cus-
tomer or, if applicable, to a group of loans . if considered 
appropriate, the discount rate can be based on a method that 
results in an impairment that is a reasonable approximation 
of using the effective interest rate method as basis for the 
calculation .
restructured loans and modifications
in this context a restructured loan is defined as a loan where 
nordea bank abp has granted concessions to the obligor due 
to their financial difficulties, and where this concession has 
resulted in an impairment loss for nordea bank abp . after a 
reconstruction the loan is normally regarded as not impaired 
if it performs according to the new conditions . in the event of 
a recovery, the payment is reported as a recovery of loan 
losses . 
modifications of the contractual cash flows for loans to 
customers in financial distress (forbearance) reduce the gross 
carrying amount of the loan . normally this reduction is less 
than the existing provision and no loss is recognised in the 
income statement due to modifications . if significant, the 
gross amounts (loan and allowance) are reduced . 
assets taken over for protection of claims
in a financial reconstruction the creditor may concede loans 
to the obligor and in exchange for this concession acquires an 
asset pledged for the conceded loans, shares issued by the 
obligor or other assets . assets taken over for protection of 
claims are reported on the same balance sheet line as similar 
p1. accounting policies, cont.
assets already held by nordea bank abp . for example, a 
property taken over, not held for own use, is reported togeth-
er with other investment properties .
at initial recognition, all assets taken over for protection of 
claims are recognised at fair value and the possible difference 
between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value of 
the assets taken over is recognised as “net loan losses” . the 
fair value of the asset on the date of recognition becomes its 
cost or amortised cost value, as applicable . in subsequent 
periods, assets taken over for protection of claims are valued 
in accordance with the valuation principles for the appropri-
ate type of asset . investment properties are then measured at 
fair value . financial assets that are foreclosed are generally 
classified into the categories fair value through profit or loss 
and measured at fair value . changes in fair values are recog-
nised in the income statement under the line “net result from 
securities trading and foreign exchange dealing” .
any change in value, after the initial recognition of the 
asset taken over, is presented in the income statement in line 
with the presentation policies for the appropriate asset . the 
line item “net loan losses” in the income statement is, after 
the initial recognition of the asset taken over, consequently 
not affected by any subsequent remeasurement of the asset .
13. leasing
leases
leases are not recognised on nordea bank abp’s balance 
sheet . lease payments are recognised as expenses in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
unless another systematic way better reflects the time pat-
tern of nordea bank abp’s benefit . the lease terms normally 
range between 3 to 25 years . leases are mainly related to 
office premise contracts and office equipment contracts nor-
mal to the business . future minimum lease payments for non-
cancellable leases are presented in note p24 “leasing” .
14. investments in group undertakings, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures
the parent company’s investments in group undertakings, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures are recognised 
under the cost model . at each balance sheet date, all shares 
in group undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ven-
tures are reviewed for indications of impairment . if such indi-
cation exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the 
carrying amount of each holding of shares is fully recover-
able . the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and the value in use . any impairment charge is 
calculated as the difference between the carrying amount 
and the recoverable amount and is presented in the line item 
“impairment losses on other financial assets” in the income 
statement .
the parent company applies fair value hedge accounting 
for the foreign exchange risk in investments in subsidiaries . 
shares in subsidiaries are remeasured at each balance sheet 
date with regards to the hedged risk with a corresponding 
entry in the line item “net result from securities trading and 
foreign exchange dealing” . the change in fair value of the 
hedging instruments is also recognised in the income state-
ment in the line item “net result from securities trading and 
foreign exchange dealing” . 
15. intangible assets
intangible assets are identifiable, non-monetary assets with-
out physical substance . the assets are under nordea bank 
abp’s control, which means that nordea bank abp has the 
power and rights to obtain the future economic benefits flow-
ing from the underlying resource . the intangible assets in 
notes to the financial statements – parent company
211
nordea annual report 2020
nordea bank abp mainly consist of goodwill as well as it-
development and computer software .
goodwill and other intangible assets are recognised at cost 
less amortisation and any write-downs . these assets are amor-
tised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, 
which is normally 5-10 years for goodwill and 3-5 years for it 
development and computer software, in some circumstances 
for strategic infrastructure up to a maximum of 10 years . the 
useful lives of assets are reassessed on a yearly basis . amorti-
sations and write-downs on intangible assets are presented in 
“depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges of tan-
gible and intangible assets” in the income statement .
goodwill is typically recognised when nordea bank abp 
acquires an asset or business or in connection with the merg-
er of a subsidiary . 
it development and computer software
costs associated with maintaining computer software pro-
grams are expensed as incurred . costs directly associated with 
major software development investments, with the ability to 
generate future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible 
assets . these costs include software development staff costs 
and overhead expenditures directly attributable to preparing 
the asset for use . computer software also includes acquired 
software licenses not related to the function of a tangible asset .
it development not yet taken into use is not amortised but 
tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indications 
of impairment . impairment testing is also performed more 
frequently if required due to any indication of impairment . 
the impairment charge is calculated as the difference 
between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount . 
at each balance sheet date, all intangible assets with defi-
nite useful lives, including it development taken into use, are 
reviewed for indications of impairment . if such indications 
exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying 
amount of the intangible asset is fully recoverable .
16. properties and equipment
properties and equipment include own-used properties, 
leasehold improvements, it equipment, furniture and other 
equipment . items of properties and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses . the cost of an item of properties and 
equipment comprises its purchase price as well as any direct-
ly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the working con-
dition for its intended use . when parts of an item of property 
and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items .
properties and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the assets . the estimates 
of the useful life of tangible assets are reassessed on a yearly 
basis . the current estimates of the useful lives are as follows:
buildings
30–75 years
equipment
3–5 years
leasehold 
improvements
changes within buildings the shorter of 
10 years and the remaining leasing 
term . new construction the shorter of 
the principles used for owned buildings 
and the remaining leasing term . fix-
tures installed in leased properties are 
depreciated over the shorter of 10–20 
years and the remaining leasing term .
at each balance sheet date, nordea bank abp assesses 
whether there is any indication that an item of property and 
p1. accounting policies, cont.
equipment may be impaired . if any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, and any impair-
ment loss is recognised .
impairment losses are reversed if the recoverable amount 
increases . the carrying amount is then increased to the recov-
erable amount but cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised .
17. investment properties
investment properties are primarily properties held to earn 
rent and/or capital appreciation . nordea bank abp applies 
the fair value model for subsequent measurement of invest-
ment properties . the best evidence of a fair value is normally 
given by quoted prices in an active market for similar proper-
ties in the same location and condition . as these prices are 
rarely available discounted cash flow projection models 
based on reliable estimates of future cash flows are also used . 
net rental income, gains and losses as well as fair value 
adjustments are recognised directly in the income statement 
as “net result from investment properties” .
18. assets and deposits in pooled schemes 
and unit-linked investment contracts
deposit in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment con-
tracts are contracts with customers and policyholders where 
the total risk is born by the customers or the policyholders . 
the deposits are invested in different types of financial assets 
on behalf of the customers and policyholders . unit-linked 
investment contracts include investment contracts written 
without any investment guarantees and that do not transfer 
sufficient insurance risk to be classified as insurance con-
tracts . since the assets and liabilities legally belong to nordea 
bank abp, these assets and liabilities are recognised on the 
balance sheet . 
deposit in pooled schemes and unit-linked investment con-
tracts are included in the respective balance sheet line item . 
the assets and deposits in these contracts are recognised and 
measured at fair value as described in section 11 “financial 
instruments” above .
19. taxes
the line item “income tax expense” in the income statement 
comprises current and deferred income tax . the income tax 
expense is recognised in the income statement, unless the tax 
effect relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case the tax effect is recognised in the applicable line item 
included in equity . 
current tax is the expected tax expense on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax pay-
able in respect of previous years .
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, using the 
balance sheet method, for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation pur-
poses . deferred tax assets are recognised for the carry for-
ward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits . 
deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date . deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties are not discounted . a deferred tax asset is recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the temporary differences, tax 
losses carry forward and unused tax credits can be utilised . 
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and 
notes to the financial statements – parent company
212
annual report 2020 nordea
are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised . 
tax positions are regularly reviewed to identify situations 
where it is not probable that the relevant tax authorities will 
accept the treatment used in the tax filings . uncertain tax 
positions are considered independently or as a group, 
depending on which approach better predicts the resolution 
of the uncertainty . if nordea bank abp concludes it is not 
probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment, the effect of uncertainty is reflected when 
determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, 
unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates . this is done 
by using either the most likely amount or the expected value, 
depending on which method better predicts the outcome of 
the uncertainty . uncertain tax treatment can affect both cur-
rent tax and deferred tax .
current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
when the legal right to offset exists and nordea bank abp 
intends to either settle the tax asset and the tax liability net or 
to recover the asset and settle the liability simultaneously . 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are generally 
offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and current tax liabilities .
20. employee benefits
all forms of consideration given by nordea bank abp to its 
employees as compensation for services performed are 
employee benefits . short-term benefits are to be settled 
within twelve months after the reporting period when the 
services have been performed . post-employment benefits are 
benefits payable after the termination of the employment . 
post-employment benefits in nordea bank abp consist only 
of pensions . termination benefits normally arise if an employ-
ment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or if an 
employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy .
short-term benefits
short-term benefits consist mainly of fixed and variable sal-
ary . both fixed and variable salaries are expensed in the peri-
od when the employees have performed services to nordea 
bank abp . nordea bank abp has also issued share-based 
payment programmes, which are further described in section 
24 “share-based payment” . 
more information on short-term benefits can be found in 
note p9 “staff costs” .
post-employment benefits
pension plans
nordea bank abp has various pension plans, consisting of 
both defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution 
pension plans, reflecting national practices and conditions in 
the countries where nordea bank abp operates . defined ben-
efit pension plans are predominantly sponsored in sweden, 
norway and finland . the major defined benefit pension plans 
are funded schemes covered by assets in pension funds/foun-
dations . if the fair value of plan assets, associated with a spe-
cific pension plan, is lower than the gross present value of the 
defined benefit obligation determined using the projected 
unit credit method, the net amount is recognised as a liability 
(“retirement benefit obligations”) . if not, the net amount is 
recognised as an asset (“retirement benefit assets”) . non-
funded pension plans are recognised as “retirement benefit 
obligations “ . all defined benefit pension plans are closed for 
new employees .
most pensions in denmark, but also plans in other coun-
tries, are based on defined contribution arrangements that 
hold no pension liability for nordea bank abp .
pension costs
obligations for defined contribution pension plans are recog-
nised as an expense as the employee renders services to the 
entity and the contribution payable in exchange for that ser-
vice becomes due . nordea bank abp’s net obligation for 
defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for 
each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned for their service in the current and 
prior periods . that benefit is discounted to determine its pres-
ent value . actuarial calculations including the projected unit 
credit method are applied to assess the present value of 
defined benefit obligations and related costs, based on sev-
eral actuarial and financial assumptions (as disclosed in note 
p33 “retirement benefit obligations”) . 
when establishing the present value of the obligation and 
the fair value of any plan assets, remeasurement effects may 
arise as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions and 
experience effects (actual outcome compared to assump-
tions) . the remeasurement effects are recognised immedi-
ately in equity through fair value reserve . 
when the calculation results in a benefit the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan . 
social security contribution is calculated and accounted for 
based on the net recognised surplus or deficit by plan and is 
included on the balance sheet as “retirement benefit obliga-
tions” or “retirement benefit assets” .
discount rate in defined benefit pension plans
the discount rate is determined by reference to high quality 
corporate bonds, where a deep enough market for such 
bonds exists . covered bonds are in this context considered to 
be corporate bonds . in countries where no such market exists 
the discount rate is determined by reference to government 
bond yields . in sweden, norway and denmark the discount 
rate is determined with reference to covered bonds and in 
finland with reference to corporate bonds . in sweden, nor-
way and denmark the observed covered bond credit spreads 
over the swap curve is derived from the most liquid long 
dated covered bonds and extrapolated to the same duration 
as the pension obligations using the relevant swap curves . in 
finland the corporate bond credit spread over the govern-
ment bond rate is extrapolated to the same duration as the 
pension obligation using the government bond curve . 
termination benefits
as mentioned above termination benefits normally arise if an 
employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, 
or if an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy . 
termination benefits do not arise if the employees have to 
continue performing services and the termination benefits can 
be considered to be normal compensation for those services . 
termination benefits are expensed when nordea bank abp 
has an obligation to make the payment . an obligation arises 
when there is a formal plan committed to on the appropriate 
organisational level and when nordea bank abp is without 
realistic possibility of withdrawal, which normally occurs 
when the plan has been communicated to the group affected 
or to their representatives . 
termination benefits can include both short-term benefits, 
for instance a number of monthly salary, and post-employ-
ment benefits, normally in the form of early retirement . short-
term benefits are presented in “salaries and remuneration” 
and post-employment benefits in “pension costs” in note p9 
“staff costs” .

21. equity
additional tier 1 capital holders
nordea bank abp has issued perpetual subordinated instru-
ments where the interest payments to the holders are at the 
discretion of nordea bank abp and non-accumulating . some 
of these instruments also include a requirement for nordea 
bank abp to pay interest if the instruments are no longer 
allowed to be included in tier 1 capital . if there is a require-
ment to pay interest based on the occurrence or non-occur-
rence of an uncertain future event that is beyond the control 
of both the issuer and the holder of the instrument, the instru-
ment shall be classified as a financial liability . the inclusion of 
the subordinated loan in tier 1 capital is decided by the regu-
lators and is thus beyond the control of nordea and the hold-
ers of the instrument . nordea bank abp classifies the instru-
ments as financial liabilities . instruments without such claus-
es are classified as equity as there is no requirement for 
nordea bank abp to pay interest or principal to the holders of 
the instrument .
nordea bank abp determines payments on financial instru-
ment classified as equity (i .e . additional tier 1 instruments) as 
distributions of profits and for that reason such payments are 
accounted for as dividends . 
invested unrestricted equity
invested unrestricted equity consists of the subscription price 
of the shares in nordea bank abp’s share issue or rights issue 
which has not been recorded in share capital . transaction 
costs, net of tax, related to the issue have been deducted .
also acquisitions and sales of own shares are recognised 
under invested unrestricted equity, for more information see 
section 21 “treasury shares” .
other reserves
other reserves comprise revaluation reserve and fair value 
reserve . 
fair value reserves include reserves for cash flow hedges, 
fair value measurement of financial assets classified into the 
category financial assets at fair value through other compre-
hensive income and accumulated remeasurements of defined 
benefit pension plans, as well as a reserve for translation 
differences . 
retained earnings
retained earnings include the undistributed profit from the 
previous years . 
dividends
dividends paid to the shareholders of nordea bank abp are 
recorded as a liability following the approval of the annual 
general meeting .
treasury shares
treasury shares are not accounted for as assets . acquisitions 
of treasury shares are recognised as a reduction in “invested 
unrestricted equity” and sales of own shares as an increase in 
“invested unrestricted equity” . also own shares in trading 
portfolios are classified as treasury shares .
contracts on nordea shares that can be settled net in cash, 
i .e . derivatives such as options and warrants and their equiva-
lents, are either presented as financial assets or financial 
liabilities .
22. provisions
provisions (which are presented as a liability) are recognised 
when nordea bank abp has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event if it is probable (i .e . 
more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation . 
the amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at 
the end of the reporting period .
provisions relating to employee benefits are further 
described in section 20 and provisions relating to financial 
guarantees contract and credit commitments are described in 
section 23 . 
contingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on the 
balance sheet but disclosed in note p38 “contingent liabili-
ties” unless the possibility of an outflow is remote . a contin-
gent liability is a possible obligation whose existence will be 
confirmed only by future event(s) not wholly within nordea 
bank abp’s control or a present obligation that is not recog-
nised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured within sufficient reliability .
23. financial guarantee contracts and credit commitments
upon initial recognition, premiums received in issued finan-
cial guarantee contracts and credit commitments are recog-
nised as prepaid income on the balance sheet . the guaran-
tees and irrevocable credit commitments are subsequently 
measured, and recognised as a provision on the balance 
sheet, at the higher of either the received fee less amortisa-
tion, or an amount calculated in accordance with ifrs 9 . 
changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement 
in the line item “net loan losses” . 
premiums received for financial guarantees are, as stated 
in section 3 “recognition of operating income”, amortised 
over the guarantee period and recognised as “fee and com-
mission income” in the income statement . premiums received 
on credit commitments are generally amortised over the loan 
commitment period . the contractual amounts are recognised 
off-balance-sheet, net of any provisions . financial guarantees 
are disclosed in the item “contingent liabilities” and irrevo-
cable credit commitments in the item “commitments” .
24. share-based payment
equity-settled programmes
nordea bank abp has annually issued programmes where 
employees participating in these programmes are granted 
share-based equity-settled rights, i .e . rights to receive shares 
for free or to acquire shares in nordea bank abp at a signifi-
cant discount compared to the share price at grant date . 
the grant date fair value of these rights is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period . the fair value per 
right is estimated at grant date and not subsequently update .
the vesting period is the period over which the employees 
have to remain in service in nordea bank abp in order for 
their rights to vest . 
for rights with non-market performance conditions, the 
amount expensed is the grant date fair value per right multi-
plied by the best estimate of rights that will eventually vest, 
which is reassessed at each reporting date . for rights with 
market performance conditions, the total fair value is estimat-
ed based on the fair value of each right times the maximum 
number of rights at grant date . market conditions are taken 
into account when estimating the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted . therefore, if all other vesting conditions 
(e .g . service condition) are met, nordea bank abp recognise 
expense for grants of equity instruments with market condi-
tions irrespective of whether that market condition is 
satisfied .
p1. accounting policies, cont.
notes to the financial statements – parent company
214
annual report 2020 nordea
social security costs are also allocated over the vesting 
period . the provision for social security costs is reassessed on 
each reporting date to ensure that the provision is based on 
the rights’ fair value at the reporting date .
for more information see note p9 “staff costs” .
cash-settled programmes
nordea bank abp has to defer payment of variable salaries 
under nordic fsa’s regulations and general guidelines, as is 
also the case with the executive incentive programme (eip) . 
the deferred amounts are to some extent indexed using 
nordea’s tsr (total shareholders’ return) and these “pro-
grammes” are cash-settled share-based programmes . these 
programmes are fully vested when the payments of variable 
salaries are initially deferred and the fair value of the obliga-
tion is remeasured on a continuous basis over the deferral 
period using the nordea tsr . the remeasurements are, 
together with the related social charges, recognised in the 
income statement in the item “net result from securities trad-
ing and foreign exchange dealing” . 
for more information see note p9 “staff costs” .

forbearance
forbearance is eased terms or restructuring due to the bor-
rower experiencing or about to experience financial difficul-
ties . the intention with granting forbearance for a limited 
time period is to ensure full repayment of the outstanding 
debt . examples of eased terms are changes in amortisation 
profile, repayment schedule, customer margin as well as 
ease of financial covenants . forbearance is undertaken on a 
selective and individual basis, approved according to pow-
ers to act and followed by impairment testing . forborne 
exposures can be performing or non-performing . individual 
loan loss provisions are recognised if necessary . 
on 13 march 2020 nordea bank abp announced that it 
would offer covid-19-related instalment-free periods in all 
nordic countries to those mortgage and car finance household 
customers and smes who were experiencing temporary liquid-
ity problems due to the covid-19 situation . nordea bank abp 
did not register covid-19- related instalment-free periods as 
forbearance, and consequently did not automatically transfer 
the exposures to stage 2, due to the temporary nature of the 
instalment-free periods and as interest continued to accrue . on 
1 october 2020 nordea bank abp ended all temporary amend-
ments to the credit risk framework and returned to its standard 
credit processes, including normal forbearance registration pro-
cedures, while still continuing to support customers through 
the crisis .
the carrying amount of loans on which nordea bank abp 
had granted covid-19-related instalment-free periods at the 
end of 2020 amounted to eur 4 .6bn, of which 86 .8% was clas-
sified as stage 1, 11 .5% as stage 2 and 1 .7% as stage 3 .

credit portfolio 
including on- and off-balance-sheet exposures the total credit 
risk exposure at year-end was eur 461bn (eur 454bn in 
2019) . credit risk is measured, monitored and segmented in 
different ways . on-balance lending consists of amortised cost 
lending and fair value lending and constitutes the major part 
of the credit portfolio . amortised cost lending is the basis for 
impaired loans, allowances and loan losses . credit risk in 
lending is measured and presented as the principal amount 
of on-balance sheet claims, i .e . loans to credit institutions and 
to the public, and off-balance-sheet potential claims on cus-
tomers and counterparts, net after allowances . credit risk 
exposure also includes the risk related to derivative contracts 
and securities financing . 
nordea bank abp’s loans to the public decreased by 5 .7% 
to eur 136bn in 2020 (eur 144bn in 2019) . the overall credit 
quality is solid with strongly rated customers . close monitor-
ing is done due to the covid-19 crisis, but supported by the 
strong nordic economies and governmental support, the 
credit quality remained stable during 2020 . of the lending to 
the public portfolio, corporate customers accounted for 68 .8% 
(65 .7%), reversed repurchase agreements for 8 .9% (13 .2%), 
household customers for 19 .0% (19 .0%) and the public sector 
for 3 .2% (2 .1%) . loans to central banks and credit institutions 
decreased to eur 64bn at the end of 2020 (eur 81bn) .

loans to corporate customers
loans to corporate customers at the end of 2020 amounted to 
eur 94bn (eur 95bn) . the sector that increased the most in 
2020 was real estate while maritime decreased the most . the 
contribution of the two largest industries (real estate and 
industrials) is approximately 36% of total lending . real estate 
remains the largest industry in nordea bank abp’s lending 
portfolio, at eur 26bn (eur 24bn) .
the distribution of loans to corporate customers by size of 
loans, seen in the table below, shows a high degree of diver-
sification where approximately 55% (56%) of the corporate 
volume represents loans up to eur 50m per customer .

loans to household customers 
in 2020 lending to household customers decreased to eur 
26bn (eur 27bn) . mortgage lending decreased to eur 10bn 
(eur 11bn) and consumer lending decreased to eur 16bn 
(eur 17bn) . the proportion of mortgage lending of total 
household lending decreased to 38% (40%) .
geographical distribution 
the portfolio is geographically well diversified with no mar-
ket accounting for more than 33% of total lending measured 
by the geography of the customer handling unit . other eu 
countries represent the largest part of lending outside the 
nordic countries . lending to the public distributed by borrow-
er domicile shows that the customers residing in the nordic 
countries account for 88% (86%) . 
rating and scoring distribution 
one way of assessing credit quality is through analysis of the 
distribution across rating grades, for rated corporate custom-
ers and institutions, as well as risk grades for scored house-
hold and small business customers, i .e . retail exposures . for
the corporate rating the majority of the rating was allocated
to 4+ and 4 . for the retail rating grade the majority of the rat-
ing was found in a+ . 
loan classes 
the loan portfolio consists of two classes: loans measured at 
amortised cost of eur 119bn and loans measured at fair value 
of eur 17bn . for further information on loans measured at 
fair value, see note p40 . loans measured at amortised cost 
are the basis used for impaired loans, allowances and loan 
losses . 
impaired loans (stage 3) 
impaired loans gross in nordea bank abp (amortised cost 
and fv) decreased to eur 3,055m (eur 3,734m), correspond-
ing to 166 basis points of total loans . 51% of impaired loans 
gross are servicing and 49% are non-servicing . impaired 
p2. risk and liquidity management, cont.

loans net, after allowances for stage 3 loans amount to eur 
1,606m, corresponding to 87 basis points of total loans . allow-
ances for stage 3 loans amount to eur 1,449m . allowances 
for stages 1&2 loans amount to eur 587m . the ratio of allow-
ances in relation to impaired loans is 47% and the allowance 
ratio for loans in stages 1&2 is 33 basis points . the decrease in 
impaired loans was mainly related to the natural resources, 
maritime and industrials sector . the portfolios with the larg-
est impaired loan amounts were also in the natural resources, 
maritime and industrials sector . 
past due loans 
past due loans, 6 days or more, for corporate customers make 
up eur 395m (554m), and past due loans to household sum 
up to eur 468m in 2020 (687m) . the table to the right shows 
loans past due 6 days or more, split by corporate and house-
hold customers . past due is defined as a loan payment that 
has not been made as of its due date .

1)  the stage classification and calculation provisioning for each exposure are based on the situation as per end of october 2020 (oct 2019), while the exposure amount and rating 
grades are based on the situation as per end of december 2020 (dec 2019) . some of the exposures in default according to the rating grade as per end of december were not in 
default as per end of october, and hence this is reflected in the stage classification .

p2. risk and liquidity management, cont.
net loan losses 
net loan losses increased to eur 678m (from eur 464m in 
2019), corresponding to an annual net loan loss ratio of 57bps . 
the change in the level of net loan losses compared to 2019 
primarily related to net loan increased management judge-
ments mainly to cover for the uncertainty on future losses 
related to covid-19 and individual provisions in oil, gas and 
offshore as well as maritime mainly due to changed collateral 
values .

p2. risk and liquidity management, cont.
counterparty credit risk
counterparty credit risk is the risk that nordea bank abp’s 
counterpart in an fx, interest, commodity, equity or credit 
derivative contract defaults prior to maturity of the contract 
and that nordea bank abp at that time has a claim on the 
counterpart . counterparty credit risk can also exist in repur-
chasing agreements and other securities financing transac-
tions . current exposure net (after close-out netting and collat-
eral reduction) represents eur 7 .3bn, of which 28% was 
towards financial institutions .
market risk
please see the section “market risk” of note g2 to the finan-
cial statements of the group .
market risk analysis
the market risk for the nordea bank abp's trading book is 
presented in the table below .
the market risk measured by var showed an average utili-
sation of eur 31 .6m in 2020 (average in 2019 was eur 14 .8m) 
and was primarily driven by interest rate var . stressed var 
showed an average utilisation of eur 46 .7m which is similar 
to 2019 (average in 2019 was eur 46 .6m) and primarily driv-
en by interest rate stressed var with additional contributions 
from credit spread stressed var . the highs in var and 
stressed var were reached in q1 2020 . var and stressed var 
are primarily driven by market risk in northern european and 
nordic countries .
the incremental risk charge (irc) at the end of 2020 was 
lower than at the end of 2019 which was driven by reduced 
default exposure . the lowest exposure occurred during 
q2 2020, while irc was the highest in q1 2020 . average irc 
increased by eur 4 .4m compared to the previous year, pri-
marily driven by higher contribution from the migration 
component .
comprehensive risk charge (crc) at the end of 2020 was 
slightly higher than at the end of 2019 . the lowest exposure 
occurred during q1 2020, while crc peaked during q2 2020 
at the start of the covid-19 crisis . average crc for 2020 
increased by eur 19 .9m compared to 2019 as it was dragged 
up by the peak at the start of the covid-19 crisis .
structural interest income risk (siir)/ev
at the end of the year, the worst loss out of the six basel sce-
narios for siir was driven by the steepening basel scenario, 
where the potential reduction of one year interest income due
to interest rate movements was eur 655m (against the worst
case income reduction at the end of 2019 of eur 1,030m, also
taken from the steepening basel scenario) . nordea bank 
abp’s balance
sheet is structured such that net interest income would 
decrease if short term interest rates fall while long rates rise .
 ev risk across all scenarios is currently zero, due to the 
beneficial impact of rate floors on assets and liabilities that 
apply due to the low/negative rate environment .

pension obligations
the pension plans are funded, meaning that the pension plan 
obligations are backed with plan assets with fair value gener-
ally on a similar level as the obligations .
the pension obligation is dependent on changes in actu-
arial assumptions and inter-annual variations can therefore 
be significant . 
the pension obligations disclosed are the earned pension 
rights calculated using the expected salary levels at 
retirement . 
the pension obligation is the valuation as per 31 december

annual report 2020 nordea
in 2020, nordea bank abp introduced a new long term 
incentive plan (ltip) for glt members, which is an equity 
settled plan . for more info on this plan, see “long term incen-
tive plan 2020–2022” below .
up until 2018 nordea bank abp in addition deferred vari-
able pay using a total shareholder return (tsr) indexation 
(excluding dividends) . the programme was consequently all 
settled in cash and the portion indexed with nordea bank 
abp’s tsr was accounted for as a cash-settled share-based 
payment programme .  
as from the 2019 program it was changed so that 50% of the 
program is paid in cash and 50% settled in nordea shares, 
which makes the portion paid in nordea shares an equity- 
settled share-based programme . 
the 2019 variable remuneration plans were in 2019 
expensed by eur 20m for compensation to be paid in cash 
and eur 20m for the share-based programme part . these 
have during 2020 been adjusted down to eur 14m for the 
portion paid in cash and eur 7m for the share-based pro-
gramme part . in 2020 1,331,083 shares in nordea were allot-
ted to the participants in these programmes, equalling eur 
7m based on the share price at the award date . another 
1,219,284 shares were granted to the participants but 
deferred . these deferred shares had a fair value of eur 6m 
based on the share price at the award date .
the following table covers all programs with share-based 
programme expenses recognised in 2020, or in the compara-
tive figures for 2019 . figures for 2020 are based on expected 
2020 outcome and all figures are excluding social security 
expenses . the expense for 2020 is based on an assumption 
on the number of shares that will be granted and deferred  
for delivery in later years .
long term incentive plan 2020–2022
please see the section ”long term incentive plan 2020–2022” 
of note g8 to the financial statements of the group .
expired long term incentive programmes – 2011/2012
ltip 2012 was fully expensed in may 2015 . all shares in ltip 
2012 are fully vested and consequently not conditional . 60% 
of the vested shares were deferred with forfeiture clauses in 
line with regulatory requirements and allotted over a five-
year period, for ltip 2012 starting may 2015 . the final distri-
bution of shares were allotted in may 2020 and at year-end 
2020 there are no outstanding shares nor any recognised 
liabilities . 
share-based variable remuneration programmes-
other than ltip programmes
please see the section ”share-based variable remuneration 
programmes (other than ltip programmes)” of note g8 to 
the financial statements of the group for more information on 
the variable share-based programmes that were deferred 
with tsr indexation (cash-settled programme up until 2018) 
and in shares (equity-settled programme as from 2019) . the 
programmes are classified as: the executive incentive pro-
gramme (eip), variable salary part (vsp) and bonus 
schemes . 
the share linked deferrals table only includes deferred 
amounts indexed with nordea tsr . the eip has been includ-
ed as from 2014, when deferred . further information regard-
ing all deferred amounts can be found in the separate report 
on remuneration published on nordea bank abp’s website

ment purposes . nordea may take positions with the expecta-
tion of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates 
or indices . the trading portfolio is treated as trading risk for

the hedge accounting requirements or hedges that are eco-
nomic hedges, but do not meet the hedge accounting 
requirements . the table below shows the fair values of deriv-
ative financial instruments together with their notional

investment properties
carrying amount of investment properties at year-end was 
eur 1m (eur 2m) . sales during the year was eur 1m (–) . 
amounts recognised in the income statement are 
insignificant .  
the method applied when calculating fair value is a rate of 
return calculation, based on internal models . as a supplement 
to these values, appraisals were obtained from independent 
external valuers for parts of the investment properties
approximately 75% of the investment properties are val-
ued using internal models based on a rate of return calcula-
tion . for the remaining 25% of the investment properties, 
appraisals were obtained from independent external valuers .

total sublease payments expected to be received under non-
cancellable subleases amounts to eur 9m (eur 10m) .  
nordea operates in leased premise . the premises are mainly 
divided into head-office contracts, banking branches and other 
contracts .
the head-office contracts in the different nordic countries 
generally have a fixed lease term and they are 10–25 years . usu-
ally these contracts have either continuation options or they are 
automatically continued unless separately terminated at the end 
of the lease term .
banking branch contracts do generally either have fixed lease 
term of 1–10 years or then they are without an end date with the 
right to terminate . the termination clauses are generally 6–24 
months . the main principle is that the premises contracts do not 
contain purchase options . the company car contracts generally 
have a fixed lease term of less than 5 years .

new provisions for restructuring costs were recognised to 
eur 74m (eur 262m) . the restructuring provision eur 251m 
is for the biggest part related to staff restructuring, related to 
the new group business plan, including new financial targets . 
approximately eur 167m of the eur 355m is expected to be 
utilised in 2021 but as for any other provision there is uncer-
tainty around timing and amount . the uncertainty is expected 
to decrease as the plans are being executed . 
loan loss provisions on off-balance-sheet items amount to 
eur 283m (eur 208m) . more information on these provisions 
can be found in note p2 “risk and liquidity management” .
excluding aml linked matters, other provisions are mainly 
premises related obligations .
bonds are transferable debt securities which normally are 
issued off an issuance programme . a bond’s term can range 
from about one month to several years . a bond manifests a 
debt owed by the issuer as borrower to the investor as lender . 
the investor is normally entitled to a cash payment from the 
issuer on the maturity date . during the term of the bond there 
are, normally, coupon payments at fixed intervals but a bond 
can be issued as a “zero-coupon security” or with other terms 
as agreed between the issuer and the investor . bonds are 
often listed for trading on a stock exchange . there are senior 
bonds and subordinated bonds . in the event of an issuer’s 
default; the issuer will be required to pay the investors of 
senior bonds and meet its obligations to all its other creditors 
in full before it can make any payments on the subordinated 
bonds . a bond can be issued as secured or unsecured .  
certificates of deposit (“cd”) are transferable debt securi-
ties that manifests a debt owed by the issuer to the investor 
and the investor is entitled to a cash payment from the issuer 
on the maturity date . cd’s are not issued off an issuance pro-
gramme and are not listed on a stock exchange . the cd’s 
term can range from 1 week to three years or longer . the cd’s 
can be issued with coupon payments or without coupon pay-
ments . cd’s are issued as unsecured . 
commercial papers (“cp”) are transferable debt securities 
and issued off an issuance programme . cps can be issued 
from overnight to about 1 year . the cp manifests debt owed 
by the issuer to the investor and the investor is entitled to a 
cash payment from the issuer on the maturity date . normally 
a cp is issued as a “zero-coupon security” with no coupon 
payments during the term of the cp . typically cp’s are not 
listed for trading on a stock exchange . a cp is usually issued 
as unsecured .

nordea bank abp sponsors both defined contribution plans 
(dcp) and defined benefit plans (dbp) . the major plans in 
each country are funded schemes covered by assets in pen-
sion funds/foundations . 
the plans are structured in accordance with local regula-
tions and legislations, local practice and, where applicable, 
collective agreements . nordea's main dbps in sweden, nor-
way and finland are all employer financed final salary and 
service based pension plans providing pension benefits on 
top of the statutory systems . all dbps are closed for new 
entrants, new employees are offered dcps . 
dbps in sweden are mainly offered in accordance with col-
lective agreements and follow the regulations in the pension 
obligations vesting act (tryggandelagen) . plan assets are 
held in a separate pension foundation . 
in norway the dbps are in accordance with the nordea 
norway occupational pension plan and follow the occupa-
tional pension act (foretakspensjonloven) . in norway plan 
assets are also held by a separate pension fund . 
in finland nordea provides additional pension benefits on 
top of the statutory system in accordance with the nordea 
finland occupational pension plan and follows the regula-
tions in the employees' pension act (tyel) . plan assets are 
generally held in a separate pension foundation . 
minimum funding requirements differ between plans but 
where such requirements are based on collective agreements 
or internal policies the funding requirement is generally that 
the pension obligations measured using local requirements 
shall be covered in full or with a predefined surplus or alter-
natively safeguarded by a credit insurance contract (sweden 
only) . some pension plans are not covered by funding 
requirements and are generally unfunded . quarterly assess-
ments are made to monitor the likely level of future contribu-
tions . 
 
 
defined benefit plans may impact nordea bank abp via 
changes in the net present value of obligations and/or chang-
es in the market value of plan assets . changes in the obliga-
tion are most importantly driven by changes in assumptions 
on discount rates (interest rates and credit spreads), inflation, 
salary increases, turnover and mortality as well as relevant 
experience adjustments where the actual outcome differs 
from the assumptions . 
assets are invested in diversified portfolios, with bond 
exposures mitigating the interest rate risk in the obligations 
and a fair amount of real assets (inflation protected) to 
reduce the long term inflationary risk in liabilities . 
multiemployer plans
in 2010 the norwegian parliament decided to change the 
afp (avtalefestet pensjon) plan in norway as from 2011 . the 
change gave rise to a new multiemployer defined benefit 
plan that cannot be calculated as such, as information on 
nordea's share of the liabilities and pension costs in the plan 
is not available from fellesordningen (the administrator) . 
consequently the afp plan has to be accounted for as a 
defined contribution plan in accordance with ias 19 . informa-
tion on the funded status in the plan is not available . 
the afp plan gives the entitled employees a lifelong addi-
tion to regular pensions from the age of 62 . furthermore, the 
scheme allows the employees to continue working while 
receiving afp without this affecting their pension rights . the 
plan is founded on the basis of a tripartite cooperation 
between employer organisations, employee organisations 
and the norwegian government . the government covers one 
third of the pension expense to the afp plan while the mem-
ber companies collectively cover the remaining two thirds of 
the pension expense . the premium the member firms pay to 
the plan is determined to be sufficient to cover on-going pen-
sion expenses and provide a basis for building up a pension 
fund . the purpose of the pension fund is to ensure sufficient 
ability to cover expected future pension obligations .
the employees that meet the requirements for afp are 
guaranteed afp payments regardless of the solvency of their 
employers . as a result the employer members have joint 
responsibility for two thirds of the payable pensions to the 
employees that at any given time meet the requirements for 
afp . any deficit or surplus on windup of the plan or entities’ 
withdrawal from the plan will not have any impact on 
nordea .
key management personnel
nordea bank abp's total pension obligations regarding key 
management personnel amounted to eur 7m (eur 7m) at 
the end of the year . complete information concerning key 
management personnel is disclosed in note p9 “staff costs” .

in its normal business, nordea bank abp issues various forms 
of guarantees in favour of its customers . loan guarantees are 
given for customers to guarantee obligations in other credit 
and pension institutions . other guarantees consist mainly of 
commercialguarantees such as bid guarantees, advance pay-
ment guarantees, warranty guarantees and export-related 
guarantees . contingent liabilities also include unutilised irrevo-
cable import documentary credits and confirmed export docu-
mentary credits . these transactions are part of the bank's ser-
vices and support nordea bank abp customers . guarantees 
and documentary credits are off-balance-sheet items, unless 
there is a need for a provision to cover a probable loan loss 
that arises from the judgement that reimbursement will not be 
received . the table above includes all issued guarantees, also 
those for which the possibility of an outflow of resources is 
considered remote .
nordea bank abp has undertaken, in relation to certain 
individuals and on certain conditions, to be responsible for 
the potential payment liability against them in their capacity 
of managing directors or board member in group undertak-
ings of nordea bank abp . 
nordea bank abp has undertaken to indemnify the mem-
bers of the glt against legal expenses incurred in relation to 
legal advice in defending or disputing certain claims or inves-
tigations from third parties, excluding crimes or actions made 
with intent or gross negligence . for each glt member, the 
indemnity is capped at an aggregate amount of eur 37 .5m, 
unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-
case basis . the indemnity is secondary to any other insurance 
coverage .  
 
a limited number of employees are entitled to severance 
pay if they are dismissed before reaching their normal retire-
ment age . for further disclosures, see note p9 “staff costs” .
claims in civil lawsuits and possible fines
within the framework of its normal business operations,
nordea bank abp faces a number of claims in civil lawsuits 
and disputes, most of which involve relatively limited 
amounts, as well as possible fines due to e .g . weak anti-mon-
ey laundering processes and procedures in the past . present-
ly, none of the current disputes are considered likely to have 
any significant adverse effect on nordea bank abp or its 
financial position . as previousy stated, nordea expects to be 
fined in denmark for weak aml processes and procedures in 
the past and has made a provision for ongoing aml-related 
matters . nordea bank abp cannot exclude the possibility of 
fines, which could impact the bank’s financial performance .  
in addition, some of these proceedings could lead to litiga-
tion . see also note g2 “risk and liquidity management” and 
note g33 “provisions” .
p37. other assets pledged
assets recognised on the balance sheet and pledged on 
behalf of other items than nordea bank abp liabilities are dis-
closed as “other assets pledged” . assets recognised on the 
balance sheet and pledged for own liabilities are disclosed in 
note p36 “assets pledged as securities for own liabilities” . 
securities borrowed and then used as collateral are reported 
in note p43 “transferred assets and obtained collaterals” . 
other assets pledged are mainly related to securities which 
includes interest-bearing securities pledged as securities for 
payment settlements within the central banks and clearing 
institutions and amounted to eur 267m (eur 20m) . from 
2020 only securities that are pledged for overnight liquidity 
are disclosed (pledged securities for intraday liquidity are 
exluded) . comparative figures have been restated . collateral 
pledged on behalf of other items other than the company´s 
own liabilities, e .g . on behalf of a third party or on behalf of 
the company´s own contingent liabilities are also accounted 
for under this item .

1)  of which eur 155m is priced at a credit spread (the difference between the discount rate and libor) of 1 .45% and a reasonable change of this credit spread would not affect the 
fair value due to callability features .
2)  the fair values are based on prices and net asset values delivered by external suppliers/custodians . the prices are fixed by the suppliers/custodians on the basis of the development 
in assets behind the investments . all private equity fund investments are internally adjusted/valued based on the private equity and venture capital valuation (ipev) guidelines . 
these carrying amounts are in a range of 5% to 100% compared to the values received from suppliers/custodians .
the tables above show, for each class of assets and liabilities 
categorised in level 3, the fair value, the valuation techniques 
used to estimate the fair value, significant unobservable 
inputs used in the valuation techniques and for financial 
assets and liabilities the fair value sensitivity to changes in 
key assumptions . 
the column “range of fair value” in the tables above shows 
the sensitivity of the fair values of level 3 financial instru-
ments to changes in key assumptions . where the exposure to 
an unobservable parameter is offset across different instru-
ments then only the net impact is disclosed in the table . the 
range disclosed are likely to be greater than the true uncer-
tainty in fair value of these instruments, as it is unlikely in 
practice that all unobservable parameters would be simulta-
neously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible 
alternatives . the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative 
of future movements in fair value .
in order to calculate the sensitivity (range) in fair value of 
derivatives a range of different modelling approaches are 
applied to determine an uncertainty interval around the 
reported fair value . the different approaches applied target 
various aspects of derivatives pricing . two common compo-
nents of derivative valuation models are volatility of underly-
ing risk factors and correlation between the relevant risk fac-
tors . each of these is addressed by applying different assump-
tions to input and/or the choice of modelling approach . 
besides these common factors a number of asset class spe-
cific factors are addressed . these include equity dividend 
expectations, recovery assumptions for credit derivatives and 
inflation expectations . the fair values of derivatives are pre-
sented as the net of assets and liabilities .
in order to calculate the sensitivity (range) in fair value of 
shares and interest-bearing securities the fair value was 
increased and decreased within a total range of 2–10 percent-
age units depending of the valuation uncertainty and under-
lying assumptions . higher ranges are applied to instruments 
with more uncertain valuations relative to actively traded 
instruments and underlying uncertainties in individual 
assumptions .

1) including debt securities eligible for refinancing with central banks of eur 67,748m (eur 61,218m) .
p43. transferred assets and obtained collaterals
transferred assets that are not derecognised 
in their entirety and associated liabilities 
assets are considered to be transferred from nordea bank 
abp if nordea bank abp either transfer the contractual right 
to receive the cash flows from the asset or retain that right 
but has a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one 
or more entities . 
 
all assets transferred continue to be recognised on the bal-
ance sheet if nordea is still exposed to changes in the fair 
value of the assets . this is the case for repurchase agree-
ments and securities lending transactions .  
 
repurchase agreements are a form of collateralised bor-
rowing where nordea bank abp sells securities with an 
agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a fixed price . 
the cash received is recognised as a deposit (liability) . securi-
ties delivered under repurchase agreements are not derecog-
nised from the balance sheet .  
 
securities lending transactions are transactions where 
nordea bank abp lends securities it holds to a counterpart 
and receives a fee .  
 
as both repurchase agreements and securities lending 
transactions results in the securities are returned to nordea, 
all risks and rewards of the instruments transferred is 
retained by nordea bank abp, although they are not available 
for nordea during the period during which they are trans-
ferred . the counterpart in the transactions hold the securities 
as collateral, but have no recourse to other assets in nordea 
bank abp .  
the securities still reported on the balance sheet and the 
corresponding liabilities are measured at fair value .

obtained collaterals which are permitted 
to be sold or repledged 
nordea bank abp obtains collaterals under reverse repur-
chase and securities borrowing agreements which, under the 
terms of the agreements, can be sold or repledged . the trans-
actions are conducted under standard agreements employed 
by financial markets participants . generally, the agreements 
require additional collateral to be provided if the value of the 
securities falls below a predetermined level . under standard 
terms for most repurchase transactions, the recipient of col-
lateral has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, subject 
to returning equivalent securities on settlement of the trans-
actions . the fair value of the securities obtained as collateral 
under reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agree-
ments are disclosed below . nordea bank abp also obtains 
collaterals under other agreements which, under the terms of 
the agreements, can be sold or repledged . those are mainly 
related to collaterals received under csa agreements cover-
ing derivative transactions .

signing
board of directors’ proposal for the distribution of earnings
on 31 december 2020, nordea bank abp’s distributable earn-
ings, including profit for the financial year − after subtracting 
the dividend to be paid on 1 march 2021 (at the earliest) based 
on the balance sheet for the financial year ended 31 december 
2019 and capitalised development expenses − were eur 
19,694,163,764 .90* and other unrestricted equity amounted to 
eur 4,573,347,620 .91 . the board of directors proposes that the 
24 march 2021 annual general meeting (agm) authorise it to 
decide on a dividend payment of a maximum of eur 0 .72 per 
share . the payment would be distributed based on the balance 
sheet to be adopted for the financial year ended 31 december 
2020, in one or several instalments . the authorisation would 
remain in force until the beginning of the next agm .
the total dividend amount calculated based on the maximum 
of eur 0 .72 per share, excluding dividend for treasury shares, 
would then be eur 2,907,097,050 .96** and it would be paid 
from retained earnings . after the maximum dividend pay-out, 
eur 16,787,066,713 .94 would be carried forward  
as distributable retained earnings . 
in the opinion of the board of directors, the proposed 
 distribution of earnings does not risk the solvency of  
nordea bank abp . further information can be found in  
the section proposed distribution of earnings in the board  
of directors’ report .

auditor’s report (translation 
of the swedish original)
to the annual general meeting of nordea bank abp 
report on the audit of the financial statements 
opinion
in our opinion
• the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group’s financial position and financial performance 
and cash flows in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the parent company’s financial performance and financial position in 
accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial statements in finland and comply with 
statutory requirements .
our opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee .
what we have audited
we have audited the financial statements of nordea bank abp (business identity code 2858394-9) for the year ended 31 
december 2020 . the financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, 
statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies
• the parent company’s balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and notes .
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in finland . our responsibilities under good auditing  
practice are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report .
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion .  
independence
we are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
applicable in finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements .
to the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group 
companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in finland and we have not provided non-audit services 
that are prohibited under article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 . the non-audit services that we have provided are dis-
closed in note g9 other expenses/auditors’ fees to the consolidated financial statements .
our audit approach
overview
• overall group materiality: € 200 million, which represents 0,65 % of equity
• the group audit scope encompassed all significant group companies, as well a number of smaller 
group companies in nordic countries, covering the vast majority of revenue, assets and liabilities
• impairment of loans to customers
• valuation of financial instruments held at fair value
• actuarial assumptions related to the life business
• it systems supporting processes over financial reporting
annual report 2020 nordea
auditor’s report
279
as part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements . in particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signifi-
cant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain .
materiality
the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality . an audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance 
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement . misstatements may arise due to fraud or error . they are 
considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of the financial statements .
based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall 
group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below . these, together with qualitative con-
siderations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to 
evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole .
 
overall group materiality
€ 200 million
how we determined it
0,65 % of equity
rationale for the materiality 
benchmark applied
we chose equity as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark 
against which the capital resources of the bank are most commonly measured 
by users and is a generally accepted benchmark . we chose 0,65% which is 
within the range of acceptable quantitative materiality thresholds in auditing 
standards .
how we tailored our group audit scope
we tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the nordea group, the accounting processes and con-
trols, and the industry in which the group operates .
we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or 
by component auditors from other pwc network firms operating under our instruction .  where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we issued specific instructions to reporting component auditors which included our risk analysis, materi-
ality and audit approach to centralized systems . audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant 
either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets 
and liabilities of the group .
by performing the procedures above at group companies, combined with additional procedures at the group level, we have 
obtained sufficient and appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the group as a whole to provide a basis for 
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements .
key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period . these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters .
as in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters 
consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud . 
nordea annual report 2020
auditor’s report

key audit matter in the audit of the group
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
impairment of loans to customers
refer to the note g1 - accounting policies (critical judgements and 
estimation uncertainty), note g11 – net loan losses and note g14 
– loans and impairment to the consolidated financial statements.
a high level of judgement is involved in determining the 
appropriate impairment loss to be recognised . for individually 
assessed loans, judgement is involved in determining whether 
a loan has a loss event and in assessing the loan loss amount .
expected credit losses (ecl) are calculated as a function of 
the probability of default, the exposure at default and the loss 
given default, as well as the timing of the loss . 
nordea categorises loans into three stages depending on the 
level of credit risk or changes in credit risk for each individual 
loan . for loans without significant increase in credit risk, stage 
1, expected credit losses are calculated for estimated defaults 
within 12 months . for loans where there is a significant 
increase in credit risk, stage 2, or loans in default, stage 3, a 
lifetime of expected losses are calculated .
the covid-19 global pandemic has impacted management’s 
determination of the ecl . to address the uncertainties inher-
ent in the current and future environment and to reflect all rel-
evant risk factors not captured in the nordea’s modelled 
results, management developed post-model-adjustments .  
additionally, nordea uses adjustments to the model-driven 
ecl results to address impairment model limitations .
this is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the 
parent company financial statements
our audit included a combination of testing of internal con-
trols over financial reporting and substantive testing .
we obtained an understanding of the loan origination pro-
cess, credit risk management and the impairment allow-
ances for loans and advances to customers .
we had a special focus on post-model-adjustments devel-
oped as a result of the covid-19 global pandemic and the 
credit risk development for large customers .
based on risk, we selected individual loans and performed 
detailed credit file reviews and assessed its credit risk .
for ecl models, we involved our modelling specialists to 
assess the methodology, challenge the underlying assump-
tions and to independently reperform the calculation for a 
sample of loans .
we evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions and 
accuracy of underlying data used to develop post-model-
adjustments and reviewed that governance procedures 
have been performed .
we have also assessed the disclosures related to impair-
ment of loans .
valuation of financial instruments held at fair value
refer to the note g1 - accounting policies (critical judgements 
and estimation uncertainty), note g19 – derivatives and hedge 
accounting, note g40 – classification of financial instruments 
and note g41 – assets and liabilities at fair value to the con-
solidated financial statements.
given the increased volatility and widespread macro-econom-
ic uncertainty around the continuous impact of the global 
covid-19 pandemic on economic activity, valuation of finan-
cial instruments continues to be an area of inherent risk . the 
valuation of level ii and iii financial instruments utilise observ-
able and unobservable inputs respectively, for recurring fair 
value measurements . significant portfolios of financial instru-
ments are valued based on models and certain assumptions 
that are not observable by third parties .
important areas in valuation of financial instruments held at 
fair value relate to:  
• framework and policies relating to models and valuation;
• internal controls relating to fair value adjustments, price 
testing, fair value hierarchy and model control & gover-
nance; and
• disclosures of financial instruments .
this is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the 
parent company financial statements .
we assessed and tested the design and operating  
effectiveness of the controls over:
• the identification, measurement and oversight of  
valuation of financial instruments
• fair value adjustments and independent price 
verification
• model control and governance .
we examined the group’s independent price verification pro-
cesses, model validation and approval processes, controls over 
data feeds and inputs to valuation and fair value hierarchy and 
the group’s governance and reporting processes and controls . 
for the valuations dependent on unobservable inputs or which 
involve a higher degree of judgment, we assessed the assump-
tions, methodologies and models used by the group . we per-
formed an independent valuation of a sample of positions .
in respect of fair value adjustments, specifically credit, debt 
and funding fair value adjustments (cva, dva and ffva) for 
derivatives we assessed the methodology applied, underlying 
models and assumptions made by the group and compared it 
with our knowledge of current industry practice . we tested the 
controls over the data inputs to the underlying models and on 
a sample basis tested underlying transactions back to support-
ing evidence .
we assessed the disclosures related to valuation of financial 
instruments held at fair value .

actuarial assumptions related to the life business
refer to the note g1 - accounting policies (critical judgements 
and estimation uncertainty) and note g29 – liabilities to poli-
cyholders to the consolidated financial statements.
technical provisions involve subjective judgments over uncer-
tain future outcomes . the value is based on models where sig-
nificant judgment is applied in setting economic assumptions, 
actuarial assumptions as well as customer behavior . changes 
in these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of 
technical provisions .
we assessed the design and tested operating effectiveness 
of the controls over the process for calculating provisions 
within the life business .
our audit also included assessments of applied methods, 
models and assumptions used in calculating the provisions . 
we have on a sample basis performed recalculations of the 
provisions . the audit was carried out involving pwc 
actuaries .
it systems supporting processes 
over financial reporting
due to the significant number of transactions that are pro-
cessed, the group’s financial reporting is highly dependent on 
it systems supporting automated accounting and reconcilia-
tion procedures . to ensure complete and accurate financial 
records it is important that controls over appropriate access 
rights, program development and changes are designed and 
operates effectively .
this is also a key audit matter with respect to our audit of the 
parent company financial statements .
we have tested the design and operating effectiveness for 
controls related to the it systems relevant for financial 
reporting . our assessment included, access to program and 
data as well as program development and changes .
for logical access to program and data, audit activities 
included testing of addition of access rights, removal of 
access rights and monitoring of appropriateness as well as 
appropriate segregation of duties . other areas tested 
included monitoring of it systems and controls over chang-
es to it systems .
there are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in article 10(2c) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014  
with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements . 
responsibilities of the board of directors and the managing director for the financial statements
the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu, and 
of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of 
financial statements in finland and comply with statutory requirements . the board of directors and the managing director are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error . 
in preparing the financial statements, the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for assessing the par-
ent company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going con-
cern and using the going concern basis of accounting . the financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no real-
istic alternative but to do so . 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion . reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists . misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these financial statements .
as part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit . we also:
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion . the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control .
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
nordea annual report 2020
auditor’s report
282
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company’s or the 
group’s internal control . 
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related dis-
closures made by management .
• conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ and the managing director’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the parent company’s or the group’s ability to continue as a going concern . if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion . our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report . however, future events or conditions may cause the parent com-
pany or the group to cease to continue as a going concern .
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether 
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and 
fair view .
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements . we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit . we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion .
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit .
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards .
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signifi-
cance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters . we describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication .
