the results for 2020 include 
a significant negative 
impact from the covid-19 
pandemic on the group’s 
passenger activities that 
generated 16% of revenue 
in 2019. due to the imposed 
travel restrictions, the 
ebitda from passenger 
activities was reduced by 
dkk 1bn compared to 2019.

rough seas in 2020
– may 2021 bring calmer waters
and new opportunities
i look back on 2020 with mixed emotions. on the one 
hand, covid-19 severely disrupted our lives and parts of 
our business. on the other hand, our ability to adapt to the 
changed circumstances proved the strength of the dfds 
organisation and the resilience of our business model.
adapting to such a severe event as covid-19 did, however, 
entail significant actions and costs, not least for the people 
we had to let go due to the sudden drop in demand across 
markets, especially in the passenger segment.
management’s resolute adaptation of activities 
mitigated the impact on ebitda, however, still with 
a 25% decrease to dkk 2.7bn. as the year evolved, 
freight demand rose to levels above 2019 helped by 
stock building in the uk ahead of brexit while passenger 
volumes remained almost at a standstill. the decrease  
in earnings was in the end caused by the drop in 
passenger volumes.
at the start of 2020, five of six members of the execu-
tive management team were new in their roles or had just 
joined. it was thus a new and untried team that faced the 
covid-19 crisis. i am impressed with their ability to quickly 
rise to the challenge, how fast they got together and the 
way they managed dfds skilfully through a difficult period.

financial position and dividend
in last year’s annual report, it was announced that dividend 
payments would resume. following the outbreak of covid-19, 
the proposed dividend was cancelled to safeguard our finan-
cial position. we consolidated our financial position post the 
outbreak and today our position is solid. leverage remains, 
however, well above our targeted range and the board there-
fore proposes not to pay a dividend in 2021. 
breakthrough year for climate
2020 was a breakthrough year for the climate agenda in 
the world of business. it’s now all about how and when we 
become climate-neutral, not if. we launched our own climate 
action plan that includes numerous projects to reduce our 
footprint over the next ten years as well as an ambition to 
replace fossil fuel with sustainable fuels to achieve climate 
neutrality by 2050. for several years, a lot of effort has 
gone into developing our approach to sustainability and the 
climate action plan is the preliminary culmination of this 
work. i am optimistic and encouraged by our green agenda.
strategic roadmap in place
going into 2021, we face an elevated level of uncer-
tainty, particularly about the effects of brexit on uk trade 
volumes as well as when and to what extent passengers 
will return in larger numbers to our ferry routes.
in the meantime, i am confident and have faith in dfds’ 
ability to adapt to market changes as well as a firm belief 
in our win23 strategic roadmap and ambitions. the acqui-
sition of hsf logistics group is a testament to this belief 
and management’s commitment to deliver on the strategy. 
in addition, the efficiency and improvement measures 
carried out in 2020 has positioned us well to both manage 
challenges and pursue opportunities in 2021. 
finally, thank you!
dfds has emerged in good shape from 2020 due to 
an extraordinary and impressive effort from the entire 
organisation. the cost has regrettably been significant 
in both human and financial terms. i am grateful for the 
great cooperation with our stakeholders, not least our 
customers as well as our business and financial partners.
i extend my deepfelt gratitude to management and 
staff for your support and efforts in overcoming the many 
challenges of 2020. hopefully 2021 will bring calmer 
waters and new opportunities to all.

managing through  
challenges and opportunities
our focus in 2020 was to serve our stakeholders as well 
as possible through a period of great uncertainty. to keep 
our colleagues safe. to maintain service and reliability to 
customers. to collaborate with partners. to maintain a 
strong financial position that keeps dfds safe.
looking back on 2020, covid-19’s disruption of our 
passenger services stands out. a sad consequence of the 
pandemic was laying off around 700 competent and loyal 
employees as we adapted to the new market conditions.
disruptions nevertheless also bring opportunities. we 
forged a commercially stronger and more focused freight 
sales organisation in the adaptation process, and have 
already achieved important customer wins. we opened 
new routes between norway and jutland in denmark and 
between ireland and france, with the latter starting on 2 
january 2021. we built a new organisation from scratch to 
provide customs clearance and related services.
strategic roadmap in place
when the pandemic broke out, we reviewed our win23 
strategy and i am happy to report that it remains a 
relevant and ambitious roadmap. our commitment  
to deliver on the win23 growth ambitions was 
underlined by the recent agreement to acquire hsf 
logistics group.
our financial ambitions are refocused on roic as 
the pandemic and other events have lowered the return 
to a level that is not satisfactory. our roic minimum 
target is 8% while the ambition of win23 is to reach a 
roic of 10% in 2023 compared to 4% in 2020.
climate action plan launched
a highlight of 2020 was the launch of our ambition 
to become climate neutral by 2050. this includes 
a pioneering project that will enable us to build 
a hydrogen ferry, hopefully already by 2027. to 
achieve the 2050-ambition we are engaging in open 
innovation partnerships to develop commercially 
viable technologies that will make it possible to use 
sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia, 
on our ferries. this is the start of an exciting, 
transformative journey.
looking ahead and thank you!
our freight business proved to be strong and resilient 
during 2020. in addition, brexit is now behind us and 
we can focus on our long term growth opportunities 
in the uk. uncertainty remains, however, elevated 
going into 2021. how quickly will trade normalise 
between the eu and the uk? when and to what extent 
will passengers return to our ferry routes? we cannot 
predict the outcomes of these key questions but 
we are prepared to respond to any challenges and 
opportunities that will arise during the year.
i would like to send a warm, huge thank you to 
my colleagues throughout dfds for their exceptional 
contribution and ability to come up with solutions to 
the many challenges we faced in 2020. 
i am also very grateful to our customers, partners 
and shareholders for your collaboration and support  
in a difficult year.

review
a challenging year
2020 was dominated by two events: the outbreak 
of covid-19 across europe and an extensive round of 
stockbuilding in the uk ahead of brexit. there were distinct 
phases through the year with negative and positive 
impacts from these events on operations and results:  
• q1: start of year in line with expectations. outbreak 
of covid-19 impacts dfds’ markets from march. initial 
adaptation launched
• q2: travel restrictions entail severe drop in demand 
for passenger services. freight demand also declines 
considerably. continued adaptation of operations and 
business structure
• q3: freight demand returns to levels comparable to 
2019. travel restrictions eased in first half of quarter 
and thereafter tightened again 
• q4: freight demand boosted by uk stockbuilding. 
tight travel restrictions continue to limit demand for 
passenger services.

climate action plan  
launched
the outbreak of covid-19 generated an exceptionally high 
level of uncertainty, especially in q2. as q3 progressed it 
became increasingly clear that freight markets would pick 
up and recover to activity levels similar to 2019. in the end, 
total freight earnings in 2020 were higher than in 2019 
helped by the extensive stockbuilding in the uk ahead of 
brexit in q4.
for dfds’ passenger services, the consequences of 
covid-19 were far more severe and the uncertainty persists. 
travel restrictions were introduced already in march 2020 
and this immediately led to a significant decrease in demand 
and hence passenger revenues. apart from a brief period 
in the first half of q3, passenger volumes were reduced to 
mainly essential travel since the outbreak in march. at the 
end of 2020, the ebitda of passenger services was reduced 
by around dkk 1bn compared to 2019. passengers are carried 
in the passenger, channel, and baltic sea business units.
an initial adaptation of operations to the sudden changes 
in market demand was launched at the end of april 2020, and 
a number of longer term adaptations to operations and the 
business structure were implemented at the end of june 2020. 
management review
dfds annual report 2020

another severe and regrettable consequence of covid-19 
was that around 700 employees were made redundant in 
2020 as part of the adaptations. around 70% of the laid 
off employees were employed in passenger services. the 
adaptations are described in more detail on page 15-16. 
on this background, dfds’ operating profit (ebitda) 
before special items decreased 25% to dkk 2,732m in 
2020 compared to 2019. overall, the decrease was due to 
the drop in passenger earnings.
the visibility of financial performance in 2020 was 
disrupted by the outbreak of covid-19. this led to the 
following development in the outlook for ebitda before 
special items during 2020:
• 6 february: outlook range of dkk 3.5-3.9bn announced
• 18 march: outlook suspended due to significant uncer-
tainty created by introduction of travel restrictions and 
general lockdowns across europe
• 7 may: outlook updated to an ebitda likely to be 
reduced towards dkk 2bn
• 12 august: outlook changed to a range of
• dkk 2.2-2.5bn
• 23 october: outlook raised to dkk 2.5-2.7bn as freight 
volumes continued to develop more positively than 
expected.
the outlook announced on 6 february 2020 also included 
an outlook for revenue growth of 4% compared to 2019. in 
august, this was restated as minus 15-18% and changed 
to minus 16-18% in october. revenue for 2020 was dkk 
14.0bn, a decrease of 16%.
on a divisional level, ferry division’s ebitda before 
special items decreased 28% to dkk 2,332m due to the drop 
in passenger earnings. logistics division’s ebitda before 
special items increased 5% to dkk 445m mostly driven by 
the addition of two companies acquired in december 2019. 
the group’s free cash flow was positive by dkk 1.2bn 
and adjusted for lease payments, the free cash flow was 
positive by dkk 0.5bn. the free cash flow included net 
investments of dkk 1.6bn which was 30% lower than the 
initial expectation for 2020 of dkk 2.3bn. investments were 
reduced as part of a process to secure the financial position 
following the uncertainty due to the outbreak of covid-19. 
financial leverage, measured by the ratio of net 
interest-bearing debt (nibd) to operating profit (ebitda) 
before special items, was 4.2 at year-end compared to 3.3 
at year-end 2019. the increase in leverage was due to the 
decrease in ebitda as nibd was lowered 5% compared to 
year-end 2019. the equity ratio was 39% at year-end 2020 
which was on level with 2019.
the average number of employees decreased 2% to 
8,213 in 2020 on account of the adaptation of the organi-
sation to the drop in revenue caused by covid-19. 
win23: strategic and  
financial ambitions set for 2023
dfds’ ambition to continue growing revenue and earnings 
considerably over the next three years builds on the win23 
strategy that has four pillars: 
a grow solutions to select industries
b digitise services to accelerate growth
c develop and expand the ferry and logistics networks
d create more value for passengers.

roic before special items was 4% in 2020 while dfds’ 
minimum return target is 8%. the financial ambition of 
win23 is to reach a return on invested capital (roic) of 10% 
in 2023. 
all four pillars include initiatives that will contribute 
to increase roic. of particular importance is pillar c’s 
fulfillment of the business plan for the mediterranean 
business unit that reported a roic of 2.4% in 2020 based 
on invested capital of dkk 9.5bn at year-end. the latter 
equals 43% of the group’s total invested capital.
pillar d covers passenger services. the potential to increase 
roic linked to passenger services is considerable as this pillar 
is focused on regaining the drop in ebitda of dkk 1bn caused 
by covid-19 in 2020 compared to 2019. a prerequisite for this 
to happen is the return of passengers in large numbers to the 
routes on the english channel, between norway and denmark, 
and between the netherlands and the uk.
major events in 2020
an overview of major events of the year is provided on 
page 20, divided into three sections: business development 
and competition; operations and digital; and people, envi-
ronment and finance. the most important of these events 
are reviewed in this section.
business development and competition
completion of fleet renewal program expected early 2022
a fleet renewal program was launched in 2016 comprising:
• six freight ferry (ro-ro) newbuildings. 6,700 lane metres of 
freight capacity per ferry equivalent to around 450 trailers
• two combined freight and passenger (ro-pax) newbuildings. 
4,500 lane metres of freight and passenger vehicles 
capacity per ferry as well as on board facilities for 600 
passengers
• a 10-year bareboat charter agreement for a combined 
freight and passenger (ro-pax) newbuilding. 3,100 lane 
meters of freight capacity and on board facilities for 
1,000 passengers. 
the new freight ferries have in line with expectations added 
efficiency and lowered emissions per transported lane metre.
the first two freight newbuildings were deployed in 2019 
between istanbul and trieste. the third newbuilding was 
deployed in april 2020 on the gothenburg-zeebrugge route 
that previously deployed three smaller freight ferries. on 
the rotterdam-immingham route two newbuildings were 
deployed in q2 2020 and at the start of q4 2020, respec-
tively. the route’s freight capacity has increased even though 
it now deploys two freight ferries compared to previously 
three. the sixth and final ferry was delivered in january 2021 
and deployed between sweden and belgium in february 2021. 
the first of the two combined freight and passenger 
newbuildings (ro-pax) is expected to be deployed later in 
the year in the baltic route network. the second is expected 
to be deployed in 2022. 
the chartered newbuilding is expected to be delivered in 
time for deployment on the channel in july 2021.

new route oslo-frederikshavn
on 25 june 2020, a new ferry route between oslo 
and frederikshavn was opened in connection with the 
reopening of the route between oslo and copenhagen. 
the latter was temporarily closed since mid-march due 
to lockdowns and travel restrictions related to covid-19. 
customers targeted for the new route are mainly passen-
gers travelling in their own car for transport purposes. the 
new route is operated by the same two passenger ferries 
that are deployed between oslo and copenhagen.
sale of ferry completed 
in september 2019 an agreement was made to sell a 
combined freight and passenger ferry (ro-pax) – liverpool 
seaways, built 1997 – to la meridionale. the ferry was 
delivered to the new owner in may 2020. the sales price 
was dkk 225m and an accounting gain of dkk 110m from 
the sale was recorded in q2 2020 under special items.
capacity agreement with uk’s department  
for transport (dft)
in october 2020, dfds entered into an agreement with the 
uk’s dft to ensure ferry freight capacity for vital goods 
such as medicine and food after the end of the brexit tran-
sition period on 31 december 2020. the agreement runs 
for six months starting 1 january 2021. the agreement 
comprises the dieppe-newhaven and rotterdam-felix-
stowe routes.
new agreement with danish defence
dfds and the danish defence have a longstanding coop-
eration and in november 2020 a new six-year agreement 
was entered into with the joint movement and transport 
organisation (jmto) that provides strategic transport for 
danish military missions. a total of seven freight ferries 
(ro-ro) will be made available for maritime transport of 
military materiel and equipment in connection with nato 
preparedness, military exercises and operations, and 
humanitarian crises.
on a day-to-day basis, the ferries remain deployed in 
dfds’ route network but will be made available when and to 
the extent requested by the danish defence. the agreement 
is also linked to the ark project, a cooperation between 
denmark and germany, which ensures access to and 
availability of maritime transport capacity for danish and 
german defences in accordance with obligations to nato.
operations and digital
initial adaptation of operations to covid-19 impact 
during march 2020, covid-19 broke out in dfds’ market 
areas and lockdowns and travel restrictions were imposed 
to contain the outbreak. this led to rapid changes in 
customer demand in both freight and passenger markets. 
the initial response implemented from mid-march included 
the following key actions: 
• operational sites and offices kept safe, including freight 
ferry routes, port terminals, and logistics solutions such 
as forwarding and warehousing operations
• suspension mid-march of two passenger routes, oslo-co-
penhagen and amsterdam-newcastle
• channel and baltic sea passenger services reduced to 
only essential travel
• freight capacity reduced by lay-up of freight ferries and 
reduced sailings 
• reduction of logistics capacity for certain sectors, 
particularly automotive and cold chain
• around 2,800 employees in q2 sent on paid leave 
through government compensation programs 
• immediate cost saving and postponement initiatives.
longer term adaptation to covid-19 impact 
on 29 june 2020, a number of longer term adaptations of 
the business structure to covid-19 impacts was launched, 
including: 
• merger of industry sales of large freight customer 
solutions, involving both ferry and logistics operations, 
into one unit to drive industry sales across the dfds 
organisation. commercial focus strengthened and 
overlapping functions consolidated
• ferry division to focus commercially on delivering 
reliable and cost-efficient services to freight forwarders 
and hauliers
• other freight and logistics operations adapted to new 
market conditions, including optimisation of port 
terminal and haulage operations

• passenger concepts aligned to changes in travel market 
dynamics with a higher share of passengers that 
primarily travel for transport purposes, including holiday 
travel. onboard concepts and offerings simplified
• improvement and efficiency projects that simplified 
and focused business support functions. this included 
a reshaped and integrated it and digital organisation as 
well as a downsizing of various functions.
the adaptations regretfully led to around 700 employees 
leaving dfds. before the layoffs, dfds employed around 
8,600 people. the total run-rate of annual cost savings  
is estimated at around dkk 250m of which around
dkk 100m impacted 2020 positively. one-off redundancy 
costs in 2020 amounted to dkk 102m recorded under 
special items.
covid-19 government aid schemes 
the group is included in various covid-19 government aid 
schemes primarily in denmark, uk, sweden and france. 
various wage compensation programs amounted to dkk 
124m and related payroll reductions of dkk 9m were 
realised equal to a total reduction of dkk 133m in 2020. 
fixed cost compensation programs amounted to dkk 1m 
as this was reduced significantly by withdrawal of a fixed 
cost application of dkk 52m in denmark. the decision to 
abstain from benefitting from the fixed cost compensation 
program was made late 2020 in view of the group’s strong 
earnings achieved in 2020 compared to expectations 
during first wave of covid-19. dfds also benefitted from 
various liquidity improvement programs that deferred 
vat and tax payments, primarily in denmark, the uk, the 
netherlands and france.
new limits on sulphur emissions in mediterranean
on 1 january 2020, imo (international maritime organisa-
tion) introduced a global limit of 0.5% on sulphur in fuel oil 
down from previously 3.5%. in 2015, a limit of 0.1% was 
introduced in northern europe. dfds has in northern europe 
complied with the limit set in 2015 by a mix of scrubber 
installations and consumption of low sulphur fuel oil.
to comply with the new rules scrubbers were installed 
on all deployed freight ferries in the mediterranean route 
network. installations started in 2019 and were completed 
by mid-2020. the total investment in scrubbers was 
dkk 328m, of which dkk 153m was invested in 2020. in 
the installation period replacement freight ferries were 
deployed which added operational cost.
customer focus 
in 2020, a new structure and format for measuring customer 
satisfaction and loyalty was implemented to increase the 
frequency and relevance of the customer feedback. the aim 
is to respond more rapidly to customer needs.
customer service and feedback was impacted by the 
covid-19 pandemic. the loyalty of freight customers 
increased due to, among other things, the reliability and 
flexibility of operations. on the other hand, there were also 
customers that experienced a lack of capacity in periods 
and changes in schedules caused by the pandemic. there 
was some shift in customer focus during the pandemic 
away from price towards reliability and customer service.
in the table on the previous page the results of the 
annual customer focus survey are reported. the overall 
customer satisfaction is measured by csat and nps scores 
as defined in the table. the csat scale was revised in 
2020 from 10-point to 5-point scale to align with industry 
rune keldsen
chief technology officer
standards. due to this change there are no comparison 
figures for the csat score. 
customer scores for passenger services are not reported 
for 2020 due to the severe negative impact of covid-19 on 
passenger volumes. 
it, digital & innovation – adapting to a post-covid-19 
world while continuing to transform
during 2020, the it, digital and innovation functions were 
merged into a joint new function technology & innovation 
along with the arrival of rune keldsen, evp and chief tech-
nology officer (cto). the mission of the new organisation 
is to increase the pace, efficiency and value of our digital 
transformation.
following the outbreak of covid-19 in late q1 most staff 
transitioned to remote working, remote working, and the 
technical capability to support it, has been a consistent 
theme through the year to ensure that staff had both the 
tools and the training to stay connected and maintain 
productivity.
focus on cross-functional collaboration
collaboration between those working with all aspects of 
technology and the commercial and operational teams 
is a key focus area. as a result of this and the impact of 
covid-19 on customers, there was substantial growth in 
usage of customer-facing freight solutions, such as the 
logistics platform dfds direct and mobile applications for 
truck drivers.
a new version of dfds direct was released in may 
2020 reaching more than 10% of the logistics division’s 
bookings by the end of year. the ambition is to at least 
double this level by 2023.

collaboration was also critical in preparing for brexit, which 
resulted in multiple new processes and integrations with 
various external authorities to ensure that the freight of 
our customers kept moving during the transition. systems 
and processes were updated and adapted in the beginning 
of 2021 to the new post-brexit rules.
automation and data - roadmap to autonomous logistics
covid-19 slowed progress on automation, which relies 
predominantly on machine learning techniques to address 
use cases such as asset utilization, yield management and 
target setting. as the pandemic disrupted ordinary behav-
iour, the operational usefulness of several algorithms was 
reduced as they rely on historical data to predict outcomes.
progress is nevertheless being made on increasing auto-
mation and real-time data transparency for the logistics 
of entering port terminals and performing tasks within the 
terminal area, as part of our innovation roadmap towards 
autonomous logistics. we continue to innovate in this area 
together with volvo and other partners.
it foundation: erp and architectural maturity  
still top priorities
preparations for the implementation of a new erp (enter-
prise resource planning) system continued throughout the 
year to develop the prototypes and the extensive integra-
tions needed between back-office and core operational 
systems. benefits are expected to come through from the 
shift towards a more composable architecture. complexity 
of passenger systems is reduced, which makes new devel-
opment faster and cheaper. similar efforts are underway in 
the freight ferry and logistics solution areas to improve our 
ability to integrate with customers and partners. 
cybersecurity is still top of mind and a strengthened cyber-
security team is in place to ensure that we respond fast 
to external threats as well as keep up to date with threat 
prevention techniques and systems. the security perspec-
tive of our cloud strategy is also high on the agenda. 
management receives regular updates on cybersecurity, 
including regular reports to the board of directors. in order 
to continuously monitor progress, the board of directors 
meets the head of technology & innovation and the head 
of cyber security biannually.
environment, people and finance
innovating for a zero-emission future
2020 saw the launch of the climate action plan that 
includes a transition to a zero-emission fleet and to green 
terminals. funding applications together with partners 
were submitted for the development of a hydrogen test 
vessel, and for testing of other alternative fuels such 
as green ammonia, as well as for the eu’s green ports 
initiative. 
a large part of becoming climate-neutral is also driven 
by automation and data transparency. focus is on two 
main innovation tracks – autonomous and energy 2.0 – 
that are increasingly converging in the search for solutions 
to reduce fuel consumption in the short-term, and for more 
radical approaches to climate neutrality. 
our policy on innovation is that a green future is best 
achieved by working openly together within our industry and 
across industries to solve the challenging problems we all 
face. we actively practice open innovation, and seek to form 
partnerships as well as supporting others who can benefit 
from access to an operator in order to test their ideas.
climate action plan launched
on 7 september 2020, dfds launched a climate action 
plan to consistently reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) 
emissions and ultimately become climate neutral by 
2050. the climate action plan reaffirms our commitment 
and responsibility for the environment. the plan also 
aims to ensure that dfds stays relevant as a provider of 
ferry and logistics services for both freight customers and 
passengers in the coming decades.
the climate action plan includes three key initiatives:
• next 10 years: +20 technical initiatives to reduce 
emissions from the ferry fleet by 45% from 2008 to 
2030, with 25-35% expected to be achieved between 
2019 and 2030 
• long-term ferry fuel replacement: introduction of a 
new generation of zero emission fuels to replace fossil 
fuels. the new fuels are sustainable as they consist 
of renewable energy stored in the form of ammonia, 
hydrogen, or methanol
• trucks, terminals, facilities and offices: reduction of 
emissions from third-party haulier trucks, own trucks 
and equipment used in port terminals. 
dfds joined ambitious sustainable fuel project
on 26 may 2020, a unique partnership between a.p. moller 
-maersk, copenhagen airports, dfds, dsv panalpina, sas 
and Ørsted was announced. it brings together the demand 
and supply side of sustainable fuels with a concrete vision 
to develop a new ground-breaking hydrogen and efuel 
production facility as early as 2023. when fully scaled-up 
by 2030, the project could annually deliver more than 
the cybersecurity team 
strengthened to ensure 
that we respond fast 
to external threats and 
keep up with threat 
prevention techniques 
and systems.
dfds direct was
released in may 2020
in a new version that 
reached more than 10% 
of the logistics division’s 
bookings by year-end.
the ambition is to at 
least double this level
by 2023.

250,000 tonnes of sustainable fuel for busses, trucks, 
maritime vessels, and airplanes. the production from the 
fully scaled facility can reduce annual carbon emissions  
by 850,000 tonnes.
dfds in partnership to develop hydrogen ferry
dfds partnered up with a group of companies in 2020 to 
develop a 100% hydrogen powered ferry for initially the 
oslo-frederikshavn-copenhagen route. 
in november 2020, the partnership applied for support 
from eu’s innovation fund to develop a ferry powered 
by electricity from a hydrogen fuel cell system, capable 
of producing up to 23 mw, emitting only water. green 
hydrogen for the ferry is envisioned to be produced by a 
projected offshore wind energy-powered electrolyser plant 
in greater copenhagen based on offshore wind. 
the largest fuel cell systems today produce only 1-5 
mw, and the development of such large-scale fuel cell 
installations for an electric ferry is a monumental task. the 
partnership committed to achieving this includes dfds, 
abb, ballard power systems europe, hexagon purus, lloyd’s 
register, knud e. hansen, Ørsted and danish ship finance.
the partnership has applied for support from the eu in 
order to accelerate the process and in view of the public 
interest in developing such technology. there are no ferries 
of this kind in the world today and a high level of uncer-
tainty is therefore involved in the undertaking. however, if 
the project develops as projected, the ferry could be in full 
operation on the route, or elsewhere, as early as 2027.
the project also aims to make these fuel types and 
technologies commercially viable, which is key for the 
transition of the industry to climate neutrality. this is also 
the ultimate goal of dfds’ climate action plan.
the ferry that has the working name europa seaways, is 
designed for 1,800 passengers and has capacity for 120 
trucks or 380 cars.
biofuel development project
in 2019, an investment was made in the start-up company 
mash energy that produces biofuel from agricultural 
waste, currently from the by-products of nut processing in 
india. the biofuel is co2 neutral and can be used in ships. 
in addition, the residual product is an effective fertiliser 
and will also contribute to reduce co2 emissions. during 
the spring of 2021 large scale test results of the fuel will 
become available and this will determine how to approach 
testing the fuel on board a dfds vessel going forward. 
together with mash energy, the goal is to develop a 
commercially viable alternative to fossil fuels.
people
a key challenge in 2020 was to keep employees safe from 
covid-19. for non-office employees on board ferries, in 
port terminals and warehouse or driving trucks a number 
measures were introduced. this included frequent tests, 
work shifts/safe bubbles, focus on hygiene and use of face 
masks as well as frequent campaigns about how to stay 
safe. for employees in offices working from home was in 
some periods mandatory or recommended to create safe 
working environments and minimise risks. clear signage 
of distance was introduced in all public areas. remote 
leadership training was also introduced, including focus 
on mental health issues arising from being separated from 
colleagues for longer periods.
sadly, two fatal accidents occurred for two people 
employed by external contractors in 2020. one occurred 
for a truck driver in the vlaardingen port terminal. the 
second occurred in mersin for a repairman on the deck of 
a freight ferry. our health & safety team worked closely 
with authorities to support their investigations into the 
accidents. both cases were closed with no remarks to our 
responsibility. the accidents have also been assessed 
locally to gather any learnings. more information about 
the accidents and safety is available in the csr report.
reporting on people and environment is part of dfds’ csr 
report. a csr summary is included in this report on pages

helping customers through brexit
we built a new customs organisation from scratch with 
around 100 employees and invested in systems that could 
connect with customs authorities to offer a full service 
concept to our customers. a new direct ferry link between 
ireland and france was opened to offer customers a hassle 
free alternative to driving through the uk.

major events after 2020
new direct ferry route between ireland  
and france/ continental europe 
to facilitate trade between ireland and continental europe, 
dfds opened on 2 january 2021 a new freight ferry route 
between rosslare in ireland and dunkirk in northern 
france. the port of dunkirk is a gateway to ireland’s top 
export markets – france, belgium, germany and nether-
lands – and a host of secondary markets. 
additional capacity was chartered in order to deploy 
three combined freight and passenger ferries on the route 
to carry drivers along with their trucks and trailers. the 
new route thus offers a cost-efficient alternative to driving 
through the uk.
the deployment of three ferries ensures a competitive 
frequency with six weekly departures in each direction. each 
ferry has a capacity of up to 125 trucks and their drivers in 
covid-19 safe single cabins. the crossing time is 24 hours. 
the route is initially not targeting passengers, although a 
passenger offering may be marketed at a later stage.
the route is expected to reach revenues above  
dkk 300m in 2022. the route is jointly owned by dfds  
and irish interests. managing director will be aidan coffey. 
the new route will be operated from offices in rosslare, 
cork, and dunkirk.
dfds creates leading provider of cold chain logistics
on 26 january 2021, dfds entered into an agreement to 
acquire 100% of hsf logistics group. the company is one 
of europe’s leading cold chain logistics providers to meat 
producers and other food producers that operates temper-
ature-controlled supply chains. 
the group operates four brands with hsf logistics a 
leading brand in the netherlands, germany and the uk. 
n&k spedition and skive køletransport are leading brands 
in denmark and scandinavia, together constituting around 
half of the revenue of the group. eurofresh is a brand 
focused on the german market.
dfds has agreed to acquire the hsf logistics group 
for a debt-free price of dkk 2.2bn (eur 296m). the hsf 
logistics group has revenue of dkk 2.8bn and an ebitda 
of dkk 320m (before adjusting for ifrs 16). the company 
has 1,800 employees and operates around 700 trucks and 
1,700 reefer trailers, including both owned and leased units. 
the acquisition of hsf logistics group is aligned with 
dfds’ win23 strategy of growing solutions to selected 
industries, including cold chain logistics. 
closing of the transaction is expected to take place 
around 1 may 2021 subject to regulatory approval and 
completion of required employee consultation processes.
more information on the transaction is available from

oslo-frederikshavn-copenhagen route suspended
in november 2020, one of the two ferries deployed on 
oslo-frederikshavn-copenhagen was laid up and in 
january 2021 the second ferry was laid up due to the 
continued tight travel restrictions. the route will be 
reopened once passengers are allowed to travel again.

roic and capital structure
return on invested capital
dfds’ return target is a minimum roic (return on invested 
capital) of 8% before special items and after tax over a 
business cycle. dfds’ weighted average cost of capital is 
around 5%.
the group’s roic before special items was 3.5% in 2020 
compared to 8.1% in 2019. the sharp decrease in roic was 
driven by negative impacts from the outbreak of covid-19 
that severely reduced earnings from passenger services. 
the roic was in 2020 above 8% in four of eight business 
units: north sea, baltic sea, nordic and uk & ireland. 
covid-19 caused a severe drop in passenger volumes that

reduced the roic of the channel and passenger business 
units, while a slowdown of particularly the automotive 
sector reduced the roic of the continent and mediter-
ranean business units. the latter was also negatively 
impacted by a slowdown in other sectors and travel 
restrictions for truck drivers.
the financial ambition of the win23 strategy is refo-
cused on roic with an ambition to achieve a roic of 10% 
in 2023 which is above the minimum return target of 8%.
 
capital structure
the leverage of dfds’ capital structure is defined as the 
ratio of net interest-bearing debt (nibd) to operating profit 
before depreciation (ebitda) and special items. target 
leverage is an nibd/ebitda-ratio of between 2.0 and 3.0. 
at the end of 2020, the nibd/ebitda-ratio was 4.2.
dfds’ board of directors continuously assesses the 
capital structure in relation to current and expected future 
earnings as well as future investment requirements, 
including acquisitions.
the capital distribution policy, distribution in 2020 and 
proposal for distribution in 2021 are reported on page 48.
business model and assets
business model
dfds moves freight and passengers on ferry routes in and 
around europe. in addition, transport and logistics solu-
tions are provided to a wide range of businesses using the 
ferry routes as part of the solution whenever that is the 
most efficient choice. 
in 2019, around 84% of dfds’ revenue derived from 
freight activities and 16% was generated by passenger 
activities. the share of passenger revenue decreased in 
2020 due to covid-19 and in 2021 passenger revenue 
is expected to recover partly. assuming a full recovery 
of passenger revenue in 2022 and consolidation of hsf 
logistics group, it is expected that the share of passenger 
revenue will be around 14%. 
ferry activities 
dfds’ ferry routes aim to provide reliable and efficient 
services for trade and travel, as such the routes are part of 
europe’s transport infrastructure.
the location and capacity of dfds’ ferry routes is 
determined by demand from businesses and consumers. 
some routes link regions with a high level of manufacturing 
activity and carry only freight, and some routes serve 
freight and passenger markets at the same time. two 
routes in the network connect attractive city destinations 
and carry mainly passengers.
port terminals are operated in key hubs to ensure access 
and efficiency, and also to offer additional services to 
freight customers, for example warehousing and storage. 
all routes operate according to fixed schedules with 
capacity determined by the number and size of ferries 
deployed on each route as well as the frequency of the 
schedule. 
different ferry types are deployed on the routes 
according to customer requirements. freight ferries (ro-ro) 
are deployed on routes carrying only freight, combined 
freight and passenger ferries (ro-pax) are deployed on 
routes where the demand for freight capacity exceeds 
passenger demand. passenger cruise ferries are deployed 
on routes that predominantly carry passengers and have a

wide range of on board facilities to make the journey itself 
an attractive experience.
the purpose of ferries is to carry freight units and cars 
that are rolled on and off, hence the ‘ro-ro’ abbreviation. 
around 82% of the freight volumes carried on dfds’ ferry 
routes are trailers that contain a wide variety of goods 
mostly for fast delivery within a few days. forwarders and 
hauliers are the main freight customers of the routes. 
trailers can be accompanied by a truck driver throughout 
a crossing or the trailer can be unaccompanied, i.e. it is 
delivered to the port and loaded on the ferry as part of 
port operations. on most longer routes the trailers are not 
accompanied by a driver and vice versa on short crossings. 
between turkey and europe all trailers are unaccompanied, 
the north sea is mainly an unaccompanied market while 
trailers on the baltic sea are mostly accompanied which 
requires ferries with cabins to accommodate drivers. on the 
channel, almost all trailers are accompanied but no cabins 
are required due to the short duration of the crossing.
on a number of routes, mostly from scandinavia to uk 
and the european continent, heavy industrial cargo is carried 
for manufacturers. this typically requires specialised equip-
ment as well as port terminal and warehousing services.
apart from the location of a route, key elements of the 
value proposition to freight customers are schedules that 
match market requirements, capacity allowing customers to 
grow their business, reliability and being easy to work with. 
the latter includes both digital solutions and relationships.
for passengers, a key element of the value proposition 
is likewise the route location. moreover, the ability to 
bring a car, the on board facilities, reliability, high season 
capacity and an easy booking process are all important.
to operate ferry routes and port terminals, including 
warehouses, a range of assets are deployed that are both 
owned and leased. information on the fleet is reported 
in the table and more details are available in the fleet 
overview on page 141-142. 
logistics activities
dfds provides transport and logistics solutions that to 
a large extent uses dfds’ route network as part of the 
solutions. the business model aims to provide flexible 
solutions that fit customer requirements and allows for 
fast reactions to changes in market conditions.
the main activity is transport solutions for full- and 
part-loads in both ambient and temperature-controlled 
trailers. another major activity is logistics solutions that are 
developed in partnership with customers, including manu-
facturers and retailers. such solutions can include ware-
housing and cross-docking services, freight management 
contracts and just-in-time/sequence deliveries. in addition, 
a new manning agency for logistics and port operations was 
established in sweden at the end of 2020.dfds deploys a 
mix of owned and leased trailers while most transports are 
subcontracted to a network of carriers: hauliers, rail opera-
tors, ferry operators and container shipping operators. own 
drivers and trucks are deployed in some contract logistics

and distribution activities. a number of warehouses are also 
operated as part of contract logistics activities.
assets and invested capital
dfds operated a fleet of 70 vessels at the end of 2020. the 
ferry routes deployed 59 ferries, of which 49 were owned 
and ten were chartered in for varying periods.
the ownership share of ferries is to a large extent 
determined by the required degree of specialisation of a ferry 
in order to match customer needs on different routes. in addi-
tion, ferry operators have in recent years in general increased 
their share of ownership, partly due to the specialisation and 
growing size of ferries and partly due to fewer companies 
focused on owning and chartering out ferries. 
the degree of specialisation of freight ferries (ro-ro, 
ro-pax) is linked to capacity requirements for freight and 
passengers, configuration of passenger areas, deck strength 
for loading of heavy freight, hanging decks for cars, sailing 
speed, fuel efficiency and ramps, including requirements for 
turnaround speed in ports.
the lifespan of freight and passenger ferries is estimated at 
35 years and 45 years for passenger cruise ferries. the duration 
of port-terminal leases is typically between 10 and 40 years.
the assets deployed in logistics mainly include cargo 
carrying equipment such as trailers and containers. it also 
includes warehouses and storage facilities. 
at the end of 2020, the total invested capital was 
dkk 22.1bn, including leased assets of dkk 3.1bn. 55% of 
the invested capital consisted of owned ferries and other 
ships and 7% consisted of owned port terminals, land and 
buildings and cargo carrying equipment. 22% of the invested 
capital was goodwill and other intangible assets. the net 
working capital was dkk 0.1bn.
ferry division’s invested capital was dkk 20.1bn at 
year-end 2020 while logistics division’s invested capital 
was dkk 1.4bn. 
outlook 2021
the level of visibility continues to be below normal levels 
for mainly two reasons: the covid-19 pandemic and 2021 
being the first year post brexit with longer term effects 
of the transition yet to emerge. uncertainty is therefore 
elevated going into 2021.
the outlook for 2021 builds on a number of assump-
tions that may change significantly as the year progresses.
general market growth prospects
the consensus outlook for gdp-growth (gross domestic 
product) in europe and turkey predicts that growth will 
resume in 2021 after a decrease in gdp in 2020. the 
consensus outlook thereby assumes that the negative 
impact of covid-19 will be less in 2021 than in 2020. it 
also reflects continued support from eu monetary and 
fiscal policies.
turkey’s economy, and in particular its trading with 
europe, is linked to the development in demand on euro-
pean markets that is expected to grow. turkey’s export is 
also expected to benefit from the depreciation of try vs 
eur. longer term, turkey should gradually benefit from 
nearshoring of manufacturing from overseas region as 
companies consider reducing risks of supply chain disrup-
tions. geopolitical issues involving turkey could dampen 
the expected growth, both short and long term.

growth in 2021 is around 5.5%, including growth of 4.2% 
for uk and 4.5% for turkey. (source: thomson reuters).
key outlook freight assumptions for 2021 
as expected, 2021 has started with a considerable 
decrease in freight ferry and logistics volumes related 
to the uk following the extended stockbuilding in q4 
2020. due to the uncertainty linked to the first year post 
brexit, visibility on the earnings outlook for business units 
facilitating trade with the uk and trading in the uk is low. 
earnings in 2021 for uk-linked activities are therefore 
expected to be below 2020.
 
the mediterranean business unit is expected to improve 
earnings in 2021 driven by volume growth and more 
efficient operations.
in the baltic region, freight ferry capacity and competi-
tion increased in the second half of 2020. this is expected 
to continue with lower earnings from ferry services in 2021 
compared to 2020.

various risks and uncertainties pertain  
to the outlook.
various risks and uncertainties pertain to 
the outlook.
the most important among these are 
possible major changes in the demand for 
ferry – freight and passengers - and logis-
tics services. for dfds, such demand is to a 
large extent linked to the level of economic 
activity in primarily europe, especially 
northern europe and in particular the uk, 
as well as adjacent regions, particularly 
turkey. 
demand can also be impacted by 
competitor actions and extraordinary 
events such as virus outbreaks. covid-19 
continues to constitute a significant 
risk, particularly for passenger services. 
the outlook can moreover be impacted 
by political changes, first and foremost 
within eu and turkey. the introduction of 
a new trade agreement between the eu 
and the uk constitutes an important risk.
changes in economic variables, espe-
cially the oil price and exchange rates, can 
furthermore impact earnings. 
future financial results may therefore 
differ significantly from expectations.
key outlook assumptions for hsf logistics group 
the acquisition of hsf logistics group is expected to 
be consolidated from 1 may 2021 subject to regulatory 
approval. for eight months in 2021, the group’s revenue 
is expected to be around dkk 1.9bn and ebitda before 
special items around dkk 250m.
key outlook passenger assumptions for 2021 
the ebitda for passenger services across business 
units - passenger, channel and baltic sea - was reduced 
by around dkk 1bn in 2020 due to travel restrictions 
imposed to limit the spread of covid-19.
it is initially assumed that around 40% of the decrease 
in 2020 is regained in 2021. the current most likely 
scenario is that travel restrictions will continue to limit 
travel in the first half of 2021 while some easing of 
restrictions are expected in the second half of the year.
the high season for ferry travel is q3 and the outlook 
is thus especially sensitive to the scope of restrictions in 
this quarter. 
revenue outlook
the group’s revenue is expected to increase by 20-25% 
compared to 2020.
the main growth drivers are the addition of hsf logis-
tics group, the opening of a new route between ireland 
and france and an increase in passenger volumes.
ebitda outlook before special items
based on the assumptions described above, the group’s 
ebitda before special items is expected to be within 
a range of dkk 3.0-3.5bn (2020: dkk 2.7bn). see the 
outlook table for a divisional split.
ebit outlook before special items
the group’s ebit before special items is expected to be 
within a range of dkk 1,000-1,500m (2020: dkk 858m). 
investments 
investments of around dkk 2.8bn are expected in 2021 of 
which dkk 0.9bn is the initial payment for hsf logistics 
group.
one new freight ferry (ro-ro) was delivered in february 
2021 and in q4 the first of two new combined freight and 
passenger ferries (ro-pax) is scheduled for delivery.  
the second is planned for delivery in 2022.
investments in 2021 are expected to comprise:
• acquisition of hsf logistics group: dkk 930m
• ferry newbuildings: dkk 800m 
• dockings and ferry upgrades: dkk 500m
• port terminals and other equipment: dkk 200m
• cargo carrying equipment and warehouses, mainly 
related to logistics division: dkk 250m
• other investments, including it and digital: dkk 150m.

managing through big swings in demand
the pandemic reduced freight volumes in early spring and 
a number of ferries were laid up to adapt operations to 
the new situation. as freight volumes picked up again, we 
brought capacity back to the market to support the growth 
of customers. for the uk stockbuilding ahead of brexit, 
we again increased capacity through more departures and 
even our new mega freight ferries were close to full as the 
stockbuilding peaked in december.

ferry division
ferry division’s revenue decreased 21% to dkk 9,678m 
compared to 2019. the decrease was mainly driven by a drop 
in passenger revenue due to travel restrictions. in addition, 
the decline in the oil price reduced revenue from bunker 
surcharges and freight revenue was reduced in q2 2020 by 
lockdowns. freight revenue picked up well from the beginning 
of q3 and stockbuilding in the uk ahead of brexit boosted 
revenue further in q4. ebitda before special items decreased 
28% to dkk 2,332m. ebit before special items decreased 
52% to dkk 815m and after special items the decrease was 
57% due to one-off costs for adapting the organisation to 
covid-19 .
the return on invested capital, roic, before special 
items decreased to 3.9% in 2020 from 8.7% in 2019 
primarily due to the significant drop in passenger earn-
ings caused by the pandemic. average invested capital 
increased 4% to dkk 20,222m compared to 2019.

freight volumes increased 2% in 2020 compared to 
2019. following a sharp drop in volumes q2 caused 
by lockdowns related to covid-19, volumes recovered 
through q3. in q4 volumes were boosted by uk stock-
piling ahead of brexit. the slowdown in q2 was particu-
larly pronounced for the automotive industry as some 
plants were temporarily closed. volumes of both finished 
cars and spare parts decreased. tem-perature controlled 
freight volumes, mostly medicine and food products, were 
less impacted.
one new mega freight ferry was deployed on the 
route between gothenburg and zeebrugge and two were 
deployed on the route between vlaardingen (rotterdam) 
and immingham. capacity on the latter route was increased 
which was well utilised during the stockbuilding period.

ahead of brexit at the end of december 2020, a six-month 
agreement was entered into with the uk department for 
transport regarding supply of freight ferry capacity in the 
first half of 2021. the agreement had no financial impact 
in 2020.
baltic sea
revenue decreased 14% to dkk 1,268m compared to 
2019 and by 5% adjusted for route closures and a decline 
in revenue from bunker surcharges due to the oil price. 
ebitda before special items decreased 13% to dkk 434m 
following lower passenger earnings and a higher level of 
costs as more capacity was added on some routes. 
freight volumes were up 4% compared to 2019 adjusted 
for the closure of the paldiski-hanko route at the end of q3. 
this followed on from a capacity reduction from mid-q2 and 
a freight agreement with eckerö line announced at the same 
time to serve volumes between finland and estonia. these 
changes provided an opportunity to improve the schedule 
and capacity between estonia and sweden where some 
market share was gained as competitors reduced capacity in 
parts of the year.
a high level of volumes were carried on the routes 
between lithuania and sweden/germany supported by 
additional capacity on the routes. competition increased, 
both direct and indirect, as competitors increased capacity, 
including the opening of a new route. 
passenger volumes decreased 15% in 2020 as passenger 
travel was restricted to essential travel. the volume 
decrease was less than on other passenger services in and 
outside baltic sea as migrant workers constitute a high 
share of the passengers. in addition, the capacity to carry 
passengers was increased on paldiski-kapellskär in q3.

revenue decreased 25% to dkk 2,012m compared 
to 2019. the decrease was mainly driven by a drop in 
passenger revenue due to travel restrictions. freight 
revenue, excluding bunker surcharges, was on level with 
2019. ebitda before special items decreased 33% to 
dkk 334m.
freight volumes were on level with 2019 while passenger 
volumes decreased 65%. the year started with freight 
volumes below 2019 as q1 in that year had seen a spike in 
volumes leading up to a brexit deadline that was eventually 
postponed. from mid-march volumes were reduced by lock-
downs before picking up towards the end of q2. the pickup 
in volumes continued into q3 and in q4 volumes reached 
record levels due to stockpiling in the uk ahead of brexit. 
total volumes in the dover strait freight market decreased 
7% in 2020 while dfds’ market share increased 2 ppt on 
2019, particularly in the second half of the year. 
the decrease in passenger volumes was higher than the 
56% decrease in the total market. the pandemic signifi-
cantly reduced volumes from the end of q1. there was a 
mild recovery in q3 as travel restrictions were eased tempo-
rarily. due to customer uncertainty around international 
travel and social distancing onboard volumes were however 
still below 2019. as travel restrictions were tightened 
for the rest of the year volumes again fell back. the low 
volumes were mitigated somewhat by higher revenue per 
passenger.
capacity on the dover strait was adapted through the 
year by reducing the number of sailings and laying up one of 
six ferries for several months.

expectedly in july. on 2 january 2021, a new route between 
ireland and france was opened deploying three combined 
freight and passenger ferries. the new route will be reported 
as part of the channel business unit.  
mediterranean
revenue decreased 5% to dkk 2,071m compared to 2019 
while ebitda before special items increased 8% to
dkk 631m.
freight volumes decreased 8% in 2020 as high growth 
in the first two months of the year was offset by a sharp 
decline in volumes from mid-march when covid-19 started 
to impact markets. in addition to the general slowdown, 
customers’ haulage operations were negatively impacted 
by travel restrictions for truck drivers. the slowdown was 
exacerbated by a high share of automotive and textile 
volumes that dropped as manufacturers temporarily closed 
plants. ferry capacity was reduced during the slowdown by 
lay-up of ferries.
volumes recovered through q3 and was on level with 
2019 in the last month of the quarter. the positive volume 
trend continued in q4 as depreciation of the turkish 
lira supported export growth. the volume recovery was 
supported by a normalisation of customers’ trucking opera-
tions as air travel restrictions for truck drivers were eased.
rail services continued to grow and the utilisation level 
improved considerably compared to 2019. port terminal oper-
ations were also improved, although capacity continues to 
be a constraint in some ports. from 1 january 2020, the new 
rules limiting sulphur in fuel oil were adopted. installation of 
scrubbers on all freight ferries was completed by mid-year. 
extra costs were incurred during the installation process 
which also reduced the reliability of schedules in periods.   
mediterranean’s result is expected to further improve in 
2021 driven by volume growth as well as further improve-
ment of operational efficiency and customer service levels.
passenger
revenue decreased 71% to dkk 489m compared to 2019 
and ebitda before special items decreased dkk 618m to 
dkk -373m.
the significant decrease in revenue and earnings was a 
result of the travel restrictions that were imposed for most 
of the year from mid-march. both routes were suspended 
at the start of the pandemic in mid-march until end june 
and mid-july, respectively. the number of sailings on the 
oslo-frederikshavn-copenhagen route were also reduced 
for most of q4. 
a new route between oslo and frederikshavn was added 
to the oslo-copenhagen route after a competitor closed its 
route permanently in march 2020. 
non-allocated items
non-allocated items primarily include activities related 
to external chartering of ships not deployed in the route 
network.
revenue decreased 5% to dkk 436m compared to  
2019 and ebitda before special items decreased 15% to  
dkk 122m. 
mediterranean’s result 
is expected to further 
improve in 2021 driven by 
volume growth as well as 
further improvement of 
operational efficiency and 
customer service levels

activities and business model
dfds’ ferry division operates 
one of the largest networks 
of ferry routes in and around 
europe providing both freight 
and passenger services.
freight ferry services
the routes are strategically located to service the 
freight volumes of forwarders, hauliers and manufac-
turers of heavy industrial goods. all routes operate on 
fixed, reliable schedules with a frequency adapted to 
customer requirements.

with manufacturers of heavy goods such as automo-
biles, metals, forest products, and chemicals.
to further enhance the efficiency of customer services, 
own port terminals are operated in strategic locations, 
including warehousing services.
passenger ferry services
the route network offers both overnight and short cross-
ings. passenger cars are transported on all routes. the 
onboard facilities are adapted to each route’s particular 
mix of passengers and their requirements for enjoying

adapting the passenger business
when the pandemic struck in early spring passenger volumes 
dropped dramatically. ferries were laid up and we regrettably 
had to adapt the workforce to the new situation. when 
passenger services resumed, we saw an opportunity to add 
frederikshavn as a new destination between norway and 
denmark to expand the route to new customer groups.

logistics division
logistics division’s revenue of dkk 5,069m was 1% below 
2019. ebitda before special items increased 5% to
dkk 445m and ebit before special items decreased 6% to 
dkk 159m. ebit after special items decreased 10% due to 
one-off costs for adapting the organisation to covid-19 .
the return on invested capital, roic, before special 
items decreased to 7.7% in 2020 from 9,2% in 2019. 
average invested capital increased 7% to dkk 1,613m.
nordic
revenue increased 3% to dkk 1,625m compared to 2019 
and ebitda before special items increased 17% to 
dkk 131m.
from mid-march until the end of may, activity was 
reduced by lockdowns following the outbreak of covid-19. 
the swedish market was the most impacted as a high share 
of solutions are provided to the automotive sector and the 
demand for specialised services also dropped. from the 
end of q2 activity started to pick up again, although the 
automotive sector was slower to recover than most other 
sectors. towards the end of q3 and in q4 activity was

services between mainly finland and scandinavia, baltics

covid-19, especially in sweden and denmark. the full-year 
result for freeco was in line with expectations. 
the swedish contract logistics activities will in 2021 
be expanded with a new warehouse in karlshamn for both 
ambient and cold chain customers. in addition, a new ware-
house is planned to open in borås, close to gothenburg, at 
the end of the year.

the outbreak of covid-19. the impact was most severe on 
automotive, special cargo construction and airline catering 
volumes. apart from the airline sector all sectors recovered 
well in h2 and traffics between the continent and the uk 
were in addition boosted by uk stockbuilding ahead of 
brexit. margins were also improved through cost control 
measures.
the acquired dutch logistics company huisman group 
was successfully integrated during 2020 adding part-load 
solutions between the netherlands and the uk, including 
warehouses and cross-docking facilities in wijchen and in 
corby. the positive full-year impact on revenue from huisman 
was insufficient to offset the drop in revenue caused by 
covid-19, especially in the netherlands and in belgium. the 
full-year result for huisman was in line with expectations. 
the annual result for the special cargo business was 
considerably reduced by inefficiencies in its trucking 
operation, including one-off costs reported in q1 2020. 
since then operations were steadily improved and earnings 
in h2 were above 2019.
uk & ireland
revenue increased 6% to dkk 1,444m compared to  
2019 and ebitda before special items increased 3% to  
dkk 155m.
as a large part of the activities in the uk & ireland 
business unit are domestic in scope, the overall impact 
from covid-19 was less severe. the cold chain activities 
distributing seafood and other produce to the uk catering 
sector were, however, disrupted in periods through the 
year. this was offset by a high level of activity in transport 
services delivered to incoming trailer volumes from the 
continent and scandinavia. the organisation was adapted 
to the market changes following covid-19. 
changes were made to the cold stores operated in 
mid-england as the warrington cold store was exited and 
an agreement to operate a cold store in liverpool was 
entered into. 
a smaller seafood distribution company, colley bros, linked 
to the grimsby activities was acquired during the year. more-
over, a new freight forwarding office was opened in dover. 
non-allocated items
revenue of non-allocated items is mainly related to an 
internal trailer equipment pool.
acquisition of hsf logistics group
an acquisition of hsf logistics group, a leading cold chain 
logistics provider, was announced in january 2021. the 
acquisition is aligned with dfds’ win23 strategy of growing 
solutions to selected industries, including cold chain 
logistics customers. 
hsf logistics group is a full-service provider of 
cold chain logistics solutions to the food industry with 
a specialist focus on meat logistics. services include collec-
tion from food producers, packaging, storage, processing 
services, and distribution of both part and full loads. 
the company operates from 22 locations across europe, 
including key distribution and storage centres in the neth-
erlands, germany, and denmark. in addition, the company 
also has offices in china and morocco.
closing of the transaction is expected to take place 
around 1 may 2020 subject to regulatory approval and 
completion of required employee consultation processes.

dfds extends railway network
during the autumn of 2020, dfds extended its network of 
rail freight routes with a new service between trieste and 
nuremberg. more than half of dfds’ freight ferry volumes 
between turkey and europe is transported by rail from the 
ports of trieste in italy and sète in france. this benefits the 
climate and reduces road traffic.

sustainability  
summary 
the aim of our sustainability strategy is to 
reduce our environmental footprint and ensure 
that employees are safe, healthy, and treated 
equally as we move goods and people across 
sea and land. the two overarching strategies 
environmental footprint and caring employer 
are each supported by three ambitions with 
metrics to measure progress. the strategy is 
aligned with un sustainable development 
goals (sdgs) 3, 5, 13, 14 and 17 due to their 
particular relevance for our business activities. 
these sdgs provide guidance and represent 
global principles for responsible conduct, to 
which we want to be held accountable.

environmental footprint 
we support ocean life, relevant research, and educational 
initiatives. we aim to be a responsible neighbour who 
reduces pollution, waste, and noise in the communities 
in which we operate. our climate action plan also aims 
to  improve air quality. the plan’s targets are to reduce 
relative co² emissions 45% by 2030 and make us climate 
neutral by 2050. 
caring employer 
we strive for a work environment that is safe, healthy, 
diverse, and inclusive, allowing people to thrive and 
contribute. we support our employees’ physical and 
mental health and encourage them to find opportunities 
to give back and do good in the societies where they live 
and work.
governance 
sustainability is integrated in our daily planning and oper-
ations. thorough processes and reporting lines are in place. 
we continually assess risks, analyse, and adjust actions to 
stay on track with our commitments. sustainability is also 
embedded in investment decisions as all investments above 
eur 1m must assess the environmental impact before 
approval. the executive management team (emt) has 
approved the climate action plan and monitors progress on 
a quarterly basis.
our policies provide clear guidance
providing maritime transport and logistics services means 
we are always in close contact with people. it also implies 
that our activities can have an impact on human rights. it is 
a priority for us to respect these rights through clear policies 
protecting people and trade
throughout the pandemic, dfds’ 
ferry routes and road transport 
continued moving freight for 
customers and supply communi-
ties with goods as truck drivers 
could still cross borders. staff 
on ferries, in port terminals and 
warehouses, and driving trucks 
were kept safe by frequent tests, 
work shifts/safe bubbles, focus 
on hygiene, face masks as well as 
frequent campaigns about how to 
stay safe. for employees in offices 
working from home was in periods 
mandatory or recommeded to 
create safe working environments 
and minise risks.

setting emission
targets for our ships
• we are fully committed to the inter-
national maritime organisation (imo)’s 
ghg (greenhouse gases) strategy 
and use “gross tonnage multiplied by 
distance travelled” when reporting on 
ghg emissions performance.  
• based on a 2008 baseline of 17.1 grams 
co² per gt-mile, the 2023 target is set 
at 12.4 grams co² per gt-mile.  
• the 2030 target is set at 9.6 grams co² 
per gt-mile. we are therefore aiming 
for a 45% reduction between 2008 and 
2030.  
• the development from 2008 to 2020 
showed a reduction of 21%. 
• achieving the 2030 target requires a 
29% reduction from 2020 levels.
designed to influence and determine major decisions, 
actions, and activities that fall within their scope. 
to promote full transparency, we voluntarily disclose 
and/or verify our environmental, social and governance 
data to third party systems. a critical part of our commit-
ment is to engage in partnerships to develop solutions 
for the future. these include engagement in industry fora 
and creating industry partnerships and partnerships with 
innovative start-ups.

on selected topics: bringing down emissions, diversity and 
inclusion as well as an overview key esg figures.
taking responsibility for bringing  
down emissions
we have to adopt sustainable fuels based on renewable 
energy to truly transform and deliver. until that is achieved, 
energy efficiency will be a key priority.
in 2020, we finalised our climate action plan. we aim 
to become climate neutral by 2050 and to relatively 
reduce ghg emissions by close to 45% from 2008 to 2030, 
corresponding to a reduction of around 25-35% between 
2019 and 2030. 
96% of co2 emissions from ferries 
in the long term – by 2050 – we aim to replace fossil fuels 
with zero emission fuels like ammonia, hydrogen, or meth-
anol. storing, handling, and use of these new fuels differs 
vastly from how fossil fuel works. finding feasible alterna-
tives to fossil fuels calls for cross-sector collaboration and 
experiments. the commercial viability of renewable fuels 
is still held back by numerous uncertainties and demand 
depends on price differentials between black and green 
energy, availability, bunker infrastructure, and regulations. 
closing the price gap between fossil and renewable fuels 
will be critical to driving the adoption, construction, and 
use of zero emission ferries. we openly share information 
about which sustainable fuels we are investigating and the 
estimated volumes required to fuel a business of our size. 
we pursue new knowledge and partnerships to help 
qualify our strategic decisions on future infrastructure and 
business models for carbon neutral transportation. we 
engage in industry fora and open innovation initiatives to 
discover technologies and synergies that will help drive 
down the cost of renewables. we prioritise contributing 
to regulation processes and are in close dialogue with 
customers to understand their expectations.
2030: short term plan
the short-term plan for reducing emissions is based on 
analysis of how we operate today and areas with the 
greatest potential for improvement. to reach the 2030 
targets, necessary actions have been identified such as fleet 
replacement and environmental upgrading, optimising the 
vessels’ hydro-dynamic performance to reduce friction in the 
water and improving decision support systems to help crews 
and shore-side support teams operate in a more fuel-efficient 
way, continuous improvements to energy consumption, 
actively engaging in developing and testing new means 
of propulsion and energy generation, and participating in 
testing low carbon fuels such as biofuels. we currently run 
around 29 projects that aim to reduce co2 emissions from 
our existing fleet. combined, this will result in a relative 
reduction in emissions of roughly 45% from 2008 to 2030.

testing biofuels based on leftover nutshells
in 2019, we invested in mash energy. this start-up is 
developing a method to produce commercially viable 
biofuel from agricultural waste. in 2021, we aim to test 
mash energy’s b11 biofuel based on agricultural waste on 
a passenger ferry. testing can help create realistic alterna-
tives and supplements to fossil fuels. 
upgrading our road fleet to cut emissions
we invest in trucks with the highest possible euro class 
engines to reduce exhaust emissions and ensure optimal 
safety and efficiency. 95% of our trucks are now euro 5 or 
6-certified. these vehicles effectively reduce harmful gas 
emissions, are fuel-efficient, and equipped with high-quality 
communication systems. 
biofuel is used in almost all swedish logistics locations. 
in 2021, fuel additives will be tested in a research set-up 
to confirm fuel efficiency benefits and a lower emission per 
kilometre. if the test results are positive, it is planned to 
scale up the testing to a section of the fleet.
diversity and inclusion
bringing together people with a variety of backgrounds and 
expertise can create a culture that acknowledges  different 
points of view preventing decision-making based on habits 
and unconscious bias.
we have a target of a minimum of 30% minority 
representation by 2023. our performance measurement 
focuses on improvements in gender diversity, as it is the 
only area in which we collect data. however, to secure a 
workforce that is truly diverse, minority representation also 
relates to race, ethnic background, religion, sexual orienta-
tion, age, level of education and socioeconomic status. 
gender diversity in dfds
the maritime and logistics industries are traditionally 
associated with male attributes and continue to be so 
today, particularly at sea. both at sea and on land the 
share of women in our company declined this year. this 
was due to the adaptation of the organisation to covid-19. 
the passenger business unit, which employs the highest 
proportion of women in dfds, was heavily impacted by 
furloughing and layoffs. 
on our ferries in general, the share of women is 15%. 
in management the number is 7%, above the industry 
average. in 2020, we signed the charter for more women in 
shipping, committing ourselves to focus on gender equality. 
an internal task force is currently exploring how we can 
make our industry attractive to a more diverse audience.
as of 2020, 27% of staff on land and 29% of managers 
are women. this is close to the target of 30% by 2023. 
achieving gender diversity remains a priority as women are 
still underrepresented in many areas. for instance in senior 
management, where only 16% of employees are women. 
diversity and inclusion is a top priority and an integral 
aspect in hiring, hr processes, and management’s operating 
procedures. senior management is heading this agenda 
by setting their own pledges. local hr has a structured 
follow-up process in place  with local managers to ensure 
continued awareness and results. we facilitate internal 
diversity community forums, sharing challenges, best 
practice, and good ideas.

preparing for clean fuels
dfds’ climate action plan aims to reduce emissions by 
45% in 2030 and achieve full climate neutrality in 2050. 
in partnership with danish companies, a hydrogen factory 
outside copenhagen is being developed. we are also 
testing a program for hydrogen fuel cells to supply power 
on board the freight ferry ark germania, and designing a 
hydrogen fuel cell powered passenger ferry for possibly 
the oslo–frederikshavn–copenhagen route. the great thing 
about hydrogen fuel cells is that they emit only water.

risk factors
general and specific operational risks
economic risks from lower demand
changes in economic activity that lead to changes in the 
volume of the trade of goods and passengers can cause 
major fluctuations in earnings as volumes are a key earn-
ings driver for both the freight and passenger activities.
risks are higher for the ferry activities, both freight and 
passenger, than for the logistics activities. the difference 
in risk profile is due to a high share of fixed costs in ferry 
operations as opposed to a high share of variable costs in 
logistics operations as the majority of haulage and other 
transport services are subcontracted to external carriers. 
this entails more flexibility to adapt activities to changes 
in demand.
the demand for freight and passenger ferry services is 
reflected in volumes and pricing, which in turn are linked 
to the general level of demand in the countries and regions 
that dfds operate routes between. general demand levels 
are most often determined by changes in macroeconomic 
variables such as consumption. demand can however also

integral part of dfds’ 
management processes 
risks and opportunities 
are regularly reviewed 
and reported to the 
board of directors for 
appropriate responses 
and actions
be impacted by virus outbreaks or other exceptional events 
that can lead to significantly lower economic activity due 
to, for example, travel and other restrictions in people’s 
usual activities. the scope of such exceptional events can 
be both regional and global. changes in economic variables 
such as exchange rates can also impact demand.
decreases in demand can lead to overcapacity on 
ferry routes and lower earnings. this can be remedied by 
reducing the frequency of departures, replacing incumbent 
ferries with smaller ferries,  removing a ferry from a route 
or laying up a ferry, and ultimately by route closure. 
overcapacity also tends to increase price pressure which 
can also reduce earnings. 
partly in order to counteract cyclical demand risk, part 
of the freight fleet is chartered to enhance flexibility. dfds 
aims to charter a share of the fleet on contracts of shorter 
duration with options for extension to provide opportuni-
ties for redelivery of ferries at a few months’ notice.
the four passenger ferries in the fleet are 100% owned 
which limits the options for adapting capacity in the short 
term. dfds’ container activities mainly operate through

the ferry activities, both 
freight and passenger, 
than for the logistics 
activities

vessel sharing and slot charter agreements with container 
shipping companies which provides flexibility. to a large 
extent, the logistics activities lease equipment.
dfds’ geographic diversification across northern europe, 
the mediterranean as well as parts of eastern europe and 
adjacent countries reduces dependence on individual 
markets. in addition, the large and diversified route 
network provides opportunities to reallocate ferry capacity 
among routes.
freight and passenger ferry markets can, moreover, be 
impacted by changes in market conditions of competing 
transport modes such as road, rail and air – the latter 
mainly impacts the passenger sector.
in addition, markets are impacted by changes in local 
and regional competition, such as the opening or closing 
of competing routes and capacity increases on existing 
competing routes. on a few routes, a significant proportion 
of freight volumes are derived from a single customer. 
risks inherent in such customer relationships are mitigated 
by multiple-year customer agreements that also reflect 
investment requirements to service such agreements.
the ferry charter market and newbuildings
dfds charters mainly freight ferries for varying periods. 
such charters are subject to price fluctuations (charter 
rates) and to risks concerning availability of ferries that fit 
route requirements. similar risks, including counterparty 
risks, are relevant when chartering out excess capacity. 
in addition, there is a price risk related to the timing 
of acquiring or ordering ferries. in connection with the 
ordering of ferries, there is a default risk related to the 
yards constructing the ferries, which can lead to additional 
costs, including delays.

impacted by changes 
in local and regional 
competition, such as 
the opening or closing 
of competing routes 
and capacity increases

due to the ongoing process of replacing and renewing the 
fleet, the sale of ferries or the cancellation of newbuilding 
contracts may result in gains or losses and costs that 
cannot be anticipated in annual profit forecasts.
it takes around two years or more from the time of 
ordering a ferry newbuilding to its delivery. the period 
depends on the complexity of the newbuilding. during such 
a period markets may change significantly and the need for 
additional capacity may have declined. such risks can be 
mitigated by having an option available to redeliver a ferry 
that matches the planned delivery of a newbuilding.
risks associated with business  
development and investments
dfds’ growth strategy entails business development and 
investment risks. this is related to both organic growth 
from investment in ferries and growth driven by the 
opening of new ferry routes, new logistics activities, acqui-
sition of companies and activities. the most pervasive risk 
associated with organic growth is related to the expansion 
of capacity on a route by deployment of larger ferries.
the acquisition of companies and activities involves 
significant risks that are linked to the size of the invest-
ment and the complexity of a subsequent integration 
process. risks associated with business development 
ventures are managed by thorough planning and deci-
sion-making processes governed by internal policies and 
guidelines for investment decisions, including a required 
rate of return on investments.
operational, security and environmental risks
the main operational risks are associated with ferries and 
other ships, port terminals as well as road and rail transport 
of freight. technical incidents and accidents may lead to 
physical harm to employees and employees of business 
partners, unplanned periods in dock for ships, interruption 
of sailing schedules, and loss of revenue. replacement 
tonnage can usually be deployed at short notice through 
chartering. in order to minimise operational risks, dfds has 
a systematic and comprehensive maintenance programme 
in place for the fleet, including regular docking schedules. in 
addition, extreme weather conditions can cause delays and 
cancellations, and strikes in ports can also disrupt services.
in the course of ordinary operations, dfds deploys freight 
and passenger ferries, port terminals, warehouses and 
cargo-carrying equipment, all of which are subject to the 
usual safety risks associated with such equipment. these 
risks are controlled and minimised partly through compli-
ance with safety requirements and routines, as well as 
preventative work, and partly through insurance against risk.
more information on health and safety is available from 
www.dfds.com/group/about/responsibility.
environmental and safety measures are based on 
dfds’ environmental and safety policies, as well as rules 
and regulations and customer requirements. changes in 
these factors can increase costs. the group is insured 
against personal injury and environmental risks in line 
with industry standards, and participates in preparatory 
legislative procedures through industry organisations.
it is widely acknowledged that the climate is changing. 
this is increasing climate risks, for example more volatile 
weather such as storms or floodings. in particular for dfds, 
ferry operations are exposed to strong winds and other 
weather phenomena that can lead to cancellation of depar-
tures and entail loss of revenue and/or extra costs. such 
impacts could rise in the future if weather patterns become 
more volatile. further legislation to mitigate or reduce 
harmful impacts on the environment could be adopted in 
the future. this could include costs in the form of taxes or 
duties as well as limitations on activities that could have 
negative financial impacts.
the eu is expected to propose the martime industry is 
included in ets (european emissions scheme) in the first half 
of 2021 with effect from 2022 or 2023. introduction of such 
a scheme would entail that part or all of dfds’ emission 
of co2 from ferries is subject to this system. a number of 
elements regarding implementation need to be clarified such 
as scope, free allowances, baselines and financial implica-
tions. it is therefore not yet possible to assess the potential 
consequences of ets for dfds and our stakeholders.
the ambition of dfds’ climate action plan is to become 
climate neutral in 2050. this may entail considerable 
changes in the fleet as fossil fuel based technology is 
replaced with sustainable technology. at some point in this 
process, ferries using fossil fuels could become obsolete. 
due to freight ferries’ estimated lifetime of around 35 
years and 45 years for passenger cruise ferries, it is envis-
aged that the replacement process will be gradual over the 
next thirty years, also bearing in mind that it requires 1-3 
years to build a new ferry.
digital and technology disruption
new digital business models or platforms are emerging 
within the transport and logistics industry. such platforms 
primarily seek to digitise the intermediary role between 
manufacturers and end users that today is managed by 
freight forwarders and transport service providers. to 
compete with such platforms, dfds is developing digital 
solutions for freight customers and monitoring changes 
in order to minimise 
operational risks, 
dfds has a systematic 
and comprehensive

in the business environment closely in order to protect 
activities and pursue business development opportunities.
platforms for booking of ferry trips by consumers are 
available today. commissions are paid to such platforms 
for bookings. to compete with such platforms, dfds is 
further developing digital solutions for passenger bookings 
and monitoring changes in the business environment 
closely in order to protect activities and pursue business 
development opportunities.
there are no perceived imminent digital threats related 
to ferry route and logistics operations as such. in the longer 
term, dfds’ current business model could be disrupted 
by new, evolving technologies for autonomous vehicles, 
vessels and terminals, as well as artificial intelligence (ai), 
internet of things (iot) and automation.
dfds has in recent years invested in in-house capabilities 
in such technologies, partly to monitor and counter risks 
posed by such new technologies and business models, and 
partly to be able to develop own solutions based on such 
technologies to pursue possible business opportunities.
it risks
disruptions to critical systems through breakdowns or virus 
and other cyberattacks can have a significant negative 
impact on commercial operations and thereby earnings. the 
scope of such risks is reduced by increasing investments in 
cyber security measures, constant monitoring of systems, 
installation of back-up systems and having proven proce-
dures in place to restore functionality of systems.
information security risks are related to the handling of 
data for passengers and freight customers. such risks are 
mitigated by internal controls and adherence to rules and 
regulations governing information security.
political and legal risks
dfds’ activities are impacted by changes in rules and regu-
lations governing the ferry, shipping and transport sectors, 
as well as changes in conditions that impact infrastruc-
tures in europe and turkey. in addition to political bodies, 
dfds is subject to international maritime organization 
(imo) conventions. the imo is the un body responsible for 
maritime issues, primarily safety and environment.
changes in the above rules and regulations can have 
negative financial consequences, including higher costs 
and entail changes in the travel patterns of passengers and 
routing of freight, including the distribution of volumes 
between sea and land transport.
the eu and the uk entered into a new trade agreement 
in december 2020 with effect from 1 january 2021. as the 
deal was finalised just days before its implementation, all 
parties involved in trading between the eu and the uk have 
experienced a number of issues with application of the new 
rules. it is too early to assess how the new agreement will 
impact trading volumes between the eu and the uk. there 
is a risk that the new rules will reduce volumes, including 
reassessment and relocation of supply chains by manufac-
turing and other companies.
the new trade agreement entails additional paperwork 
and border inspections. dfds has therefore established a 
full service customs clearance offering to customers and 
income from this enterprise may mitigate possible adverse 
impacts of the trade agreement. in addition, duty-free sales 
have resumed on passenger ferry routes and this may also 
provide some mitigation.  
other possible changes concern taxation arrangements

bunker consumption is commercially hedged in ‘normal’ 
years through bunker clauses (baf: bunker adjustment 
factor) in freight customer contracts. hedging of usd is 
included in the baf. the baf-coverage lags the actual cost 
by 1-2 months as the surcharge is adjusted on a monthly 
basis through the year. the remaining consumption is 
consumed on passenger routes and financially hedged as 
deemed appropriate. 
in 2021, the consumption of bunker by the ferry fleet 
is expected to amount to around 750,000 tons. part of 
the bunker consumption on passenger routes is financially 
hedged. a price change of 10% compared to the price level 
at year-end 2020 is expected to impact operating profit by 
around dkk 5.1m in 2021.

the dfds share
and shareholders
share capital
dfds has one class of shares. the share capital at the end 
of 2020 was dkk 1,173m comprising 58,631,578 shares, 
each with a nominal value of dkk 20. there were no 
changes to the share capital during 2020. 
stock exchange trading
the dfds share is listed on nasdaq copenhagen where 
32.9m dfds shares were traded in 2020 equal to an annual 
turnover of dkk 7.0bn compared to dkk 7.6bn in 2019. 
the average number of trades per day was 1,196 compared 
to 1,145 in 2019 and the average daily turnover was dkk 
28m compared to dkk 30m in 2019. the dfds share is part 
of the large cap index.
share price development and yield
dfds’ share price was dkk 275 at year-end 2020, a decrease 
of 15% compared to year-end 2019. the market value at 
the end of 2020 was dkk 15.8bn, excluding treasury shares. 
by comparison, the danish stock market’s all-share index 
increased 29% in 2020.
share price decreased
15% in 2020
dividend cancelled due  
to negative impact  
of covid-19
the divergence in the development between the dfds share 
and the all-share index was, among other things, due to the 
significant negative impact of covid-19 on the passenger 
ferry market that dfds is part of. 
the total distribution yield on the dfds share was 0% in 
2020 as no capital was distributed to shareholders due to the 
extraordinary negative impact of covid-19 on earnings in 2020.
distribution policy
the starting point for determining the level of capital distri-
bution to shareholders is the current and expected future 
financial leverage measured as the ratio between nibd and 
ebitda. target leverage is a ratio between 2.0 and 3.0. nibd/
ebitda was 4.2 at the end of 2020.
it is preferred to pay dividend semi-annually to facilitate 
a faster return of capital to shareholders and to align 
payments with dfds’ seasonal cash flow that peaks during 
the third quarter, the high season for passenger travel.
capital is distributed through dividend and share 
buybacks. the latter instrument is preferred for distribution 
of excess capital while dividend is preferred to be ongoing

and sustainable. whether capital is excess is assessed based 
on the leverage target and future investment requirements.
distribution to shareholders in 2020
due to the extraordinary negative impact on earnings in 2020 
from covid-19, it became necessary to safeguard the financial 
position. it was therefore decided by the annual general meeting 
(agm) that no dividend was paid in 2020.
dividend proposal
the board of directors proposes to the 2021 agm that no 
dividends are paid in 2021 due to the continued safeguarding 
of the financial position. the financial leverage is, all else 
being equal, expected to decrease during 2021. 
shareholders
at the end of 2020, dfds had 22,152 registered shareholders 
who owned 95% of the share capital. international share-
holders owned 30% (2019: 34%) of the total registered share 
capital. the lauritzen foundation was the largest shareholder 
with a holding of 42% of the total share capital at the end of 
2020 compared to 41% at the end of 2019.
investor relations
the aim of investor relations (ir) is to facilitate an ongoing 
dialogue with the financial community, primarily institutional 
investors and analysts. key events during the year are quarterly 
reports, conference calls and roadshows to present strategic and 
financial results. in addition, management and ir participate at 
investor conferences, roadshows and meetings with investors 
and analysts in between quarters. due to covid-19, roadshows 
and meetings were mostly virtual in 2020. there is a silent 
period of four weeks prior to the release of quarterly reports.
dfds is currently covered by six equity analysts. reports on this link, 
investor presentations and a range of other information are available.

financial review
reporting structure
dfds’ activities are organised in two divisions: ferry 
division operates five business units and logistics division 
operates three business units. group non-allocated items 
consist of corporate costs not allocated to either division. 
each division also has non-allocated items which mainly 
include external charter activities in ferry division and an 
equipment pool in logistics division. 
revenue
reported revenue decreased 15.8% to dkk 13,971m in 
2020. the decrease was due to the outbreak of covid-19 
that from mid-march reduced travel as restrictions were 
introduced. moreover, the initial lockdowns that were 
applied reduced manufacturing and other activity which 
led to a drop in the demand for freight services.
these events were also the main driver of a 20.7% or
dkk 2.5bn decrease in ferry division’s revenue to
dkk 9,678m. the decrease in passenger revenue was
dkk 1.7bn spread across three business units: passenger, 
channel and baltic sea. the remaining decrease of
investments of dkk 1.6bn
included dkk 0.9bn for
newbuildings
year ended with strong 
financial position
covid-19 travel restrictions 
lowered revenue 16%
to dkk 14.0bn
drop in passenger earnings 
decreased ebitda 25%
to dkk 2.7bn 
freight earnings resilient
dkk 0.8bn was thus related to freight revenue. half of 
the decrease was due to lower revenue bunker surcharges 
following a declining oil price. the other half was due to 
the lower activity in q2 caused by the covid-19 lockdowns. 
the negative impact on freight revenue was most severe 
in the mediterranean and north sea business units that 
have a large share of automotive customers as this sector 
temporarily closed manufacturing plants.
logistics division’s revenue declined only 0.9% to
dkk 5,069m as a negative impact from covid-19, also 
mainly in q2, was offset by revenue from two acquisitions 
made in december 2019, one in finland and one in the 
netherlands. the finnish company was added to the nordic 
business unit and the dutch company was added to the 
continent business unit. in may 2020, a smaller uk seafood 
distribution company was acquired and added to the uk & 
ireland business unit.  
in q4 2020, freight revenue in both divisions increased 
by a surge in volumes from stockbuilding in uk ahead of 
brexit.

ebitda before special items
operating profit before depreciation, ebitda, and special 
items decreased 25% to dkk 2,732m.
ferry division’s ebitda decreased 28% or dkk 922m to 
dkk 2,332m as passenger earnings across three business 
units dropped dkk 1,029m in 2020. freight earnings thus 
ended the year above 2019 as particularly earnings in q4 
2020 offset the negative impact from covid-19 on earnings 
in q2 2020. the increase in freight earnings was driven by 
the mediterranean and channel business units as the latter 
benefited from the uk stockbuilding ahead of brexit.
logistics’ ebitda increased 5% to dkk 445m mainly 
driven by a positive full-year impact from the addition of 
two acquired companies that both performed in line with 
expectations set before covid-19. this helped the nordic 
and continent business units in total to increase ebitda 
compared to 2019 as the recurring activities overall were 
negatively impacted by covid-19, for example by a slow-
down in the automotive industry. uk & ireland performed 
just above 2019 as good performance in parts of the 
business unit was offset by negative impacts from covid-
19, for example on the uk catering sector. in addition, a 
provision of dkk 10m was made at the end of the year 
related to a cold chain warehouse.
the group cost of non-allocated items increased to 
dkk -45m from dkk -42m in 2019.
depreciation, impairment and ebit
total depreciation and impairment decreased 1% to
dkk 1,873m. depreciation was mainly lowered by the rede-
livery of four chartered freight ferries that were capitalised 
and depreciated according to ifrs 16. the chartered ferries 
were replaced by fewer and larger owned freight ferries. 
the net effect was a decrease in depreciation.
the group’s ebit before special items decreased 51%  
to dkk 858m.
special items and ebit
special items in 2020 was a net cost of dkk 117m. the 
two largest cost items was dkk 102m related to adap-
tation of the organisation to the effects of covid-19 and 
an impairment of dkk 100m related to the oslo-fred-
erikshavn-copenhagen route. these items were partly 
offset by an accounting gain of dkk 110m on the sale of a 
combined freight and passenger ferry. more information on 
special items is available in note 2.6 on page 76.
the group’s ebit after special items was dkk 741m, a 
decrease of 55%.
financing
the net cost of financing decreased 1% to dkk 275m 
compared to 2019. there was a positive variance on 
currency adjustments of dkk 17m while the net interest 
cost increased dkk 13m. the latter was among other 
things negatively impacted by costs related to a temporary 
waiver of loan covenants.
tax and the annual result
the ferry activities of the dfds group are covered by 
tonnage tax schemes in denmark, norway, the netherlands, 
lithuania, france, and turkey. the tax on the annual profit 
amounted to a total cost of dkk 24m. this included a tax 
cost of dkk 48m for the year and an adjustment to prior 
years that was a net income of dkk 24m.
the net annual result was dkk 442m, a decrease of 
66% compared to 2019.

investments
net investments in 2020 amounted to dkk 1,618m.  
this included dkk 1,422m of ship investments of which
dkk 906m was used for ferry newbuildings, delivered and 
on order, dkk 363m for upgrades and dockings and
dkk 153m for scrubbers. the cash flow from sale of ships 
was positive by dkk 202m from the sale of a combined 
freight and passenger ferry. the remaining investments of 
dkk 398m were mainly related to port terminals, cargo 
carrying equipment, software and other items.
assets, invested capital and return
total assets amounted to dkk 27.0bn at the end of the 
year which was on level with 2019. 
 
net working capital was dkk 132m at the end of 2020 
compared to dkk 417m at the end of 2019. net working 
capital was decreased in both divisions with the largest 
decrease achieved in the mediterranean business unit as 
trade receivables from a major customer were reduced.
at year-end 2020, the invested capital had decreased 
2% to dkk 22.1bn from year-end 2019 mainly due to a 
reduction of the working capital and fewer leased assets. 
the former was partly reduced by extended payment 
terms on vat and taxes related to covid-19 compensation 
programs. a focused effort on collection of outstanding 
accounts receivable also reduced the working capital. 
calculated as an average, the invested capital increased 
8% to dkk 22.5bn in 2020.
in 2020, the return on invested capital, roic, was 3.0% 
and 3.5% adjusted for special items.

corporate governance 
summary
board of directors
the board of directors is made up of six directors 
appointed by the annual general meeting of shareholders, 
elected for a period of one year, as well as three directors 
appointed by employees, elected for a period of four years.
five of the six directors appointed by shareholders at 
the most recent ordinary meeting are deemed independent 
according to the danish recommendations on good 
corporate governance. two of the six appointed directors 
are women.
the board of directors work in accordance with the 
company’s articles of association, the rules of procedure 
of the board of directors as well as an established annual 
cycle of focus areas to ensure that all major governance 
aspects are reviewed at least once annually.
the chair of the board of directors undertakes an annual 
review of the performance of the board of directors, most 
recently with third party assistance. the composition of the 
board of directors aims to ensure that competencies that 
are key to the company’s performance are represented. ten 
board meetings were held in 2020.

dfds annual report 2020
in preparing the annual report, dfds focuses on ensuring 
that the content is relevant to the reader and that the 
presentation is clear. 
the purpose is to provide an overview of what drives 
performance. the structure of the notes reflects dfds’ fi-
nancial performance goal, roic, and the structure aims at 
providing an enhanced understanding of each accounting 
area by describing relevant accounting policies and any 
significant accounting estimates and assessments related 
thereto at the end of each note. 
the accounting policies have been made within the frame-
work of the prevailing international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu. the actual text of 
the standard is not repeated in the notes. the description 
of accounting policies in the notes forms part of the overall 
description of dfds’ accounting policies. 
basis of reporting
the 2020 consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements of dfds a/s have been pre-
pared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the 
ifrs as adopted by the eu, and additional danish disclosure 
requirements for listed companies. the consolidated finan-
cial statements are also in accordance with ifrs as issued 
by the international accounting standards board (iasb). 
the outbreak of covid-19 and brexit is not expected to have 
impact on dfds’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
during the first half of 2020 covid-19 had negative impact 
on passenger as well freight activities. in the second half 
of 2020 the negative impact continued for the passenger 
activities due to travel restrictions whereas the freight ac-
tivities recovered to levels before covid-19. 
brexit did not impact the financial statement negatively 
for 2020.
on 23 february 2021, the board of directors and the ex-
ecutive management board considered and approved the 
2020 annual report of dfds a/s. the annual report will 
be presented to the shareholders of dfds a/s for approval 
at the ordinary annual general meeting on 23 march 2021.
basis for preparation
the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner (dkk) which is the parent company’s functional 
currency.
the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements are prepared according 
to the historical cost convention except that derivatives 
and financial instruments classified as “fair value through 
profit loss” (fvtpl) are measured at fair value.
assets classified as held for sale are measured at the low-
er of the carrying amount before the changed presentation 
and the fair value less costs to sell.
the accounting policies, set out below and in the notes, 
have been used consistently in respect of the financial 
year and to comparative figures.
rounding
in general, rounding may cause variances in sums and per-
centages in the annual report.
new international financial reporting standards and inter-
pretations
in 2020, the group has adopted all relevant new and up-
dated accounting standards.
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
the iasb has issued a number of new or amended stand-
ards and interpretations with effective date post 31 de-
cember 2020, some of which have not yet been endorsed 
by the eu. the new and amended standards and interpre-
tations are not mandatory for the financial reporting for 
2020. the group expects to adopt the standards and inter-
pretations when they become mandatory.
none of the standards and interpretations are expected 
to have a significant impact on recognition and measure-
ment.  
application of materiality and relevance
dfds’ annual report is based on the concept of materiality 
and relevance to ensure that the content is material and 
relevant to the user. this objective is pursued by providing 
relevant rather than generic descriptions and information.
when assessing materiality and relevance, due consid-
eration is given to ensure compliance with applicable 
accounting legislation etc. and to ensure that the consol-
idated financial statements and parent company finan-
cial statements give a true and fair view of the group’s 
and the parent company’s financial position at the bal-
ance sheet date and the operations and cash flows for the 
financial year.
the consolidated financial statements and the parent 
company financial statements consist of many trans-
actions. these transactions are aggregated into classes 
according to their nature or function and presented in 
classes of similar items in the financial statements and 
in the notes as required by ifrs. if items are individually 
immaterial they are aggregated with other items of similar 
nature in the statements or in the notes. the disclosure 
requirements throughout ifrs are substantial and dfds 
provides these specific disclosures required by ifrs unless 
the information is considered immaterial to the econom-
ic decision-making of the users of these financial state-
ments or not relevant for the group.
subtotals and alternative performance measures
in the annual report dfds presents certain financial per-
formance measures such as subtotals and key figures 
which are not required or defined under ifrs. it is consid-
ered that these alternative measures provide relevant 
supplementary information for the stakeholders of dfds.
significant income and expenses which dfds assesses 
not to be directly attributable to the operating activities 
or which are considered non-recurring are presented in the 
income statement in a separate line item labelled ‘special 
items’ in order to distinguish these items from other in-
come statement items. reference is made to note 2.6 for 
more details on special items. the income statement in-
cludes the subtotals ‘operating profit before depreciation 
(ebitda) and special items’ and ‘operating profit (ebit) be-
fore special items’ as these are assessed to provide a more 
transparent and comparable view of dfds’ recurring oper-
ating profit. in note 2.6 it is disclosed how the line items in 
the income statement would have been affected if ‘special 
items’ had not been presented in a separate line item. 
for definitions of key figures please refer to the section 
‘definitions’.
significant accounting policies
management considers the accounting policies for the 
following areas as the most important for the group: con-
solidated financial statements; business combinations; 
non-current intangible assets; ferries and other ships; 
pension and jubilee liabilities; deferred tax assets; right-
of-use assets; derivatives; special items; provisions and 
contingencies. accounting policies for basis of consolida-
tion, non-controlling interests and translation of foreign 
currencies are described below, while accounting policies 
for the remaining areas are included in the notes to which 
they relate.
significant estimates
in the preparation of the consolidated financial state-
ments, management undertakes several accounting es-
timates and assessments and makes assumptions which 
provide the basis for recognition and measurement of the 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the group 
and the parent company. these estimates assessments, 
and assumptions are based on historical experience and 
other factors such as covid-19 and brexit which the man-
agement considers reasonable under the circumstances, 
but which by their nature are uncertain and unpredictable. 
the assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and un-
anticipated events or circumstances may occur, for which 
reason the actual results may deviate from the applied 
estimates, assessments, and assumptions. 
in the opinion of management, the following accounting es-
timates and assessments are significant in the preparation 
of the annual report: impairment testing of goodwill and 
other non-current intangible assets; impairment testing of 
ferries and other ships including the assessment of use-
ful life and scrap value; purchase price allocation in con-
nection with acquisitions; pension and jubilee liabilities; 
deferred tax assets; leasing arrangements; derivatives; 
provisions and contingencies.

descriptions of the significant accounting estimates and 
assessments are included in the notes to which they relate.
description of accounting policies
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements includes the par-
ent company dfds a/s and the subsidiaries in which the 
parent company controls the financial and operational 
policies. control is obtained when the company directly 
or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights in 
the enterprise (i.e. subsidiary) or if it, in some other way, 
controls the enterprise. the parent company and these 
subsidiaries are referred to as the group.
enterprises, which are not subsidiaries, over which the 
group exercises significant influence, but which it does 
not control, are considered associates. significant influ-
ence is generally obtained by direct or indirect ownership 
or control of more than 20% of the voting rights but less 
than 50%.
enterprises which according to agreement are controlled 
together with one or more other companies are considered 
joint ventures. 
the consolidated financial statements are based on the 
parent company and the subsidiaries and are prepared 
by combining items of a uniform nature and eliminating 
inter-company transactions, shareholdings, balances, and 
inter-company gains and losses. the consolidated finan-
cial statements are prepared by applying the group’s ac-
counting policies.
investments in subsidiaries are eliminated against the pro-
portionate share of the subsidiaries’ net asset value at the 
acquisition date.
the group’s investments in associates and joint ventures 
are recognised in the consolidated financial statements 
at the group’s proportionate share of the associate’s / joint 
venture’s net asset value. unrealised intercompany gains 
and losses from transactions with associates and joint 
ventures are eliminated by the group’s interest in the re-
spective associate/jointly controlled enterprise.
non-controlling interests
in the consolidated financial statements, the individual 
financial line items of subsidiaries are recognised in full. 
the non-controlling interests’ share of the results for the 
year and of the equity of subsidiaries which are not whol-
ly-owned are included in the group’s results and equity, 
respectively, but are presented separately in the proposed 
profit appropriation and the statement of changes in eq-
uity. if a non-controlling interest has a put option to sell 
its ownership interest to dfds, the fair value of the put 
option is recognised as an interest-bearing liability which 
means that the results for the year and equity attributable 
to non-controlling interests are not presented separately 
in the proposed profit appropriation and the statement of 
changes in equity.
government grants
grants from the government are recognised at their fair 
value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 
grant will be received and the group will comply with all 
attached conditions. government grants relating to costs 
are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the peri-
od necessary to match them with the costs that they are 
intended to compensate.
translation of foreign currencies
functional and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of each of the 
group’s enterprises are measured using the functional 
currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the enterprise operates. the consolidated financial state-
ments are presented in danish kroner (dkk).
translation of transactions and balances
on initial recognition, foreign currency transactions are 
translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of transaction. currency gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of these transac-
tions as well as from the translation at year-end exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement 
as financial income or cost except when deferred in equity 
as qualifying for cash flow hedges.
currency gains and losses on non-monetary items recog-
nised at fair value, such as securities measured at fvtpl, 
are recognised in the same line item as the fair value gain 
or loss.
non-current assets acquired in foreign currency are trans-
lated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of acquisi-
tion. gains and losses on hedges relating to the acquisition 
of non-current assets are recognised as part of the value of 
the non-current asset at its initial recognition.
translation of subsidiaries
in the consolidated financial statements, the income 
statement items of subsidiaries with a functional currency 
different from dkk are translated at the average exchange 
rate, while the balance sheet items are translated at the 
exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
foreign exchange differences arising on translation of such 
subsidiaries’ equity at the beginning of the reporting peri-
od to the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period 
and on translation of the income statements from average 
exchange rates to the exchange rates at the end of the 
reporting period are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and attributed to a separate translation reserve 
under equity. the exchange rate adjustment is allocated 
between the parent company’s and the non-controlling in-
terests’ shares of equity.
when disposing of 100%-owned foreign enterprises, ex-
change differences which have accumulated in equity via 
other comprehensive income, and which are attributable 
to the enterprise, are transferred from other comprehen-
sive income to the income statement together with any 
gains or losses associated with the disposal.
report under the esef regulation
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 
on the european single electronic format (esef regula-
tion) has introduced a single electronic reporting format 
for the annual financial reports of issuers with securities 
listed on the eu regulated markets. the group’s ixbrl tags 
have been prepared in accordance with the esef taxono-
my, which is included in the esef regulation and devel-
oped based on the ifrs taxonomy published by the ifrs 
foundation. the annual report submitted to the danish 
financial supervisory authority (the officially appointed 
mechanism) consists of the xhtml document together 
with the technical files, all of which are included in the zip 
file dfds-2020-12-31.zip.
key figures
key figures are calculated in accordance with the latest 
version of the danish finance society’s guidelines, ‘recom-
mendations and financial ratios’. the key figures stated 
in the overview with consolidated financial highlights are 
defined on the ‘definitions and glossary’ page.

(section 2)
1)  corporate income tax is 
calculated for each entity 
within the group following the 
tax legislation and current tax 
rate in each tax jurisdiction. 
the amount for each entity 
is then adjusted by the tax 
effect from financial items 
calculated following the tax 
legislation and current tax 
rate in each tax jurisdiction to 
get corporate income tax on 
ebit. the amounts per entity 
are then consolidated.
2)  the decrease in roic com-
pared to 2019 is primarily 
related to a decrease in net 
operating profit after tax 
(nopat) as a consequence of 
the covid-19 situation.
return on invested capital (roic) is a strategic key 
ratio to dfds when measuring the financial perfor-
mance of our business. dfds’ minimum return target 
goal is a roic of at least 8.0%. the financial ambi-
tion of win23 is to reach a return on invested capital 
(roic) of 10% in 2023.
this section provides the notes of the main compo-
nents that forms the basis of net operating profit 
after tax (nopat) which is a measure of profit that 
excludes the costs and tax benefit of debt financing 
by measuring the earnings before interest and taxes 
(ebit) adjusted for corporate income tax on ebit.
together with invested capital, nopat forms the 
basis of the roic calculation. reference is made to 
section 3.

2.1 segment information
the segments together with allocation of operating prof-
it, assets and liabilities etc. are identical with the internal 
reporting structure of the group. management has defined 
the groups’ business segments based on the reporting 
regularly presented to the group executive management, 
which also forms the basis for management decisions.
the costs of the segments are the directly registered costs 
including a few systematically allocated indirect costs, 
primarily concerning group functions.
non-allocated costs reflect the general functions which 
cannot reasonably be allocated to the segments. the 
costs consist primarily of costs concerning the executive 
board and board of directors but also group functions 
such as treasury, investor relation,s legal, procurement, 
communication, finance, and depreciation on the group’s 
it-systems etc. in addition, the elimination of transactions 
between segments is included. transactions between seg-
ments are concluded at arm’s length terms.  
segment assets include assets which are directly related 
to the segment such as non-current intangible, non-cur-
rent tangible, other non-current and right-of-use assets, 
inventories, receivables, prepayments, cash in hand and at 
bank. segment liabilities include current and non-current 
liabilities. 
the ferry division’s activities are divided into five business 
areas: north sea, baltic sea, channel, mediterranean, and 
passenger.
ferry division operates ferry routes in and around europe 
transporting freight units, mainly trailers, and passengers. 
the routes deploy a mix of freight ferries, freight and pas-
senger ferries as well as passenger cruise ferries. in addi-
tion, port terminals are owned and/or operated at strate-
gic hubs of the route network. the freight customers are 
mainly forwarders and hauliers as well as manufacturers 
of heavy industrial goods. the main passenger customer 
groups are passengers travelling with own cars, mini cruise 
passengers, tour operators, and business conferences.
the logistics division’s activities are divided into three 
business areas: nordic, continent, and uk & ireland.
logistics division provides transport solutions for full- and 
part loads as well as contract logistics solutions, including 
warehousing. in addition, container ships, including vessel 
sharing agreements with other container operators, are 
operated. the customers are primarily manufacturers of 
industrial goods and consumables as well as retailers.

geographical breakdown
the group does not have a natural geographic split on coun-
tries since the group, mainly ferry division, is based on a 
connected route network in primarily northern europe and 
mediterranean. the routes support each other with sales 
and customer services located in one country whereas the 
actual revenue is created in other countries. consequently, 
it is not possible to present a meaningful split of revenues 
and non-current assets by country. the split is therefore 
presented by the sea and geographical areas in which dfds 
operates. the geographical split of revenue is shown in the 
revenue note. reference is made to note 2.2. 
the applied split results in seven geographical areas: north 
sea, baltic sea, english channel, continent, nordic, uk/ire-
land and mediterranean. as a consequence of the group’s 
business model, the routes do not directly own the ferries, 
but charter the ferries from a group internal vessel pool. 
the ferries are frequently moved within the group’s routes. 
furthermore, certain non-current assets such as it-soft-
ware and headquarter owned corporate assets are for the 
benefit for the entire group. it is therefore not possible to 
meaningfully estimate the exact value of the non-current 
assets per geographical area. instead an adjusted alloca-
tion has been used.

  accounting policies
wages, salaries, social security contributions, pension 
contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bo-
nuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the 
year in which the associated services are rendered by 
employees of the group. where the group provides 
long-term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to 
match the rendering of the services by the respective 
employees.
2.2 revenue (continued)
  accounting policies
revenue from transport of passengers, freight and 
from rendering terminal and warehouse services etc, is 
recognised in the income statement at the time of de-
livery of the service to the customer, which is the time 
where the control is transferred and when each sepa-
rate performance obligation in the customer contract 
is fulfilled following the “over-time principle”. some 
of the ferry and freight transports have a series of 
performance obligations, but as the duration of these 
transports are short term the impact from splitting 
these contracts into “distinct services” will not have 
material impact.   
most transports carried out by the ferry division are 
charaterised by short delivery time (most sailings are 
less than 30 hours while sailings to/from turkey are up 
to 60 hours). transports carried out by logistics divi-
sion can take delivery over a longer period.
revenue from chartering out ferries is recognised 
straightline over the duration of the agreement.
on board sales is recognised at a “point in time”.
revenue is measured at fair value excluding value 
added tax and after deduction of trade discounts.
trade receivables are not adjusted for any financing 
component when recognised. the general credit terms 
are overall short and are following market terms. 
accounting estimates and judgements are made in 
order to determine time of delivery and accrue for rel-
evant income along with evaluation of pricing. these 
accounting estimates and judgements are based on 
experience and historical sales figures along with a 
continuous follow-up on service delivered.

the majority of the ferry activities performed in the dan-
ish, turkish, french, lithuanian, norwegian, and dutch 
enterprises in the group are included in local tonnage tax 
schemes where the taxable income related to transporta-
tion of passengers and freight is calculated based on the 
tonnage deployed during the year and not the actual prof-
its generated. taxable income related to other activities is 
taxed according to the normal corporate income tax rules 
and at the standard corporate tax rates.
in 2020, the group realised an effective tax rate adjusted 
for prior years’ tax of 10.3% (2019: 3.7%) combined and 
32.8% (2019: 51.9%) on income subject to normal corpo-
rate income tax.
addition on acquisition of enterprises relates to the ac-
quisition of colley brothers ltd. in 2020. the movement 
in deferred tax recognised in other comprehensive income 
relates to value adjustments of defined benefit pension 
schemes in uk.
dfds a/s and its danish subsidiaries dfds stevedoring 
a/s and dfds germany aps are subject to compulsory 
joint taxation with lf investment aps and j. lauritzen a/s 
and these two enterprises’ danish controlled enterprises. 
lf investment aps is the administration company in the 
joint taxation and settles all payments of corporation tax 
due by the joint taxed enterprises with the tax authorities. 
in accordance with the danish rules on joint taxation, dfds 
a/s, dfds stevedoring a/s and dfds germany aps are li-
able for their own corporate tax due and are only subsid-
iary and pro rata liable for the corporation tax liabilities 
towards the danish tax authorities for all other enterprises 
that are part of the danish joint taxation.

it has been assessed that the losses cannot be utilised in 
the foreseeable future.
the majority of the ferry activities performed in the dan-
ish, turkish, french, lithuanian, norwegian and dutch en-
terprises in the group are included in local tonnage tax 
schemes. if the companies under tonnage taxation with-
draw from the tonnage taxation schemes, a deferred tax 
liability in the amount of maximum dkk 786m may be 
recognised (2019: dkk 715m).
the companies are not expected to withdraw from the 
scheme and consequently no deferred tax relating to as-
sets and liabilities subject to tonnage taxation has been 
recognised.
  significant accounting estimates and assessments
deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax 
losses carried forward, are recognised to the extent 
that management assesses that the tax asset can be 
utilised through positive taxable income in the fore-
seeable future which usually is within 3-5 years. as-
sessment is performed annually based on forecasts, 
business initiatives and likely structural changes for 
the coming years.
  accounting policies
tax for the year comprises income tax, tonnage tax, 
and joint taxation contribution for the year of dan-
ish subsidiaries as well as changes in deferred tax for 
the year. additionally, the tax for the year comprises 
adjustments to prior years taxes and changes in the 
assessment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. 
the tax for the year is recognised in the income state-
ment or in the equity in correlation to the underlying 
transaction.
the current payable danish corporation tax is allocat-
ed by the settlement of a joint taxation contribution 
between the jointly taxed companies in proportion to 
their taxable income. companies with tax losses re-
ceive joint taxation contributions from companies that 
have been able to utilise the tax losses to reduce their 
own taxable profit.
tax computed on the taxable income and tonnage tax 
for the year is recognised in the balance sheet as tax 
payable or receivable or joint taxation contribution for 
danish companies considering on-account/advance 
payments.
deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the carrying amount 
and the tax base of the assets and liabilities at the re-
porting date. however, deferred tax is not recognised 
on temporary differences relating to non-tax-deduct-
ible goodwill that arose on acquisition date without 
impacting the result or taxable income.
deferred tax relating to assets and liabilities subject 
to tonnage taxation is recognised to the extent that 
deferred tax is expected to crystallise. deferred tax 
assets are recognised for all deductible temporary dif-
ferences and the carry forward of any unused tax loss-
es. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
and the carry forward of unused tax losses, can be uti-
lised in the foreseeable future. the carrying amount is 
reviewed at each reporting date.
deferred tax is measured on the basis of the expected 
use and settlement of the individual assets and liabil-
ities and according to the tax rules and at the known 
tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date when 
the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current 
tax. the change in deferred tax as a result of changes 
in tax rates is recognised in the income statement.
uncertain tax positions are measured, depending on 
the type, either as a probability-weighted average of 
possible outcomes or as the most likely outcome. un-
certain tax positions are recognised either as payable/
receivable tax and/or as deferred tax assets/liabilities.

details about roic.
the following section provides the notes of the main 
components that forms basis of the invested capital 
being non-current intangible, tangible assets and 
right-of-use assets and net working capital being 
net current assets (non interest-bearing current as-
sets minus non interest-bearing current liabilities) 
plus non-current prepaid costs minus pension and 
jubilee liabilities and other provisions.
furthermore, notes that are closely related to the 
non-current intangible, tangible assets and right-of 
use assets such as impairment testing and profit on 
disposal of non-current assets are also included in 
this section.

  accounting policies
non-current intangible assets - other than goodwill
• generally the following applies unless otherwise 
stated:
•  assets are measured at cost less accumulated am-
ortisation and impairment losses.
•  the cost includes costs to external suppliers, ma-
terials and components, direct wages, salaries and 
interests paid as from the time of payment until the 
date when the asset is available for use. 
•  the basis for amortisation is determined as the cost 
less estimated residual value.
• the assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life to the estimated re-
sidual value.
• the effect from changes in amortisation period or 
the residual value is recognised prospectively as a 
change in the accounting estimate.
  accounting policies
goodwill
at initial recognition goodwill is recognised in the bal-
ance sheet at cost, as described in note 5.5 ‘business 
combinations’. subsequently, goodwill is measured at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is 
not amortised.
an impairment test is performed at least once a year 
together with other non-current assets of the group.  
the book value of goodwill is allocated to the group’s 
cash-generating units at the time of acquisition. 
development projects in progress
development projects in progress, primarily develop-
ment of it software, are recognised as non-current in-
tangible assets if the following criteria are met:
•  the projects are clearly defined and identifiable;
• the group intends to use the projects once com-
pleted;
• the future earnings from the projects are expected 
to cover the development and administrative costs; 
and
• the cost can be reliably measured.
the amortisation of capitalised development projects 
starts after the completion of the development pro-
ject and is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful life, which normally is 3-5 years, but 
in certain cases up to 10-15 years (where the latter 
goes for significant internally developed commercial 
and operational systems).
other non-current intangible assets
other non-current intangible assets comprise the 
value of customer relations or similar, identified as 
part of business combinations, and which has definite 
useful life. other non-current intangible assets are 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. amortisation is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which 
normally is 3-5 years, except from customer portfolio 
which is 10 years. 
port concession rights
port concession rights comprise the value of access to 
stategically placed ports which are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date.
acquired port concession rights are amortised over the 
concession period.
software
it software purchased or internally developed is 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.
amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the expected useful life which normally is 5-10 years.

  accounting policies
generally the following applies unless otherwise stated:
• assets are measured at cost less accumulated de-
preciation and impairment losses.
• the cost includes costs to external suppliers, ma-
terials and components, direct wages, salaries and 
interests paid as from the time of payment until the 
date when the asset is available for use. the cost 
price also comprises gains and losses on transac-
tions designated as hedges.
• the basis for depreciation is determined as the cost 
less estimated residual value.
• the assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
over the estimated useful life to the estimated re-
sidual value.
• estimated useful life and estimated residual values 
are reassessed at least once a year. in estimating the  
estimated useful life for ferries and other ships it 
is taken into consideration that dfds continuously 
is spending substantial funds on ongoing mainte-
nance.
• the effect from changes in depreciation period or 
the residual value is recognised prospectively as a 
change in the accounting estimate.
ferries and other ships
the rebuilding/upgrade of ferries and other ships is cap-
italised if the rebuilding/upgrade can be attributed to:
• safety measures.
• measures to extend the useful life of the ferries and 
other ships.
• measure to reduce climate impact.
• measures to improve earnings.
• docking.
maintenance and daily running costs for the ferries 
and other ships are expensed in the income statement 
as incurred.
docking costs are capitalised and depreciated on a 
straight line basis until the ferry’s or ship’s next dock-
ing. in most cases, the docking interval is 2 years for 
passenger cruise ferries and 2½ years for freight and 
passenger ferries as well as freight ferries.
gains or losses on the disposal of ferries and other 
ships are calculated as the difference between sales 
price less sales costs and the book value at dispos-
al date. gains or losses on the disposal of ferries and 
other ships are recognised when substantially all risks 
and rewards incident to ownership have transferred to 
the buyer, and are presented in the income statement 
as ‘profit on disposal of non-current assets, net’ or 
‘special items’ if the gain/loss is significant.
  accounting policies (continued)
passenger cruise- and freight and passenger (ro-pax) 
ferries
due to differences in the wear of certain components 
of passenger cruise- and freight and passenger ferries, 
the cost of these ferries is divided into components 
with low wear, such as hull and engine, and compo-
nents with high wear, such as parts of the hotel, cater-
ing/restaurants and shop areas.
freight ferries (ro-ro)
the cost of freight ferries is not divided into compo-
nents as there is no material difference in the wear of 
the various components of freight ferries.
depreciation – expected useful life and residual value 
the depreciation period for components with low wear 
is 35 years for freight and passenger- and freight fer-
ries from the year in which the ferry was built. in july 
2020 the remaining lifetime of two passenger cruise 
ferries has been reassessed and based on the condi-
tion of the ships the remaining useful life has been pro-
longed by 10 years. the depreciation period is hereaf-
ter 45 years for all passenger cruise ferries. the impact 
on depreciation in 2020 is a reduction of dkk 13m.
the residual value is calculated as the value of the 
ferry’s steel less estimated costs of disposal. 
components with high wear are normally depreciated 
over 5-15 years down to a residual value of dkk 0.
other non-current tangible assets
other non-current tangible assets comprise buildings, 
terminals and machinery, tools and equipment, and 
leasehold improvements.
the estimated useful lifetimes are as follows:
buildings
25-50 years
terminals etc.
10-40 years
equipment etc
4-10 years
leasehold improvements
max. depreciated over 
the term of the lease
gains or losses arising from the disposal of other 
non-current tangible assets are calculated as the dif-
ference between the disposal price less disposal costs 
and the book value at the date of disposal. gains or 
losses on the disposal of these non-current assets are 
recognised in the income statement as ‘profit on dis-
posal of non-current assets, net’ unless they qualify to 
be a special item, reference is made to note 2.6.

  accounting policies
the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liabil-
ity is recognised at the commencement date, i.e. the 
date the underlying asset is ready for use. right-of-
use assets are measured at cost corresponding to the 
lease liability recognised, adjusted for any lease pre-
payments including dismantling and restoration costs. 
the lease liabilities are measured at the present value 
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. the 
lease payments are discounted using dfds’ incremen-
tal borrowing rate. 
depreciation follows the straight-line method over the 
lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use assets, 
whichever is shortest. however ,for one terminal the de-
preciation is based on volumes handled in the terminal.
the lease payments include fixed payments less any 
lease incentives receivable and variable lease pay-
ments that depend on an index or a rate. if the con-
tract holds an option to purchase, extend or terminate 
a lease and it is reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the group, the lease payment will include those. the 
variable lease payments that do not depend on an 
index or a rate are recognised as expense in the peri-
od on which the event or condition that triggers the 
payment occurs. 
the group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption for lease contracts that, at the commence-
ment date, have a lease term of 12 months or less for 
all classes of underlying assets except for terminals 
and ferries and other ships, and the exemption for 
lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of 
low value. lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets are recognised as expenses 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
for all classes of assets, except for terminals, non-
lease components, i.e. the service element, is separat-
ed from the lease components and thereby form part 
of the right-of-use asset and lease liability recognised 
in the balance sheet. 
the group has lease contracts for various items of 
land & buildings, terminals, ferries and other ships, 
equipment, and other assets used in its operations. 
leases normally have the following lease terms:
land & buildings
3 – 7 years
terminals
10 – 40 years
ferries and other ships
up to 10 years
equipment
3 – 7 years
other assets
1 – 3 years
rental and lease matters (lease out)
for accounting purposes, assets leased out are divided 
into finance and operating leases.
in respect of assets leased out on a finance lease, an 
amount equal to the net present value of the future 
lease payments is recognised in the balance sheet as 
a lease receivable from lessee. the asset leased out is 
reclassified from non-current asset to leases receiva-
bles and any gain or loss arising from this is recognised 
in the income statement.
lease income from assets leased out on an operat-
ing lease is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.
3.1.3 leases (continued)
the group has two terminal lease contracts that contains 
variable payments based on the number of transferred 
units. these terms have been negotiated to align the lease 
expense with the units transferred and revenue earned.

  significant accounting estimates and assessments
leases (extention options)
the group has entered into lease/charter agreements 
for ferries with extension options. management exer-
cises significant judgement in determining whether 
these extension options are reasonably certain to be 
exercised and in the connection considers all relevant 
factors that create an economic and strategic incen-
tive for it to exercise the extention option.
leases (lease out)
the group has entered into operating lease/charter 
agreements for ferries under usual terms and con-
ditions for such agreements. at inception of each 
individual agreement, management assesses and de-
termines whether the agreement is a finance or an op-
erating leasing agreement.

3.1.5 impairment testing
introduction
dfds decided to impairment tests all non-current assets 
at least once every year and in case of indication of impair-
ment. due to covid-19 quarterly impairment assessments 
have been made in 2020.
definition of cash-generating units
the breakdown into cash-generating units takes its start-
ing point in the internal structure of the two segments,  
ferry and logistics, and their business areas, including 
the strategic, operational and commercial management  
and control of these, both separately and across business 
areas, and the nature of the customer services provided.
based on this the following seven cash generating units 
have been identified:
ferry cgu:
• the business areas north sea, baltic sea and mediter-
ranean
• the business area english channel
• the oslo – frederikshavn - copenhagen route which is 
part of the passenger business area
• the amsterdam – newcastle route which is part of the 
passenger business area
logistics cgu:
• the business area nordic – forwarding- and logistics ac-
tivities in the nordic and baltic countries
• the business area continent – forwarding and logistics 
activities at the european continent
• the business area uk & ireland – forwarding and logis-
tics activities in uk and ireland
non-current intangible and tangible assets as well as 
right-of-use assets are assigned to the above cash-gener-
ating units, unless this cannot be done with a reasonable 
degree of certainty. software and other assets which can-
not with reasonable certainty be assigned to one or more 
of the above cash-generating units are tested for impair-
ment as a non-allocated group asset, i.e. on the basis of 
group earnings.
basis for impairment testing and calculation  
of recoverable amount
in the impairment test for cash-generating units, the re-
coverable amount of the unit is compared with its carrying 
amount. the recoverable amount is the higher value of its 
value-in-use and its fair value less costs of disposal. if the 
recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the 
latter is written down to the lower value.
3.1.5 impairment testing (continued)
the value-in-use is calculated as the discounted value of 
the estimated future net cash flows per cash-generating 
unit. impairment testing (value-in-use) is performed based 
on management approved forecast for 2021 and business 
plans beyond 2021. key parameters for the forecast pe-
riods are trends in revenue, ebit, ebit margin, future in-
vestments, and growth expectations. these parameters 
are determined specifically for each individual cash-gener-
ating unit. growth is incorporated in forecasts for periods 
beyond 2021 and in the terminal period with reference to 
the growth rate and cash flow section below. 
the recoverable amount for cash-generating units contain-
ing goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calcu-
lations. for a breakdown of goodwill on cash-generating 
units, reference is made to note 3.1.1. 
the fair value of the group’s main assets, ferries and other 
ships, is determined on the basis of the average of two to 
three independent broker valuations per ship less estimat-
ed costs of disposal. the task of the brokers is to assess 
the value of the individual ships in a ‘willing buyer – willing 
seller’ situation. the valuations have been obtained from 
the same recognised brokers as in previous years, and man-
agement considers an average of these to be the best and 
most reasonable expression of the ships’ fair value. 
the carrying amount of right-of-use assets is added to the 
base of non-current tangible and intangible assets being 
subject to impairment testing. the right-of-use assets are 
regarded an integrated part of the operating activities 
taking place in the group’s cash-generating unit and ac-
cordingly, the carrying amount of a right-of-use asset is 
allocated to the cash-generating unit in which the asset in 
question is used. thereby right-of-use assets are tested on 
cash-generating unit level.
determination of estimated growth rates and cash flow
the expected net cashflows are assessed at cgu level 
on basis of approved forecast for 2021 and manage-
ment business plans beyond 2021. these projections are 
performed on basis of assumptions on when the specific 
cgu will reach normal activity levels i.e. after covid-19. 
the projections also include the estimated impact of long-
term strategic decisions such as win23 and assessment of 
opportunities for future growth and required investments. 
for ferry and logistics division cgus’ which include a 
terminal period, oecd prediction for long term consumer 
price index, a growth rate of 1.0% have been applied. fur-
ther, the consequences from covid-19 outbreak have been 
incorporated in the forecast for 2021 and onwards. it is 
management expectations that a full recovery from cov-
id-19 will take place during 2022 for most of the cgu’s. 
the following assumptions for growth rates have been ap-
plied to each cgu.
ferry (cgus):
north sea, baltic sea and mediterranean: end of 2022 a 
full ebit recovery in line with pre covid-19 is expected. af-
ter 2022 a growth in ebit for 2023-2025 between (2.4% 
- 9.0%), and growth in terminal period of 1.0%, is expected 
(2019: 0%). 
the business area english channel: end of 2022 a full ebit 
recovery in line with pre covid-19 is expected. after 2022 
a growth in ebit for 2023-2025 of 1.3% and growth in ter-
minal period of 1.0% is expected (2019: 0%).
the oslo – frederikshavn - copenhagen route: 
the extensive travel restrictions in 2020 have resulted 
in a significantly reduced passenger traffic. the expecta-
tion for 2021 is negative growth as well as negative ebit. 
during 2022, management expects a partiel recovery will 
take place and a steady state will be achieved by the end 
of 2022. varying growth rates have been incorporated in 
the forecast years beyond 2022, and expects to provide an 
overall positive ebit. the growth rates in ebit vary from 
year to year and depend to a large extent on when planned 
maintenance costs, improvements etc. are taking place. 
from 2022, growth rates represent an avg. of 1.0% over 
the forecast period due to oecd prediction consumer price 
index (2019: 0%).
the amsterdam – newcastle route: the expectation for 
2021 is a negative growth as well as negative ebit. during 
2022, management expects a partiel recovery will take 
place and a steady state will be achieved by the end of 
2022. varying growth rates have been incorporated in the 
forecast years beyond 2022, and expects to provide an 
overall positive ebit. the growth rates in ebit vary from 
year to year and depend to a large extent on when planned 
maintenance costs, improvements etc. are taking place. 
from 2022, growth rates represent an avg. of 3.5% over 
the forecast period (2019: 0%).
logistics (cgus):
the business area nordic: growth in ebit for 2022-2025, 
of 5% and growth in terminal period of 1.0% (2019: 0%).
the business area continent: growth in ebit for 2022-2025, 
of 5% and growth in terminal period of 1.0% (2019: 0%).
the business area uk & ireland: growth in ebit for 2022-2025, 
of 5% and growth in terminal period of 1.0% (2019: 0%).

dfds annual report 2020
determination of discount rate
the discount rate for year-end 2020 impairment testing 
purposes is based on a calculation of dfds’ weighted 
average cost of capital (wacc) taking into account both 
debt and equity. the cost of equity is based on a risk-free 
rate, plus a market risk premium. the risk-free interest 
rate is based on a 10-year danish risk-free rate at year-end 
which at the end of 2020 is negative. accordingly, dfds 
has decided to use a normalised risk-free rate of 1.0%. 
the market risk premium is calculated as a general equity 
market risk premium of 6.0% (2019: 6.0%) multiplied by 
the leveraged beta value for dfds (2019: non-leveraged 
beta value). the leveraged beta value applied at year-end 
2020 is calculated by obtaining the unlevered beta val-
ue of peer group companies via the capital iq database. 
this beta value is then relevered in accordance with the 
groups’ current capital structure. the cost of debt is based 
on the interest-bearing borrowings for the group plus the 
risk-free interest. further, risk premium may be added for 
the individual cash-generating unit if special conditions 
and/or uncertainties indicate a need hereto. conversely, 
if the risk level for the individual cash-generating unit is 
considered to be lower than the general risk level, then 
the risk premium is reduced if special conditions indicate 
a need hereto. 
the impact of covid-19 and brexit on the cash-generating 
units is uncertain and the expected impact is built into 
the forecasts. for the cgu, oslo – frederikshavn - copen-
hagen a specific risk premium of 1.0 percentage point 
has been added on top of the determined discount rate 
to reflect the increase in uncertainty for passengers. the 
discount rates used in determining the carrying amounts 
of right-of-use assets/lease liabilities are based on bor-
rowing rates which are lower than the discount rates used 
in the impairment test, which all things being equal will 
have a negative impact on the results of the impairment 
test as the carrying amount of the cash-generating units 
will increase more than the value-in-use of the cash-gen-
erating-units.
for cash-generating units where the recoverable amount is 
based on value-in-use, the pre-tax discount rates applied 
have been within the following ranges in the two segments:
2020
2019
ferry division
6.4% - 7.4%
7.5% - 9.2%
logistics division
6.4%
7.4% - 8.6%
the applied discount rates in cash-generating units for 
which the carrying amount of goodwill forms a significant 
part of the group’s total goodwill are 6.4% (2019: 7.5%) 
in ‘north sea, baltic sea and mediterranean’, 6.4% (2019: 
7.4%) in ‘continent’ and 6.4% (2019: 7.7%) in ‘uk & ireland’.
sensitivity analysis
as part of the preparation of impairment tests, sensitivity 
analysis are prepared on the basis of relevant risk factors 
and scenarios that management can determine with rea-
sonable reliability. sensitivity analysis are prepared by 
altering the estimates within the range of probable out-
comes. the sensitivities have been assessed as follows, all 
other things being equal:
• an increase in the discount rate of 0.5%-points.
• a decrease in ebit of 10%.
• a decrease in broker valuations of 10%.
none of these calculations have given rise to adjustments 
of the results of the impairment tests prepared. 
order of recognising impairments
if a need for impairment is identified, goodwill is the first 
to be impaired, followed by the primary non-current tangi-
ble and intangible assets and right-of-use assets in the in-
dividual cash-generating units. impairments are allocated 
to the respective assets according to the carrying amount 
of the assets unless this results in an impairment to a val-
ue below the fair value less costs of disposal of the asset.
impairment tests 2020
based on the impairment tests prepared at year end 2020 
the cash generating unit: “oslo - frederikshavn - copenha-
gen” has been impaired by dkk 100m. the impairment is 
applied to the non-current tangible assets. no goodwill is 
allocated to the cgu. the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is based on value in use method. the im-
pairment loss of dkk 100m is recognised under special 
items. reference is made to note 2.6. further an impair-
ment of dkk 29m has been recognised in relation to re-
classification of a ferry to assets classified as held for sale. 
reference is made to note 2.6 and note 3.1.6.  
impairment tests 2019 
on the basis of the impairment tests prepared at year end 
2019 it was not deemed necessary to impair any of the 
cash-generating units in 2019 nor reverse any impairment 
losses recognised in prior years.
  significant accounting estimates and assessments
covid-19 and brexit considerations 
management has taken the risk and uncertainty relating 
to covid-19 and brexit into consideration when preparing 
the forecasts and cash flows.
impairment testing of goodwill and other non-current 
intangible assets 
impairment testing of goodwill and other non-current 
intangible assets, which primarily relates to it, acquired 
port concession rights and acquired customer portfolios, 
is undertaken at least once every year and in case of in-
dication of impairment. the impairment tests are based 
on the expected future cash flow for the cash-generating 
unit in question. the key parameters are trends in reve-
nue, ebit, ebit margin, future investments and growth 
expectations. these parameters are based on estimates 
of the future which are inherently uncertain. 
impairment testing of ferries and other ships, includ-
ing the assessment of useful life and scrap value 
significant accounting estimates and assessments re-
garding ferries and other ships include the allocation 
of the ferry’s cost price on components based on the 
expected useful life of the identified components; the 
ferry’s expected maximum useful life; the ferry’s scrap 
value; and impairment testing. the expected useful 
life of ferries and other ships and their scrap values 
are reviewed and estimated at least once a year. im-
pairment test is performed at least once a year, typi-
cally at year-end. additional impairment tests are per-
formed if indications of impairment occur in the period 
between the annual impairment tests.
impairment testing of right-of-use assets
for information on significant accounting estimates 
and assessments regarding right-of-use assets from 
leases reference is made to note 3.1.3. 
impairment testing of right-of-use assets, which pri-
marily relates to leases of terminals, ferries, land and 
buildings and cargo carrying equipment, is performed 
at least once a year, typically at year-end. addition-
al impairment tests are performed if indications of 
impairment occur in the period between the annual 
impairment tests.
the right-of-use assets are regarded an integrated 
part of the operating activities taking place in the 
group’s cash-generating units and accordingly, the 
carrying amount of a right-of-use asset is allocated 
to the cash-generating unit in which the asset in ques-
tion is used. thereby right-of-use assets are tested on 
cash-generating unit level.
the impairment tests are based on fair value less costs 
of disposal for the assets in the cash-generating unit or 
the value-in-use where the expected future cash flow 
for the cash-generating unit is a main element in the cal-
culation. the key parameters in assessing expected fu-
ture cash flows are trends in revenue, ebit, ebit margin, 
future investments and growth expectations, which are 
inherently uncertain. the fair value less cost of disposal 
for the group’s main assets, ferries and other ships, are 
based on broker valuations. for further information on 
broker valuations reference is made to the paragraph 
‘basis for impairment testing and calculation of recov-
erable amount’ which can be found above in this note.
  accounting policies
the carrying amount of non-current intangible, good-
will, tangible and right-of-use assets are continuously 
assessed, at least once a year, to determine whether 
there is an indication of impairment. when such indi-
cation exists the recoverable amount of the asset is 
assessed. the recoverable amount is the higher of the 
fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use. 
the value-in-use is calculated as the present value of 
the future net cash flow, which the asset is expected to 
generate either by itself or from the lowest cash-gen-
erating unit to which the asset is allocated.

liverpool seaways, built 1997 — to la meridionale. the 
ferry was delivered to the new owner in may 2020. the 
sales price was dkk 225m and an expected accounting 
profit of dkk 110m was recognised under special items.

the last five years dfds’ realised credit losses on trade re-
ceivables have been insignificant and the loss rate has not 
exceeded 0.2% (2019: 0.2%) of the revenue in any of the 
respective years. the changes in payment pattern continue 
to be insignificant and at the same level as previous years 
albeit the covid-19 situation is monitored closely. accord-
ingly, at year-end 2020 the expected credit losses on trade 
receivables calculated under the simplified expected cred-
it loss model is based on the average historical loss rate on 
revenue for the last five years of 0.1% (2019: 0.1%) plus 
adjustments for forward-looking factors where considered 
relevant such as covid-19 and brexit.
  accounting policies
receivables are recognised at amortised cost less ex-
pected credit losses. 
dfds’ risks regarding trade receivables are not consid-
ered unusual and no material risk is attributable to a 
single customer or group of customers. according to 
the group’s policy of undertaking credit risks, credit 
ratings of significant customers are performed at least 
once a year.
write-downs on trade receivables are based on the 
simplified expected credit loss model. credit loss al-
lowances on individual receivables are provided for 
when objective indications of credit losses occurs 
such as customer bankruptcy and uncertainty about 
the customers’ ability and/or willingness to pay, etc. in 
addition to this, allowances for expected credit losses 
are made on the remaining trade receivables based on 
a simplified approach. 
contract assets comprise work in progress services 
where the customer has not been invoiced yet. work 
in progress services is measured based on the value 
of the of the work performed as of the balance sheet 
date.
write-downs and realised losses on trade receivables 
and work in progress services are recognised in ferry 
and other ship operation and maintenance costs in the 
income statement.
other receivables comprise other trade receivables; 
insurance receivables on loss or damage of ferries and 
other ships; financial lease receivables; outstanding 
balances for chartered ferries; interest receivable, etc.

consolidated financial statements
 
dfds annual report 2020
3.2.4 pension and jubilee liabilities
the group contributes to defined contribution plans as 
well as defined benefit plans. the majority of the pen-
sion plans are funded through payments of contributions 
to independent insurance companies responsible for the 
pension obligation towards the employees (defined con-
tribution plans). in these plans the group has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further contributions irre-
spective of the financial situation of these insurance com-
panies. pension costs from such plans are expensed in the 
income statement when incurred.
in primarily the united kingdom the group has defined 
benefit plans. in addition there are minor defined benefit 
plans in norway, belgium, italy, turkey, lithuania, france, 
germany, denmark, and sweden. the united kingdom ac-
count for 73.3% (2019: 69.0%) of the total net liability 
and 95.3% (2019: 95.5%) of the funded and unfunded ob-
ligation. the majority of the defined benefit plans are pen-
sion plans that yearly pay out a certain percentage of the 
employee’s final salary upon retirement. the pensions are 
paid out as from retirement and during the remaining life 
of the employee. the percentage of the salary is depend-
ent of the seniority of the employee except for certain-
closed plans in the united kingdom and some of the other 
minor plans. the defined benefit plans typically include a 
spouse pension and disability insurance.
some of the pension plans in sweden are multi-employ-
er plans, which cover a large number of enterprises. the 
plans are collective and are covered through contribu-
tions paid to the pension company alecta. the swedish 
financial accounting standards council’s interpretations 
committee (redovisningsrådet) has defined this plan as 
a multi-employer defined benefit plan. presently, it is not 
possible to obtain sufficient information from alecta to 
assess the plans as defined benefit plans. consequently, 
the pension plans are similarly to prior years treated as 
defined contribution plans. the contributions are dkk 4m 
in 2020 (2019: dkk 4m). the collective funding ratio at 
alecta amounts to 144% as per september 2020 (septem-
ber 2019: 142%). for 2021, the contributions are expected 
to be dkk 5m. dfds’ share of the multi-employer plan is 
around 0.0046% and the liability follows the share of the 
total plan.

  significant accounting estimates and assessments
the group’s defined benefit pension plans are calculat-
ed on the basis of a number of key actuarial assump-
tions, including discount rate, the anticipated returns 
on the plans’ assets, the anticipated development in 
wages and pensions, anticipated mortality, etc. even 
moderate alterations in these assumptions can result 
in significant changes in pension liabilities.
the value of the group’s defined pension benefit plans is 
based on calculations undertaken by external actuaries.
1)  all factors are weighted at the 
pro rata share of the individu-
al actuarial obligation.
2)  schemes closed for new 
members will have a social 
security rate and future salary 
increase of 0%.

dfds annual report 2020
  accounting policies
contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised in the income statement in the period in 
which they relate, and any payable contributions are 
accrued in the balance sheet as other payables.
as regards defined benefit pension plans, an actuarial 
valuation of the value in use of future benefits payable 
under the plan is made once a year. the value in use 
is calculated based on assumptions of future devel-
opment in wage/salary levels, interest rates, inflation, 
mortality, etc. the value in use is only calculated for 
benefits to which the employees have become entitled 
during their employment with the group. the actuarial 
calculation of the value in use less the fair value of 
any assets under the plan is recognised in the balance 
sheet under pension obligations. pension costs of the 
year are recognised in the income statement based on 
actuarial estimates and finance expectations at the 
beginning of the year. the difference between the cal-
culated development in pension assets and liabilities 
and the realised values are recognised in other com-
prehensive income as actuarial gains and losses.
changes in the benefits payable for employees’ past 
service to the enterprise result in an adjustment of 
the actuarial calculation of the value in use, which 
is classified as past service costs. past service costs 
are recognised in the income statement immediately 
if the employees have already earned the right to the 
adjusted benefit. otherwise, the benefits will be recog-
nised in the income statement over the period in which 
the employees earn the right to the adjusted benefits.
other non-current employee obligations include jubi-
lee benefits, etc.

  accounting policies
provisions are recognised when, due to an event occur-
ring on or before the reporting date, the group has a 
legal or constructive obligation, and it is probable that 
the group will have to give up future economic bene-
fits to meet the obligation and that the obligation can 
be reliably estimated. provisions are recognised based 
on management’s best estimate of the anticipated ex-
penditure for settling the relevant obligation and are 
discounted if deemed material.

4. capital structure and finances
94 
consolidated financial statements
 
dfds annual report 2020
dfds’ risk management policy
dfds’ risk management policy is governed by the dfds 
treasury policy, which is approved by the board of direc-
tors on an annual basis. the financial policy sets out the 
framework, key policies, limits and guidelines for financial 
risk management of dfds. dfds does not enter into specu-
lation. the most important risk factors managed financial-
ly in dfds are 1) bunker price, 2) interest rate, 3) currency 
exchange, 4) liquidity and 5) credit exposure. dfds manag-
es its capital structure as described below.
bunker risk
in 2020 dfds total bunker cost was dkk 1,314m or 9% of 
group revenue (dkk 2,075m or 13% in 2019). therefore, 
the fluctuations in the bunker price constitute a significant 
risk. bunker is denominated in usd. the corresponding 
usd/dkk is described separately below.
in the freight industry it is customary to pass through the 
risk of fluctuations in bunker price and corresponding cur-
rency exchange rate risk to freight customers via a bunker 
adjustment factor (baf). in the passenger industry, fluctu-
ations in the cost of bunker are reflected in the ticket price 
to the extent possible.
on group level approximately 93% (90% in 2019) of dfds 
bunker price exposure and corresponding currency risk is 
passed through to freight customers via baf agreements. 
the remaining bunker price exposure is financially hedged 
up to six quarters ahead in accordance with dfds treasury 
policy.
an increase in the bunker price of 10% compared to the ac-
tual bunker price during 2020 would have increased bun-
ker cost by dkk 7m for the group in 2020 all else equal 
(2019: dkk 17m). a decrease in the bunker price would 
have had a similar but positive effect.
an increase in the bunker price of 10% compared to the ac-
tual bunker price at balance sheet date would have had a 
positive effect on the group’s equity reserve for hedging of 
dkk 10m all else equal (2019: dkk 3m). a decrease in the 
bunker price would have had a similar but negative effect.
interest rate risk
dfds is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through 
funding. according to dfds treasury policy the interest 
rate on 40-70% of the loan portfolio including long-term 
charter agreements must be fixed with a weighted average 
duration of 9-36 months. dfds enters into interest rate 
swaps and caps to comply with this policy.
the total net interest-bearing debt (including currency 
swaps on bonds and lease liabilities) amounts to dkk 
11,361m at year end 2020 (2019: dkk 11,954m). the 
group’s total interest-bearing debt primarily consists of 
partly secured credit facilities, unsecured corporate bonds 
and floating rate mortgages with security in ferries and 
other ships. the debt portfolio had an average time to ma-
turity of 4.2 years (2019: 4.3 years).
as part of the financial strategy, interest rate swaps and 
caps with a principal amount of dkk 3,056m (2019: dkk 
2,700m) have been established to reduce interest rate 
risk in compliance with dfds treasury policy. the share of 
fixed-rate debt including interest rate derivatives was 39% 
at year-end 2020 (2019: 38%). including long term char-
ter agreements, the share of fixed-rate debt is 42% (2019: 
40%). the duration of the group’s debt portfolio (including 
charter liabilities) was 1.0 years (2019: 1.3 years).
4.1 financial and operational risks
an increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to 
the actual interest rates in 2020 would have increased 
net interest payments on long term debt incl. hedging by 
dkk 42m for the group in 2020 all else equal (2019: dkk 
39m). a decrease in the interest rates of 1%-point would 
have reduced the net interest payment by dkk 7m (2019: 
dkk 7m).
an increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to 
the actual interest rate at balance sheet date would have 
had a hypothetical positive effect on the group’s equity 
reserve for hedging of dkk 53m all else equal (2019: dkk 
48m). a decrease would have had a negative effect of dkk 
41m (2019: dkk 26m).
currency risk
approximately 95% of dfds’ revenues in 2020 were in-
voiced in foreign currencies (2019: 92%) with the most 
substantial revenue being generated in eur, sek, gbp, and 
nok. usd was the most substantial cost currency. dfds 
was exposed to the exchange rate development of try 
due to revenue and costs in try. in 2019 a new invoicing 
model was introduced that incentivised payments in eur 
or cash rather than try. the purpose of the new model was 
to reduce currency risk. in 2020 than 90% of customers 
have adopted the new invoicing model. and try cash flow 
expenses are limited to salary- and certain port operation 
costs while most other cash flows are in currencies other 
than try, e.g., bunker.
currency exchange risk is monitored continuously and ac-
tively hedged in accordance with dfds treasury policy. 
the aim is to actively reduce currency balance sheet and 
expected currency cash flow exposure using forward ex- 
change contracts and currency swaps. eur is considered 
a minor risk due to denmark’s fixed exchange rate policy. 
usd risk is reduced by entering into forward exchange 
contracts in connection with hedging of future bunker 
consumption, charter agreements, and payments under 
shipbuilding contracts. expected future cash flow in other 
currencies than usd is currently not hedged as they are 
within the limits accepted in the treasury policy.
the operational currency cash flow is defined as the 
group’s consolidated net currency cash flows from rev-
enues and operational costs. the table below shows the 
impact on the group’s operating profit before depreciation 
(ebitda) and special items from changes in the foreign 
exchange rate.

in addition to currency risk arising from operations, trans-
lation risk arise when foreign currency financial state-
ments of subsidiaries are translated into dkk as part of 
the consolidation process. the group’s most substantial 
translation risks are in sek, gbp, and nok. the impact on 
net profit from an increase of the average exchange rates

liquidity risks
dfds financial policy is to secure adequate liquidity to 
meet financial and operational payment obligations by 
maintaining a minimum cash resource of dkk 0,4bn in 
2020 and from 2021 a minimum cash ressource of dkk 
1.0bn. the year-end cash resource was dkk 4,932m (2019: 
dkk 2,290m), of which undrawn committed and uncom-
mitted credit facilities amounts to dkk 3,671m (2019:

assumptions for the maturity table:
the maturity analysis is based on undiscounted cash flows 
including estimated interest payments. interest payments 
are estimated based on existing market conditions.
the undiscounted cash flows related to derivative finan-
cial liabilities are presented at gross amounts unless the 
parties according to the contract have a right or obligation 
to settle at net amount.
credit risk
dfds credit risk is primarily attributable to trade- and oth-
er receivables and cash. the receivables including work in 
progress services are stated in the balance net of write-
downs. reference is made to note 3.2.1 for a further infor-
mation on write-downs on trade receivables and work in 
progress services.
according to the group’s policy of undertaking credit risks, 
credit ratings of all customers and other partners are per-
formed at least once a year. customers have provided 
bank guarantees for payments for the benefit of dfds. for 
dkk 21m in 2020 (2019: dkk 57m). prepayment guaran-
tees regarding dfds’ newbuilding program amount to dkk 
747m (2019: dkk 760m).
dfds’ credit risk towards financial counterparties primar-
ily relates to cash on bank accounts and positive market 
values of derivatives. credit limits on financial counter-
parties are calculated in accordance with dfds treasury 
policy based on credit ratings from international credit 
rating agencies. credit ratings and resulting credit limits 
are monitored continuously.
capital structure
capital distribution to shareholders is based on a target 
leverage of a nibd/ebitda multiple between 2.0 and 3.0. 
the target can be suspended in connection with large in-
vestments, acquisitions, and other strategic initiatives. at 
year-end 2020 the nibd/ebitda multiple was 4.2 (2019: 
3.3). after distribution of dividend, excess capital is de-
termined based on the leverage target, including future 
investment requirements, and distributed through share 
buybacks.

in 2020 no financial hedges were deemed inefficient hence 
no profit or loss was recognised in the income statement 
in 2020.
the fair value of the interest swaps has been calculated 
by discounting the expected future interest payments. 
the discount rate for each interest payment is estimated 
on the basis of a swap interest curve, which is calculated 
based on market interest rates.
the fair value of forward exchange contracts and bunker 
contracts is calculated based on actual forward curves in 
dfds’ treasury system.

derivative financial assets and liabilities are all measured 
at level 2. reference is made to note 4 .1 for description of 
the valuation method.
securities, financial assets measured at fair value through 
profit or loss comprise other shares and equity invest-
ments as well as other investments of dkk 10m (2019: 
dkk 10m). these are some minor unlisted shares and in-
vestments.
transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are 
considered to have occurred at the date of the event or 
change in circumstances that caused the transfer. there 
were no transfers between the levels in the fair value hier-
archy in 2020 (2019: no transfers).
  significant accounting estimates and assessments
derivatives
when entering into agreements involving derivatives, 
management assesses whether the derivative in ques-
tion meets the criteria for hedge accounting, including 
whether the hedging relates to recognised assets and 
liabilities, projected future cash flows, or financial 
investments. effectiveness tests are carried out, and 
any inefficiency is recognised in the income statement.

  accounting policies
derivatives financial instruments
derivatives financial instruments are measured in the 
balance sheet at fair value as from the date where 
the derivatives financial instrument is concluded. the 
fair values of derivatives financial instruments are 
presented as derivatives financial instruments un-
der asssets if positive or under liabilities if negative. 
netting of positive and negative derivatives financial 
instruments is only performed if the group is entitled 
to and has the intention to settle more derivatives 
financial instruments as a net. fair values of deriva-
tives financial instruments are computed on the basis 
of current market data and generally accepted valua-
tion methods.
fair value hedge
changes in the fair value of financial instruments des-
ignated as and qualifying for recognition as a fair val-
ue hedge of recognised assets and liabilities are recog-
nised in the income statement together with changes 
in the value of the hedged asset or liability based on 
the hedged proportion. hedging of future cash flows 
according to agreements (firm commitments), except 
for foreign currency hedges, is treated as a fair value 
hedge of a recognised asset and liability.
cash flow hedge
changes in the fair value of financial instruments des-
ignated as and qualifying for cash flow hedging and 
which effectively hedge changes in future cash flows, 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
the change in fair value that relates to the effective 
portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised as a sep-
arate equity reserve until the hedged cash flow im-
pacts the income statement. at this point in time the 
related gains or losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement into the same line item as the hedged item 
is recognised.
however, when the forecast transaction that is hedged 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the 
gains or losses previously recognised in other com-
prehensive income are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the 
non-financial asset.
for derivative financial instruments that no longer 
qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge is dissolved 
prospectively. the accumulated fair value in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement into 
the same line item as the hedged item is recognised.
other financial instruments
for financial instruments that do not fulfil the re-
quirements of being treated as hedge instruments, the 
changes in fair value are recognised successively in 
the income statement as financial income and cost.

  accounting policies
interest-bearing liabilities comprise amounts owed 
to mortgage/credit institutions and banks as well as 
amounts owed to owners of issued corporate bonds 
including liabilities arising from derivatives relating 
to issued corporate bonds. the amounts are initially 
recognised at fair value net of transaction expenses. 
subsequently, the financial liability is measured at 
amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value 
using the effective interest method, so that the differ-
ence between the proceeds and the nominal value is 
recognised in the income statement under ‘financial 
costs’ over the term of the loan.
interest-bearing liabilities also include capitalised 
residual lease obligations on finance leases. other li-
abilities are recognised at amortised cost, which cor-
responds to the net realisable value in all material 
respects.

in june 2019 dfds issued a new five year bond of nok 
400m with a coupon of 3-month nibor + 150 bps and 
priced at par. the bond was immediately swapped into 
danish kroner and fixed interest. the purpose of the bond 
issued was to refinance existing bonds and extend debt 
maturity as well as for general corporate purposes.
in connection with the delivery of two new freight ferries 
in 2020 dfds obtained two new mortgage loans; one loan 
of dkk 364m with a maturity of 12 years and a repayment 
profile of 15 years and one loan of dkk 352m with a matu-
rity of 12 years and a repayment profile of 15 years. both 
mortgage loans are cibor based. 
in connection with the delivery of three new freight ferries 
in 2019 dfds obtained three new mortgage loans; two fer-
ry loans of each dkk 365m with a maturity of 7 years and 
a repayment profile of 20 years and one ferry loan of dkk 
364m with a maturity of 12 years and a repayment profile 
of 15 years. all three mortgage loans are cibor based. 
the fair value of the interest-bearing liabilities amounts 
to dkk 12,692m (2019: dkk 12,886m). the fair value 
measurement is categorised within level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy except for the part that relates to issued corpo-
rate bonds of nominal nok 1,250m for which the fair value 
measurement is categorised within level 1.
the fair value of the financial liabilities is determined as 
the present value of expected future repayments and in-
terest rates. the group’s actual borrowing rate for equiv-
alent terms is used as the discount rate. the fair value 
of the issued corporate bonds nominal nok 1,250m has 
been calculated based on the quoted bond price in may 
2020 which is the latest quoted price (2019: quoted bond 
price in august 2019). the fair value of the issued corpo-
rate bonds nominal nok400m has been calculated based 
on the quoted bond price in june 2019 which is the latest 
quoted price (2019: quoted bond price in june 2019).
dkk 2,778m of the interest-bearing liabilities fall due after 
five years (2019: dkk 2,366m). no unusual conditions in 
connection with the borrowings are made. the loan agree-
ments can be settled at fair value plus a small surcharge, 
whereas premature settlement of the corporate bonds re-
quires a repurchase of the bonds.
the covenants of a loan agreement — entered into in june 
2018 in connection with the acquisition of u. n. ro-ro 
— were adapted in june 2020 to reflect the uncertainty 
caused by covid-19. no other loan agreements contain rel-
evant covenant risk.
reference is made to note 4.1 for financial risks, etc.
1)  the group has issued two 5 
year corporate bond loans; 
one in 2019 of nominal nok 
400m and one in 2017 of 
nominal nok 1,250m respec-
tively (2019: one in 2019 of 
nominal nok 400m and one in 
2017 of nominal nok 1,250m 
respectively).
2)  in 2017 dfds issued a five-
year corporate bond of nok 
1,250m, which runs for the 
period 28 september 2017 
until 28 september 2022. 
the bond is listed on the oslo 
stock exchange. the five-year 
bond has been issued with a 
floating rate based on three 
month nibor + 1.32% margin 
in nok, but swapped to cibor 
+ 0.99% margin in dkk. in 
2019 dfds issued a five-year 
corporate bond of nok 400m, 
which runs for the period 7 
june 2019 until 7 june 2024. 
the bond is listed on the oslo 
stock exchange. the five-year 
bond has been issued with a 
floating rate based on three 
month nibor + 1.50% margin 
in nok, but swapped to cibor

5.3 share options
the decision to grant share options is made by the board of 
directors. share options have been granted to the executive 
board and leading employees. each share option gives the 
holder of the option the right to acquire one existing share 
in the parent company of nominal dkk 20. the share option 
schemes equal a right to acquire 2.0% of the share capital 
(2019: 1.3%) if the remaining share options are exercised.
share options are granted in 2015 at an exercise price equal 
to the average share price of the parent company’s shares 
20 days before the grant with an addition of 5%. share op-
tions are granted in 2016-2020 at an exercise price equal to 
the average share price of the parent company’s shares 20 
days before the grant with an addition of 10%.
vesting occurs on a straight line basis over three years from 
the date of grant. special conditions apply regarding illness 
and death and if the capital structure of the parent compa-
ny is changed.
the share options can be exercised when a minimum of 
three years and a maximum of five years have elapsed since 
the grant dates.
share options granted can only be settled with shares. a 
part of the treasury shares is reserved for settling the out-
standing share options.

the cash flow statement has been prepared using the 
indirect method, and shows the consolidated cash 
flow from operating, investing, and financing activities 
for the year, and the consolidated cash and cash equiv-
alents at the beginning and end of the year.
the cash flow effect of acquisition and disposal of 
enterprises is shown separately in cash flows to/from 
investing activities.
cash flows from acquisitions of enterprises are rec-
ognised in the cash flow statement from the date of 
acquisition. cash flows from disposals of enterprises 
are recognised up until the date of disposal.
cash flow from operating activities is calculated on 
the basis of the profit/loss before amortisation and de-
preciation (ebitda) and special items adjusted for the 
cash flow effect of special items, non-cash operating 
items, changes in working capital (such as trade paya-
bles, current account payables to joint ventures, trade 
receivables, prepaid costs, etc.), payments related to 
pensions and other provisions, payments relating to 
financial items and corporation tax paid. 
cash flow from investing activities includes payments

short-term debt. payment of lease liablities is includ-
ed under financing activities and the related interest is 
included as a financial item under operating activities.

employee recognition
in recognition of the contribution made by dfds’ employ-
ees in a year with exceptional challenges, the board of di-
rectors has 22 december 2020 awarded up to 50 shares 
free of charge to each employee. the shares will vest over 
a three-year period from january 2021 to december 2023. 
the shares are in most countries awarded as a phantom 
share programme whereby the entitled employees will re-
ceive a cash payment in december 2023 equal to the value 
of 50 dfds shares. the total number of employees eligi-
ble for the award of shares is around 8,000 and the total 
value of awarded shares is around dkk 110m, which will 
be proportionally expensed in the income statement under 
employee costs over the vesting period.
  accounting policies
the group has set up equity-settled share option 
plans. part of the parent company’s holding of treas-
ury shares is used for the share option plan.
the value of services received in exchange for grant-
ed share options is measured at the fair value of the 
share options granted.
the equity-settled share options are measured at the 
fair value at grant date and recognised in the income 
statement under staff costs over the vesting period. 
the counter posting is recognised directly in equity as 
a shareholder transaction.
at initial recognition of the share options, an estimate 
is made over the number of share options that the em-
ployees will vest, cf. the service conditions described 
above in this note. subsequent to initial recognition, 
the estimate of share options to be vested is adjusted 
whereby the total recognition is based on the actual 
number of vested share options.
the fair value of the granted share options is calcu-
lated using the black-scholes option-pricing model. 
terms and conditions for each grant are taken into ac-
count when calculating the fair value.
the share award programmes are recognised at fair 
value over the vesting period and expensed as staff 
cost. the accrual is recorded under other payables or 
on equity depending on whether settlement is done in 
cash or shares, respectively.

108 consolidated financial statements
 
dfds annual report 2020
  accounting policies
enterprises acquired or formed during the year are 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date of acquisition or formation. enterprises 
disposed are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements until the date of disposal. the compara-
tive figures are not adjusted for acquisitions or dis-
posals.
business combinations where control is obtained by 
the dfds group are recognised using the acquisition 
method. the identifiable assets, liabilities and con-
tingent liabilities of newly-acquired enterprises are 
assessed at their fair value on the acquisition date. 
identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they are 
separable or arise from a contractual right. deferred 
tax related to the revaluations is recognised.
the acquisition date is the date on which the dfds 
group obtains actual control over the acquired enter-
prise.
positive differences (goodwill) between, on the one 
hand, the purchase price, the value of minority inter-
ests in the acquired enterprise and the fair value of 
any previously acquired shareholdings, and, on the 
other hand, the fair value of the acquired identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recog-
nised as goodwill under non-current intangible assets. 
goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for 
impairment. the first impairment test is performed be-
fore the end of the acquisition year.
upon acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the 
cash-generating units, which subsequently form the 
basis for the impairment test. allocation of goodwill 
to cash-generating units is described in sections 3.1.1 
and 3.1.5.
goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection 
with the acquisition of a foreign enterprise with a dif-
ferent functional currency than the dfds group’s pres-
entation currency are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign enterprise, and are translated and con-
verted at first recognition to the functional currency 
of the foreign enterprise at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date. 
the purchase consideration of an enterprise is the fair 
value of the agreed payment in the form of assets 
transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity instru-
ments issued to seller. if part of the consideration is 
contingent on future events or fulfilment of agreed 
conditions, this part of the consideration is recognised 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. costs attribut-
able to business combinations are recognised directly 
in the income statement when incurred.
if, at acquisition date, uncertainty exist regarding the 
identification and measurement of acquired assets, 
liabilities or contingent liabilities, or determination of 
the purchase price, initial recognition and measure-
ment is done based on preliminary values. the prelimi-
nary values may be adjusted until 12 months from the 
acquisition date, provided the initial recognition was 
preliminary or incorrect. changes in estimates regard-
ing contingent considerations are recognised in the 
income statement as special items.
incremental acquisitions after control has been ob-
tained, i.e. purchase of minority interests, are recog-
nised directly in equity. disposal of minority interests 
not resulting in loss of control is likewise recognised 
directly in equity.
gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures are calculated as the difference 
between the disposal consideration and the book 
value of net assets at the date of disposal, including 
the book value of goodwill, accumulated exchange 
gains and losses previously recognised in the equity 
as well as anticipated disposal costs. exchange rate 
adjustments attributable to the group’s ownership in-
terest, and which previously were recognised directly 
in equity, are included in the calculation of the gain/
loss. any retained participating interests are measured 
at their fair value at the time at which the controlling 
influence was lost.
5.5 acquisitions and sale of enterprises, activities and non-controlling interests (continued)
insignificant acquisitions
on 12 july 2019 the acquisition of stevedoring activ-
ities from the belgium company gezworen wegers en 
meters surveys b.v.b.a. was completed and the dfds 
group obtained control as from this date. dfds paid 
dkk 10m for the acquired acitivities. as dfds is the 
main customer, the acquisition will not have material 
impact on the dfds group’s revenue and result before 
tax. furthermore the group has acquired one associated 
company for dkk 4m.
disposals 2019
during q2 2019 the group disposed two minor associated 
companies.
acquisition of non-controlling interests
acquisition of shares by dfds a/s in ab dfds seaways 
during 2020 amounts to less than dkk 1m (2019: less 
than dkk 1m), equivalent to an ownership of 0.03% 
(2019: 0.1%) after which the company is owned 97.1% 
(2019: 97.1%). badwill of less than dkk 1m (2019: bad-
will of less than dkk 1m) is recognised directly in equity.

on an ongoing basis, as well as the likely outcome of 
pending or potential legal proceedings, etc.  such out-
come depends on future events which are inherently 
uncertain. in assessing the likely outcome of signifi-
cant legal proceedings, tax issues, etc., management 
uses external legal advisers as well as relevant case

statement by the executive board and the board of directors
the board of directors and the executive board have to-
day considered and approved the annual report of dfds

to the shareholders of dfds a/s
report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and parent company financial statements
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements of dfds 
a/s for the financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020, 
which comprise income statement, statement of compre-
hensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in 
equity, cash flow statement and notes, including account-
ing policies, for the group and the parent company. the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent compa-
ny financial statements are prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as adopted by 
the eu and additional requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the financial position of the group and the 
parent company at 31 december 2020 and of the results 
of the group’s and the parent company’s operations and 
cash flows for the financial year 1 january – 31 december 
2020 in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional require-
ments of the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to 
the audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
standards on auditing (isas) and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further described in the 
“auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidat-
ed financial statements and the parent company financial 
statements” (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the 
financial statements”) section of our report. we believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the in-
ternational ethics standards board for accountants’ code 
of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accord-
ance with these rules and requirements. 
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provided any 
prohibited non-audit services as described in article 5(1) 
of regulation (eu) no. 537/2014.
appointment of auditor
we were initially appointed as auditor of dfds a/s before 
1995 and accordingly, we have to resign as auditor of the 
company at the annual general meeting in 2021 at the lat-
est. we have been reappointed annually by resolution of 
the general meeting for a total consecutive period of more 
than 25 years up to and including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes-
sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of 
the financial statements for the financial year 2020. these 
matters were addressed during our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
for each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context.
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the 
“auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements” section, including in relation to the key audit 
matters below. accordingly, our audit included the design 
and performance of procedures to respond to our assess-
ment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements. the results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial 
statements.
valuation of non-current intangible and tangible assets 
non-current intangible and tangible assets including in-
vestments in ferries and other ships, goodwill and other 
independent auditors’ report
non-current intangible assets amounts to a total of dkk 
18,635 million at 31 december 2020. management’s dis-
closures on the impairment testing of non-current intan-
gible and tangible assets are included in note 3.1.5 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
this area is significant to our audit due to the carrying val-
ue of non-current intangible and tangible assets as well as 
the management assessments and estimations involved in 
impairment testing of these.
management prepares impairment tests for all significant 
non-current assets at year-end, or more frequent if there is 
any indication of impairment. impairment testing is based 
on the estimated recoverable amounts, which for invest-
ments in ferries and other ships is the higher of fair value 
less estimated costs of disposal and value in use. for other 
non-current intangible and tangible assets, the recovera-
ble amount is estimated on basis of value in use. value in 
use is calculated for the cash generating units determined 
by management.
for details on the impairment tests performed by manage-
ment reference is made to note 3.1.5 in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
our audit procedures in relation to valuation of non-cur-
rent assets included:
•  examination of the value-in-use model prepared by man-
agement, including consideration of the cash-generation 
units defined by management and the valuation meth-
odology and challenging the reasonableness of key as-
sumptions and input data based on our knowledge of the 
business and industry together with available supporting 
evidence such as available budgets and externally ob-
servable market data related to interest rates etc.
•  for investments in ferries and other ships testing of the 
component accounting and comparison of the useful 
life and scrap values used with assessments made and 
data provided by dfds’ technical department and other 
sources as well as inquiries to dfds’ management and 
dfds’ technical department.
•  examination of fair value less costs to sell for ferries 
and other ships calculated by management, including 
comparison of carrying values of the ferries and other 
ships with available valuations prepared by external 
and independent ship valuation experts.
•  examination of the adequacy of disclosures about key 
assumptions and sensitivity in note 3.1.5 to the consol-
idated financial statements.
statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the management’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
management’s review, and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the management’s review and, 
in doing so, consider whether the management’s review is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise ap-
pears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the 
management’s review provides the information required 
under the danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
the management’s review is in accordance with the finan-
cial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatement of the man-
agement’s review. 
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consoli-
dated financial statements and parent company financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards as adopt-
ed by the eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the prepa-
ration of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
115 reports
 
dfds annual report 2020
in preparing the financial statements, management is re-
sponsible for assessing the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the fi-
nancial statements unless management either intends to 
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease op-
erations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. rea-
sonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas 
and additional requirements applicable in denmark will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. mis-
statements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could rea-
sonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exer-
cise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the pur-
pose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s and the parent company’s internal control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s and the parent company’s ability to con-
tinue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inade-
quate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions 
may cause the group and the parent company to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and con-
tents of the financial statements, including the note 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements rep-
resent the underlying transactions and events in a man-
ner that gives a true and fair view.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business ac-
tivities within the group to express an opinion on the con-
solidated financial statements. we are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, includ-
ing any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical re-
quirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
independent auditors’ report (continued)
from the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent company financial state-
ments of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public in-
terest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation 
as part of our audit of the financial statements of dfds a/s 
we performed procedures to express an opinion on wheth-
er the annual report for the financial year 1 january – 31 
december 2020 with the file name dfds-2020-12-31.zip 
is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with 
the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on 
the european single electronic format (esef regulation) 
which includes requirements related to the preparation of 
the annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements. 
management is responsible for preparing an annual report 
that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility 
includes: 
•  the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format; 
•  the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl 
tags, including extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for 
financial information required to be tagged using judge-
ment where necessary; 
•  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and 
the consolidated financial statements presented in hu-
man readable format; and 
•  for such internal control as management determines 
necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report 
that is compliant with the esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on 
whether the annual report is prepared, in all material re-
spects, in compliance with the esef regulation based 
on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report 
that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent 
of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material depar-
tures from the requirements set out in the esef regula-
tion, whether due to fraud or error. the procedures include: 
•  testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml 
format; 
•  obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl 
tagging process and of internal control over the tagging 
process; 
•  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of 
the consolidated financial statements; 
•  evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of 
ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxonomy and 
the creation of extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been identified; 
•  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements 
to elements in the esef taxonomy; and 
•  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited 
consolidated financial statements. 
in our opinion, the annual report for the financial year 1 
january – 31 december 2020 with the file name dfds-
2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation

note 18 pension and jubilee liabilities
the parent company contributes to defined contribution 
plans as well as defined benefit plans. the majority of the 
pension plans are funded through contributions to an in-
dependent insurance company responsible for the pension 
obligation towards the employees (defined contribution 
plans). in these plans the parent company has no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further contributions irre-
spective of the financial situation of the insurance compa-
ny. pension costs from such plans are charged to the income 
statement when incurred. the parent company has minor 
defined benefit plans. the defined benefit plans are pen-
sion plans that yearly pay out a certain percentage of the 
final salary the employee has when the employee retires. 
the pensions are paid out as from retirement and during the 
remaining life of the employee. the percentage of the salary 
is dependent of the seniority of the employees. the defined 
benefit plans typically include a spouse pension.

employee recognition
in recognition of the contribution made by dfds’ employ-
ees in a year with exceptional challenges, the board of di-
rectors has 22 december 2020 awarded up to 50 shares 
free of charge to each employee.
the shares will vest over a three-year period from january 
2021 to december 2023. the shares are in most countries 
awarded as a phantom share programme whereby the en-
titled employees will receive a cash payment in december 
2023 equal to the value of 50 dfds shares. the total num-
ber of employees eligible for the award of shares is around 
2,400 and the total value of awarded shares is around dkk 
33m, which will be proportionally expensed in the income 
statement under employee costs over the vesting period.

the fair value of the interest-bearing liabilities amounts to

ment is categorised within level 3 in the fair value hier-
archy except for the part that relates to issued corporate 
bonds of nominal nok 1,250m for which the fair value 
measurement is categorised within level 1.
the fair value of the financial liabilities is determined as 
the present value of expected future repayments and in-
terest rates. the group’s actual borrowing rate for equiv-
alent terms is used as the discount rate. the fair value 
of the issued corporate bonds nominal nok 1,250m has 
been calculated based on the quoted bond price in may 
2020 which is the latest quoted price (2019: quoted bond 
price in august 2019). the fair value of the issued corpo-
rate bonds nominal nok400m has been calculated based 
on the quoted bond price in june 2019 which is the latest 
quoted price (2019: quoted bond price in june 2019).
dkk 758m of the interest-bearing liabilities in the parent 
company fall due after five years (2019: dkk 427m). no 
unusual conditions in connection with borrowing are made. 
the loan agreements can be settled at fair value plus a 
small surcharge, whereas settlement of the corporate 
bonds requires a repurchase of the bonds. reference is

and the parent company. reference is made to the consol-
idated financial statements note 4.1.
the following specifications for the parent company are 
different to the similar specifications for the group.
financial risks
interest rate risks
an increase in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to 
the actual interest rates in 2020 would, other things being 
equal, have increased net interest payments by dkk 7m 
for the parent company in 2020 (2019: dkk 4m). a de-
crease in the interest rate of 1%-point compared to the ac-
tual interest rates in 2020 would, other things being equal, 
have had a positive effect of dkk 1m (2019: dkk 1m).

liabilities, including estimated interest payments and ex-
cluding the impact of netting agreements:

ment. due to covid-19 quarterly impairment assessments

basis for impairment testing and calculation of recovera-
ble amount reference is made to the consolidated finan-
cial statements note 3.1.5.

ates and joint ventures
impairment tests are carried out for each subsidiary, asso-
ciates and joint ventures in the parent company if there 
is indication of impairment. the individual companies are 
regarded as the lowest cash-generating units.
the estimated value in use is based on cash flows accord-
ing to management approved budget for the coming finan-
cial year and for specific subsidiaries approved buisness 
cases beond 2021 have been aplied. expectations towards

historical results, and take into account expectations to-
wards possible future fluctuations in cash flows.

the business area to which it belongs. the applied discount 
rates for 2020 and 2019 are shown in the table in the con-
solidated financial statements note 3.1.5.

note 34 accounting policies
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
are measured at cost in the parent company’s balance 
sheet. impairment testing is carried out if there is any indi-
cation of impairment. the carrying amount is written down 
to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. the impairment loss is 
recognised as financial cost in profit for the year unless 
it qualifies as a special item. if the parent company has a 
legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in sub-
sidiaries, associates and joint ventures, a provision for this 
is recognised.
equity
reserves for development costs
the reserve for development costs comprise of dfds’ de-
velopment costs corresponding to the capitalized develop-
ment cost in the balance sheet. the reserve is non distrib-
utable and cannot be used to cover deficit. the reserve is 
dissolved upon disposal of the development cost either by 
sale or if the development cost is no longer part of the en-
tity’s operation. the reserve will then be transferred to the 
distributable reserves. the reserve will be reduced and the 
distributable reserves increased concurrently with either 
depreciations or write-downs.
for a description of the hedging reserve, revaluation of 
securities and treasury shares, reference is made to con-
solidated financial statements, note 4.6.
the parent company financial statements are prepared 
pursuant to the requirements of the danish financial  
statements act concerning preparation of separate parent 
company financial statements for companies reporting 
under ifrs.
the 2020 financial statements have been prepared in ac-
cordance with international financial reporting standards  
as adopted by the eu and additional danish disclosure re-
quirements for annual reports of listed companies.
critical accounting estimates and assessments
in the process of preparing the parent company financial 
statements, a number of accounting estimates and judge-
ments have been made that affect assets and liabilities at 
the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the 
reporting period. management regularly reassesses these 
estimates and judgements, partly on the basis of histori-
cal experience and a number of other factors in the given 
circumstances.
impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries
impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries is car-
ried out if there is indication of impairment. the impair-
ment tests are based on the expected future cash flows 
for the tested subsidiaries. for further details of estimates 
and assessments relating to investments in subsidiaries 
reference is made to note 31, which mention impairment 
testing.
management is of the opinion that, except for impairment 
testing of investments in subsidiaries, no accounting es-
timates or judgements are made in connection with the 
presentation of the parent company financial statements 
that are material to the financial reporting, other than 
those disclosed in section 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
description of accounting policies
the parent company accounting policies are consistent 
with the accounting policies described in the consolidated 
financial statements with the following exceptions:
business combinations
in the parent company common control acquisitions (and 
disposals) of enterprises and activities are measured and 
recognised in accordance with the ‘book value method’ by 
which differences, if any, between purchase price and book 
value of the acquired/sold enterprise/activity are recog-
nised directly in equity.
translation of foreign currencies
foreign exchange adjustments of balances accounted for 
as part of the total net investment in enterprises that 
have a functional currency other than dkk are recognised 
in profit for the year as financial income and costs in the 
parent company financial statements. likewise, foreign 
exchange gains and losses on the portion of loans and 
derivative financial instruments that has been entered 
into to hedge the net investment in these enterprises are 
recognised directly in the profit for the year as financial 
income and costs.
dividends from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures
dividends from investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures are recognised in the parent company’s in-
come statement for the year in which the dividends are 
declared. if distributions exceed the subsidiary’s, the asso-
ciate’s or the joint venture’s comprehensive income for the 
period, an impairment test is carried out.

moving for all  
to grow since 1866
to enable trade and growth c. f. tietgen merged four 
danish steamship companies to become dfds* in 1866.
goods and coal from the uk, the world’s industrial loco-
motive at the time, were sailed to scandinavia and other 
regions where markets for, among other things, textiles and 
energy were developing. the new shipping lines conversely 
created access for farmers in these regions to the uk’s 
rapidly growing market for food and raw materials. 
dfds developed quickly in line with the growth it 
helped create. around 1900, dfds’ steam ships also 
connected farmers around the black sea with the new 
russian industrial area around st. petersburg. routes were 
launched to the usa bringing back soya cake as feed to 
european farmers. this supported their transformation 
from exporters of livestock to producers and exporters 
of processed products like butter and bacon. dfds also 
opened new routes to connect danish and scandinavian 
cities with each other and the world. all this was based on 
a fleet of more than 120 ships, among the largest in the 
world at the time. 
for many years dfds transported immigrants, who 
sought a better future, to the usa. during the world wars, 
dfds kept up supplies of critical food and coal to people in 
europe who otherwise would have been starving and unable 
to heat their homes. jobs and industry were kept alive. 
after the war, dfds’ fleet, many now powered by diesel 
engines, kept moving: goods from usa to europe, people 
between countries, goods between uk and mainland 
europe, between the mediterranean and scandinavia and to 
and from iceland. at the end of the sixties, dfds were the 
among the first to develop a roll-on-roll-off service, paving 
the way for more efficient shipping of freight units such as 
trailers carrying industrial cargo. 
the logistics activities were developed from 1972 with 
the same purpose. connecting businesses with door-door 
solutions to facilitate trade and growth. when dan trans-
port was acquired in 1998, dfds became one of the largest 
forwarding and logistics companies in northern europe. the 
merged company, dfds dan transport, was sold in 2000 to 
focus the company’s resources on further developing the 
ferry route network for freight and passengers. 
this strategy was accelerated by the acquisition of 
norfolkline in 2010 and, in addition, the logistics arm 
was now redeveloped to focus on transport corridors that 
overlapped with the route network. in 2018, dfds again 
expanded into the mediterranean through the acquisition of 
turkey’s largest freight ferry operator, u. n. ro-ro.
today, dfds is one of europe’s largest combined ferry 
and logistics companies with a continued clear purpose of 
moving for all to grow.
in january 2021, dfds entered into 
an agreement to acquire hsf logistics 
group to create northern europe’s 
leading provider of cold chain logis-
tics. the acquisition is subject to regu-
latory approval.

united steamship company.
