the result before tax amounted to a loss of dkk 104 million in 2020. 
 
the significant decrease in passenger revenue during the covid-19 
pandemic is partially offset by compensation from the state amount-
ing to dkk 914 million.  
 
• in 2020, dsb’s customers took 120.1 million journeys - a decrease of 36 percent 
compared to 2019. 
• in accordance with the agreement with the danish government, railway operations 
were essentially maintained under the original timetable for 2020, and a number of 
initiatives to prevent the spread of infection have also been effected.  
• the eu commission has approved that the danish state has so far paid out dkk 914 
million in compensation for the financial losses due to covid-19 in the period up to 
and including august 2020. 
• dsb is in dialogue with the danish ministry of transport concerning compensation for 
the period september-december 2020. 
• the danish ministry of transport has worked with dsb to prepare a basis for also 
making it possible to compensate dsb for losses in 2021 that are attributed to 
covid-19 and the restrictions and recommendations issued by the authorities. 
• high punctuality that exceeds the contract targets for both s-trains and long-distance 
& regional trains. 
• the first three of a total of 42 vectron electric locomotives ordered from siemens 
were delivered in october and put into passenger operations two months ahead of 
schedule.

finances 
due to covid-19 and the restrictions and recommendations issued by the authorities in 
order to limit the spread of infection, we saw an extraordinarily high decrease in the 
number of journeys taken in 2020. among other things, the authorities have encour-
aged both private and public sector employees to work from home and instructed the 
management report

public to generally avoid public transportation during rush hour. this has naturally had a 
significantly negative impact on both the number of journeys taken and the passenger 
revenue.  
 
it has only been possible to a limited extent 
to reduce the costs of train operations in or-
der to compensate for the lower passenger 
revenue. in accordance with an agreement 
with the danish government, dsb has es-
sentially maintained its normal timetable 
throughout 2020 in order to ensure the nec-
essary mobility in society. among other 
things, this mobility was maintained to en-
sure that people with critical social functions 
were able to get to and from work. 
  
from 11 march to 31 december 2020, 
covid-19 had a significantly negative im-
pact on dsb’s result. the impact has been 
calculated to be in the range of dkk -1,500 million. this is a net loss, mostly due to lost 
passenger revenue compared to the same period of 2019 adjusted for compensating 
cost reductions. dsb has initiated and implemented extraordinary cost reduction pro-
grammes amounting to around dkk 180 million for 2020. we have also applied for and 
received funds from the aid packages announced by the state. 
 
in september, the danish government let it be known that they would offer full com-
pensation for the financial losses resulting from covid-19. on 21 december 2020, the 
eu commission approved that the danish state pays compensation for covid-19 re-
lated net losses up to and including august 2020 amounting to dkk 914 million. dsb 
has received this compensation. 
 
for the period 1 september - 31 december 2020, the calculated net loss amounted to 
approximately dkk 600 million. a process has been agreed upon with the danish minis-
try of transport for applying to the eu commission for compensation for the losses in 
this period. the payment of the compensation is conditional upon the eu commission 
approving this state aid, and the compensation is, therefore, not included in this annual 
report.  
 
on this basis, in 2020 we have now incurred a loss before tax of dkk 104 million, which 
is dkk 1,537 million better than in 2019. however, the results for 2019 were impacted 
by the write down of rolling stock amounting to dkk 1,686 million. if the write down for 
2019 are excluded, the result for 2020 is dkk 147 million worse than in 2019. this is 
due to the outstanding compensation for losses due to covid-19 for the period sep-
tember-december 2020 and a generally lower level of costs than in 2019. on top of 
this, there are less depreciation due to the large write down of 2019, net profits of dkk 
110 million from the sale of properties and the positive adjustment of the non-dedeucti-
ble vat for prior years amounting to a dkk 67 million.

it is to be expected that covid-19 and the introduced restrictions and recommenda-
tions will also impact the number of travellers and the finances very negatively in 2021. 
together with the danish ministry of transport, dsb has prepared a basis for how it can 
be possible to also compensate dsb for losses attributed to covid-19 in 2021.  
 
“we have a large task ahead of us, first to win 
back the customers to public transport and then 
to create growth. we are ready.” 
flemming jensen, ceo 
taking the train must be safe 
in 2020, customers took 120.1 million journeys compared to 187.2 million in 2019. this 
corresponds to a decrease of 36%. the decrease in the number of journeys was seen 
across all markets. after a good start to the year, where, up until mid-march, we saw a 
growth in the number of journeys and increased market share for great belt crossings, 
covid-19 then began to have a significant negative impact on the number of journeys. 
after the controlled reopening of denmark from the beginning of may, the summer pe-
riod saw an increase in the number of journeys - even if this was still at a significantly 
lower level than in 2019. the summer’s increases were positively impacted by an or-
ange campaign that sold over half a million additional tickets. in addition, 50,000 ‘re-
jsepas’ (travel passes) were offered which generated 225,000 new journeys.  
 
however, with the second wave of covid-19 and the introduction of new restrictions 
from august onwards - including requirements for wearing masks in public transport, 
requiring seat reservations, people being encouraged to travel outside of the rush hour, 
and working from home as much as possible - we have noted a significant decrease in 
the demand for train journeys. 
 
our focus has been and remains on contributing to reducing the spread of infection and 
making it safe to travel by train for both our customers and employees. over the course 
of the year, we have launched a number of initiatives - including developing a new 
online app that shows the passenger density of s-trains, setting up distancing markings 
at stations and trains, installing hand sanitiser units and doing additional cleaning on 
trains and at stations. these initiatives have generally been well received by our cus-
tomers and, despite covid-19, it has been possible to keep customer satisfaction levels 
at a high level of 7.9 (on a scale of 0-10), and our reputation in 2020 has improved to a 
previously unseen extent.  
 
these implemented initiatives help make our customers and employees feel safe in the 
here and now, but they must also contribute to making it safe for customers to return to 
taking the train when the covid-19 situation allows for that again. we are aware that 
when it comes to winning customers back, we must take into account the potential 
long-term structural changes that covid-19 is expected to result in, among other 
things, a foreseeable increasing proportion of people working from home and more 
online meetings. these are factors that we will take into account in our product offerings 
and services for, among others, commuters and those taking business trips.

high punctuality and meeting the contract targets 
the customer punctuality for both s-trains and long-distance & regional trains has im-
proved compared to last year and exceeds the traffic contract’s targets. with a punctu-
ality of 94.4% for s-trains and 86.7% for long-distance & regional trains, we have 
achieved the highest level of punctuality in five years.  
 
the customer punctuality figures are positively impacted by a more robust timetable 
that has resulted in faults in tracks and signals having less impact on operations. the 
renewed focus on the processes for the maintenance of rolling stock has also resulted in 
fewer faults and more stable operations. finally, delays from sweden - which impact the 
entire long-distance & regional train traffic significantly - have also decreased com-
pared to past years due, among other things, to covid-19 related limitations on traffic. 
the transfer of lines to other operators 
the line between odense and svendborg and the line between vejle and struer were 
transferred over to arriva as of 13 december 2020. this was a result of a political 
agreement from 2017. the transfer of these lines has resulted in a decision to close 
dsb’s workshops in fredericia. 
 
in addition, the line between roskilde and køge was transferred to lokaltog, also as of 
13 december 2020. the transfer was a result of an agreement between the danish min-
istry of transport and region zealand from 2018.  
 
due to a political agreement from 2017, the practical responsibility for purchasing traffic 
across Øresund between copenhagen and malmø was handed over to the swedish traf-
fic purchasing company, skånetrafiken. after a call for tenders, skånetrafiken chose sj 
as its operator, and it is intended that the line between copenhagen and malmø is to be 
serviced by sj when the timetable changes in december 2023. the maintenance of the 
77 swedish-owned Øresund train sets has been transferred to sj and the maintenance 
company mantena in sweden with the timetable change as of 13 december 2020. as a 
result, the activities at the workshop in helgoland have been reduced and we have dis-
missed a number of employees.  
sustainability - environmentally friendly electric trains will streamline operations 
dsb’s overall objective is to ensure that there is “room for everyone on the journey to-
wards sustainability.” the objective is based on our public service task of reducing con-
gestion and being a climate-friendly alternative mode of transport thus increasing our 
significant contribution to the green transition and the meeting of denmark’s climate 
targets. 
 
we have, therefore, formulated four ambitious goals for sustainability that are to be met be-
tween now and 2030: we want to be completely carbon neutral, we want to reduce our en-
ergy consumption by 50%, we want to avoid emitting particles from the train engines, and we 
want to reuse at least 90% of our waste.  
 
a large part of dsb’s contribution to a sustainable denmark is to be achieved via the planned 
modernisation of the rail network, the purchase of electric trains, and the establishment of 
new modern workshops.

in 2020, we have taken another important step in the transition from the aging diesel trains 
towards having a modern and uniform electric train fleet with the delivery of the first three 
vectron electric locomotives that will pull dsb’s double-decker coaches. from october on-
wards, the electric locomotives were put into operation in the regional traffic on zealand. 
from february 2021, we will gradually begin reducing our use of me diesel locomotives 
thanks to increased use of vectron locomotives. this will result in significant reductions of 
both co2 emissions, energy consumption and particle emissions. the new electric locomotives 
will also result in more profitable operations as they are phased in.  
 
the purchasing of new railway carriages has already been effected and they are expected to 
be used in the international traffic from copenhagen to hamburg in 2023. the purchasing 
process for the new electric train sets is in its final tender phase, and final offers have been 
received. the new electric train sets are expected to be put into operation for danish domes-
tic traffic from 2024 onwards.  
 
we are in the process of building three new workshops that, among other things, will main-
tain the train of the future and it is critical for our sustainability strategy that these work-
shops become as sustainable as possible. we are, therefore, working closely with the danish 
green building council to ensure that the workshops are certified by the dgnb gold standard.  
 
our sustainability targets are ambitious, and they can only be attained if - together with our 
suppliers - we ensure sustainable and responsible solutions across the company. we have, 
therefore, amongst other things in connection with our purchasing, focused on supporting 
sustainable solutions that are also financially viable and effective. in connection with calls for 
tenders, therefore, we also invite suppliers and business partners to identify such solutions.  
 
“i have no doubt that we can make a significant 
contribution to reducing congestion and 
strengthening the green transition in denmark 
as soon as we reach the other side of covid-19.”

financial activities 
the pre-tax earnings in 2020 amounted to a 
loss of dkk 104 million, which is dkk 1,537 
million less than in 2019.  
 
the result for 2019 was negatively impacted 
by the write down of rolling stock for long-
distance & regional trains - including write 
down of 11 phased out ic4 train sets. the 
write down have also resulted in less depre-
ciation in 2020.  
 
the result for 2020 is negatively impacted 
by covid-19 and the restrictions issued in 
that context. the number of journeys and 
passenger revenue are significantly lower 
than in previous years. cost reduction 
measures have been implemented in order 
to partially compensate for the lost revenue. 
by agreement with the danish government, 
however, the train operations have been 
maintained in all material respects, and this 
has limited the opportunities for cost reduc-
tions. funds have also been applied for and 
received from the aid packages announced 
by the state. 
 
following approval from the eu commission, 
the danish state has paid dkk 914 million in 
compensation for lost revenue due to 
covid-19 in the period from march to au-
gust. the amount has been included in this 
year’s result before tax under net revenue 
as traffic contract revenues since the com-
pensation is viewed as part of the renegotia-
tion provision of the traffic contract. dsb 
has complied with the danish government’s 
decision to keep operating public transport 
systems, and this has had financial conse-
quences for dsb in the form of lost passen-
ger revenue. the compensation for the pe-
riod september to december has not been 
included due to the uncertainty of whether 
the eu commission would approve it. if it is 
approved, dsb will also apply for compensa-
tion for the period. 
 
dsb has calculated that, in the period 11 
march - 31 december 2020, covid-19 has 
had an impact on dsb’s result amounting to 
approximately dkk -1,500 million. this is a 
net loss that can largely be attributed to lost 
passenger revenue compared to the same 
period of 2019, after the deduction of com-
pensating cost reductions and salary com-
pensation via the state’s aid packages. dsb 
has initiated and implemented extraordinary 
cost reduction programmes amounting to 
around dkk 180 million. 
 
unlike previous annual reports, a result be-
fore tax has not been adjusted for non-re-
curring items for 2020. this has previously 
been used in order to provide a better com-
parison of the results with previous years 
but due to covid-19, this is extremely diffi-
cult. 
 
the balance sheet total amounted to dkk 
12,147 million at the end of 2020, compared 
with dkk 12,081 million at 31 december 
2019. 
 
in 2020, dsb invested dkk 885 million 
(dkk 858 million). investments were mostly 
in heavy maintenance of long-distance and 
regional trains and s-trains. in addition, 
there are advance payments for new railway 
coaches and new workshops. 
 
interest bearing debt, net has been reduced 
by dkk 494 million compared with 31 de-
cember 2019 and amounted to dkk 2,826 
million on 31 december 2020 (cf. note 4.5). 
 
in 2020, return on invested capital after tax 
amounted to 0.0 (-13.8), gearing was 2.2 
(1.6) and the solvency ratio was 33.7 
(36.0). despite a challenging year, dsb has 
been able to maintain satisfactory levels of

the development in net revenue is nega-
tively impacted by a major decrease in the 
number of journeys due to covid-19.

passenger revenue amounted to dkk 3,411 
million, which is dkk 1,762 million lower 
than in 2019. this is mainly attributed to the 
large decrease in the number of journeys.  
 
the loss of revenue is only partially offset by 
the state having paid dkk 914 million in 
compensation. the amount is calculated as 
a net loss, mainly consisting of lost passen-
ger revenue minus cost savings and used 
compensation packages, etc. 
 
metro double factor 
for the passenger revenue, dsb includes the effect of the current 
revenue-sharing model in the greater copenhagen area. the 
model involves metroselskabet i/s (the owner of the copenhagen 
metro) receiving a larger proportion of the total passenger reve-
nue in the greater copenhagen area, i.e., its share is higher than 
metroselskabet’s proportion of the total number of journeys. this 
larger proportion (the metro double factor) is deducted from dsb’s 
passenger revenue.

passenger revenue for long-distance & re-
gional trains is dkk 1,387 million lower than 
in 2019. the development is mainly due to a 
decrease in the number of journeys of 31.6 
million or 42%. the decrease in the number 
of journeys is seen in all markets - though 
the most significant decrease is for Øresund 
crossings over the bridge and for zealand, 
including kystbanen/the coast line and the 
kastrup line. 
 
in 2020, s-trains had 35.6 million fewer 
journeys than in 2019, amounting to a de-
crease of 32%. this has resulted in a de-
crease in passenger revenue of dkk 375 
million. 
 
the traffic contract revenues from the state 
amounted to dkk 4,819 million, which is 
dkk 794 million more than in 2019. the 
compensation from the state of dkk 914 
million is the main reason for this increase. 
the traffic contract payments in 2020 were 
reduced by dkk 70 million compared to 
2019 as a result of supplemental contract 
19 of 2017, which reduces the annual con-
tract payments by dkk 207 million in 2018 
and will rise to a deduction of dkk 380 mil-
lion from 2022. in addition, the traffic con-
tract payments in 2019 included compensa-
tion for work done in the period 2012 to 
april 2019 in connection with the new signal

plemental contract 25. 
 
sales of repair and maintenance services for 
rolling stock, etc. amounted to dkk 312 mil-
lion and have increased by dkk 14 million 
relative to 2019.  
 
sales and leasing of rolling stock amounted 
to dkk 159 million, which is dkk 109 million 
higher than in 2019. this is a result of sell-
ing the desiro train sets to arriva in connec-
tion with the transfer of train traffic in mid- 
and west jutland and the transfer of the 
svendborg line. 
 
work performed on its own account and 
capitalised amounted to dkk 468 million 
and has decreased by dkk 12 million com-
pared with 2019. the decrease is due to less 
heavy maintenance of rolling stock and a 
smaller number of capitalizable supple-
mental works. 
 
other operating income decreased by dkk 
65 million and amounted to dkk 1,294 mil-
lion. the decrease is mainly attributed to 
lower revenues from dsb’s 7-eleven kiosks, 
amounting to a decrease of dkk 178 million 
due to the covid-19 situation. on the other 
hand, net profits from the selling of proper-
ties increased to dkk 110 million - mainly in 
connection with entering into a joint venture 
agreement with ny valby udvikling a/s con-
cerning the development of a project involv-
ing construction rights for dsb’s area at 
grønttorvet in valby. finally, dsb has made 
use of the danish state’s aid packages for 
furloughed workers and for covering fixed 
costs. 
expenses  
expenses totalled dkk 9,162 million. (dkk 
9,371 million) and have thus been reduced 
by dkk 209 million. 
 
the lower costs are generally due to the 
continuing work on streamlining the organi-
sation as part of the streamlining pro-
gramme called ‘robust dsb’. in addition, 
savings of dkk 180 million, aimed at offset-
ting the negative financial consequences of 
covid-19, were also realised in 2020 . 
  
expenses for raw materials and consuma-
bles amounted to dkk 1,941 million and 
represents a decrease of dkk 17 million. 
the development is impacted by a reduced 
consumption of goods in dsb’s 7-eleven ki-
osks due to the smaller sales volume. con-
versely, expenses for the purchasing of pre-
viously leased desiro train sets that were 
sold on to arriva increased. 
 
other external expenses amounted to dkk 
3,528 million, representing a decrease of 
dkk 149 million compared to the year be-
fore. the decrease can mainly be attributed 
to lower expenses for replacement transport 
and lower expenses for commissions, infra-
structure fees and marketing. in addition, 
the adjustment of non-deductible vat for 
previous years amounted to dkk 67 million. 
however, there has also been an increase of 
consultancy fees, mainly in connection with 
preparing to purchase new rolling stock and 
the s-train of the future. 
 
staff costs amounted to dkk 3,693 million 
and have fallen by dkk 43 million in com-
parison to 2019. the decrease is due to hav-
ing fewer employees in 2020, among other 
things, due to the continued streamlining in-
itiatives. at the end of the year, dsb had 
6,625 full-time employees, representing a 
decrease of 194 employees or 3% compared 
to 2019. 
amortisation, depreciation and write 
downs 
amortisation, depreciation and write downs 
amounted to dkk 1,335 million compared 
with dkk 3,551 million in 2019. the de-
crease is due to 2019 being impacted by 
write-downs of dkk 1,686 million and the 
depreciation of rolling stock in 2020 have 
been lower as a direct result of the write-
down.

the result before tax in the 4th quarter of 
2020 showed a profit of dkk 537 million and 
was significantly impacted by the dkk 914

however, the underlying result remains neg-
atively impacted by the covid-19 situation. 
 
the net revenue amounted to dkk 2,922

in the 4th quarter of 2019. 
 
the passenger revenue was negatively im-
pacted by fewer journeys and amounted to 
dkk 831 million for the quarter, compared 
to dkk 1,362 million for the same quarter of 
2019. 
 
traffic contract revenues from the state 
amounted to dkk 1,888 million, which is 
dkk 899 million more than in the 4th quar-
ter of 2019 - and is a result of the compen-
sation from the state of dkk 914 million. 
 
the compensation for covid-19 related 
losses was provided as a result of the rene-
gotiation clause in dsb’s traffic contract with 
the state which can be used in extraordinary 
circumstances. the compensation package 
is included in the traffic contract revenue. 
revenues from the state’s other general aid 
packages are included under other operat-
ing revenue. 
 
sales of repair and maintenance services for 
rolling stock, etc. amounted to dkk 83 mil-
lion. the selling and leasing of rolling stock 
generated dkk 120 million, which is an in-
crease of dkk 111 million compared to 2019 
due to the selling of train sets in connection 
with termination of activities. 
 
work carried out at dsb’s own expense re-
lated to heavy maintenance and capitaliza-
ble works amounted to dkk 121 million. 
 
other operating income amounted to dkk 
335 million, compared to dkk 356 million in 
2019. the lower sales volumes in dsb’s 7-
eleven kiosks have been partially offset by 
selling spare parts in connection with the 
transfer of the maintenance of the swedish 
Øresund train sets.

liquidity 
dsb wants to ensure that it always has ap-
propriate levels of liquidity that support 
agreements that have been entered into in 
the form of incurring ongoing costs and also 
to have the capacity to initiate major invest-
ments projects such as buying new rolling 
stock, etc. 
 
 
 
results 
14 
in the early stages of covid-19, dsb 
strengthened its liquidity by another dkk 
1,500 million via bank facilities. this in-
creased the total available liquidity to dkk 
4,521 million by the end of the 1st quarter 
of 2020. the liquidity reserve was to ensure 
that dsb had sufficient liquidity to last 1-1.5 
years based on the risk of lower passenger 
revenues. 
 
throughout 2020, the liquidity levels have 
been ample and even improved due to the 
option to delay the payment of a-taxes and 
labour market (am) contributions until 2021 
(dkk 294 million) and from receiving dkk 
914 million in compensation payments from 
the state.  
 
by the end of the year, the liquidity reserve 
amounted to dkk 8,317 million. specifically, 
the liquidity reserve was grown via agree-
ments that help to ensure liquidity for 
agreements that are already signed con-
cerning the purchase of electric locomotives 
and train coaches, but it was also used to 
cover future payments for environmentally 
friendly electric train sets. 
 
dsb’s strong focus on green investments is 
the reason why loan agreements have been 
set up with both the nordic investment 
bank and the european investment bank.  
 
dsb signed a loan agreement with the nor-
dic investment bank for eur 400 million 
(dkk 2,975 million) with a maturity of 15 
years. at the end of 2020, eur 267 million 
(dkk 1,986 million) have not yet been paid 
out. the loan will be paid out over the 
course of the next one and a half years.  
 
the european investment bank has also 
agreed to a project loan framework amount-
ing to eur 500 million (dkk 3,719 million) 
for new train sets. the framework includes 
an agreement for eur 150 million. the loans 
have been structured to have a 25-year ma-
turity date. as of the end of 2020, payments 
have not yet been made. 
sustainability 
dsb entered into a new era in 2020 with the 
introduction of the new environmentally 
friendly siemens vectron electric locomo-
tives (eb electric locomotives). in the years 
ahead, the diesel trains will gradually be 
phased out and a new fleet of environmen-
tally friendly electric trains will be intro-
duced. 
 
operating a key part of the transport sector 
means that dsb carries out an important 
societal task by connecting denmark in a 
way that helps prevent congestion on roads 
and contributes to sustainable mobility.  
 
the transport sector as a whole represents a 
significant proportion of denmark’s emission 
of greenhouse gases. between now and 
2030, dsb will make a significant contribu-
tion to ensuring that the transport sector’s 
co2 emissions are reduced, and that den-
mark can realise its climate targets. 
 
the train is already now one of the best en-
vironmentally and climate friendly modes of 
transport. at the same time, on many lines 
the train is an effective way of getting from 
a to b as even during rush hour trains can 
transport a lot of people from city centre to 
city centre without congesting the main road 
networks.  
dsb sees a great deal of potential, there-
fore, in developing the railway even further 
so that it will continue to contribute to real-
ising the green transport sector of the future 
- particularly when it comes to passenger 
transport.  
objectives and initiatives 
dsb intends to launch several initiatives 
aimed at ensuring that the train becomes 
the preferred mode of transport for danes 
when everyday life begins returning to nor-
mal after covid-19.  
 
dsb has specified ambitious goals that will 
make a significant contribution to making 
denmark greener with reduced congestion

15 
on the roads. in that context, dsb is work-
ing with four climate and environmental ob-
jectives which are to be met by 2030: 
• objective 1: co2 neutral - all of dsb is to 
be supplied with renewable energy 
• objective 2: reducing energy consump-
tion by 50% - driven by improved energy 
efficiency  
• objective 3: no particle emissions from 
the locomotives’ engines - avoiding im-
pacting the environment 
• objective 4: at least 90% of waste is to 
be reused - i.e., turned into new re-
sources. 
the objectives have provided the framework 
for the work and the results achieved in 
2020. dsb continues to work on identifying 
initiatives between now and 2030 that will 
ensure that the environmental and climate 
objectives are realised. 
 
objective 1: co2-neutral 
tonne co2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dsb is in the process of acquiring a co2 
neutral supply of electricity. a co2 neutral 
dsb will reduce co2 emissions by approxi-
mately 250,000 tonnes compared to 2018. 
the initiatives that have already been identi-
fied are estimated to result in savings of be-
tween 80-90% in terms of co2 emissions, 
mainly due to the new electric train fleet. 
the remaining 10-20% of the goal achieve-
ment will be addressed by future initiatives 
that are as yet unidentified. 
 
objective 2: energy consumption reduced by 
50% 
gj (million) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in 2018, dsb’s energy consumption 
amounted to just under 4 million gigajoules 
(gj). the already scheduled initiatives will 
realise around 75% of the objective of re-
ducing energy consumption by 50% in 2030 
- mainly from energy efficiency initiatives. 
the remaining efficiency initiatives are yet 
to be identified, but they will mainly be re-
lated to train operations and properties.

trains. based on the current plan, this is es-
timated to be achieved in 2028. 
 
objective 4: recycling waste 
recycling percentage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
today, dsb recycles or reuses around half 
of its waste, and it has started mapping the 
initiatives that can contribute to realising the 
objective of recycling or reusing 90% of 
waste in 2030. dsb believes that there is 
potential for significantly increased recycling 
widely in the company. 
 
for all future acquisitions, there will also be 
requirements for a high degree of recyclabil-
ity. one example of this is the siemens eb 
electric locomotives, which can be 98% re-
cycled once their service life ends. 
new electric locomotives 
the largest single contribution to realising 
the environmental and climate goals will be 
in replacing the diesel fuel rolling stock with 
electric rolling stock. 
 
dsb has taken an important step in this di-
rection in 2020, as the first three eb electric 
locomotives were delivered and the first one 
was deployed in the regional traffic on zea-
land from october. the other two were de-
ployed in december. in 2021, additional eb 
electric locomotives will also be put into op-
eration. 
 
at first, the new eb electric locomotives will 
replace the aging ea electric locomotives. 
from february 2021, the use of me diesel 
locomotives will gradually be reduced due to 
increased deployment of the eb electric lo-
comotives. this results in significant reduc-
tions of co2 emissions, energy consumption 
and particle emissions. 
 
it is estimated that the eb electric locomo-
tives will as a minimum reduce the emis-
sions of particles from train operations by 
13%, or 27,000 tonnes of co2 per year 
when they are fully phased in. in addition, 
there will also be a 10-tonne annual reduc-
tion of particles, amounting to 60% of dsb’s 
total particle emissions from train opera-
tions. 
 
the eb electric locomotives are thus an im-
portant part of realising dsb’s environmen-
tal and climate objectives between now and 
2030. 
new workshops 
dsb is also in the process of building three 
brand new workshops which are intended to 
service the locomotives and trains of the fu-
ture. a core part of dsb’s strategy and real-
ising the environmental and climate goals is 
making sure that the workshops are as sus-
tainable as possible. dsb is, therefore, 
working closely with the danish green build-
ing council with the aim of having the work-
shops certified in accordance with the dgnb 
sustainability standard.  
 
the project is proceeding according to the 
plan, as dsb is working on gaining a dgnb 
gold certification for the workshops once 
they are ready in 2025. in that case, it will 
be the result of targeted initiatives aimed at 
ensuring the workshops are sustainable 
throughout all of the construction phases.

services each year and in that context, we

ensuring that sustainability is factored into 
the entire supply chain. 
 
in 2020, a commission was set up for sus-
tainable purchasing. the committee is to en-
sure that dsb works together with suppliers 
to create sustainable and responsible solu-
tions. in future tender rounds, dsb will, 
therefore, have a greater focus than previ-
ously on inviting the tender participants to 
identify such sustainable solutions - for ex-
ample, via energy-saving solutions and by 
minimising the use of harmful substances 
and non-recyclable materials.  
 
with this approach, dsb’s purchasing pro-
cesses will not only in themselves be more 
sustainable, but they will also encourage 
suppliers to develop sustainable solutions 
that benefit the climate, the environment, 
and the danes’ opportunities for climate-
friendly travel by train. 
 
this is the beginning of initiatives that will 
contribute to realising the objective of recy-
cling 90% of waste by 2030.  
 
dsb has also started an experiment with 
sorting customer waste and recycling it. the 
experiment was started in november at the 
roskilde and vejle train stations. together 
with a supplier, dsb has develop a waste 
sorting solution for this experiment. the so-
lution uses a dustbin with compartments for 
sorting waste in three different categories 
and also for separate disposal of cans/bot-
tles with a deposit for the benefit of others 
(who can return them and collect the 
money). several municipalities have also 
contacted dsb and asked to be part of the 
experiment and to make the waste sorting 
solution available in surrounding urban 
spaces. dsb is expecting to launch more 
waste sorting experiments in 2021. 
 
besides a green transition involving its pri-
mary operations, dsb is also working in a 
targeted manner to make travelling by train 
even more attractive to customers. more ap-
pealing trains will encourage people to 
choose travel by train instead of using their 
cars, which will both benefit the environ-
ment and reduce road congestion, particu-
larly in and around the major cities. 
 
in december, dsb introduced a new express 
route between copenhagen, odense and 
aarhus called lyn+ (lightning+). lyn+ is an 
express line without many stops. dsb ex-
pects this to be a particularly attractive op-
tion for business trips. 
 
dsb is also working on developing and 
launching new types of tickets that should 
make it even more attractive to take the 
train - for example, for commuters and 
those taking business trips. 
 
the new rolling stock and coming infrastruc-
ture improvements will also significantly re-
duce travel times and the frequency of de-
partures will also be increased on some of 
the most popular lines in denmark. 
 
the transport sector is undergoing a major 
transition between now and 2030, and it is 
dsb’s ambition to ensure that the transition 
allows for the railway network and dsb in 
particular to continue to act as the green 
‘backbone’ of future passenger transport. 
 
dsb is thus well on its way towards sustain-
ability.

2020 started out with a positive develop-
ment in the number of journeys in january 
and february. in february, 541,000 more 
journeys were travelled than in the same 
period in 2019, corresponding to index 104. 
in the following months, however, the num-
ber of journeys travelled fell significantly 
due to covid-19.  
 
all together, 120.1 million journeys were 
travelled in 2020 compared to 187.2 million 
journeys in 2019. this represents a de-
crease of 36%. this is attributed to covid-
19 and the announced restrictions and 
guidelines from the public authorities aimed 
at slowing the spread of infection - including 
requirements for wearing face masks and 
making seat reservations and the encour-
agement to travel outside of rush hours and 
work from home as much as possible. 
 
the reduction in the number of journeys is 
seen across all markets, but the biggest de-
crease has been for journeys with long-dis-
tance & regional trains. 
 
figure 2: percentage change in number of jour-
neys 
(2020 compared to 2019) 
 
in 2020, track works were completed on the 
routes between ringsted and næstved, ros-
kilde and holbæk, ringsted and slagelse, 
fredericia and aarhus, aarhus and aalborg 
and there were track closures resulting from 
the s-train signal programme. these are 
not assessed as having had a significant im-
pact on the number of journeys when con-
sidering the impact of covid-19. 
 
as of 13 december, the traffic on the vejle-
struer line, the svendborg line and lille syd 
(roskilde-køge) were transferred to other 
operators. in the future, this will result in a 
decrease in the number of journeys for the 
west market (jutland and funen) and for 
zealand, including kystbanen (the coast 
line) and the kastrup line.

43.7 million journeys were travelled by 
long-distance & regional trains in 2020 
compared to 75.3 million in 2019 - a de-
crease of 42%. january and february 
showed a 1% growth rate overall. in march, 
the number of journeys decreased by 50% 
compared to 2019. the decrease continued 
in april to 78%, and for the 2nd quarter, the 
total decrease was 64%. in the 3rd quarter, 
the curve started to reverse and the de-
crease was 37%. the customers were very 
receptive to the summer campaigns, which 
resulted in a positive development in the 
number of journeys. in the 4th quarter, the 
second wave of covid-19 hit the country 
and additional restrictions were imposed. 
this resulted in a decrease in the number of 
 
 
 
 
results 
19 
journeys of 48% compared to 2019 - with 
the largest decrease in december, of 56%. 
 
Øresund crossings amounted to 5.0 million 
journeys in 2020, which is 59% fewer than 
in 2019. the Øresund line was also impacted 
by the shutting down of the danish-swedish 
border. 
 
the number of journeys on zealand, includ-
ing kystbanen (the coast line) and the 
kastrup line, amounted to 23.6 million in 
2020, a decrease of 43% compared to 2019. 
the traffic in this region was growing in jan-
uary and february, but fell significantly dur-
ing the rest of the year. kystbanen (the 
coast line) and the kastrup line were par-
ticularly impacted by a lower number of 
journeys to and from copenhagen airport. 
in addition, the roskilde-køge line on lille 
syd was also transferred to another opera-
tor. 
 
for west (jutland and funen), the number 
of journeys decreased by 26% compared to 
2019. after a growth rate of 6% in january 
and february compared to the same period 
in 2019, the number of journeys decreased 
by 36% in march compared to the same 
month a year earlier. for the 2nd quarter, 
the total decrease amounted to 52%, while 
the trend reversed in the 3rd quarter where 
the decrease was 13%. in the 4th quarter 
the decrease was 28% - but this includes 
the transfer of traffic on the vejle-struer line 
and the svendborg line. west (jutland and 
funen) is thus the market that was least im-
pacted by covid-19. 
 
the number of east/west journeys (crossing 
the great belt) was 34% fewer in 2020 
compared to 2019. there was an increase of 
9% in january and february, partly at-
tributed to an increased supply of orange 
and orange free tickets. in addition to the 
increased sales of orange and orange free 
tickets, the development was impacted by a 
changed schedule for international trains 
which now cross the great belt. the de-
crease in march amounted to 48%, followed 
by a decrease of 76% in april. the overall 
decrease in the 2nd quarter amounted to 
60%, in the 3rd quarter it was 20% and in 
the 4th quarter it was 44%. the positive de-
velopment in the 3rd quarter was helped 
along by the ‘rejs i danmark’ (‘travel in 
denmark’) campaign. for east/west, the 
‘rejsepas’ (‘travel pass’) contributed with 
90,000 journey and orange and orange 
free tickets contributed with 564,000 jour-
neys. new restrictions from september on-
wards - including requiring passengers to 
wear face masks - were a contributing factor 
to customers choosing an alternative mode 
of transport for long journeys or replacing 
their business travel with virtual meetings . 
 
there were 76.3 million s-train journeys in 
2020, which is 35.6 million fewer than in 
2019. after a 2% increase in the number of 
journeys in january and february, the trend 
reversed just as on the other lines. all in all, 
the number of journeys for the year de-
creased by 32% compared to 2019. 
increasing market share and growth in the 
number of journeys at the beginning of 2020 
january and february showed a positive de-
velopment in the total number of journeys, 
as 655,000 million more journeys were trav-
elled compared to the same period of 2019. 
 
the market share for traffic across the great 
belt was at 25.0% in both january and feb-
ruary, which is the highest level since 2016. 
this has continued the positive trend from 
the 2nd half of 2019. the total market for 
great belt crossings also grew during this 
period, but trains were the only mode of 
transport that gained market shares in both 
january and february 2020. 
marketing initiatives adapted to the current 
situation 
during a turbulent year, dsb has continually 
tried to remain focused on what is most im-
portant to customers as the year went by. 
since march, the focus has been on ensuring 
safe journeys during these covid-19 times. 
therefore, a number of initiatives were 
 
 
results 
20 
launched, including information campaigns 
and other customer-oriented communica-
tions. as the infection rates and restrictions 
eased, dsb has focused on providing good 
offers for inspiring train journeys driven by a 
desire to discover denmark during a sum-
mer where many chose not to travel abroad. 
these initiatives were well-received by cus-
tomers which can, for example, be seen in 
dsb’s reputation ratings, which improved 
significantly in 2020. 
 
2020 got off to a good start with a market-
ing campaign for orange tickets. it was a 
record-breaking year with 137,000 orange 
tickets sold - 38% more than in 2019. at the 
beginning of 2020, dsb’s communications 
were also focused on dsb’s four environ-
mental and climate-related objectives, 
spreading the message that the train is a 
sustainable mode of transport. the cam-
paign was, in particular, targeted at face-
book and linkedin. 
 
when denmark was shut down in march, the 
commercial and sales-focused messages 
were replaced by messages focusing on 
safety. 
 
denmark gradually began reopening in may 
as the infection rates dropped. dsb experi-
enced a renewed appetite for travel and 
opened, on an initiative of the danish minis-
try of transport, the largest summer sales 
drive ever, offering a total of 1 million or-
ange tickets at a maximum price of dkk 99. 
a special deal was also introduced in the 
form of the ‘rejsepas’ (‘travel pass’), a 
ticket that provided unlimited travel 
throughout the public transport system for a 
week (of the travellers’ choice) during the 
school summer holidays for dkk 299. 
 
the marketing revolved around what every-
one had missed during the spring: positive 
experiences with friends and family in the 
beautiful danish summer landscape. the 
campaigns were prepared together with or-
ganisations such as visitdenmark and were 
supported by ideas for experiences close to 
train stations in particular but also experi-
ences in denmark in general. 
 
the rejsepas, which had been agreed upon 
with and financed by the danish ministry of 
transport and limited to 50,000 units, was 
sold out in three days. the sale of orange 
tickets was also a big success,  and over 
565,000 orange tickets were sold - 397,000 
of which were for great belt crossings. this 
corresponds to index 805 compared to the 
sales of 2019’s summer campaign. 
 
in the last part of 2020, when working from 
home was once again recommended, dsb’s 
marketing began focusing on customers and 
their safety while travelling by train. 
 
the last campaign of 2020 was the christ-
mas season campaign, offering orange tick-
ets for weekend travel from 31 october to 
13 december. the campaign sales were 
negatively impacted by the new restrictions 
across the country and the result was 
122,500 tickets sold, which corresponds to 
index 67 compared to 2019’s christmas 
campaign. 
 
in future, dsb will support a sustainable re-
opening of society after covid-19. dsb ex-
pects, therefore, that it will once again com-
municate commercially - including how the 
train is a sustainable transport choice - once 
the conditions in society allow this. 
covid-19 initiatives 
during the pandemic, dsb has been in close 
dialogue with the public authorities, followed 
their recommendations and continually ad-
justed its initiatives. as a result, a number 
of changes have been made in daily opera-
tions, which support the authorities’ efforts 
to limit the spread of infection. 
 
dsb provided hand sanitiser dispensers and 
displayed face mask banners at an early 
stage to remind customers about the im-
portance of following the recommendations 
of the public authorities.

21 
dsb has also implemented extra cleaning at 
stations and in trains underway - including 
disinfecting the contact surfaces. addition-
ally, employees have been posted at certain 
stations to remind customers about the 
guidelines, and a new online app (plads-
paarejsen.dk) has been developed and 
launched where customers can see the oc-
cupancy of s-trains.  
 
it is expected that customers will also need 
more flexible products in the future, for ex-
ample, due to increased working from 
home. dsb has, therefore, begun develop-
ing a more flexible commuter ticket product.  
 
as part of this effort, dsb is entering into a 
partnership with the other traffic companies 
to create a more permanent concept that 
can meet the customers’ need for flexibility 
and thus provide a more attractive sustaina-
ble choice of transport to commuters in ‘the 
new normal everyday’.  
lyn+ (lightning+) is a new premium prod-
uct 
dsb has deployed more trains to the re-
gional traffic between east and west den-
mark. this has been done on the basis of a 
political agreement. 
 
lyn+ is a new concept that was launched 
with the change in time tables on 13 de-
cember and with presales that began in oc-
tober. 
 
this is an improved type of product for cus-
tomers, involving trains running from co-
penhagen to aarhus with just a single stop 
along the way - in odense. this allows cus-
tomers to save up to 9 minutes per depar-
ture compared to the normal ‘lyn’ (‘light-
ning’) trains. the trains have eight depar-
tures during rush hours on weekdays, dsb 
1’ offers service and a coffee express 
onboard. seat reservations are required in 
order to ensure that lyn+ is perceived as a 
premium product where customers can sit 
and work or relax without being disturbed. 
the product is particularly attractive for 
business travellers. 
focus on train journeys abroad 
due, amongst other things, to the custom-
ers’ focus on the train’s environmental ad-
vantages, international train traffic also in-
creased up until february 2020 when the 
covid-19 restrictions almost froze the mar-
ket. 
 
train departures to international destina-
tions increased from 2019 to the beginning 
of 2020, and particularly during the first 
months of 2020 where sales were 32% 
higher than in the same period of 2019. 
 
dsb has, therefore, been increasing its fo-
cus on partnerships that can make interna-
tional travel available to additional custom-
ers and is, in this connection, investigating 
the possibilities for coordinating a potential 
international night train service with other 
european railway operators. dsb is also in-
vesting in new environmentally friendly and 
comfortable train coaches that will be de-
ployed to the international train traffic from 
2023 onwards. in addition, the train links to 
hamburg will continually be improved and 
expanded upon - particularly once the feh-
marn belt fixed link opens. 
 
customers can now order tickets for their 
train journey to a number of countries up to 
six months before departure compared to 
three months as it was previously. this 
longer timeframe makes it easier to put to-
gether the final plans for international train 
trips in good time, and is the result of dsb’s 
continuing work towards establishing addi-
tional partnerships across national borders 
and with other train operators. the aim is to 
offer our customers a product that can com-
pete with air travel and at the same time 
ensure that there is an attractive and sus-
tainable alternative when travelling outside 
of denmark. 
 
the objective is for it to be easy to plan a 
trip abroad and buy a ticket for the journey. 
 
 
results 
22 
this has been a key motivation for making it 
possible to book a print-it-yourself ticket 
online for trips throughout europe - from 
sweden to southern italy. this development 
will continue in the years ahead and will 
meet the customers’ demands for being able 
to book tickets digitally. 
 
in 2020, dsb has also worked on offering 
sustainable study trips by train as a next 
step together with a number of danish up-
per secondary schools, ngos and travel 
agencies. this work was begun after a 
“hackathon” held during the autumn of 
2019. during the spring and summer of 
2020, dsb also held innovation events with 
six upper secondary school classes in coop-
eration with the climate embassy (concito) 
and a travel agency and workshops have 
also been held for upper secondary school 
teachers.  
customers are making increasing use of dig-
ital services 
more and more customers have used the 
digital self-service solutions in 2020,  and 
this trend is in line with the strategy of pro-
moting the use of digital self-service solu-
tions. the degree of self-service at the end 
of 2020 was 94. this is 2.5 percentage 
points higher than at the end of 2019.  
 
throughout 2020, dsb has focused on digi-
talising products and services for its custom-
ers, including business cards, Øresund 
commuter cards and pram/stroller seat res-
ervations. a new business portal was also 
launched at the end of 2020. 
 
covid-19 has also increased the need for 
self-service solutions and agile development 
processes. dsb is continually adapting its 
services, for example, by making it possible 
to refund travel cards and tickets so that the 
customers’ needs can be met in the special 
circumstances.

1) due to covid-19, customer satisfaction levels have not been 
measured during the whole of 2020. the data collection method-
ology has been changed and this may result in minor shifts com-
pared to previous surveys. 
the customer satisfaction levels for all of 
2020 ended at 7.9, which is a slight de-
crease compared to 2019. 
 
for long-distance & regional trains, the 
customer satisfaction levels were un-
changed, but they decreased for s-trains. 
the decrease in customer satisfaction levels 
is particularly noticeable when it comes to 
the parameters of safety in trains and at 
stations, but also when it comes to the in-
ternal cleaning in the train. this develop-
ment is presumably related to covid-19, 
with the subsequent increased focus on 
safety and cleanliness. dsb has made signif-
icant investments in these areas in 2020 
and intends to continue with such invest-
ments in 2021.  
reputation 
dsb’s reputation rose significantly in 2020,  
and at the end of the year it was judged to 
be 63.1. this was an increase of 10.7 points 
compared to the end of 2019,  and it is also 
dsb’s highest recorded reputation level 
since measurements began.

figure 3: reputation - average for the year 
index 0-100 
 
 
dsb’s reputation has on average increased 
by 7.4 points to 60.1 for the year. the cus-
tomers seem to especially appreciate that 
dsb has taken on significant responsibility 
for visible and reassuring communications 
during covid-19. the greater punctuality 
also makes a positive contribution to the 
high reputation score. 
 
for both users (67.6) and non-users (53.3), 
the reputation score for the 4th quarter of 
2020 is significantly higher than for the 4th 
quarter of 2019. 
punctuality 
 
for both long-distance & regional trains 
and s-trains, customer and operator punctu-
ality in 2020 was at one of the highest levels 
ever seen (since dsb started measuring 
punctuality). 
 
the high punctuality figures are mainly a re-
sult of significantly improved stability in the 
rolling stock and reduced impact as a result 
of delayed trains from sweden. 
 
the customer and operator punctuality fig-
ures for long-distance & regional trains 
were particularly high in 2020 compared to 
earlier periods. s-trains, which were already 
at a stable high level also had particularly 
high levels for both customer and operator 
punctuality in 2020.

1) customers who arrived on time at their final destination with less 
than a three-minute delay. 
the customer punctuality for long-distance 
& regional trains increased to 86.7% in 
2020 from 79.1% in 2019. the customer 
punctuality figures have generally been pos-
itively impacted by fewer infrastructure inci-
dents (tracks and signals), fewer rolling 
stock faults (among other things, due to a 
renewed focus on the maintenance of the 
rolling stock), a robust timetable and re-
duced impact of delayed trains arriving from 
sweden. 
 
the customer punctuality of 86.7% is above 
the traffic contract’s target for 2020 of 
78.7%. 
 
customer punctuality for s-trains increased 
to 94.4% in 2020 from 93.0% in 2019. cus-
tomer punctuality for s-trains is also posi-
tively impacted by fewer infrastructure inci-
dents and fewer rolling stock faults. 
  
the customer punctuality of 94.4% is better 
than the traffic contract’s target of 92.3%. 
 
customer punctuality for both long-distance 
& regional trains and s-trains is also posi-
tively impacted by strengthened cooperation 
between dsb and banedanmark - including 
having weekly coordination meetings to en-
sure that traffic-related disturbances due to, 
for example, infrastructure issues are man-
aged in such a way as to create the least in-
convenience for customers.

1) trains that arrived on time with less than a three-minute delay, 
less any minutes of delay for which dsb is not responsible. 
operator punctuality for long-distance & 
regional trains increased to 96.5% from 
94.9% in 2019. operator punctuality has, in 
particular, benefitted from a robust timeta-
ble and fewer rolling stock faults. 
 
the operator punctuality of 96.5% is better 
than the traffic contract’s target of 94.1%. 
 
operator punctuality for s-trains was 98.7% 
in 2020, which is an increase from 98.2% in 
2019. operator punctuality was positively 
impacted by fewer rolling stock faults and 
fewer train propulsion system faults. 
 
the operator punctuality of 98.7% is above 
the traffic contract’s target of 97.5%. 
punctuality, 4th quarter 2020 
customer punctuality for long-distance & 
regional trains was 84.8% and thus better 
than the traffic contract’s target. for s-
trains, the customer punctuality was 94.9%, 
which is also better than the traffic con-
tract’s target. 
 
operator punctuality for long-distance & 
regional trains was 96.5%, while operator 
punctuality for s-trains was 99.1%. both 
were thus above the traffic contract’s tar-
gets.

the number of full-time employees de-

1) seat kilometres are calculated as the number of seats contained 
in a litra unit multiplied by the number of litra-kilometres trav-
elled. the calculation includes depreciation but is adjusted for 
non-recurring items. 
passenger revenues per seat kilometre in 
2020 declined by 34% compared with 2019. 
the decline is due to the large decrease in 
the number of journeys, while the number 
of seat kilometres in 2020 were similar to 
2019.

25 
the costs per seat kilometre decreased by 
8% compared to 2019. this is due to lower 
costs, mainly in the form of less depreciation 
which is a direct result of the write-downs of 
rolling stock in 2019. 
rolling stock 
rolling stock situation in 2020 
dsb has a strong focus on the green transi-
tion - among other things, by prioritising the 
deployment of electric rolling stock. as a re-
sult, 30% of the total kilometre production 
for long-distance & regional trains in 2020 
was with electric rolling stock. 
 
between now and 2030, the diesel driven 
rolling stock will be phased out and replaced 
with electric rolling stock in pace with the 
electrification of the rail network. 
 
dsb is looking into the opportunities for di-
vesting itself of activities at the workshops 
that supply and maintain spare parts for the 
trains. this concerns supply, logistics and 
conversion. the aim of the divestment pro-
cess is to ensure that dsb has a stable sup-
ply chain for the current trains until the train 
of the future is fully phased in. 
  
2020 was a special year for dsb, as the first 
three of a total of 42 ordered siemens vec-
tron electric locomotives arrived. the elec-
tric locomotives arrived ahead of schedule 
and the first one was deployed to passenger 
operations two months earlier than planned. 
 
the remaining eb electric locomotives will 
be delivered on an ongoing basis throughout 
2021 and the 1st half of 2022. this will al-
low for the phasing out of the older diesel 
and electric locomotives, a process which is 
expected to be completed in december 
2021. 
 
 
1) based on the danish ministry of transportation’s tema 2015 
model. 
the eb electric locomotives will be pulling 
double-decker coaches and new train 
coaches that will be delivered by talgo. 
 
generally speaking, dsb’s rolling stock is 
“co2 friendly”1). for example, a diesel driven 
ic3 train set deployed to normal intercity 
operations typically emits 4-5 times less co2 
per passenger kilometre than a traditional 
petrol or diesel engined car, while electric 
rolling stock such as ir4 train sets emits 
about 20 times less co2.  
 
by transitioning towards using electric roll-
ing stock, dsb ensures that the train’s sig-
nificant environmental advantages com-
pared to cars are also maintained in the fu-
ture - even if the car fleet is gradually opti-
mised and replaced by electric vehicles. 
 
once all eb electric locomotives have re-
placed the old diesel locomotives, the co2 
emissions will be reduced by at least 27,000 
tonnes per year, and the environment will 
benefit from a 10-tonne reduction in particle 
emissions per year, or around 60% of the 
total particles emitted by dsb’s train opera-
tions. 
  
this means that the eb electric locomotives 
are an important part of dsb’s ambitious 
goal of being completely co2-neutral and to 
have zero particle emissions from the trains’ 
engines in 2030. 
 
in 2020, dsb’s rolling stock also travelled 
fewer kilometres in total than in 2019. this 
is mainly due to the reduced pace of opera-
tions due to covid-19. however, the rolling 
stock travelled more kilometres between in-

2) the desiro train sets have been sold and handed over to arriva as 
of 13 december 2020. 
3) as of 13 december 2020, no ea electric locomotives are in opera-

4) the litra kilometre count for eb electric locomotives has not been

the reliability of rolling stock has improved 
significantly in 2020 compared to 2019 
across dsb’s train fleet. this has resulted in 
the number of kilometres travelled between 
incidents increasing from 2019 to 2020 for 
all litra units except the ic3 train sets, 
where the high level in 2019 was maintained 
in 2020. 
ic4 train sets 
in 2020, the ic4 train sets travelled 7.3 mil-
lion litra kilometres, which is around the 
same as in 2019.  
 
18% of the total diesel production in 2020 
was with ic4 train sets. 
 
in 2020, the ic4 train sets were primarily 
utilised in regional rail traffic in jutland and 
on zealand, but also for selected departures 
in the long-distance rail traffic. 
 
the ic4 train sets’ operational stability has 
improved compared to 2019. the number of 
kilometres travelled between incidents has 
increased by 23%. a continuing structured 
approach towards the management of faults 
and optimisation of the planning processes 
for maintenance works has also contributed 
to the higher levels of operational stability.  
ic3 train sets 
the ic3 train sets continue to constitute a 
very central part of the train fleet and ac-
count for a very large majority of the long-
distance & regional train traffic. the ic3 
train sets have accounted for 68% of the to-
tal diesel train operations and have travelled 
27.6 million litra kilometres in 2020, which 
is 4% less than in 2019. 
 
the number of kilometres travelled between 
incidents in 2020 is around the same as in 
2019. in 2020, there were some challenges 
with a growing number of faults attributed 
to the new signal system and train 
operations on the old signal system with 
ertms-converted train sets.

ir4 train sets 
the ir4 train sets are used both on kyst-
banen (the coast line) and for long-dis-
tance & regional trains together with the 
ic3 train sets. 
 
in 2020, the ir4 train sets travelled 9% 
more litra kilometres than in 2019, and this 
is due, among other things, to a general pri-
oritisation of deploying electric rolling stock. 
 
in 2020, the ir4 train sets travelled signifi-
cantly more kilometres between incidents 
than in 2019. the ir4 train sets thus trav-
elled 26,000 kilometres between incidents, 
which is an increase of 49% compared to 
2019. 
 
the positive development is mainly due to 
an ongoing focus on a dynamic monitoring 
of the train fleet and comparing data from 
other litra types in order to identify the 
sources of faults and recall trains for correc-
tive maintenance before the faults arise dur-
ing operations. the data collected is also 
used for a more structured troubleshooting 
and corrective maintenance process. 
Øresund train sets 
in 2020, the Øresund train sets travelled 
13% fewer litra kilometres than in 2019 
due, among other things, to the limitations 
imposed on traffic to and from sweden. 
 
the significant increase in the number of kil-
ometres travelled between incidents is due 
to a more comprehensive use of data from 
the monitoring of the train fleet. this has al-
lowed for better management of inspection 
and maintenance processes. 
 
in connection with the transfer of Øresund 
traffic, the maintenance responsibility for 
the 77 swedish-owned Øresund train sets 
was transferred to sj and the maintenance 
company mantena in sweden as of 13 de-
cember.  
 
the 34 danish-owned Øresund train sets are 
still maintained by dsb. 
double-decker coaches 
the double-decker coaches are pulled by me 
diesel locomotives and eb electric locomo-
tives, but up until 13 december they were 
also drawn by ea electric locomotives. 
 
in 2020, the double-decker coaches trav-
elled 15.4 million litra kilometres, which is 
similar to 2019. 
 
in 2020, the double-decker coaches have 
travelled 18% fewer kilometres between in-
cidents than in 2019.  
 
since 2019, dsb has completed several ini-
tiatives on an ongoing basis to improve the 
number of kilometres travelled between inci-
dents for the double-decker coaches. among 
other things, this has included the resetting 
of doors and the replacement of connectors, 
cables and batteries. 
desiro train sets 
in 2020, the desiro train sets have been de-
ployed to the svendborg line and lille syd 
between roskilde and næstved. in addition, 
they have also been deployed to west funen 
when there has been a lack of train sets. 
they have travelled a total of 2.3 million li-
tra kilometres on these lines in 2020. 
 
the desiro train sets were sold and handed 
over to arriva as of 13 december. 
me diesel locomotives 
the me diesel locomotives have travelled 
4% fewer litra kilometres in 2020 compared 
to 2019. 
 
dsb is continually reducing its use of me 
diesel locomotives, which are being phased 
out in line with putting new eb electric loco-
motives into service. the me diesel locomo-
tives are expected to be completely phased 
out in december 2021. 
ea electric locomotives 
in 2020, the ea electric locomotives trav-
elled fewer litra kilometres than in 2019, but 
 
 
results 
28 
travelled further between incidents than in 
2019.  
 
the ea electric locomotives (some of them 
up to 34 years old) were fully removed from 
operations as of 13 december and put up 
for sale. the ea electric locomotives will be 
replaced by the new eb electric locomotives. 
eb electric locomotives 
dsb has ordered 42 siemens vectron elec-
tric locomotives and three of them were de-
ployed to operations in 2020.  
 
the remaining eb electric locomotives will 
be delivered on a rolling basis in 2021 and 
the 1st half of 2022. 
s-train sets 
the s-train sets travelled 18.5 million litra 
kilometres in 2020, which is 3% more than 
in 2019. among other things, this is due to 
more train sets being deployed per depar-
ture throughout most of 2020 in order to 
ensure proper distancing between customers 
in the trains. 
 
the number of kilometres travelled between 
incidents increased by 22% compared to 
2019, as the s-trains travelled 20,700 kilo-
metres between incidents in 2020.  
 
the s-train fleet has generally achieved a 
high and stable number of kilometres trav-
elled between incidents in 2020. the devel-
opment is, among other things, due to more 
and improving initiatives related to main-
taining the train sets and better opportuni-
ties for fixing operational faults.  
 
as the s-train sets get older, more and 
more spare parts are no longer being pro-
duced. dsb is continually working towards 
finding solutions for replacing components.  
the electrification programme 
banedanmark is in the process of electrify-
ing major parts of the danish rail network. 
currently, the rail network is only partially 
electrified.  
 
the banedanmark project is expected to 
continue up until 2027 and involves the 
electrification of 1,362 kilometres of the rail 
network.  
 
once the rail network has been fully electri-
fied, dsb will be able to use electric rolling 
stock alone in its operations. this will bene-
fit both the environment and the train oper-
ations,  as electric trains not only emit less 
co2, they also make less noise and, there-
fore, provide a better environment at sta-
tions and along the tracks.  
 
in addition to the environmental benefits, 
customers will also experience faster travel 
times and more stable operations. dsb will 
also achieve cost savings with the deploy-
ment of a modern and more homogeneous 
train fleet. 
the signal programme 
in the coming years, banedanmark will be 
replacing the signal systems throughout 
denmark. the new signal systems will con-
tribute to making the rail network even 
more attractive as a sustainable and con-
gestion-free transport form in denmark. the 
programme’s objective is to ensure fewer 
delays and allow for higher speeds and more 
trains on the network. 
 
in 2020, the signal programme for long-
distance & regional trains has focused in 
particular on converting the train sets to the 
new etcs/stm signal system and following 
up on the converted train sets in operation. 
 
for s-trains, the focus in 2020 was particu-
larly on the operation of the already com-
pleted lines and the preparations for the 
next roll out of the new signal system at the 
beginning of 2021. 
long-distance & regional trains 
the serial installation of equipment for the 
new signal system really took off in 2020.

all 20 desiro train sets were converted as 
planned before they were handed over to 
arriva. 
 
the conversion of two ic3 train sets began 
in february, and the objective of converting 
35 ic3 train sets before the end of the year 
was met.  
 
in addition, by the end of 2020 eight dou-
ble-decker control cars have also been con-
verted. 
 
the conversion of the first ir4 train set was 
completed in the spring. due to the transi-
tion to the eu’s 4th railway package and the 
supply chain challenges faced by banedan-
mark and alstom, it is expected that the 
first ir4 train sets will not be deployed to 
operations until march 2021. 
 
there are still challenges associated with 
faults on trains operating with renovated 
train sets where the tracks are still using the 
old signal system. a steering group has 
been established involving dsb, banedan-
mark and siemens to prioritise the initia-
tives aimed at remedying this situation by 
the summer of 2021 and minimising the 
number of braking incidents compared to 
2020. 
s-trains 
in 2020, there was a focus on preparing for 
the next rollout of the new signal system for 
the s-train network, which was put into op-
eration on 25 january 2021 and covers the 
ny ellebjerg-ryparken, ryparken-farum and 
nordhavn-svanemøllen lines. 
 
a new technical solution for addressing the 
challenge of automatic braking when tracks 
are slippery is expected to be implemented 
in june 2021. the customers will then begin 
to experience a smoother flow of traffic. 
dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s 
with the amendment of the dsb act in 
2019, dsb was able to move further into the 
value chain when it comes to developing 
real estate projects. this means that, via its 
subsidiary, dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s, 
dsb can enter into partnerships to realise 
high-quality real estate projects focusing on 
sustainability. thus, dsb is now able to gen-
erate long-term revenue in the form of 
rental income rather than just getting the 
proceeds from selling real estate. these rev-
enues should help to finance the future train 
operations. 
 
the commercial real estate projects will be 
structured as joint ventures with external 
parties where dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s 
owns up to 50% of the equity. dsb ejen-
domsudvikling a/s provides the building 
rights and, as a starting point, the external 
partner provides the liquidity. 
 
in june, dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s en-
tered into a joint venture agreement with ny 
valby udvikling a/s concerning the con-
struction and renting out of a residential 
property with 375 apartments on grønttor-
vet in valby. dsb has made sure that the 
construction will be carried out in such a 
manner that it can subsequently gain the 
dgnb gold certificate of sustainability. the 
first apartments are expected to be ready to 
rent out at the end of 2021, and the prop-
erty is expected to be fully rented out by 
spring 2022. 
 
in 2021, dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s is ex-
pecting to enter into a joint venture agree-
ment do develop an area on carsten nie-
buhrs gade in copenhagen. the companies 
that will back this project were founded in 
2020. the founding of the companies has no 
accounting impact on 2020. 
 
besides the revenues from selling real es-
tate, project development and commercial 
real estate development, dsb ejendoms-
udvikling a/s also earns revenues from 
renting out existing properties.

expectations for 2021 
the uncertainty around the covid-19 situa-
tion - including the infection numbers and 
restrictions as well as the structural conse-
quences - mean that the result for 2021 is 
associated with an unusually large degree of 
uncertainty.  
 
there is also uncertainty surrounding the 
opportunities for getting additional compen-
sation for losses incurred in 2020 and 2021. 
 
if such compensation is not received, a neg-
ative result amounting to around dkk 1,000 
million can be expected in 2021. 
 
events that have occurred after 
the balance sheet date 
together with the danish ministry of 
transport, dsb has prepared a basis for how 
dsb can be compensated for losses at-
tributed to covid-19 in 2021. the agree-
ment will enter into force when approved by 
the danish government. 
 
no events have occurred after 31 december 
2020 which, in the opinion of the manage-
ment, have a significant impact on the as-
sessment of the annual report for 2020.

there are no other matters that, in the opin-
ion of the management, have a significant

the board of directors and the executive board have today discussed and approved dsb’s 
annual report for 2020. 
 
the annual report is presented in accordance with the danish financial statements act and 
the danish dsb act. we consider the accounting policies applied to be appropriate. accord-
ingly, the annual report gives a true and fair view of the group's and the parent company’s 
assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the group's 
and the parent company’s operations and the group’s cash flows for the financial year from 1 
january to 31 december 2020. 
 
in our view, the management report contains a well-founded assessment of the development 
in the group’s and the parent corporation’s activities and financial conditions, the profit for 
the year and the group’s and the parent company’s financial position in general and a de-
scription of the most important risks and uncertainty factors to which the group and the par-
ent company are subject.  
 
the annual report is recommended for approval by the annual meeting.

to the minister for transport 
auditor’s report on the consolidated annual accounts and the annual account 
opinion  
we have audited the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts of the independ-
ent public corporation dsb for the financial year 1 january - 31 december 2020, comprising 
income statement, balance sheet, equity statement and notes, including accounting policies, 
for the group as well as for the parent company and the consolidated cash flow statement. 
the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts are presented in accordance with 
the provisions of the danish financial statements act and the dsb act. 
 
in our view, the consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts give a true and fair view 
of the group’s and the independent public corporation dsb’s assets, liabilities and financial 
position as of 31 december 2020 and of the result of the group’s and the independent public 
corporation dsb’s activities and the group’s cash flows for the financial year 1 january - 31 
december 2020 in accordance with the provisions of the danish financial statements act and 
the dsb act. 
basis of opinion  
we have performed our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark as well as good public auditing practice, as the 
audit is carried out on the basis of the provisions in the dsb act.  our responsibility, accord-
ing to these standards and requirements, is described in detail in the section "auditor’s re-
sponsibility for auditing of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts". we 
believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. 
independence 
the auditor-general is independent of the independent public corporation dsb pursuant to 
section 1(6) of the danish auditor general’s act and the approved auditor is independent of 
the independent public corporation dsb pursuant to international ethical rules for auditors 
(iesba’s ethical rules) and the additional requirements applicable in denmark. we have both 
fulfilled our additional ethical obligations under these rules and requirements. 
the management’s responsibility for the consolidated annual accounts and the 
annual accounts 
the management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and 
annual accounts that give a true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial state-
ments act and the dsb act. the management is also responsible for such internal controls as 
it deems necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated annual accounts and annual ac-
counts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
in the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, the manage-
ment is responsible for assessing the independent public corporation dsb’s ability to continue 
operations, providing information on conditions regarding continued operation, if relevant, 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 
34 
and preparing the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going 
concern accounting principle unless the management intends to liquidate the independent 
public corporation dsb, suspend operations or has no other realistic alternative than to do so. 
the auditor’s responsibility for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts and 
the annual accounts 
our aim is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the consolidated annual accounts and 
the annual accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether 
this is due to fraud or errors, and to issue an auditor’s report and express an opinion. a high 
degree of assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit per-
formed in accordance with international standards on audits and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark, as well as good public auditing practice, cf. the dsb act, will always 
discover material misstatements when such are present. misstatements may occur as a result 
of fraud or error and may be regarded as material if it can reasonably be expected that the 
misstatement, or parts thereof, affects the financial decisions made by the users of the ac-
counts based on the annual accounts. 
 
as part of an audit performed in accordance with international auditing standards and the ad-
ditional requirements applicable in denmark, as well as good public auditor practice, cf. the 
dsb act, we perform professional assessments and maintain professional scepticism during 
the audit. in addition:  
• we identify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the consolidated annual ac-
counts and the annual accounts regardless of whether this is due to fraud or error, prepare 
and carry out audit procedures in response to these risks and obtain audit evidence that is 
adequate and suitable for forming a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than for material misstatement due to error, since 
fraud may include conspiracies, forgery, intentional omission, misrepresentation or the dis-
regarding of internal controls. 
• we reach an understanding of the internal control with relevance for the audit in order to 
be able to prepare audit procedures that are suitable under the circumstances, but not in 
order to be able to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the independent public corpo-
ration dsb’s internal controls. 
• we determine whether the accounting policies applied by the management are suitable and 
whether the accounting estimates made by management and related information are rea-
sonable. 
• we express an opinion as to whether the management’s preparation of the consolidated 
annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going concern accounting principle 
is suitable and whether, based on the audit evidence obtained, there is material uncertainty 
associated with events or conditions which may give rise to significant doubt as to the inde-
pendent public corporation dsb’s ability to continue operations. if we find that there is ma-
terial uncertainty, we must state in our auditor’s report that the consolidated annual ac-
counts and the annual accounts contain information on this or, if such information is not 
adequate, modify our opinion. our opinion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may result in the in-
dependent public corporation dsb being unable to continue operations. 
 
 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts

• we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated annual ac-
counts and the annual accounts, including the information in the notes, and whether the 
consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts reflect the underlying transactions 
and events and thus present a true and fair view of these. 
• we obtain sufficient and suitable audit evidence for the financial information for companies 
or business activities in the group for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the consoli-
dated annual accounts. we are responsible for managing, overseeing and carrying out the 
group audit. we are solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
we communicate with the executive management on the planned scope and timing of the au-
dit as well as significant audit observations, including any significant defects in internal con-
trol which we identify during our audit.  
statement on the management report  
the management is responsible for the management report. 
 
our opinion on the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts does not include 
the management report and we do not express any opinion with certainty on the manage-
ment report. 
 
in connection with our audit of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, it 
is our responsibility to read the management report and consider whether the management 
report is significantly inconsistent with the consolidated annual accounts and the annual ac-
counts or our knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way seems to contain ma-
terial misstatement. 
 
our responsibility is also to consider whether the management report contains the required 
information pursuant to the danish financial statements act. 
 
based on the work performed, we find that the management report is in accordance with the 
consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts and has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the danish financial statements act. we have not identified any 
material misstatement in the management report.  
declaration pursuant to other legislation and other regulation 
statement on legal-critical audit and performance audit 
the management is responsible for ensuring that the transactions covered by the financial re-
porting are in accordance with reported grants, legislation and other stipulations, as well as 
with agreements concluded and the usual practice. the management is also responsible for 
ensuring that due financial consideration is taken for the management of the funds and oper-
ations of the companies included in the annual accounts. in that context, the management is 
responsible for setting up systems and processes that promote frugality, productivity and effi-
ciency. 
 
in connection with our audit of the annual accounts, it is our responsibility to complete a le-
gal-critical audit and a management audit of selected topics in accordance with good public 
accounting practice. during our legal-critical audit, we verify with a high degree of certainty 
for the selected topics whether the examined transactions covered by the financial reporting 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 
36 
are in accordance with the relevant provisions of grants, legislation and other stipulations in 
addition to concluded agreements and the usual practice. during our management audit, we

consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 
42 
1.1 accounting policies applied 
the annual report for the independent public company, 
dsb, has been prepared in accordance with the provi-
sions of the danish financial statements act on the act 
on dsb. 
 
the annual report has been prepared according to the 
same accounting policies as the annual report for 2019 
except for the change below. 
 
changed accounting practices 
companies owned and operated jointly with others and 
where the parties together exercise a controlling influ-
ence (joint ventures) were previously consolidated on a 
pro-rata basis. in 2020 this was changed, so now these 
companies are included in the consolidated annual ac-
counts by their book value. the change has not had 
any financial impact. an adjustment of comparison fig-
ures for 2019 has not been made, as the amount con-
sists of a reduction of the balance sheet sum of dkk 5 
million and does not, therefore, impact the understand-
ing of accounts. neither have key figures for 2019, 
2018, 2017 and 2016 been adjusted. 
 
changes in accounting estimates  
there have been no significant changes to accounting 
estimates in 2020. 
 
consolidated annual accounts 
the consolidated annual accounts comprise the parent 
company and affiliated companies in which the parent 
corporation directly or indirectly holds more than 50 per 
cent of the voting rights and exercises a controlling in-
fluence. companies in which the group holds between 
20 and 50 per cent of the voting rights and exercises 
significant, but not controlling, influence are regarded 
as associated companies. companies owned and oper-
ated jointly with others and where the parties together 
exercise a controlling influence are considered as joint 
ventures. 
 
the note financial fixed assets includes affiliated 
companies (subsidiaries and joint ventures) and associ-
ated companies.  
 
the consolidated annual accounts are prepared as a 
summary of the accounts of the parent company and 
the individual affiliated companies stated in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies and with elimina-
tion of intragroup income and expenses, shareholdings, 
intragroup balances and dividends as well as intragroup 
realised and unrealised profits on transactions.  
 
business combinations 
newly acquired or newly founded companies are recog-
nised in the consolidated annual accounts at the time of 
acquisition. sold or liquidated companies are recog-
nised in the consolidated income statement until the 
time of divestment. comparative figures are not re-
stated for newly acquired, sold or liquidated companies. 
 
gains or losses related to the sale or liquidation of 
group and associated companies are stated as the dif-
ference between the sales price and the carrying 
amount of the net assets at the time of sale, including 
notes and accounting policies applied 
section 1 
interpretation 
 
the notes are separated by themes and based on 
materiality. the purpose is to ensure that the 
financial reporting reflects and is adapted to 
specific conditions based on materiality. 
the notes are divided into eight groups according 
to theme: 
section 1 
interpretation 
section 2 
operations 
section 3 
operating equipment 
section 4 
financing and capital structure  
section 5 
taxation 
section 6 
working capital  
section 7 
financial conditions  
section 8  other notes 
 
this section contains the following notes: 
1.1 
accounting policies applied 
1.2 
significant accounting estimates 
1.3 
materiality in financial reporting 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 
43 
non-amortised goodwill and expected costs of sale or 
liquidation. 
 
acquisitions of new companies are accounted for using 
the purchase method, according to which the identifia-
ble assets and liabilities of the newly acquired compa-
nies are measured at their fair values at the date of ac-
quisition. costs of restructuring which are recognised in 
the acquired company before the date of takeover and 
which have not been agreed as part of the acquisition 
are included in the pre-acquisition balance sheet and 
thus the determination of goodwill. restructuring de-
cided by the acquirer is recognised in the income state-
ment. the tax effect of the revaluation is taken into ac-
count. 
 
any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 
(goodwill) is recognised as intangible assets and amor-
tised systematically in the income statement based on 
an individual assessment of the economic service life of 
the asset. any excess of the fair value of the identifia-
ble assets and liabilities acquired over the cost of the 
acquisition (negative goodwill) is recognised in the in-
come statement as income at the time of takeover 
when the general conditions for recognition of income 
are fulfilled. 
 
intragroup business combinations 
in connection with business combinations such as pur-
chase and sale of equity investments, mergers, de-
mergers, addition of assets and share exchanges, etc., 
with participation of companies under the control of the 
parent company, the book value method will be used in 
the future. when this method is applied, the business 
combination is regarded as completed at the time of ac-
quisition with any adjustment of comparative figures. 
the difference between the agreed consideration and 
the carrying amount of the acquired company is recog-
nised in equity.  
 
foreign currency translation 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated on initial recognition using the exchange rate 
on the transaction date. differences between the ex-
change rate on the transaction date and the exchange 
rate on the payment day are recognised in the income 
statement under financial income and expenses, net. 
 
receivables, liabilities and other monetary items de-
nominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate at the balance sheet date. the difference 
between the exchange rate at the balance sheet date 
and the exchange rate at the time when the account 
receivable or liability arose or was recognised in the lat-
est annual accounts is recognised in the income state-
ment under financial items. 
foreign-affiliated companies are considered to be inde-
pendent units. the income statement is translated using 
the average exchange rate and the balance sheet items 
are translated using the exchange rate at the balance 
sheet date. exchange rate differences arising from the 
translation of foreign-affiliated companies’ equity at the 
beginning of the year at the exchange rates on the bal-
ance sheet date and from the translation of income 
statements from average exchange rates at the ex-
change rates on the balance sheet date are taken di-
rectly to equity. 
 
non-deductible vat 
dsb has a partial right of deduction of incoming vat, 
since the group has both vat-liable and vat-free activ-
ities.  
the vat-free activities are related to passenger 
transport. furthermore, the payroll tax is calculated. 
 
the non-deductible proportion of the incoming vat is 
included in the individual items in the income statement 
and the balance sheet. as part of the joint vat registra-
tion, the parent company pays compensation to affili-
ated companies in those cases where there would have 
been full right of deduction if the affiliated company 
had had an independent vat registration.  
 
equity 
 
reserve for development costs 
reserve for development costs comprises recognised 
development costs. the reserve cannot be used for 
payment of dividends or covering losses. the reserve is 
reduced or dissolved if the recognised development 
costs are amortised, depreciated or eliminated from the 
operation of the corporation. this takes place by trans-
fer directly to the distributable reserves of the equity. 
 
reserve for hedging transactions 
the reserve for hedging transactions includes recog-
nised financial instruments that are classified as hedges 
for future cash flows. the reserve cannot be used for 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 
44 
payment of dividends or covering losses. the reserve is 
value-adjusted with the changes made to the financial 
instruments. 
 
dividends 
dividends are recognised as a liability at the time of 
adoption at the ordinary annual meeting (the time of 
declaration). the proposed dividend for the financial 
year is disclosed as a separate item under equity.

into operating, investing and financing activity for the 
year, changes in the cash in bank and in hand and the 
cash in bank and in hand at the beginning and end of 
the year.  
 
the cash flow statement contains a share of the cash 
flows from consolidated companies. 
 
a separate cash flow statement has not been prepared 
for the parent company as this is included in the con-
solidated cash flow statement. 
 
cash flow from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities are stated as the 
operating profit/loss adjusted for non-cash operating 
items, financial income and expenses paid, corporation 
tax paid and changes in working capital. the working 
capital comprises the change in current assets less the 
change in current liabilities exclusive of items included 
in cash in bank and in hand. changes in working capital 
are adjusted for changes that have no effect on liquid-
ity. 
 
cash flows from investment activities 
cash flows from investment activities include purchases 
and sales, etc., of fixed assets.  
 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities comprise proceeds 
from raising loans, repayment and instalments on liabil-
ities and dividend received and paid.

1.2 significant accounting estimates 
a number of accounting estimates have been used for 
establishing and complying with accounting practices. 
 
the measurement of the carrying value of certain as-
sets and liabilities are based on estimates of how future 
events will impact the value of these assets and liabili-
ties on the balance sheet date. estimates that are sig-
nificant to delivering the accounts are made, among 
other things, for the life expectancy of fixed assets, the 
money flows from investments and the associated dis-
counting rates, sales values, deferred provisions and 
contingent liabilities.  
 
the estimates and assumptions are also based on his-
torical experiences, special circumstances due to 
covid-19 and other factors that senior management 
assess as reasonable under the circumstances, but 
which, due to their nature, are uncertain and unpredict-
able.  
 
the assumptions may be incomplete or inexact, and 
unexpected events or circumstances may occur. fur-
thermore, the business activities are subject to risks 
and uncertainties that cannot be controlled and which 
may lead to the actual results deviating from these es-
timates.  
 
rolling stock  
the valuation of rolling stock is – also due to the cur-
rent covid-19 situation - associated with significant 
accounting estimates in 2020.  
 
the significant accounting estimates apply to, among 
other things, expectations for the future income, appli-
cation of the rolling stock, the scrap value and the tech-
nical and financial life expectancy. 
 
the estimates made are further described in the note 
for tangible fixed assets (section 3). 
 
1.3 materiality in financial reporting 
when preparing the annual report, there is an individ-
ual assessment of whether an item is material. this as-
sessment is based on both qualitative and quantitative 
factors. if individual presentation in the income state-
ment, balance sheet and notes is not assessed to be 
relevant for the reader’s decisions the information is 
considered to be immaterial.

accounting practices 
passenger revenues are recognised at the time of carriage. provision is made in respect of the value of tickets sold 
that have not been used at the balance sheet date. discounts in connection with sales and payments relating to the 
travel time guarantee schemes are deducted from the net revenue. revenues from control fees are measured after 
the deduction of expected losses. 
 
traffic contract revenues are recognised over the periods to which they relate. 
 
revenues from corrective maintenance of rolling stock, etc., are recognised concurrently with production, which 
means that revenues correspond to the selling price of work performed for the year (production method).  
 
revenues from the sale of rolling stock that has been acquired with the intent to sell are included when the delivery 
and transfer of risk has taken place.

the new development projects and intangible fixed assets being completed and prepayments mainly cover the de-
velopment of new planning tools for train and staff management, new processes for loading sales transactions in sap 
and systems aimed at improving customer loyalty. the additions of the year are essentially costs for external con-
sultants, direct salaries and acquisitions of systems. 
 
accounting practices 
intangible fixed assets comprise primarily development projects, including rights of use and software. 
 
development projects are included as intangible fixed assets if the cost price can be measured reliably and there is a 
sufficient degree of certainty that the future earnings can cover the sales and administration costs in addition to the 
development costs themselves. it is a prerequisite that the projects are clearly defined and identifiable and that the 
technical feasibility, sufficient resources and a potential future market or development opportunity in the company 
can be indicated. other development costs are recognised as expenses in the income statement as and when they 
are incurred. development costs included in the balance sheet are measured at cost price less accumulated deprecia-
tion, amortisation and write-downs. 
 
the cost price of development projects includes costs - also staff costs and amortisation - that can be directly linked 
to the company’s development activities. interest and borrowing expenses on loans for financing of development pro-
jects are recognised in cost provided they relate to the development period. all other financing expenses are recog-
nised in the income statement. after completion of the development work, development projects are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. the amortisation period is usually 3-10 years. 
 
profits and losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carry-
ing amount at the time of sale. profits and losses are included in the income statement under other operating income 
or other external expenses.

the costs of development projects are tied to the equity, as described under accounting policies in section 1 under 
reserve for development costs.

covid-19 has not affected dsb's ability to support the value of rolling stock, which is relatively low - partly due to 
the significant write-downs in 2019. in 2020, no basis has been found for writing down rolling stock 
 
the disposals of rolling stock during the year can be attributed to larger maintenance projects which, in accounting 
terms, are fully written off and which were replaced by new equivalent maintenance projects during the year. 
in connection with the operation of the coastal line/Øresund traffic, collateral has been provided in the form of 10 
train sets at a book value of dkk 259 million. the financing amounted to eur 36.8 million as of 31 december 2020. 
 
based on previous experiences, the scrap value of rolling stock is estimated to be dkk 0.

accounting practices 
land and buildings, rolling stock, operating equipment, fixtures and fittings and other equipment are measured at 
their cost price less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs. land is not amortised.  
 
cost includes the purchase price and costs directly related to the purchase up to the time where the asset is ready 
for use. with regard to own produced assets (primarily major maintenance inspections (life cycle cost (lcc)) of cap-
italised train sets, the cost price covers direct and indirect costs for materials, components, subcontractors and 
wages/salaries as well as costs of borrowing from specific and general borrowing in direct connection with the con-
struction of the individual asset. 
 
expenses for major maintenance inspections (lcc) of train sets are recognised separately and amortised over the 
useful life, which corresponds to the period until the next major maintenance inspection or to when the train is 
phased out of operations. the costs for major maintenance inspections for litra that have not yet been assigned a 
specific time for phasing out are depreciated based on an individual assessment.  
 
assets are depreciated linearly over their expected useful lives based on the following assessment of their expected 
useful lives: 
 
buildings 
30-60 years 
installations 
10-15 years 
rolling stock 
2-25 years 
operating equipment, fixtures and fittings 
and other equipment 
3-25 years  
 
 
in connection with capitalisation, the cost price is distributed on the most important individual components (decom-
position) and amortised over their useful life. the basis of depreciation is calculated, taking into account the scrap 
value of the asset after the end of its useful life and reduced by any write-downs. the amortisation period and the 
scrap value are fixed at the time of acquisition and reassessed annually. if the scrap value exceeds the carrying 
amount of the asset, amortisation stops. 
 
if the amortisation period or the scrap value changes, the impact on amortisation in the future is recognised as a 
change of accounting estimates. 
 
profits and losses on disposal or scrapping of tangible fixed assets are calculated as the difference between the sales 
price less cost of sales and the carrying amount at the time of sale or scrapping. profits and losses are included in the 
income statement under other operating income or other external expenses. 
 
commercial properties 
commercial properties include land and buildings that have been sold or are expected to be sold - but where the 
transfer of risk is only expected to take place within 12 months.  
 
commercial properties are stated at cost price. commercial properties that were previously classified as tangible 
fixed assets are stated at cost price minus accumulated write-downs made before the reclassification from tangible 
fixed assets to commercial properties, after which no further write-downs are applied. 
 
leasing 
in terms of accounting, leasing obligations are divided into finance and operating leases. expenses regarding opera-
tional leases are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease. total commitments regarding opera-
tional leasing and rent agreement are disclosed under contingent assets and liabilities in addition to other financial 
obligations.

decrease in value of fixed assets 
the carrying amount of fixed assets is reviewed on the balance sheet date to decide whether there are any indica-
tions of impairment other than what is expressed through amortisation. if there are signs of such impairment, an 
impairment test is carried out for the relevant asset or group of assets to determine whether the recoverable amount 
is lower than the carrying amount. if so, a write-down is made to that lower recoverable amount. any write-downs 
are recognised in the income statement.  
 
in case of subsequence reversals of write-downs as a consequence of changes in the preconditions for the calculated 
recoverable value, the value of the asset is increased to the adjusted recoverable value, but not to more than the 
carrying amount the asset would have had if it had not been written down for impairment.

accounting practices 
equity investments in affiliated companies are measured according to the book value method. this means that equity 
investments are measured at the proportionate share of the companies’ book value, calculated according to the ac-
counting policies of the group less or plus unrealised intragroup profits and losses. 
 
equity investments in affiliated companies with a negative book value are measured at dkk 0, and any potential re-
ceivables from these companies are depreciated to the extent that the receivable is irrecoverable. to the extent that 
the parent company has a legal or actual obligation to cover a deficit exceeding the receivable, the remaining amount 
is recognised in other provisions. 
 
the net value adjustment of equity investments in affiliated companies is shown as reserve for net value adjustment 
according to the book value method in equity, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the cost price.  
 
in the parent company’s income statement, the proportionate share of affiliated company’s profit/loss after tax, less 
the proportionate share of internal profit/loss, is recognised.

accounting practices 
equity investments in associated companies and joint ventures are measured according to the book value method. 
this means that equity investments are measured at the proportionate share of the companies’ book value, calcu-
lated according to the accounting policies of the group less or plus unrealised intragroup profits and losses. 
 
equity investments in associated companies and joint ventures with a negative book value are measured at dkk 0 
and any receivables from these companies are depreciated to the extent that the receivable is irrecoverable. to the 
extent that the parent company has a legal or actual obligation to cover a deficit exceeding the receivable, the re-
maining amount is recognised in other provisions. 
 
subordinated loan capital in associated companies and other receivables is measured at amortised cost. 
 
in both the parent company’s and group’s income statement, the proportionate share of the associated companies’ 
and joint ventures profit/loss after tax, less the proportionate share of internal profit/loss, is recognised.

all foreign currency loans have been converted into dkk via currency swaps. 
 
in the parent company and the group, dkk 3,673 million of the debt portfolio was raised without state guarantee 
(2019: dkk 2,801 million). the remaining loans are all guaranteed by the danish state, to which a guarantee com-
mission is payable. 
 
accounting practices 
liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received after deduction of transaction costs 
incurred. in subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised 
value using the effective interest rate. accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is 
recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. 
 
other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost price.

accounting practices 
the corporation is covered by the danish rules on compulsory joint taxation of the group’s danish affiliated compa-
nies. the affiliated companies are included in the joint taxation from the time at which they are included in the con-
solidation and until they are excluded from the consolidation. 
 
the parent company is the administration unit for the joint taxation and consequently settles all payments of corpo-
ration tax with the tax authorities. 
 
the current danish corporation tax is distributed by settlement of the joint taxation contributions between the jointly 
taxed companies relative to their taxable income. in this connection, any companies with a tax loss receive joint tax-
ation contributions from companies that were able to use this loss to reduce their own tax profit. 
section 5 
taxation 
 
in 2020, tax on earnings for the year amounted to 
an expense of dkk 57 million in the parent 
company and a revenue of dkk 47 million in the 
group.

the total tax for the year, comprising current corporation tax, the year’s joint taxation contribution and changes in 
deferred tax, including differences as a consequence of changed tax rates, is recognised in the income statement 
with the share attributable to the profit/loss for the year and directly in equity by the share which may be attributed 
to items entered directly on equity. 
 
current tax liabilities and receivables are included in the balance sheet as calculated tax on the taxable income for 
the year adjusted for tax on the taxable income for previous years and tax paid on account. 
 
joint taxation contributions payable and receivable are included in the balance sheet as balances with affiliated com-
panies.

the group's danish companies are jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated taxable income, etc., the 
total corporation tax liability is dkk 0 million at 31 december 2020 (2019: dkk 80 million). the group’s danish com-
panies are jointly and severally liable for danish withholding tax in the form of tax on dividend, royalty and interest. 
any subsequent corrections of corporation and withholding taxes may increase the corporation’s liability. 
 
dsb, dsb service & retail a/s, dsb ejendomsudvikling a/s and dsb vedligehold a/s are jointly registered for vat 
and payroll tax purposes and are jointly and severally liable for payment of the companies’ aggregate vat and pay-
roll tax liabilities. 
 
accounting practices 
deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. however, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences 
relating to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and on office premises and other items, where temporary 
differences, apart from business acquisitions, arise at the date of acquisition without affecting the profit/loss for the 
year or the taxable income. in cases where the calculation of the tax value may be made according to different taxa-
tion rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management’s planned use of the asset or settlement of the 
liability. 
 
 
 
 
consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts

deferred tax assets, including the value of a tax loss allowed for carry forward and net financing expenses, are rec-
ognised as an asset at the expected value of utilisation, either through elimination of tax on future earnings or by 
set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. 
 
deferred tax is adjusted for eliminations of unrealised intragroup profits and intragroup losses. 
 
deferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and tax rates in the individual countries applicable according to the 
legislation in force at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax.

spare parts, etc., are used for corrective maintenance of rolling stock. for certain groups of spare parts, etc., there 
is an element of uncertainty regarding the time they are used, while emergency stockpiles are created for critical 
product groups with long delivery times. 
 
as of 31 december 2020, the inventory has been written down due to inventory obsoleteness with a total of dkk 400 
million. (2019: dkk 291 million), almost entirely related to spare parts, etc. 
 
accounting practices 
oil for trains and spare parts are measured at cost according to the average cost method. the cost price comprises 
the purchase price plus delivery costs and any processing and other costs directly or indirectly attributable to inven-
tories.  
 
goods for sale in shops, etc., are measured at cost, calculated in accordance with the fifo method. the cost price 
comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs. 
 
inventories are written down to the net realisable value if this is lower than the cost price. the net realisable value 
for inventories is calculated as the sales amount less completion costs and costs incurred to effect the sale.

no significant amount of collateral received for trade receivables. paid deposits are considered as collateral for re-
ceivables from leasing activities. 
 
all trade receivables are due for payment within 1 year. 
 
provision for losses on receivables 
there is an ongoing assessment of indications for loss of value for trade receivables. 
 
in the statement of provisions for expected losses, a segmentation of the population of trade receivables has been 
made. the segmentation separates the portfolio into types of customers, types of receivable and historical experi-
ences in relation to determining losses. an average expected loss percentage is calculated based on the segmenta-
tion.  
 
as of 31 december 2020, provisions for losses have not been made concerning receivables from affiliated compa-
nies, receivable joint taxation contribution, other receivables, prepayment, loans to affiliated companies, or subor-
dinated loan capital in associated companies. 
 
accounting practices 
receivables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to the nominal value. provisions for expected 
losses are based on historical experience and is made when there is an objective indication that a receivable or port-
folio for receivables has decreased in value. if there is an objective indication that an individual receivable has lost 
value, provision is made for losses at the individual level.

as a result of its operations, investments and financing, dsb is exposed to changes in risk relating to interest, cur-
rency exchange rates, raw material prices and liquidity and counterparty risks. the financial management aims to 
address the associated financial risks. the overall framework is set out in the financial policy, which is approved by 
the board of directors. 
 
in accordance with this policy, dsb must monitor, calculate, administer and manage risks, in addition to continuously 
monitoring risk exposure and cash resources. 
 
the purpose of the financial hedging is to limit and control the impact on profit caused by fluctuations in the financial 
markets. there are no significant changes in risk exposure or risk management compared with 2019. 
 
accounting practices  
initial recognition of derivative financial instruments is made in the balance sheet at cost and they are subsequently 
measured at fair value. positive and negative changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognised 
in other receivables and other liabilities, respectively. 
 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging 
of the fair value of a recognised asset or recognised liability are recognised in the income statement together with 
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability. 
 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging 
of future assets or liabilities are recognised in other receivables or other liabilities and in equity. if the future trans-
action results in the recognition of assets or liabilities, amounts previously recognised in equity will be transferred at 
the cost price of the respective asset or liability. if the future transaction results in income or expenses, amounts 
previous recognised as equity will be transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item im-
pacts the income statement. 
 
in respect of derivative financial instruments which do not meet the conditions for treatment as hedging instruments, 
changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement on an ongoing basis. 
section 7 
financial conditions 
 
dsb defines risk as an uncertainty associated with 
future targets that can have wide-ranging impacts 
on safety, punctuality, reputation and finances. 
financial risks include interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, raw material prices, liquidity and 
counterparties. 
interest rate risks are related to changes in 
financing 
interest rates. 
 
the primary currency risks relate to oil purchases 
and trade with international counterparties in eur 
and sek, respectively. 
 
raw materials price risk occurs in connection with 
the purchase of electricity and oil.  
 
liquidity risks relate to the opportunities for ensuring 
liquidity. 
 
counterparty risk arises when counterparties fail to 
fulfil their obligations.

as a result of financing activities, dsb is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, both in denmark and abroad. the 
primary interest rate exposure in this regard relates to fluctuations in cibor, stibor, nibor and euribor. the pol-
icy is to raise all loans so that interest rate risks are only associated with cibor and euribor. interest rate risks are 
normally hedged using interest rate swaps in which variable rate loans are converted to a fixed rate. 
 
within a 12-month period, interest rate sensitivity shall not exceed dkk 100 million (with a percentage point change 
in interest rates), the debt portfolio must have a duration of at least 15 years, and at least 25% of the liability portfo-
lio must be at a fixed rate. accordingly, the weighted average duration of gross debt is 9.5 years (2019: 8.7 years). 
of the financial liabilities, 100% were converted to a fixed rate of interest with maturity of longer than one year 
(2019: 100%). variable-rate debt is adjusted regularly during the year. 
  
 
currency risks in recognised financial assets and liabilities are hedged so that the risk is in dkk. in relation to the 
financial policy, risks in eur or other currencies are only permitted if they are included in the affiliated companies’ 
financing or hedging of exposure from affiliated companies. 
 
the most significant currency exposure relates to loans in jpy, sek, nok and eur, which are hedged using derivative 
financial instruments. after hedging, dsb is not exposed to significant currency risks from financing activities. 
 
other registered positions represent an insignificant share of the currency exposure; the future cash flow in currency 
is hedged 30-70% on average, as calculated for a rolling 12-month period. 
 
currency risks associated with operations are primarily related to oil consumption (usd). other currency risks in re-
lation to trade with international counterparts are limited, apart from sek and eur . the exposure to eur is particu-
larly related to the acquisition of rolling stock.

the net assets in equity investments in foreign-affiliated companies are affected by currency fluctuations when con-
verting to dkk in the consolidated financial statements. this conversion risk is not hedged.

conditions for sensitivity analysis: 
·  financial instruments which are recognised in the balance sheet at 31 december 2020 (2019). 
dsb uses oil and electricity in its operations and is, therefore, exposed to raw materials price risks which are hedged. 
the hedging is ongoing throughout the year and is carried out through the conclusion of raw materials price agree-
ments.

dsb’s policy is to always maintain sufficient cash reserves. the target is to have a cash reserve corresponding to the 
development in the approved budget year’s expected net debt plus dkk 200 million, though at least dkk 1,000 mil-
lion. the cash reserve is calculated as cash in bank and in hand plus access to drawing on bank facilities. 
 
at 31 december 2020, agreements are concluded on revocable bank facilities of dkk 3,616 million and irrevocable 
bank facilities of dkk 5,225 million, expiring during the period 2021-2025 (2019: revocable for dkk 2,500 million 
and irrevocable for dkk 1,750 million, expiring during the period 2020-2024). of these cash resources, dkk 8,317 
million is not utilised. (2019: dkk 3,069 million). 
 
in 2020, a non-terminable facility of eur 400 million was signed with den nordiske investeringsbank (nib) with a 
loan series profile from 2025 and an expiry date in 2035. additionally, a non-terminable facility of eur 150 million 
was signed with the european investment bank (eib) with a total pledged amount of eur 500 million, expiring no 
later than 2045. 
 
 
counterparty risk arises when financial derivative instruments are concluded to hedge financial risks or when liquidity 
is placed with financial counterparties. the risk is that the counterparties will fail to fulfil their obligations. 
 
all cash in bank and in hand and agreements on financial instruments are either placed in banks or as part of agree-
ments with financial institutions rated as a minimum of a according to standard & poor’s rating.

1) fair value exclusively relates to derivative financial instruments. dsb holds no listed equities or bonds. 
 
the valuation of the derivative financial instruments takes place based on common methodologies, as observable 
prices at fixed times are spread out over the lifetime of the instruments for the purposes of forming price curves. 
they are used to discount the payment of the instruments. the prices are provided by a major and well-known infor-
mation system, and the calculations of the valuations are made in a treasury system. the calculated fair values are 
compared with the fair values calculated by the counterparties.

restructuring - staff covers the severance costs in connection with the streamlining of the administration in 2019. 
 
other provisions include obligations regarding civil servants on loan and compensation obligations, etc. 
 
accounting practices 
provisions are recognised when, as a consequence of an event that occurred at the balance sheet date at the latest, 
dsb has a legal obligation or an actual obligation, and it is likely that financial advantages must be given up to meet 
that obligation. 
 
provisions are recognised and measured as the best estimate of the costs necessary to liquidate the obligations. if 
fulfilment of the obligation is expected to be far in the future, the obligation is measured at fair value.

contingent assets includes possible compensation from the state in connection with the financial consequences as a 
result of covid-19 for the period september-december 2020. 
 
contingent liabilities include guarantees at a total of dkk 3 million (dkk 13 million) for affiliated business. this com-
prises an operating guarantee for deliveries under the signal programme for the s-train rail network. 
 
dsb pays an ongoing pension contribution for civil servants, calculated as a percentage of the pensionable salary, to 
cover the state’s pension obligation to civil servants. upon retirement, the state assumes the full pension obligation. 
the contribution rate for the ongoing pension contributions is based on assumptions about expected pension age, 
wage development, etc. deviations from these assumptions, under certain conditions, can result in an adjustment of 
the contributions in the form of additional payment to or from the state at the time of retirement.  
 
dsb has an obligation to pay redundancy payment for three years to civil servants who are dismissed for a cause 
that is not the fault of the civil service, see section 32 of the danish civil servant act. dsb also has a commitment to 
the agency for public finance and management to pay pension costs for civil servants until the expected retirement 
age of 62 years. on the balance sheet date, dsb has only recognised a liability for dismissed civil servants. 
 
in 2018, dsb has cancelled the contract with dxc concerning data centre and sap operations. in 2019, dsb has 
raised claims against dxc. dxc has raised counterclaims against dsb. the final outcome and the financial conse-
quences are uncertain. dsb has not included any potential compensation payments in 2020. 
 
in addition to this, dsb is also a party to a small number of other pending cases. the outcome of these cases, indi-
vidually or jointly, is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial position of the company. 
 
other financial obligations include the leasing of rolling stock at a total of dkk 0 million (dkk 29 million, which fell 
due in 2020). 
 
the increase in other financial obligations relates to agreements for the purchase of new rolling stock. 
 
as part of dsb’s agreement with rejsekort & rejseplan a/s concerning the use of the rejsekort system, dsb is 
obliged to pay an annual subscription fee until the year 2028. the total liability amounts to dkk 1,615 million (dkk 
1,677 million), of which dkk 194 is due for payment in 2021 (dkk 185 million in 2020) and dkk 808 million is due in 
the period 2022-2025 (dkk 744 million in the period 2021-2024). 
 
dsb has outsourced the majority of its it operations covering it services and operations of networks, telephony, 
data centres and systems. the total liability in this regard is dkk 302 million. (dkk 292 million) of which dkk 182 
million falls due in 2021 (dkk 144 million in 2020) and dkk 120 million falls due in the period 2022-2025 (dkk 148 
million in 2021-2024). 
 
dsb has signed a contract for leasing telegade 2 in taastrup. the lease is non-terminable by dsb for the period until 
2026 for parts of the premises. the total liability in this regard is dkk 114 million. (dkk 147 million) of which dkk 23

safety 
in 2020, dsb has continued working with 
the ongoing consolidation of safety manage-
ment as a natural part of everyday life 
throughout dsb. the maturity of the railway 
safety area continues to be high and is 
showing positive developments. 
 
in 2020, dsb began the initial work of en-
suring compliance with legislation concern-
ing eu’s 4th railway package’s technical pil-
lar, with which dsb must comply by the 
time the current safety certificate is to be 
renewed on 31 december 2021. dsb has 
found that there is a high degree of compli-
ance and has initiated a positive and con-
structive dialogue with the danish 
transport, building and housing authority 
and era (eu agency for railways) concern-
ing the coming certification process. 
 
dsb has also been in dialogue with the dan-
ish transport, building and housing author-
ity in 2020 in the context of reporting on op-
erational changes that may impact dsb’s 
safety certificate. none of the year’s 
changes - such as commissioning the new 
eb electric locomotives and termination of 
operations in the northern part of lille syd 
and svendborgbanen - have resulted in 
changes to dsb’s safety certificate. 
 
in q3 and q4, the danish transport, build-
ing and housing authority has also carried 
out physical inspections that ended with sat-
isfactory results, and this reinforces the view 
that dsb has a well-functioning safety man-
agement system which is based on learning 
and development and which can be im-
proved on an ongoing basis. 
 
as in previous years, dsb also continued 
working in 2020 on reducing the number of 
signal overruns and significant accidents, 
with a particular focus on accidents involving 
personal injuries.

1) the table includes the most important safety indicators for long-
distance & regional trains and s-trains. 
2)  the table does not include suicides and attempted suicides. 
3) the figures for 2019 have been changed in relation to previously 
published figures as a result of final calculations. similarly, the 
figures for 2020 represent the status at the time of reporting, but 
may be changed at a later date in connection with the reporting 
for the annual safety report. 
with eight significant accidents, dsb has 
met the safety targets for 2020. the major-
ity of the significant accidents in 2020 were 
yet again due to people getting injured as a 
result of moving into unauthorised locations 
and displaying inappropriate behaviour in 
railway areas.  
 
dsb uses campaigns to inform about the 
importance of being careful and avoiding ex-
posing oneself to danger. it is, however, a 
difficult task to influence this kind of inap-
propriate behaviour. 
 
in 2020, dsb also had a high number of sig-
nal overruns. the registered signal overruns 
were, however, still below the year’s safety 
targets and the number of signal overruns 
has been reduced compared to 2019. 
among other things, this can be attributed 
to the ongoing focus on causes of signal 
overruns, training and the launching of con-
crete activities - including adapting training 
needs and physical conditions.

in 2021, dsb will continue using initiatives 
to address railway-related safety incidents 
on an ongoing basis and will have a particu-
lar focus on significant accident and signal 
overruns. the work with safety management 
also continues, aimed at maintaining the 
safety levels and improving them on an on-
going basis and to ensure that safety man-
agement is a natural part of everyday life at 
dsb. 
risk management 
as a train operator, dsb is exposed to a 
number of different risks and possibilities 
that can impact train operations. risk man-
agement is, therefore, an integrated compo-
nent of dsb’s business processes - including 
when approving significant investments and 
implementing major construction and infra-
structure programmes. 
 
risk management is aimed at preventing 
and preparing the company for incidents 
that interrupt operations, reducing uncer-
tainty, taking advantage of opportunities 
and supporting the fulfilment of the strategic 
goals. 
 
the board of directors has overall responsi-
bility for the risk management process, 
while the ongoing monitoring and follow-up 
on the process are handled by the auditor 
committee. the management is responsible 
for the ongoing updating and development 
of the process.

long-distance & regional trains 
impacted by the pandemic 
covid-19 has had significant consequences 
for the long-distance & regional train traffic 
in 2020. an otherwise promising start to the 
year (with growing market shares for great 
belt crossings and growth in regional traffic) 
was in march replaced with requirements 
from the authorities about customer distanc-
ing and encouraging avoidance of using 
public transport during rush hours to pre-
vent the spread of infection. this has re-
sulted in a significant decrease in the num-
ber of journeys with long-distance & re-
gional trains. 
 
in order to ensure safe journeys for both 
customer and employees, dsb has launched 
a number of safety initiatives, including dis-
tancing markers on stations and in trains, 
providing hand sanitisers at the stations, re-
quiring seat reservations in long-distance & 
regional trains and cleaning services while 
the trains are in operation to supplement 
the daily cleaning rounds. the initiatives are 
intended to make it safer for customers to 
return to using trains on a large scale. 
 
dsb is working hard to ensure that the cus-
tomers it has lost will not give up entirely on 
public transport and dsb is, therefore, fol-
lowing the development of the pandemic 
closely. in addition, there are ongoing dia-
logues with the authorities about adapting 
activities to make it safer to travel by train. 
s-trains impacted by the pandemic 
the authorities’ recommendation to avoid 
public transport during rush hour and the 
general encouragement to work from home 
has also resulted in a significant decrease in 
the number of journeys taken via s-trains. 
 
ensuring a safe journey is an important fac-
tor influencing customers’ return to travel-
ling by train. besides the distancing markers 
in trains and at stations, dsb has, among 
other things, developed an online app (plad-
spaarejsen.dk), which shows whether there 
is plenty of space, limited space or no space 
on the next s-train. in addition, initiatives 
have been launched to disinfect interior sur-
faces in s-trains in operation - for example, 
doorknobs, support bars, and handles on the 
routes between copenhagen-valby and co-
penhagen-ny ellebjerg in order to prevent 
the spread of infection in areas with particu-
larly high numbers of people testing positive 
for covid-19. 
risks concerning rolling stock and 
infrastructure 
changes to infrastructure works 
as a train operator, dsb is, to a significant 
degree, dependent on investments in infra-
structure works on the rail network being 
carried out according to the fixed schedules. 
delays in the infrastructure projects, such as 
the signal programme and the electrification 
programme, mean that scheduled train op-
erations are impaired, and this has a major 
impact on the customers.  
 
in order to ensure that the customers have 
trains that arrive on schedule, dsb is con-
tinually working on improving its planning in 
relation to rolling stock, maintenance and 
the deployment of personnel, and it also 
strives to ensure that planned track closures 
are incorporated as soon as possible into the 
train time tables. 
delivery of spare parts and components 
for an ageing train fleet 
ongoing maintenance of the train fleet is 
crucial for the ability to deliver a good and 
safe product to the customers. the purchase 
of spare parts and corrective maintenance of 
components for the ageing fleet is, however, 
prone to types of faults that lead to a need 
for new spare parts and components, as 
many of the parts are unique and no longer 
produced by the supplier. the consequence 
of this is that rolling stock is out of service 
for longer periods, and this impacts the abil-
ity to maintain stable railway operations.  
 
 
 
 
 
corporate issues 
89 
89 
 
in order to reduce the risk, there is a con-
stant focus on development in operations - 
including workshop management, the pur-
chase of spare parts and changes to traffic 
patterns. 
electric and standardised train fleet 
in the coming years, dsb will be investing 
massively in new electric trains that will re-
place the ageing train fleet. a new standard-
ised fleet is expected to help simplify opera-
tions and result in higher operational stabil-
ity. the investments come with significant 
risks that in the worst-case scenario can de-
lay the deployment of the new electric trains 
as this depends on the plan for the deploy-
ment and completion of new infrastructure 
works being followed. a lack of operational 
permits can also delay the deployment.  
 
the deliveries are monitored during the exe-
cution of the works in order to reduce the 
risk of a delayed phase-in, and dsb will 
monitor the changes to the approval pro-
cesses themselves in order to alleviate po-
tential changes in relation to authorities and 
documentation. 
safety 
safety precedes everything else at dsb, 
where accidents or breaches of safety regu-
lations can have far-reaching consequences. 
the safety of customers and employees is, 
therefore, of the highest priority in the risk 
management process and in carrying out the 
daily work. in order to reduce risks, emer-
gency response plans that aim to ensure the 
ability to handle unforeseen incidents at 
very short notice have been established, 
among other things. in addition, dsb is sub-
ject to a number of requirements from the 
authorities that are continually monitored 
and controlled by the ministry of transport. 
it-related risks 
it security 
dsb relies on well-functioning and reliable 
it systems that support its ability to run an 
effective business and ensure the safety of 
its employees and customers. 
 
cybercrime is a real and serious threat, 
since viruses and internet crime can lead to 
operational disruptions that go far beyond 
the incident itself, and the customer’s per-
sonal data can also be compromised.  
 
dsb focuses, therefore, on protecting its it 
systems and data, and it works in a targeted 
manner to develop a culture where e-learn-
ing is used to improve the employees’ 
awareness of the importance of it security 
and the protection of personal data. 
increased growth through digitalisation 
creating a market-oriented dsb requires 
massive digitalisation initiatives.  
 
dsb wants digitalisation to contribute to 
creating growth through simplified and more 
competitive products in addition to contrib-
uting to an optimal utilisation of capacity. 
this digitalisation must also contribute to 
ensuring efficiency through the simplification 
and automation of processes across the 
business areas.  
other risks 
reputation  
dsb carries out an important societal func-
tion, and it is, therefore, of the utmost im-
portance that dsb is perceived as a respon-
sible company that runs its business opera-
tions with a focus on ethics and compliance 
with legislation, while at the same time, cre-
ating growth and value for society as a 
whole.  
 
dsb is aware of the significance of having a 
good reputation, and it manages risk by 
having clear guidelines and policies aimed at 
ensuring that dsb’s reputation is not 
harmed, but instead continually improves. 
social and employee conditions 
dsb focusses on ensuring a good working 
environment. there continues to be a focus 
 
 
 
corporate issues 
90 
on local campaigns to minimise falling and 
stumbling accidents, and long-term cam-
paigns are being worked on to prevent 
work-related injuries. 
 
furthermore, there is a focus on ensuring 
that employees and customers are safe at 
the stations and on the trains, and there are 
several initiatives underway at the local 
level to teach employees’ conflict resolution 
skills. 
 
environment 
with sustainability being high on the agenda 
and an increasing focus on the environmen-
tal impact and energy consumption of dsb’s 
operations from neighbours, customers and 
employees, there is a risk of increasing ex-
ternal and internal requirements for invest-
ments to reduce the environmental foot-
print. 
 
dsb monitors developments and expects to 
see significant improvements in pace with 
the updating of rolling stock and the acquisi-
tion of electric trains that meet new stand-
ards and contribute to more climate-friendly 
railway traffic in denmark. 
 
in addition, new workshops will be set up in 
eastern and western denmark. these work-
shops must be ready to implement mainte-
nance and preparation work in connection 
with the phasing in and operation of new 
trains. the workshops are set up based on 
guiding principles of sustainability and func-
tionality, and they must be certified accord-
ing to the dgnb gold standard, which is the 
second-highest sustainability certification 
that can be achieved. 
financial risks

dsb’s most important financial risks con-
cerning interest rate and currency fluctua-
tions, see section 7, financial conditions. 
corporate governance 
recommendations for corporate 
governance 
as an independent public corporation, dsb 
follows the state’s recommendations for cor-
porate governance as they appear in “the 
state’s ownership policy”. the policy con-
tains guidelines for the management of state 
corporations, including requirements, expec-
tations and recommendations for corporate 
governance.  
 
in addition, dsb follows the recommenda-
tions of the committee for good corporate 
governance. dsb complies with the recom-
mendations to the extent that they are rele-
vant.  
 
the account of good corporate governance 
according to the “comply with or explain” 
principle has been published on 
www.dsb.dk. 
openness and transparency 
communication 
dsb aims to make the dialogue between the 
corporation and its stakeholders (owner, 
customers, partners and employees) as 
open and broad as possible, and to ensure 
that communication is simple, factual and 
professionally correct. 
customer ambassador 
the customer ambassador processes cus-
tomer complaints and considers cases at 
his/her own initiative. the customer ambas-
sador shall contribute to ensuring that cus-
tomers receive the service that they are en-
titled to. the customer ambassador consid-
ers enquiries from customers who have pre-
viously had their case processed by dsb, 
but who do not feel that they have received 
a satisfactory reply to their complaint.  
 
the customer ambassador prepares half-
yearly status reports published on 
www.dsb.dk.

publication of important content 
dsb notifies the danish business authority 
as soon as possible of all important matters 
relating to the corporation which may be 
presumed to be of importance to dsb’s fu-
ture, owner, creditors or employees. 
annual and interim reports 
as an independent public corporation, finan-
cial reporting complies with the danish fi-
nancial statements act and the dsb act. 
the annual report is audited by a state-au-
thorised public accountant and the auditor 
general.  
 
the board of directors shall submit quar-
terly reports in accordance with the require-
ments of the danish financial statement 
acts. the quarterly reports are sent to the 
minister for transport and the danish busi-
ness authority. 
 
dsb holds quarterly meetings with the min-
ister of transport where, amongst others, 
the financial situation is discussed. 
 
the ministry of transport lays down dsb’s 
accounting regulations pursuant to the dan-
ish railway act. 
corporate social responsibility (csr) 
pursuant to the danish financial statements 
act, dsb is required, as an independent 
public corporation, to publish a report on the 
corporation’s approach to corporate social 
responsibility. among other things, the re-
port must include information on policies for 
corporate social responsibility and how these 
policies are put into practice. the report for 
2020 is incorporated in the annual report 
under the ‘reporting on corporate social re-
sponsibility’ section. 
ethics 
dsb has developed a code of conduct 
which, in accordance with dsb’s compliance 
policy, shall ensure that the company is run 
in an ethical and sustainable manner. this 
code of conduct applies to all of dsb’s em-
ployees. the code of conduct is based on 
dsb’s fundamental values and is a guideline 
for how employees, the management and 
the board of directors should act, make the 
right decision on an everyday basis and how 
they should treat each other, the customers 
and other stakeholders. 
 
the whistle-blower scheme is managed by 
the head of the internal audit function, who 
reports to the auditing committee. if the re-
port concerns the board of directors, com-
pany directors or the internal audit, the case 
will be processed by an external attorney. 
the external attorney will sort all the reports 
before they are passed on to the administra-
tor. employees can use the whistle-blower 
scheme to report anonymously on suspi-
cious or irregular behaviour such as, for ex-
ample, violations of dsb’s code of conduct 
or financial fraud. in 2020, five reports were 
submitted via the scheme. none of these 
cases was assessed as having material con-
sequences for dsb. 
diversity in the board of directors 
the board of directors has set the target 
figures for the underrepresented gender on 
the board of directors. as an independent 
public company, dsb is subject to the provi-
sions of the gender equality act relating to 
public sector administration. these provi-
sions state that the company’s board of di-
rectors should have a balanced composition 
in terms of gender. this target is met as 
there is an equal gender distribution on the 
current board (not including the employee 
representatives). the activities related to 
ensuring diversity at other management lev-
els are described in the section on ‘report-
ing on corporate social responsibility’. 
the general public 
in accordance with the articles of associa-
tion, the ordinary annual meeting is held 
once a year before the end of april. the an-
nual meeting, which corresponds to the an-
nual general meeting in a limited liability 
company, is open to the press.

according to the danish dsb act, the danish 
act on public access to documents on public 
file, the danish public administration act 
and the danish act on the parliamentary 
ombudsman will apply to cases concerning 
employees and the railway activities carried 
out as part of the provision of negotiated 
traffic. 
dsb regulation 
dsb is governed by consolidation act no. 
1184 of 12 october 2010 with the latest 
amendment being the executive order con-
cerning the dsb act of 7 may 2019 (the 
dsb act). dsb’s articles of association 
dated 16 may 2019 were issued pursuant to 
the dsb act.

audit committee 
the audit committee assists the board of 
directors with an independent assessment 
of whether the company's financial report-
ing, internal control, risk management and 
statutory audit are organised appropriately 
in the light of dsb’s size and complexity. 
the framework for the work of the commit-
tee is defined in a mandate. 
by the end of 2020, the audit committee 
comprised the following members, all of 
whom are independent: 
 
carsten gerner, chairman

things, a completed penetration test and 
preparing for an iso-27001 certification. 
• internal control structure 
• policies dealing with, among other things, 
it security and taxes 
• notification of gdpr and compliance func-
tion activities 
the board of directors, election and 
eligibility 
the board of directors includes both mem-
bers selected by the minister for transport 
and members elected by the employees. 
 
the members elected by the minister must 
be elected based on social, managerial and 
business considerations so that the board of 
directors as a whole has insight into traffic-
related issues. furthermore, the composition 
of the board of directors ensures insight into 
financial issues. 
 
the board members elected by the employ-
ees are elected in accordance with the dan-
ish companies act’s provisions concerning 
the election of employee representatives.  
 
the chairman of the board carries out an 
annual evaluation of the work in the board 
of directors and the executive board. in ad-
dition to complying with the recommenda-
tions on corporate governance, the aim is to 
ensure that the board of directors, via its 
composition and competences, always sup-
ports dsb and dsb’s objectives in the best 
possible manner. 
 
the evaluation takes place as a group dis-
cussion and is supported by an electronic 
questionnaire-based survey. one-to-one dis-
cussions between the chairman of the board 
and the individual board members are also 
completed. in relation to the recommenda-
tions for good corporate governance, exter-
nal assistance is brought in for the evalua-
tion at least every three years. all board 
members have participated in the evaluation 
and it was concluded that the board included 
the required competencies. 
 
 
 
corporate issues 
94 
 
the special competencies of the board of di-
rectors are described on www.dsb.dk. 
 
members of the board of directors are 
elected for a period of one to two years. it is 
possible to be re-elected. the minister for 
transport may at any time during a general 
meeting remove the members selected by 
the minister. 
 
composition of the board of directors, 
2020 
in 2020, the board of directors comprised 
nine members, six of whom were selected 
by the ministry for transport and three 
elected by the employees. an overview of 
the board of directors can be found in the 
section on organisation. 
 
the members of the board of directors 
elected at the annual meeting are consid-
ered to be independent. 
the management’s tasks and 
responsibilities 
the board of directors is in charge of the 
general and strategic management of dsb’s 
affairs. the board of directors employs and 
dismisses the executive board and specifies 
its terms of employment. the articles of as-
sociation include a detailed description of 
the tasks of the board of directors.  
 
the executive board can comprise one or 
more members whose appointment is regis-
tered with the danish business authority. 
the executive board is in charge of day-to-
day management.

reporting on corporate social responsibility 
covid-19 has had a significant impact on dsb in 2020 - also when it comes to dsb’s social 
responsibility. as a part of society’s critical infrastructure, dsb has been tasked with ensuring 
that danes can have a safe and reliable public transport available on an everyday basis, de-
spite large parts of the country being shut down. 
 
the operations in 2020 have demanded a special focus on avoiding the spread of infection 
and ensuring responsible behaviour in the public transport system - for both customers and 
employees. 
 
dsb’s approach throughout the period has been to follow the recommendations of the author-
ities. specifically, this has resulted in communications aimed at public safety towards the cus-
tomers both in the media and online and also specific recommendations and nudging in the 
form of, for example, loudspeaker messages, posters, pictograms and distancing markers at 
stations and in trains. 
 
the employees have had access to relevant protective gear. together with a special staff and 
communications setup, all covid-19 related questions across the organisation have been fol-
lowed up continually. dsb has worked with both customer-facing issues and with - in light of 
the pandemic - securing the working environment for employees. 
 
among other things, the employees have been provided with relevant protective equipment 
and instructions in working safely under covid-19. dsb has also planned and ensured that 
non-critical employees have worked at home during the periods recommended by the author-
ities to minimize the risk of infection. 
 
in addition to the above, dsb's initiatives in connection with covid-19 are also described in 
the management's report, initiatives in connection with covid-19 and commercial risks. 
 
the initiative is a natural extension of dsb’s work with corporate social responsibility as de-
scribed in this section. 
 
dsb’s focus on corporate social responsibility contributes to the creation of a framework 
within which: 
• the company’s customers can travel easily, safely and securely with dsb. this includes el-
derly and disabled customers. 
• an environmentally and climate-friendly public transport company benefits society, custom-
ers, employees and dsb. 
• there is a good working environment, where, amongst others, diversity contributes to the 
development of dsb. 
• there is an internal pride in working for a company that makes a positive contribution to 
society.

dsb’s purpose is to: provide room for everyone on this journey towards sustainability. work 
towards creation of a more sustainable company focusing on reducing congestion and pro-
moting that transition in denmark. the part of dsb’s work that involves corporate social re-
sponsibility is described in further detail under results - sustainability. 
 
dsb complies with the un global compact’s 10 universal principles, focusing on human rights 
and employee rights. the ethical rules require that our suppliers comply with national and in-
ternational rules regarding child labour, health and safety at work, discrimination, use of 
forced or involuntary labour, corruption, bribery and the environment. dsb’s ethical policy 
also includes a whistle-blower scheme providing good opportunities for handling any irregu-
larities as quickly as possible. 
 
the environmental policy describes the work involved in actively reducing the company’s cli-
mate impact and is described in more detail below under environment and climate. 
 
additionally, dsb has a policy for working environment, diversity and communication and 
staff, which creates the framework for proper and safe working conditions and open and hon-
est communication. dsb also has an accessibility policy, which ensures that customers with 
disabilities can make use of dsb’s services. 
 
the procurement policy aims to ensure that dsb handles acquisitions in a professional man-
ner and prevents bribery. social responsibility is also expressed in the requirements that are

made of suppliers. dsb’s focuses on purchasing items that support dsb’ goals for sustainabil-
ity and, when signing contracts with external suppliers, dsb ensures that they are familiar 
with the code of ethics to a relevant extent. 
 
safety and security is a human right. the combined expression of dsb’s work in this context 
is reflected in the above policies and are documented through the activities below. 
collaboration and support 
since 2009, dsb has been a part of the un global compact and reports annu-
ally on its work related to social responsibility. 
 
in 2018, dsb entered into a 4-year strategic partnership with the un’s associa-
tion for children, unicef. the purpose of the collaboration was to make it easy for dsb’s cus-
tomers and employees to become involved in helping the world’s most vulnerable children, 
and in that manner contribute towards the creation of a more fair and sustainable future. the 
goal is to collect at least dkk 1 million per year in the period 2019-2021. in 2020, over dkk 
1.3 million was collected for unicef’s work. 
 
since 2008, dsb has collaborated with ‘natteravnene’, a night watch group consisting of 
4,000 adult volunteers who patrol the cities at night - including at stations and in trains - to 
create a safer environment. dsb continues to provide financial support to natteravnene. they 
can travel by all dsb trains free of charge when they carry out their volunteer work. in addi-
tion, dsb has added natteravnene’s logo and colours to 2 s-trains. 
 
dsb collaborates with a number of aid organisations in denmark by allowing them to collect 
donations for their charitable causes and to hand out materials to customers at the stations. 
these organisations include ‘danmarks indsamlingen’ (denmark’s fundraising) (dr and 12 of 
denmark’s largest humanitarian organisations), danchurchaid, the danish cancer society, 
mellemfolkeligt samvirke (actionaid), save the children denmark, danish red cross, the 
danish refugee council and the world’s best news. 
 
at election time in denmark, dsb also supports the democratic process by permitting the po-
litical parties and their candidates to distribute material at the stations in the period leading 
up to the election. 
safety and security  
it must be safe and secure to be a customer and employee of dsb. safety is deeply inte-
grated in the way that dsb operates. in the safety policy, it is stated: our customers need to 
be able to take safety for granted - but we must never do so! 
 
surveillance in trains and at stations contributes to safety and security. at the end of 2020, 
over 2,500 cameras were installed at 143 stations and almost 4,000 cameras in s-trains. as 
an example, the camera surveillance is used to ensure that police and extra personnel are 
called in when the situation requires it, and also to help police solve crimes such as vandal-
ism, violent assaults, pick-pocketing, etc. 
 
dsb has installed heart defibrillators in trains and at certain stations. in 2020, the heart de-
fibrillators have been used in both stations and trains, and in several cases, this has helped to 
save lives. due to covid-19 restrictions, no courses have been held in 2020 on how to use 
heart defibrillators.

suicides and attempted suicides are, unfortunately, recurring events. besides being a tragedy 
for those run over by trains as well as for their families, it also has an impact on customers 
and employees in the form of both mental strain and more trivial impacts such as cancelled 
trains and delays. 22 suicides and 16 attempted suicides were registered in 2020. 
 
in january 2020, automated lighting was added to dark areas at valby station and signs were 
also erected with the number to livslinien (a danish suicide hotline). amongst the calls made 
to livslinien, it is believed that one call resulted in a single person aborting an attempted sui-
cide involving jumping in front of a train. work continues with similar initiatives at other sta-
tions where the number of suicides has been relatively high.

1) due to covid-19, customer satisfaction levels have not been measured throughout the whole of 2020. at the same time, the data collection methodology has been changed and this 
may result in minor shifts compared to previous surveys. 
the customers’ perception of security in trains and at stations is monitored continually in cus-
tomer surveys. the surveys show that customers feel a bit less secure in 2020 compared to 
2019. the decrease is assumed to be related to the covid-19 situation which has resulted in 
customers feeling a bit more insecure travelling by train due to the risk of infection. the cus-
tomer satisfaction levels for 2020 are 
• security in trains: 8.6 
• security at stations: 8.1 
overall, the reported ‘satisfaction with this journey’ was 7.9 in 2020, which is 0.1 percentage 
points lower than in 2019. 
 
in 2020, dsb also spent large sums on removing graffiti and creating attractive and safe en-
vironments for customers both in trains and at stations. among other things, this took place

via preventive efforts such as security guards, etc. and targeted cleaning of trains and build-
ings. dsb’s partnership with banedanmark on a zero-tolerance policy for graffiti at all stations 
continues. the stations most at-risk are checked for graffiti on a daily basis while the other 
stations are checked once a week. the organised graffiti actions at the stations have been vir-
tually eliminated, but there is still a lot of ‘tagging’ going on - though these are quickly re-
moved. the additional anti-graffiti initiatives have made customers feel more secure in trains. 
 
dsb is focused on ensuring that the stations are kept as clean and tidy as possible, as this 
makes customers feel more secure there as well. the presence of service staff and monitoring 
initiatives also make our customers feel more secure and they can also help the police in any 
investigative work. finally, in several cities, dsb has a close and ongoing partnership with the 
police and the relevant authorities when it comes to the collaboration between schools, social 
authorities and the police. 
health and safety 
part of dsb’s strategy involves being an attractive place to work where health and safety is-
sues are a natural part of decision-making processes and the day to day work. this is, among 
other things, supported via a systematic approach to health and safety issues. in 2020, dsb 
has, therefore, chosen to become working environment certified based on the new iso45001 
standard. 
 
figure 2: work accidents 
number 
 
 
dsb is continually focused on creating a better working environment and reducing the num-
ber of work-related accidents and absences. accidents with absences declined to 94 in 2020 
from 146 in 2019. accidents without absences declined to 552 in 2020 from 701 in 2019. al-
together, the number of work accidents declined from 847 in 2019 to 646 in 2020. 
 
the decrease is the result of increased systematic analysis of the causes and extent of work 
accidents in addition to a decrease in violence, threats and accidents involving falls and stum-
bles resulting from a great focus and effort dedicated to these areas. in addition, the covid-
19 situation has also resulted in fewer customers taking the train and thus fewer conflict situ-
ations.

when many people are bunched together at stations, kiosks and in trains, and also when it 
comes to ticket controls, disagreements may occur that can escalate to threats and violence 
against employees. dsb makes every effort to become better at preventing and managing 
these situations. this is accomplished, amongst other things, by training employees in conflict 
management and collaborating with the police. following the introduction of new guidelines in 
2018 to prevent and manage violence and threats, there has been a continual decrease of 
such incidents. the guidelines are focused on ensuring that the employees’ health is always 
the top priority and that they receive support when violence and threats occur. 
 
figure 3: violence and threats against employees 
number 
 
 
dsb has zero-tolerance for abusive behaviour in all situations - both external and internal. 
this applies to sexual harassment, bullying, violence, threats or other abusive behaviour. in 
2020, dsb has made this very clear in its guidelines for sexual harassment. dsb’s annual 
workplace assessment includes an investigation of the scope of abusive behaviour internally 
in dsb, and this forms the basis for a management-level follow-up. 
 
in 2020, dsb has also worked on reducing stress. this has been done by providing infor-
mation and tools to employees, managers and the working environment organisation. the 
proportion of employees who respond that they have experienced work-related stress was 
28% in the latest workplace assessment in 2018. part of the action plans includes a focus on 
preventing and dealing with stress.

figure 4: absence due to sickness 
number of sick days, average 
 
 
in 2020, dsb has focused on reducing the general level of absence due to sickness and the 
absence policy has been revised. the average absence due to sickness has increased in 2020 
for the customer-oriented areas and in general, but has decreased among the administrative 
staff. at the start of the pandemic, absence due to sickness increased, but it has normalized 
by the end of the year. 
accessibility  
dsb wants to ensure that it is easy for everyone to take the train - including those challenged 
by disabilities. 
 
dsb offers assistance for the disabled, and it can be ordered around the clock - however, at 
least 12 hours before the planned start of the journey. similarly, dsb has a companion 
scheme that allows the disabled person to bring along a companion at a reduced price. 
 
in 2020, dsb provided disabled assistance in 9,167 cases (2019: 18,481) and sold 38,029 
disability/disability companion tickets (2019: 60,377). 
 
dsb has trained 70 children’s guides who take care of these children in a special train car-
riage where only these children have seat reservations. in 2020, 11,411 tickets were sold for 
children’s guides (2019: 15,591). 
 
as for other journeys, the numbers above have decreased compared to 2019 due to the 
covid-19 pandemic. 
 
a parliamentary majority has set aside dkk 25 million per year from 2021 for reducing fares 
for pensioners. the funds are divided between east and west denmark based on the current 
passenger revenue for pensioner products provided by the traffic companies. 
reporting on diversity 
dsb is an accommodating company with room for diversity. the diversity policy is, among 
other things, used in the recruitment, development and retention of employees. dsb believes 
that diversity is a strength and makes it a more competitive company.

the work with diversity is focused on: 
• adding more traineeships 
• hiring more employees on special terms 
• hiring more employees with minority backgrounds 
• hiring more women. 
 
in order to appeal to a wide range of potential candidates, dsb’s job adverts include pictures 
of people of different genders, ages and ethnic backgrounds. dsb also works in a focused 
manner with digitalisation where, among other things, e-learning videos emphasise that dsb 
is a workplace with room for everyone. 
dsb has developed a recruitment process for the future which involves dsb hiring trainees 
twice a year.  
 
in 2020, an additional 21 office trainees were hired, bringing the total throughout dsb to 43.  
in addition, dsb employs two sales trainees and 56 apprentices. the number of apprentices 
is closely correlated with the daily operations. fewer apprentices were, therefore, recruited in 
2020 compared to 2019 due to the changes to operations in coming years. 
 
dsb has also chosen to help to integrate refugees into the danish labour market. the last 
three years, around 100 refugees participated in brief 4-week internships and six refugees 
were enrolled in a special 13-week introductory labour market course. 
 
there are also ongoing internship programmes in several of dsb’s 7-eleven stores. these 
programmes are aimed at, for example, refugees or citizens who need to be integrated back 
into the labour market after a period of illness or the like. 
 
the number of dsb employees with ethnic minority backgrounds has increased in 2020. 
 
equal representation at management levels is an integral part of the staff policy. dsb’s board 
of directors has an even gender distribution (not counting the board members elected by em-
ployees). the gender composition of the board of directors thus meets the target of having a 
balanced gender composition. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corporate issues 
103 
103 
dsb wants to ensure that the gender composition includes at least 1/3 of the under-repre-
sented gender. at the end of 2020, the gender distribution amongst the directors was 29% 
female. 30% of all managers in dsb were also women, and this more or less matches the 
proportion of total female employees. as in previous years, the proportion of female manag-
ers increased in 2020 across all management tiers. 
 
further resources who will work intensively on continuing to develop and update dsb’s diver-
sity initiatives will be added to hr in 2021. as part of this process, new initiatives will be 
identified and new targets will be set. 
bribery 
dsb does not tolerate corruption, and it has clear internal guidelines for receiving gifts. the 
guidelines are communicated to the employees via e-learning courses on the intranet and are 
also a topic in the introductory training for new employees.  
 
dsb also has an acquisition policy with a code of conduct to which all suppliers must adhere. 
dsb trades with both danish and international suppliers as an integrated part of maintenance 
works, the acquisition of new trains and other activities. dsb makes a very large proportion 
of its purchases from known suppliers. 
 
finally, dsb has a whistle-blower scheme that is administered by the head of internal audit-
ing. dsb has recorded no instances of bribery in 2020. 
environment and climate  
dsb is part of the green transition in denmark. in 2019, dsb specified four ambitious targets 
for the climate and environment in 2030 as part of the journey towards a sustainable future. 
• carbon neutral - all of dsb is to be supplied with renewable energy 
• reducing energy consumption by 50% - via a focus on increasing energy efficiency 
• no particle emissions from train engines - avoid harming the environment 
• at least 90% of waste is to be reused - i.e., turned into new resources. 
dsb has changed the basis for three out of the four objectives in order to focus on the areas 
where dsb is responsible for operations and thus has the opportunity to meet the targets via 
optimisations. the changes can be seen in the notes under the diagrams below. 
 
more detailed information on policies, initiatives and results are available in the environmen-
tal annual report 2020, which can be found at www.dsb.dk. 
co2 emissions 
dsb’s objective is to be carbon neutral by 2030, making all trains and other operations sup-
plied with renewable energy. 
 
dsb’s future electrical locomotives and train sets will provide a significant contribution to re-
ducing co2 emissions. as the transition is made to electrical rolling stock, new and more en-
ergy-efficient workshops will be established and this will also have a positive effect. 
 
 
 
 
corporate issues 
104 
objective 1: co2-neutral 
ton co2 
 
1) the carbon neutrality target no longer includes employee commutes. comparative figures have been adjusted. 
the total co2 emissions in 2020 have fallen by 6% compared to 2019. the development is af-
fected by a slight reduction in dsb’s diesel consumption together with a greater reduction in 
the co2 emissions from electricity production in denmark. 
energy consumption 
dsb’s objective for energy consumption in 2030 is to halve this compared to 2018. the future 
electrical locomotives and trains will play a major part in energy optimisation and so will the 
new and more energy-efficient workshops. at the same time, dsb will continue to optimise 
the operation in general of workshops and other types of buildings. 
 
through the environmental policy and the certification of workshops and preparation centres, 
dsb focuses on reducing both its impact on the local environment and reducing energy con-
sumption.

objective 2: energy consumption reduced by 50%1) 
gj (million) 
 
1) the target for energy reduction now also includes fuel for selected modes of transport (replacement traffic, school and work-related trips). 
comparative figures have been adjusted. 
 
89% of dsb’s total energy consumption in 2020 was used for train operations, which is simi-
lar to the 2019 level.  
 
the total energy consumption for train operations in 2020 fell by 2% compared to 2019.  the 
energy consumption of diesel trains fell by 3% while the electricity consumption for train op-
erations remained the same. 
 
in october, dsb commissioned the first of the new eb electric locomotives. two more loco-
motives were commissioned in december. as more electric locomotives are commissioned 
during 2021, the phasing out of diesel locomotives will be seen in the energy consumption 
levels. 
 
the energy consumption for buildings and facilities fell by 7% in 2020 compared to 2019. the 
development in energy consumption is, among other things, due to a large decrease in the 
consumption of both electricity and heating.  
 
in 2020, the following initiatives have had an impact on developments in energy consump-
tion: 
• an increased focus on optimising operations in heating plants in two large workshops in co-
penhagen have resulted in energy savings in 2020 
• a focus on energy optimisation and better lighting has resulted in a decrease in electricity 
consumption in dsb’s 7-eleven stores, workshops and preparation centres 
• covid-19 has impacted the energy and water consumption levels - mainly in dsb’s admin-
istration and at dsb’s course centre at knudshoved. this is due to employees working from 
home and cancelled seminars and courses.

in 2020, dsb has completed a mandatory energy inspection of the trains and the workshop in 
taastrup. 
particle emissions 
dsb’s objective is zero particle emission from train engines by 2030. this is to be achieved 
via using electrical rolling stock, though it requires that banedanmark continues its work on 
electrification. 
 
diesel trains make a local impact on air quality in the form of particles, nox, etc. dsb’s main 
focus is on a reduction of particles, including ultrafine particles. the electric train sets and lo-
comotives do not emit particles from the train’s engines. 
 
objective 3: no particle emissions from the train’s engines 
particles, tonnes 
 
 
the total emission of particles, calculated by mass, from diesel trains has fallen by 9% in 
comparison to 2019 and by 39% since 2017. this decrease is due to the reduced consump-
tion of diesel, the ongoing retrofitting of me diesel locomotives with new cylinders and injec-
tors and changing the injector settings. 
waste 
dsb’s objective is to reuse at least 90% of waste in 2030. in order to reach this goal, dsb 
will focus on how waste management at workshops, when preparing the trains, at stations 
and in the administration can be optimised so that the amount of waste is reduced and the 
waste is reused to a higher degree than at present. the remaining 10% of the waste in 2030 
will be waste that requires other treatment.

objective 4: at least 90% of waste is to be reused1) 
distribution of waste 
 
1) the objective of recycling 90% of waste now also applies to building and facility waste. comparative figures have been adjusted. 
 
in 2020, the overall recycling percentage was 46%. this is a decrease of 57% compared to 
2019 and is mainly attributed to the fact that during 2020 dsb only scrapped one ic4 train 
set and sold one ea electric locomotive to the danish railway museum in odense. in 2019, 
the recycling percentage was higher, as it was affected by more train sets being scrapped for 
recycling. 
 
the relatively large amount of landfilled waste in 2018 primarily relates to contaminated soil 
in connection with the establishment of a parking area. 
 
during 2020, dsb has set up two ‘station rooms’ (a kiosk and café in one) at haslev station 
and rungsted kyst station. from december, it has been possible to sort waste into four dif-
ferent categories. this solution was implemented so that more categories of waste sorting can 
be implemented in the future. starting in november, a pilot project was initiated at the train 
stations in roskilde and vejle with customer-facing waste sorting at source in the categories 
plastic/metal, residual waste and cans/bottles with a deposit that can be returned to the ben-
efit of others. 
 
during 2020, all of dsb’s 7-eleven stores were enrolled in the ‘too good to go’ scheme. in 
2020, this has resulted in almost 28,000 meals being saved, which amounts to 28 tonnes of 
food that would otherwise have been thrown out. 
 
the waste disposal area at copenhagen central station has been renovated in 2020 and a 
new waste scheme has been created for all stores, involving an external supplier sorting the 
waste. during 2021, a model will be developed for how to manage customer-facing waste at 
copenhagen central station.

dsb will set up three new workshops 
the new workshops in copenhagen and aarhus will be used for the new train sets and are ex-
pected to open in 2025 and 2027 respectively. the new workshop in næstved is to be used 
for train coaches and electric locomotives and is expected to open in 2025.  
 
all three workshops will be certified by the dgnb gold sustainability standard.  
 
for the workshop in copenhagen, the environmental impact assessment and related section 
25 permits have been the subject of a public hearing process in 2020. the zoning plan for the 
workshop in næstved was approved in 2020. in coming years, the workshops will obtain the 
remaining zoning and environmental approvals. 
 
noise from diesel locomotives at køge 
from 28 march - 30 november, banedanmark has carried out infrastructure works that have 
resulted in track closures between ringsted and næstved. trains to and from nykøbing fal-
ster were, therefore, re-routed via køge during this period. the use of me diesel locomotives 
and double-decker coaches has in that connection resulted in many complaints about noise 
and smoke nuisances. in this period, dsb has been in dialogue with køge municipality to re-
duce the noise nuisance. 
 
the oil spill at the supply facility in nykøbing falster 
at the end of 2018, diesel oil was observed in a ditch. dsb was ordered to clean it up and has 
subsequently removed the contaminated soil and water. in may 2019, dsb was also ordered 
by guldborgsund municipality to investigate the cause of the oil spill. dsb has investigated 
the extent of the contamination and an oil separator at the supply plant will be replaced by 
the beginning of 2021.

management statement 
 
dsb’s management has today discussed and approved dsb's line accounts for 2020. 
 
the accounts are presented in accordance with the principles and methods specified in the 
dsb accounting regulations, taking into account the interpretations agreed with the ministry 
of transport, building and housing. 
 
it is our view that: 
• the accounting regulations have been respected in 2020, including implementing the nec-
essary accounting breakdown, see section 2 of the accounting regulations, such that dsb 
can account for the need for subsidies for the passenger traffic. 
• the model instrument and the basis of allocation used are documented in accordance with 
section 3 of the accounting regulations so that dsb can account for the financial allocation 
to the routes.

dsb has prepared reports on the finances of the train operations divided into activity areas in 
order to promote transparency in their finances and results. combined with a division of oper-
ator tasks by lines, this contributes to adding transparency to dsb’s train operations, and 
dsb continually uses the line accounts to streamline operations. 
 
the following is highlighted: 
• covid-19 has had a big impact on passenger revenues, and all three train service areas 
have seen significantly lower revenues than usual. 
• dsb has received dkk 914 million in compensation for the financial losses (mainly in the 
form of lost passenger revenue) incurred due to covid-19. the compensation has been 
classified as traffic contract payments, as the compensation is viewed to have been pro-
vided as a part of the traffic contract’s renegotiation provision. 
• in 2019, the long-distance & regional train rolling stock has been written down. the write-
down has resulted in lower depreciation in 2020 and has thus lowered the cost levels in 
general for long-distance & regional traffic and Øresund traffic. 
• in 2020, s-train traffic had a negative pre-tax result of dkk 77 million, including dkk 335 
million in distributed contract payments. there were no write-downs of s-train rolling stock 
in 2019, and the cost levels in 2020 were slightly higher than in 2019. 
 
activity area accounts 
public services delivered by dsb pursuant to the traffic contract are divided between train 
service, train system, and general obligations, see fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet.. 
• train service relates to the operator task of running trains. 
• train system is a collective designation for the activities that support the task of running 
trains, from operation of stations, provision of rolling stock, planning and monitoring the 
daily train operations to traffic information and the sale of tickets. 
• general obligations are activities that are independent of train operations - for example, 
subsidies to the danish railway museum and the relative costs for arriva stations that are 
not covered by arriva. 
train service is furthermore categorised as long-distance and regional train traffic, s-train 
traffic and Øresund traffic. train system is categorised as stations, rolling stock and sys-
tems & channels. systems & channels includes sales channels and customer service as well 
as traffic handling and shared functions. 
 
for 2020, revenues before the leasing of rolling stock amounted to dkk 9,185 million. the 
revenues finance the delivered public service traffic. 
 
in 2020, passenger revenues amounted to dkk 3,432 million, and in the route accounts this 
is distributed to the train operations services2), i.e., the passenger traffic, while the train 
 
2) this is an analytical choice, as the passenger revenues are in fact also used for co-financing, for example, stations, sales channels, timetable 
planning, traffic information, etc. if the passenger revenues were also allocated to train system, the amount of the contract payment to be 
allocated to these areas of activities would be reduced.

system tasks in the model are almost entirely financed by the revenues from the traffic con-
tract. commission revenues from the sale of tickets by other operators are distributed to sys-
tems & channels and amount to dkk 68 million of other operating revenues. 
 
danish train passenger traffic is characterised by a strong desire for cohesion in the public 
transport, including an integrated and uniform customer experience for the entire journey. in 
order to deliver this, the public transport sector is characterised by a high degree of integra-
tion and collaboration across traffic companies and operators, in addition to shared and inte-
grated commercial solutions such as, for example, rejsekort (travel card), rejseplanen 
(travel planner) and dot. calculation of the passenger revenues has been based on the 
signed agreements between the traffic companies and operators on revenue sharing. 
 
dsb undertakes an integrating role in the danish train passenger traffic by, for example, co-
financing the development of other traffic companies’ traffic systems and traffic offers. an ex-
ample of this is the passenger revenue sharing in the greater copenhagen area and the oper-
ation of contractor traffic services in central and western jutland - though this has less of an 
impact after the transition to the k21 timetable as of 13 december 2020. 
 
the current revenue-sharing model in the greater copenhagen area means that metro-
selskabet i/s receives a share of the total passenger revenue that exceeds the metro’s share 
of the total number of journeys in the copenhagen area. this disproportionate share (the so-
called metro double factor of 1.49) has a negative impact on dsb’s passenger revenue. 
 
it is expected that the revenue sharing between the parties on zealand (movie, metro-
selskabet and dsb) will be based on a so-called source distribution of sales revenue based on 
rejsekort (travel card) data. this will result in a much better and more transparent basis for 
revenue sharing than the system that has been used so far and based on the companies’ own 
counting systems and periodic customer counts in the individual modes of transport.  
 
in 2020, some traffic has been contracted on behalf of arriva danmark on a single route in 
central and western jutland. this should be viewed in the context of train services in that 
area generally having been handed over to arriva danmark from dsb as part of a political de-
cision to do so. in practice, contracted traffic means that dsb pays for the costs of operating 
a number of departures from central and western jutland in order to thereby ensure direct 
departures for customers to the rest of the country. the direct costs amount to dkk 13 mil-
lion, and the revenues from the contracted traffic go to arriva danmark - but dsb is compen-
sated in turn via contract payments from the state. this is a route where dsb does not have 
a large production and, therefore, not a lot of passenger revenues go to arriva danmark in-
stead of dsb - an estimate would be dkk 1-2 million per year in 2020, which is also a year 
that has been hit hard by covid-19. 
 
in 2020, the total revenues from traffic contracts amounted to dkk 4,819 million. these rev-
enues finance the loss-making train traffic and other activity areas based on the principles de-
termined in the traffic contract with the state. in 2020, dsb has received dkk 914 million in 
compensation for the financial losses incurred due to covid-19 for the period 11 march to the 
end of august. this amount is treated as a normal contract payment in the model. 
 
with the vision of a market oriented dsb, dsb has presented an ambitious plan that, to-
gether with the state’s investments in the railway infrastructure and dsb’s investments in the 
train of the future, will result in increased financial room for manoeuvre in dsb up to 2030.

this can either be used to reduce the contract payments from the state and/or to reduce 
ticket prices for the benefit of passengers and society at large. from a societal point of view, 
if a larger proportion of all transport activities were by rail, this would also contribute to a 
more sustainable denmark and reduce congestion in and around the major cities.  
 
of the total revenues before leasing of rolling stock, passenger revenues amounted to 37 
percent, revenues from traffic contracts amounted to 53 percent and other operating reve-
nues amounted to 10 percent. 
 
in accordance with the traffic contract, the contract payment is distributed such that, for sta-
tions, it reflects a risk-adjusted return on the invested capital (roic) of 3 percent. for mate-
rial and general obligations, it reflects a cost coverage without return and, for systems & 
channels, it reflects a profit margin of 5 percent. the remaining contract payment is distrib-
uted to train service.  
 
the positive result for stations and for systems & channels is, therefore, due to the technical 
distribution of the contract payment. 
 
of the total revenues before leasing of rolling stock, 68 percent finances train services and 
31 percent finances train system tasks, while the remaining 1 percent finances general obli-
gations.

4) 
other operating revenues includes fees, compensation, rent, leasing of rolling stock, and revenues from traffic-independent activities. passenger revenues under systems & channels also covers commis-
sion revenues from the sale of tickets from other operators. 
in 2020, costs before leasing of rolling stock amounted to dkk 8,262 million for public ser-
vices. 68 percent of which are used for train service, 30 percent for train system and the 
rest for general obligations. 
 
for both income and costs, costs relating to leasing of rolling stock have been disregarded, as 
the rolling stock is considered in the line accounts as a result-neutral transfer within the com-
pany. it is assumed technically that the rolling stock is leased for train service without any 
return. 
 
the breakdown of train operations into activity areas is based on public services, which is a 
statement of the activities carried out by dsb under the traffic contract. 
 
the basis for this breakdown of the activities is the route economy model. this model divides 
the profit and loss account into areas of activity and calculates the economy of each individual 
area of activity based on an estimate of the type of activities required in the respective area. 
costs of train service 
most of dsbs’ costs for 2020, including depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and finan-
cial items relate to train services (dkk 6,549 million), distributed on long-distance & re-
gional trains (dkk 4,338 million), s-train traffic (dkk 1,562 million) and Øresund traffic (dkk 
649 million), see fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet.. 
 
rolling stock maintenance and leasing total dkk 2,708 million or 41 percent of the total costs 
for train services, while costs for onboard personnel amount to dkk 1,611 million or 25 per-
cent, see figure 3.

in the coming years, a very large number of infrastructure works will be performed in den-
mark. these works are absolutely essential and, once they have been completed, they will - 
together with the new electric trains - ensure a well-functioning and sustainable train opera-
tion that will benefit dsb’s customers. during the infrastructure work, dsb’s finances are im-
pacted to a very significant degree. in particular, this is in the form of reduced passenger rev-
enues as the customers opt out of taking the train and use other modes of transportation, but 
it is also in the form of increased costs for replacement traffic. 
 
banedanmark’s grants cover the project costs of infrastructure works, while dsb pays the 
costs of replacement traffic when train operations are prevented due to track closures. in 
2020, dsb has spent dkk 116 million on replacement traffic. it is banedanmark that plans 
and carries out the infrastructure works. 
 
in accordance with the accounting regulations, dsb shall allocate the complete costs of the 
activities and thus also a part of the supporting functions, which constitute dkk 1,080 million 
or 16 percent of the train service costs. the support functions include cross-sector it func-
tions, staff and common functions, and finance and hr functions. more than half of the costs 
of support functions are staff and consultancy costs. the remainder includes costs of software 
development, licences, outsourced data operations centre, insurance, rental of premises, and 
costs of consumption, marketing and depreciation/amortisation, etc. 
 
costs of support functions are allocated to the activity areas based on the number of employ-
ees, converted into full-time employees involved in carrying out the individual activities. this 
means that employee-intensive activities account for a substantial part of the costs. conse-

quently, train services, to which the largest share of employees contributes directly as mem-
bers of the onboard personnel and indirectly in the workshops, carries a relatively large share 
of the costs of supporting functions. 
 
the costs of support functions are only variable to a limited extent in relation to the extent of 
train services. the handover of traffic to other operators thus has no substantial effect on the 
costs for interdepartmental it functions or other support functions. 
train system costs 
the train system costs, excluding rolling stock, which ensures coherence in train services in 
denmark, are dkk 2,100 million in 2020 including depreciation, amortisation, write-downs 
and financial revenues and costs, see fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet.. systems & 
channels, which comprises traffic handling & common functions and sales channels & cus-
tomer service, accounts for dkk 1,393 million or 66 percent of this while stations accounts 
for dkk 707 million or 34 percent. 
 
sales channels & customer service comprises customer-oriented activities such as ticket 
sales channels (personal service, self-service sales and other sales channels), customer ser-
vice, traffic information, rejsekort (travel card) and marketing. traffic handling & common 
functions includes traffic-oriented activities such as planning of personnel, rolling stock, and 
traffic, traffic education, safety, monitoring and control of railway traffic at the operations 
centres, etc. run by dsb together with banedanmark. in line with train service, the figures 
for train systems must be calculated with the fully allocated costs and thus carry a share of 
dsb’s total supporting functions.

vat and tax 
dsb has partial right of deduction of incoming vat, since the group has both vat-liable and 
vat-free activities. the non-deductible proportion of incoming vat is included in the individ-
ual items in the income statement and the balance sheet. 
 
for 2020, the non-deductible proportion of incoming vat amounts to a total cost of dkk 334 
million. dsb and a number of associated companies share a common vat registration. the 
non-deductible vat is distributed to the activity areas based according to the relative vat 
weighting of the relevant activities. subsequently, the non-deductible vat matches the actual 
costs via the distribution model. 
 
corporation tax is not allocated to the activity areas and routes. in the general accounts, cor-
poration tax is divided between public services according to the negotiated contract and com-
petitive activities. the corporate tax related to public services has been calculated as reve-
nues of dkk 73 million in 2020. 
earnings for the year and statement of net contract payments 
profit/loss for the year for public services has been calculated as a deficit of dkk 185 million. 
negative earnings are deducted from dsb’s equity, and thus the owner’s (the danish state’s) 
value of dsb. the contract payment also deducts/adds various levies such as taxes, vat and 
payroll tax that are returned to the state, and dsb also pays infrastructure charges to use the 
infrastructure (tracks and bridges) that dsb uses for its long-distance & regional train opera-
tions. 
 
hence figure 5 calculates the state’s net contract payment to dsb once these factors have 
been taken into account - in other words when the contract payments have been deducted 
from the internal distribution of resources in the sector in addition to the redistribution to 
other state actors. the net contract payment is thus an expression of the state’s actual pay-
ment to dsb for train operations.

127 
figure 5: the state’s net contract payments to dsb 
amounts in dkk million 
 
 
thus, the state’s net contract payments to dsb amount to dkk 2,894 million. in addition, in 
2020 dsb has received dkk 914 million as compensation for the financial consequences of 
covid-19. the amount is calculated as a net loss, mainly comprising lost passenger revenues 
minus cost savings and compensation packages made use of, etc. 
line accounts 
the line accounts are primarily an internal analysis tool used by dsb to understand the corre-
lations between operations and to analyse and optimise the financial structure of the individ-
ual lines. the information about the finances of train operations on individual routes provides 
a good overview of the societal priorities of danish train operations. 
 
in a broader perspective, the route accounts are suited for demonstrating the significant ex-
tent of dsb’s activities outside the train service activities, which range from planning and 
monitoring of traffic, customer service and distribution systems to station operation. these 
are tasks that dsb also manages on behalf of, and in collaboration with, the other public 
transport operators. 
 
however, the route accounts are not well suited to direct financial comparison between oper-
ators, even if such comparison focuses alone on the train operation activities. furthermore, 
the route accounts cannot be used as a reference work with respect to adjustment of costs in 
connection with the transfer of routes. 
 
the reason for this is partly that the line accounts are based on a distribution model and 
partly that dsb’s costs, like all other companies’ costs, are variable to differing degrees de-
pending on the production volume. this means that parts of the costs are only vaguely or not 
at all correlated with the number of train or seat-kilometres driven. therefore, it applies that 
there is no notable correlation between the extent of the train services and costs for, e.g., 
 
 
line accounts

sales and distribution channels, planning systems and monitoring centres. when dsb trans-
fers train traffic, it means that dsb loses economies of scale and opportunities for transversal 
synergy. 
 
the route accounts are based on the activity area train services that reflects the costs of op-
erating train services. the costs are allocated to the routes in relation to their use of activities 
and the supporting functions are allocated to the routes based on the number of full-time em-
ployees involved in the individual activities, see fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet. and 
fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet.. 
 
a positive result reflects that the route has operated at a profit and can, therefore, be oper-
ated without any state subsidies. on the other hand, negative results reflect that the route 
operates at a loss and financing must be added from profit-making routes and/or government 
contract payments. 
 
according to the accounting regulations, dsb is required to also specify the individual routes, 
including all costs, regardless of whether the individual cost concerns the extent of produc-
tion. therefore, the train system costs of both stations and systems & channels are broken 
down into routes in fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet. and fejl! henvisningskilde ikke 
fundet.. in practice, this means the inclusion, for example, of costs for operating stations, 
operating the rejsekort (travel card) system, ticket vending machines, traffic information and 
operations centres controlling traffic to limit delays, etc. the costs have been broken down by 
routes, even though these activities do not have any direct connection with the actual econ-
omy of the train traffic on the individual route. 
 
the key figures for passenger revenues per seat kilometre and costs per seat-kilometre pro-
vide the best indication of how the seat capacity is utilised on the individual routes, see fejl! 
henvisningskilde ikke fundet. and fejl! henvisningskilde ikke fundet.. the seat-kilo-
metre takes into account the number of seats available in the individual litra and the number 
of train sets/coaches coupled on a route. train kilometres, which are often used as a key fig-
ure, do not take these differences into account. the statement of seat-kilometres is associ-
ated with some uncertainty, since the statement of journeys, and thus how far the individual 
customer travels, is to a great extent based on passenger studies based on spot checks, cus-

method used for preparation of the route accounts 
as a public undertaking, dsb must satisfy a number of reporting requirements, see figure 6. 
the reporting requirements each have their own background and purpose and all aim at cre-
ating transparency and control related to dsb matters. however, the requirements consider 
the company from different perspectives, which makes it difficult to determine the connection 
between the individual reports and at the same time negatively affects transparency. 
 
figure 6: reporting requirements in dsb 
 
 
the danish financial statements act stipulates requirements for the drawing up of accounts, 
which apply to the whole group and provide insight into the financial position of the whole 
company. 
 
dsb’s accounting regulations are designed to separate public services from competitive ac-
tivities in order to provide an insight into the activities that are subject to contract payment 
and ensure that there is no illegal state support. the presentation of the general accounts, 
which are reviewed by dsb's external auditor, divides the parent company’s result into public 
services under a negotiated contract and competitive activities. 
 
the traffic contract covers only public services that are performed under the contract. these 
services represent a proportion of the independent public company dsb’s services. this 
means, for example, that dsb vedligehold a/s is not covered directly by the public service 
obligation, but indirectly in the form of the preparation and maintenance services that are de-
livered and invoiced for train services. neither is dsb service & retail a/s covered by the 
public service obligation. 
 
the route accounts are based on the general accounts where public services are separated. 
the activity area accounts are an attempt to segment activities with reference to the division 
in the traffic contract. the route accounts are a breakdown of the train operations on the 
routes in accordance with dsb’s accounting regulations.

figure 7: elements of train operations 
 
 
dsb operates trains in denmark as a total activity but must, in connection with the traffic 
contract, prepare and implement a separation of the train operations into activities related to 
the actual train movements (train operations), and activities related to the maintenance of 
the production apparatus (train system), see figure 7. 
the financial model for routes 
the route economy model provides a basis for dsb's general accounts and route accounts. 
this creates an unambiguous correlation and a complete transaction trail between the individ-
ual accounts. 
 
the model creates the general accounts setup by dividing activities into public services under 
a negotiated contract and competitive activities, such as, for example, renting out properties 
to external customers. 
 
public services are further divided into activity areas and the activities that dsb implements 
to operate the individual routes. the routes contain all accounting entries relating to train op-
erations, see an earlier definition.

figure 8: design of the route economy model 
 
 
figure 8 describes the principal method used in the route economy model where the account-
ing entries are grouped and distributed via activities for routes. at the resources level, the ac-
counts are grouped and classified according to production proximity, so that the supporting 
functions are distributed according to the capacity unit’s relative use of resources. the model 
makes use primarily of objective and systematic basis of allocation based on production infor-
mation. 
 
the route economy model is based on a combination of "full cost allocation" and "activity-
based cost allocation". the full cost allocation results from the accounting regulations re-
quirement that all costs are allocated to the routes. 
definition of routes 
figure 9 shows the definitions used for the individual routes that have been adapted to the 
production and timetable that dsb has used in 2020. the only change compared to 2019 is 
that the route from copenhagen to hamburg has been re-routed to cross the great belt in-
stead of using rødby ferry with a subsequent ferry crossing to germany. the change is due 
to the fact that in coming years there will be a lot of track works on south zealand, lolland 
and falster in connection with the construction of the fehmarn belt fixed link. 
 
some geographically connected routes have been combined to be viewed as a single entity, 
since they are very closely connected. this concerns the following routes: 
• odense - ringe - svendborg 
• aarhus - fredericia - esbjerg 
• copenhagen - holbæk - kalundborg 
• copenhagen - roskilde - ringsted - slagelse

long-distance & regional trains 
 
 
• long-distance trains are defined as trains crossing the great belt (the red routes) and com-
prise the routes copenhagen - aarhus - aalborg (intercitylyn), copenhagen - aalborg (in-
tercity), copenhagen - esbjerg (intercity) and copenhagen - odense - hamburg (inter-
city).

• the remaining intercitylyn and intercity routes are defined as regional trains, as in prac-
tice, this is regional train traffic as the trains stop at all stations (aarhus - langå - struer - 
fredericia - vejle - struer, aarhus - hamburg and fredericia - sønderborg). 
• the aarhus - langå - struer route is viewed as a separate route, as dsb has an obligation 
according to the traffic contract to operate the route six times a day but does not receive 
the associated passenger revenues. 
• the Øresund traffic is divided into two routes (copenhagen - helsingør and copenhagen - 
malmø (only to the Øresund border)). 
• the train categories regional west and regional east follow the underlying train produc-
tion. 
definition of activities and division into the activity areas train services and train 
system 
the central element in the route economy model is the definition of the activities carried out 
by dsb in the train operations. the activity definitions and groupings used support the dis-
tinction between train operations and train systems on which the activity area accounts are 
based.

the basic accounting registrations do not directly support a division of the train services in ac-
cordance with the activity area perception in the traffic contract. the basic registrations are

aimed at supporting the company’s current organisation and thus the most effective com-
bined reporting. that is why the reports on activity areas are based on the line economy 
model’s basis of allocation. 
basis of allocation 
development of the route economy model is based on the objective that the model should re-
flect the revenue, cost and production structure. since it is an allocation model, the amount 
of the revenues and costs per route will depend on the choice of activity groupings and basis 
of allocation. 
 
the train service activities for routes are in general distributed according to the following prin-
ciples: 
• if the activity is performed only for the operation of a single route, there will be a direct al-
location to the route. 
• if, instead, the activity is carried out in order to be able to run multiple routes, the costs 
will be distributed to routes in accordance with an appropriate production parameter. 
 
figure 11: the main basis of allocation for train services in the route economy model 
 
 
figure 11 shows the main production-based basis of allocation used in the allocation of the 
train service activities to the individual routes. this can be illustrated by the examples below: 
• the full costs of the train transport activity under on-board personnel are distributed 
among the routes based on the locomotive driver’s time registration that is connected to 
the individual route via the rolling stock. 
• the full maintenance costs of, for example, ic3 train sets are distributed relative to the 
routes where ic3 train sets are used based on the number of kilometres that the ic3 train 
set has travelled. 
• the infrastructure costs for crossing the great belt are allocated in proportion to the num-
ber of bridge crossings made on the individual route in addition to how many kilometres the 
individual train has travelled. 
distribution of passenger revenues to the routes 
it is not possible to directly quantify the number of journeys in dsb due to the fact that, in 
public transport, it is possible to ride on buses, the metro and the train without necessarily

139 
having to have a ticket for a specific departure. this applies to both period tickets and single 
journeys, since it is possible to buy an open ticket for, e.g., copenhagen - aarhus. thus, it is 
not possible to determine whether the journey has been made on the long-distance train 
headed for esbjerg, aarhus or aalborg. in addition, a journey can be made using multiple op-
erators and routes. for example, a journey from tisvildeleje to aarhus involving the local 
train from tisvildeleje to hillerød, s-train from hillerød to copenhagen h, and regional train 
from copenhagen to aarhus can be travelled on the same ticket. 
 
figure 12: the principles behind the allocation of passenger revenues to routes 
 
 
the calculation is further complicated by the fact that there are currently many ticket systems 
and fare zones that need to be coordinated between different operators. 
 
for long-distance & regional trains, therefore, dsb has a number of travel sources, see fig-
ure 12, of which the most significant are dsb’s own ticket sales and greater copenhagen 
area travels in addition to the rejsekort (travel card). among other things, the journeys are 
assessed by passenger counts in trains and the weighing of trains which is converted to cus-
tomer numbers. the methods may vary from travel source to travel source and are agreed 
with the other operators in a given tariff area. 
 
the trips must then be divided into travel relationships that show from where and to where 
the journey is made. this is, among other things, based on passenger studies3) of travel pat-
terns that provide a statistical weighting that can be used for the travel sources. this means 
that the distribution comes with a certain statistical uncertainty relative to the size of the 
samples on the individual route and total population of travellers on that route. 
when travel relationships are established, the journey’s route must be determined - in other 
words, which of the possible routes have been used to travel between two destinations. since

a journey can be made over several routes, it must be shared relatively between the routes. 
thus, a trip can be divided into one or more partial journeys. occupancy counts and timeta-
bles are used for dividing across travel routes. 
 
partial journeys are used to allocate passenger revenues to routes in the overall travel reve-
nues model. in the route economy model, this input is used as a basis for distributing the 
registered passenger revenue. there is thus a certain amount of estimation involved in the 
passenger revenues linked to individual routes. 
 
for s-trains, the route revenues are calculated in a separate passenger count system (aps), 
which allocates the passenger revenues for the eight main routes. 
distribution of revenues from the traffic contract to areas of activity 
the route economy model will not be broken down into the contract payment on routes since 
there is no unique activity-based method by which to allocate the contract payment. 
 
for use for the activity area accounts, dsb has chosen to allocate contract payment accord-
ing to the following method: 
 
figure 13: principles for allocating revenues from the traffic contract to activity areas 
 
 
the contract payment to stations is allocated so as to ensure an annual return on the in-
vested capital (roic) of 3 percent. the contract payment for general obligations (historical) 
is based on cost recovery. the contract payment for systems & channels is based on a profit 
ratio of 5 percent, whereas the contract payment for rolling stock covers all the project costs 
of the preparatory work for the purchase of new electric trains for denmark, the future s-
train system and new workshops, since rolling stock rental is charged to the train service ac-
tivity. at the same time, the dedicated contract payment for improving the public transport 
network via the acquisition of double-decker coaches and improvements to ir4 train sets4) is 
allocated to rolling stock. 
 
the remaining contract payment accrues to train services where it is distributed such that 
the profit ratio is identical for long-distance & regional train services, Øresund traffic and s-
train traffic. if a route generates a profit without a contract payment, the payment is distrib-
uted to the loss-making traffic areas alone. 
 
 
4) see the political agreement, “fare reductions and investments in improving public transport” of 12 june 2012 and the political agreement 
“acquisition of double-decker coaches” of 1 april 2014.

in addition, it is assumed that the passenger revenues accrue to train services and thus, ac-
cording to the model, do not contribute directly to the train system. 
distribution of leasing of rolling stock 
all revenues and costs as well as depreciation, amortisation, write-downs and financial reve-
nues and costs for rolling stock are collected in two pools, one for long-distance & regional 
trains (including Øresund) and one for s-trains. however, both pools exclude the train of the 
future, the future s-train system and new workshops. 
 
on the long-distance & regional train routes where dedicated rolling stock is used (odense - 
ringe - svendborg, aarhus - hamburg, copenhagen - odense - hamburg and copenhagen - 
malmö), the route costs are accounted directly with the specific rolling stock costs. the re-
maining rolling stock pool is regarded as a common pool and is, therefore, calculated as an 
average rolling stock lease using the travelled litra kilometres on the individual routes. the 
leasing of rolling stock for s-trains is solely based on the actual costs for the rolling stock.
