protecting people and business in a world in lockdown 
the covid-19 pandemic overshadowed everything else in 
2020. the entire world suffered. at gn, we were impacted 
early on, when a contract security guard at gn hearing’s 
manufacturing site in china was infected in late january. we 
temporarily suspended operations at the site, and from then 
on, our leadership managed professionally through un-
charted waters.  
 
looking back over the course of the year, i would argue that 
gn handled the challenges well. our priority was to protect 
people’s health, livelihoods, our innovation engine, our supply 
chain, and our business in a world of various lockdowns. 
management steered the ship firmly, managing cost wisely, 
while never compromising on the innovation that would 
allow the business to bounce back when the day comes. our 
leaders and employees around the world demonstrated 
remarkable stamina and heart, helping each other, helping 
customers, and helping the company by working efficiently in 
difficult circumstances and accepting furlough and reduced 
pay. 
 
the board and i appreciate the many personal sacrifices that 
have been made. for this we are thankful to each and every 
one of gn’s more than 6,000 employees throughout the 
world – and we trust our shareholders feel the same.  
 
diversely affected businesses proved the strength of gn 
throughout 2020, the pandemic affected gn’s two business 
divisions very differently:  
• gn audio entered the year with a strong track-record of 
growth in attractive enterprise markets based on an indus-
try leading product portfolio, excellent execution, and im-
proved brand recognition. the already high demand rose 
sharply as enterprises and organizations increased invest-
ments in collaboration tools allowing employees to work 
effectively from home. gn audio’s investments over the 
recent years in a highly scalable setup for manufacturing 
and logistics ensured that customers’ needs could be met 
with as little delay as possible. this helped gn audio take 
significant market share during 2020. 
• for gn hearing the pandemic resulted in sharply declining 
revenue. as elderly, more vulnerable populations were ad-
vised to stay home and local restrictions shut down many 
hearing clinics, the sale of hearing aids dropped dramati-
cally, especially in march through may.  
in such challenging times, it proved beneficial for gn to oper-
ate with limited forward integration and within both the hear-
ing aid and audio & collaboration space. 
 
major product launches successfully moved online 
both gn audio and gn hearing kept up momentum in prod-
uct innovation and development and executed on extensive 
product launches digitally. in march – with most markets in 
full lockdown – gn audio launched the second generation of 
the evolve range, evolve2, its best-selling and market leading 
unified communications headset. this was all done online 
with no ability to meet customers face-to-face, and still 
ended up being gn audio’s most successful product launch 
to date.  
 
in august, gn hearing launched resound one, an entirely 
new class of hearing aids that offers a truly individualized 
hearing experience and the best sound quality for every user. 
a 24-hour online global launch event on september 1 had 
10,000 attendees sign up, which is more than any regular 
hearing industry conference had ever attracted. 
 
both examples show the agility and ability of gn’s organiza-
tion to rapidly adapt to new circumstances and execute suc-
cessfully in a turbulent world with numerous headwinds.  
 
preceding these major product innovations lay significant 
work and investments in research and development. while 
the pandemic required diligent cost control and savings 
throughout gn, the decision to not save on the company’s in-
novation engine was deliberate. we already saw the benefit 
of this in 2020 and will see this even more in years to come. 
 
new opportunities during and post pandemic 
we strongly believe that gn continues to be well positioned 
for success. our fundamental strategy for 2020 and beyond 
is unchanged by the pandemic and has already proven robust 
navigating safely through rough waters 
with professional leadership and proactive management, gn fared well through 
unprecedented challenges in 2020. in a year when the entire world was heavily 
burdened by the global pandemic, gn adjusted appropriately but never compro-
mised on our innovation agenda, launching multiple well-received state-of-the-
art products, and managing expenditure diligently

gn store nord a/s 
for a rapidly changing and uncertain world, as has gn’s busi-
ness model and organization.  
 
in the coming years gn will continue to take individualized 
customer experiences to a whole new level and further 
broaden the reach and appeal of gn’s hearing, audio, and 
video product portfolios, where we see ample opportunities 
for continued growth. as new market segments open up, we 
will further leverage gn’s technological expertise and com-
mercial platform, where these provide a particular competi-
tive advantage.  
 
while covid-19 temporarily hampered hearing clinics from 
serving their clients face-to-face, the pandemic also demon-
strated that the need for hearing is greater than ever when 
people are physically distanced from each other. with in-
creased mask wearing and social distancing there is clearly a 
greater need and awareness is increasing of how crucial it is 
for people to be able to hear and understand one another, 
aided by technology and proper remote care. the hearing 
market fundamentals continue to be healthy with a growing 
elderly and more affluent population and we see the markets 
as being fundamentally intact. 
 
gn hearing is well positioned as a leader in connectivity and 
audiology designed for the individual, as demonstrated by our 
latest product families. we will continue to invest in expand-
ing what a hearing aid can do for the user. a hearing aid 
should, obviously, deliver the best possible sound for the 
user, but increasingly we will engineer hearing aids to assist 
users and their relatives with much more than ”just” hearing. 
we think of these multiple new opportunities as beyond hear-
ing enabling people to hear more, do more, and be more.  
 
also in gn audio’s enterprise business, we believe that our 
markets are intact. large enterprise customers across the 
world are preparing for more permanent flexible and hybrid 
work initiatives which will continue after covid-19. gn audio 
is strongly positioned to capture the market opportunities 
and the current trends, which has contributed to significant 
market expansion. professional collaboration tools based on 
sound, vision, and artificial intelligence will open up for a 
range of new ways to improve work efficiency, collaboration, 
and compliance with e.g. health restrictions. we will continue 
to invest into our business to capture growth in audio and 
video collaboration.  
 
the near future remains uncertain 
as covid-19 continues to make life and business difficult 
around the world, and blur the world economic outlook, the 
near future expectations for both gn’s business divisions re-
main significantly more uncertain than normal. in entering 
2021, we see that the trying times are not over.  
 
however, gn’s market fundamentals remain healthy. based 
on gn’s attractive market prospects, focused strategic execu-
tion and a strong track record for developing industry-
leading, user-friendly, and increasingly-individualized hearing, 
audio and video products and solutions, gn continues to be 
well positioned beyond 2020.  
 
gn has a robust business platform and a well-established or-
ganization with strong leadership and talented employees. 
our financial foundation is solid, and our strategy is un-
changed: driving growth by delivering uniquely and increas-
ingly individualized customer experiences in our products and 
solutions through innovation leadership and commercial & 
eco-system excellence.  
 
making life sound better 
predicting the future is subject to many uncertainties right 
now. just as the company has done for more than 150 years, 
gn will focus on managing what we can control. manage-
ment and our employees did this exceptionally well in 2020.  
 
with the experience and talent available throughout the 
company, with the right strategy in place, and with market 
leading positions in attractive markets, the board of directors 
is confident that gn will continue its highly successful growth 
journey, whatever challenges the future may hold. we will 
continue delivering on our purpose: making life sound bet-
ter. the world needs that more than ever right now.

gn store nord a/s 
covid-19 
in 2020, gn store nord was affected in three ways by covid-
19: (i) various impact on production capacity and supply of 
components from subcontractors in h1 2020, (ii) gn audio 
experienced strong demand as enterprises invested in em-
ployees working from home, and (iii) gn hearing was im-
pacted by lockdowns and local restrictions impacting de-
mand. the impact of the pandemic obviously influenced gn 
hearing in a completely different way than gn audio, and we 
see having the two businesses under one roof as a position of 
strength for the company.  
 
to partially mitigate the negative impact on employment 
from lockdowns and local restrictions, many governments 
across the world implemented support schemes for busi-
nesses. where appropriate, gn benefitted from some of 
these schemes in lockdown markets. further, the danish gov-
ernment introduced a helpful temporary tax relief for re-
search and development costs.  
 
revenue 
in 2020, gn store nord increased revenue by 7% to dkk 
13,449 million compared to dkk 12,574 million in 2019. 
organic revenue growth was 9%, compared to 15% in 2019. 
the foreign exchange contribution was around -1% and m&a 
contribution was around -1%.  
 
the solid performance of the company in an extraordinary 
year reflects the continuous strong development in both gn 
hearing and gn audio, driven by innovative product portfo-
lios and strong commercial execution. 
 
ebita 
gn realized ebita of dkk 1,866 million in 2020 (including 
gain from legal settlements and litigation of dkk 114 million) 
which was 20% lower than the dkk 2,321 million realized in 
2019. gn’s earnings decrease reflects the significant negative 
impact on revenue from covid-19 in gn hearing, but partly 
offset by the strong performance in gn audio. during the 
year, gn focused on prudent cost control but also continued 
investments into r&d and future growth opportunities. the 
ebita margin was 13.9% (including gain from legal 
settlements and litigation of dkk 114 million), compared to 
18.5% in 2019. excluding the gain from legal settlements and 
litigation, ebita was dkk 1,752 million, reflecting an ebita 
margin of 13.0%. 
 
ebita in other was dkk -177 million compared to dkk -155 
million in 2019. 
 
group performance 2020 
2020 manifested the benefits of having gn hearing and gn audio under the 
same roof. gn audio +42%, gn hearing -24%, gn +9% organic revenue growth

gn store nord a/s 
net profit 
amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets 
was dkk -235 million in 2020, compared to dkk -298 million 
in 2019. the development was mainly driven by an 
impairment loss in the beltone retail in relation to the 
ongoing optimization of the portfolio in 2019.  
 
financial items were dkk -6 million, compared to dkk -92 
million in 2019. the development in financial items was 
mainly driven by a positive non-cash contribution from 
foreign exchange revaluation of certain balance sheet items, 
as well as a fair value adjustment related to an existing 
ownership interest.  
 
the effective tax rate was 21.3%, while the net profit was 
dkk 1,269 million, compared to dkk 1,468 million in 2019, 
translating into a decrease of 14%, reflecting the negative 
impact from covid-19 in gn hearing offset by prudent cost 
management and strong performance in gn audio.  
 
other performance indicators 
gn continued throughout 2020 to have strong focus on cash 
flow generation and has taken prudent cost measures. free 
cash flow excl. m&a increased 44% to dkk 1,865 million, 
equal to a cash conversion of 100% for the group compared 
to 56% in 2019. 
 
earnings per share (eps) was dkk 9.72, compared to dkk 
11.12 in 2019.  
 
the return on invested capital (roic) was 19% in 2020, 
compared to 25% in 2019.  
 
by the end of 2020, equity in gn store nord amounted to 
dkk 5,178 million, compared to dkk 4,849 million in 2019. 
the increase was primarily driven by the net profit generated 
during the year on top of the execution of the share buyback 
program finalized on march 9, 2020, as well as the ordinary 
dividend payment and changes in foreign exchange rates.

capital structure 
as previously communicated, gn has a long-term capital 
structure target of a net interest-bearing debt between one- 
and two-times ebitda. by the end of 2020, the net interest-
bearing debt amounted to dkk 4,198 million (compared to 
dkk 5,303 million in 2019), corresponding to 1.8 times 
ebitda. the decrease in net interest-bearing debt was driven 
by prudent cash flow management and a strong cash 
conversion in gn audio.  
 
the balance sheet remained very sound with ample sources 
of liquidity and gn had cash and cash equivalent of dkk 
1,657 million at the end of 2020.  
 
in the last couple of years, gn proactively diversified the 
funding profile. the different sources of financing now availa-
ble to gn include the convertible bond market (via the listed 
convertible bond), traditional bonds (via the euro medium-
term note program), the euro commercial paper program, 
bilateral loan from eib, uncommitted bank facilities including 
overdraft lines as well as immediate access to undrawn re-
volving credit facilities of dkk 2 billion and usd 40 million. 
 
dividend and share buyback program 
in 2020, gn distributed in total dkk 356 million back to 
shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. in march 
2020, gn paid out dkk 206 million in dividend (dkk 1.45 per 
share) in respect of the fiscal year 2019 as approved at the 
annual general meeting in 2020.  
 
in order to preserve a strong balance sheet in uncertain times, 
gn postponed share buybacks (program intended to be 
initiated following the approvals by the annual general 
meeting on march 11, 2020), until better predictability and 
visibility into the consequences of the covid-19 was achieved 
(see company announcement no. 24 of april 3, 2020). 
 
in light of the uncertain market environment caused by 
covid-19 in the spring and to sustain a strong balance sheet, 
the board of directors decided to cancel the planned capital 
decrease of 4,171,390 shares, as otherwise approved at the 
annual general meeting in march 2020, to retain flexibility for 
general corporate purposes.  
 
as part of the current capital structure policy, and when 
better visibility of the ongoing pandemic materializes, it is 
gn’s ambition to reinitiate share buybacks in order to 
continue to focus on creating shareholder value, subject to 
the necessary authorization by the annual general meeting to 
acquire treasury shares. 
 
the board of directors will propose to pay out dkk 1.45 per 
share in dividend for the fiscal year 2020 (equivalent to a total 
dividend of dkk 206 million), in line with last year. 
 
foreign exchange exposure 
gn has hedged a substantial part of the expected net cash-
flow in foreign currencies to secure the ebita contribution of 
the material trading currencies for the next 12 months across 
both gn hearing and gn audio.  
 
claim against plantronics inc.  
in 2012, gn audio filed suit against plantronics for attempted 
monopolization of the distributors’ market in the united 
states. on october 18, 2017, a jury in the federal district 
court of delaware ruled in favor of plantronics as the jury did 
not find that plantronics’ behavior in the market had been un-
lawful. gn appealed the ruling and won a re-trial in the us 
court of appeals for the third circuit on july 10, 2019. on 
july 13, 2020 gn audio and plantronics settled the legal case, 
and the financial impact from the settlement agreement was 
booked in q3 2020. 
 
changes in financial leadership  
on september 30, gn announced that marcus desimoni will 
step down from his dual position as cfo of gn store nord 
and of gn hearing as of december 31, 2020. peter la cour 
gormsen, cfo of gn audio, was appointed cfo of gn store 
nord. peter la cour gormsen will also remain cfo of gn 
audio.

one of a 
kind 
"i'm back in the world now" 
ray weaver first noticed a hearing loss 10-15 years ago: “i 
started to take my hearing loss seriously, when my wife and 
my kids started saying: ’dad, you cannot hear us’. they are 
the most important people in my life, so i want to hear 
them.” 
 
ray weaver is an award-winning songwriter and musician. 
he was born in the us and currently resides in denmark. 
having played in bands since he was 15 years old and been 
exposed to loud music throughout his life, ray believes this 
has had a negative impact on his hearing. 
 
ray’s wife, lotte, became concerned when ray started en-
gaging less in conversations: “i noticed ray’s hearing loss 
when he started withdrawing. he spoke less when we had 
guests over.“ 
 
since being fitted with resound one, the hearing aids have 
provided ray with an increased sense of awareness of his 
surroundings and has given him the confidence to engage 
fully in social situations with family and friends. 
  
“i hear things that i hadn’t realized i couldn’t hear before. 
when i was outside for the first time, i heard leaves rustling 
across the driveway. i kept saying ‘what’s that sound?’ i’ve 
experienced an overall increased sense of confidence as i 
no longer have to ask people to repeat questions and parts 
of conversations. wearing hearing aids has given me a 
huge boost to say – i'm back in the world now.” 
 
or in lotte’s words: “now he is back to normal – and we 
even have to fight to get a word in.”

-1%, while the impact from m&a was around -1%. revenue 
growth was -26%. the revenue in 2020 reached dkk 4,725 
million, compared to dkk 6,351 million in 2019. 
 
the impact from covid-19 varied greatly across regions and 
countries. north america experienced a slower market 
recovery during 2020 than europe and rest of world, with 
the commercial market improving faster than the veterans 
affairs channel and with significant differences across states. 
in europe, gn hearing saw strong emerging recovery during 
2020 in especially germany and the south european markets. 
the uk saw a slower recovery and remained heavily impacted 
by local restrictions during 2020. in rest of world, gn 
hearing saw strong emerging recovery in most areas 
particularly in china, japan, and south korea.  
 
earnings and other financial highlights 
gn hearing’s gross profit decreased by -34% to dkk 2,905 
million in 2020 compared to dkk 4,380 million in 2019, 
mainly driven by the significant revenue decrease. the gross 
margin was 61.5% compared to 69.0% in 2019 primarily 
driven by the fixed part of production cost, one-time costs 
and mix effects.  
 
operating expenses were dkk 2,864 million compared to 
dkk 3,096 million in 2019, corresponding to a decrease of 
7%. the decrease in operating expenses is following prudent 
cost management during the year, but also impacted by one-
time costs related to the consequences of covid-19.   
 
ebita decreased to dkk 41 million in 2020 from dkk 1,284 
million in 2019. the ebita margin was 0.9%. the positive 
ebita was achieved by prudent cost management on top of 
one-time costs and continued investments into r&d and it.  
 
the return on invested capital (roic) was 1% in 2020 
compared to 19% in 2019. 
free cash flow excl. m&a was positive of dkk 127 million in 
2020, compared to dkk 672 million in 2019 despite the 
severe impact from covid-19. 
 
business highlights 
covid-19 
gn hearing was severely impacted by the covid-19 outbreak 
in several ways, beginning with production and supply chain 
issues. in january 2020, gn hearing suspended operations at 
its xiamen, china, production site due to covid-19, but with 
the site fully operational again during february 2020.  
 
in the beginning of the year, gn hearing was off to a good 
start in line with expectation. as the covid-19 pandemic 
spread globally in early spring, the global hearing aid markets 
saw a gradual shut-down as markets across the world were 
facing lockdowns and various local restrictions. from the low-
point in april 2020, the market and gn hearing experienced 
an emerging recovery over the summer with markets getting 
close to normality. due to increasing infections rates across 
the world again in the autumn / early winter, the markets 
halted in its recovery. the impact from covid-19 varied 
throughout the year greatly across regions and countries, 
with north america experiencing a slower recovery during 
2020 than europe and rest of would, but with significant dif-
ferences across states and channels.  
resound enzo q and resound linx quattro 
in february 2020, gn hearing launched multiple new 
resound hearing solutions, resound enzo q as well as an 
extension to the resound linx quattro family to include four 
new hearing aids (three new bte hearing aids and a mini rie 
model). these were based on the powerful chip platform of 
resound linx quattro, which offers impressive sound 
quality, connectivity, and customer care for people with all 
types of hearing loss.

right 
beside 
you 
 
the covid-19 pandemic hit those with untreated 
hearing loss especially hard by further isolating 
them from friends and family and putting limits 
on their ability to hear and understand critical 
news and instruction about how to stay safe. 
 
beltone is about being right beside you and with 
around 1,500 locations across the us, beltone 
recognized an acute need to help in practical 
ways.  
 
many clinics offered “curbside assistance” allow-
ing customers to either stay at home or drive up 
to the clinic to have a beltone hearing care pro-
fessional come to their car or front door to col-
lect their hearing aids for service, cleaning or ad-
justment - without any direct contact or the cus-
tomer stepping out of their home or car. 
 
beltone remote care™ live was launched to al-
low beltone clinics to remotely assists patients. 
from afar, audiologists can provide their patients 
with the personal attention and care they re-
quire, including adjustments and fitting, via a live 
video call.  
 
to further ease some of the strain during the 
pandemic, the beltone foundation donated 550 
hearing instruments to individuals otherwise una-
ble to get hearing help due to the financial down-
turn. also, beltone offered free batteries to any-
one who requested them, regardless of manufac-
turer. in total, the foundation donated more 
than 7,500 batteries in 2020.

resound assist™ live 
in april 2020, gn hearing’s renowned connectivity leadership 
was expanded to offer resound assist live, which is an inno-
vative new part of the popular resound assist customer care 
solution. the solution delivers a heightened level of customer 
experience and business support for hearing care profession-
als, thus providing a more individualized experience. in the 
context of covid-19, the accelerated launch of resound as-
sist live enables a new, groundbreaking way to access end-to-
end hearing care, including the ability to conduct hearing 
tests in the home of the users utilizing the hearing aids as en-
abler. this is reducing the need for in-office visits at a time 
when older, more vulnerable populations are advised to stay 
at home. resound assist live was well received by users and 
will in a post-pandemic world continue to offer an attractive 
and more individualized choice for users. 
resound one 
in august 2020, gn hearing announced the launch of 
resound one, a revolutionary new class of hearing aids that 
solves one of the hearing industry’s most enduring obstacles 
to improving speech intelligibility in noise. in clinical trials, 
90% of users identified resound one with microphone & 
receiver in ear (m&rie) as providing superior sound quality to 
a traditional hearing aid with microphones positioned behind 
the ear. through a combination of a radical new receiver 
design and gn’s all-new and most powerful sound-processing 
chipset ever, gn hearing was able to deliver the world’s first 
all access directionality as well as the m&rie solution which 
incorporates an additional microphone inside the ear canal 
while preserving the comfort of an open-fit form factor. 
unlike regular rie and bte hearing aids, by collecting sound 
right inside the user’s own ears, resound one preserves all 
the audio cues needed for the brain to correctly localize and 
tune in to specific voices or sounds, thus allowing for a much 
more individualized hearing experience.   
 
resound one was available in clinics end of august 2020. on 
september 1, 2020, gn hearing hosted a global launch event, 
with over 10,000 hearing care professionals enrolled onto the 
largest ever gathering on hearing aid technology in an inter-
active, virtual learning environment. user reception and feed-
back for resound one has been overwhelmingly positive. 
veterans affairs 
the u.s. veterans affairs (va) channel, which represents 
roughly 20% of the us market, was significantly impacted by 
covid-19 and the total volume in the channel was at index 
66 in 2020 compared to 2019, with great variances in terms 
of recovery across states. by the end of 2020, resound one 
became available in the channel. under normal circumstances 
va is a channel that easily adopts new technology, but due to 
the covid-19 physical meetings have not been possible 
which – combined with the fact that resound one is 
completely new and groundbreaking technology – have 
resulted in a slower uptake than under normal circumstances. 
it is still gn hearing's clear ambition to drive market share 
gains in the channel based on the superior technology of 
resound one. 
beltone network 
during 2020, gn hearing continued to execute on several 
strategic initiatives to continue the improvement of the north 
american beltone network. beltone is a strong and 
recognized brand in the us hearing aid market with around 
1,500 point-of-sales in north america, and it is gn hearing’s 
ambition to further strengthen the beltone business in order 
to position the network well for the future.  
 
during 2020, as for the hearing aid market overall, beltone 
was negatively impacted by covid-19, but did find creative 
ways of continuing to serve customers through the difficult 
period. in june 2020, beltone announced the launch of an 
online store, making beltone the only major hearing care 
retailer to offer an online, trusted source of original, direct-
from-manufacturer solution.  
 
beltone continued to optimize its “ownership in transition” 
portfolio of retail stores. by the end of 2020, beltone had 
reduced the total number of owned retail stores in transition 
to around 100, which is in line with the overall strategic 
objective.

coping & 
helping 
gn hearing stepping 
up to help 
customers 
as the covid-19 forced many hearing clinics to 
close down and deprived people from critical hear-
ing care, gn hearing launched initiatives to help 
customers and hearing care professionals: 
• gn hearing accelerated the development of re-
sound assist live. this new technology greatly ex-
panded at-home care for people with hearing loss, 
allowing hearing care professionals to send, test, fit, 
and fine-tune hearing aids remotely. this was vital 
especially to vulnerable populations that were ad-
vised to stay at home, in times when they were most 
dependent on their hearing to keep informed and 
connected with their loved ones. the solution will 
continue to be an attractive option for many, also af-
ter the pandemic 
• as face masks became a new normal, people with 
hearing loss were confronted with new challenges: 
lipreading accounts for 30% of anybody’s speech 
recognition but is even more critical if you have hear-
ing loss. gn hearing developed a new face mask 
program setting for the hearing aid, making it easier 
for people with hearing aids to understand people 
wearing face masks 
• under the banner of resound gives sound, gn 
hearing in the us donated usd 1 million worth of 
resound one hearing aids free of charge to people 
with hearing loss who have experienced financial dif-
ficulty related to covid-19. hearing care profession-
als in this program devote their time for fitting and 
care to help people in their communities

smart hearing alliance 
the smart hearing alliance, a co-development and co-
commercialization partnership between gn hearing and 
cochlear, first announced in october 2015, was despite a year 
filled with global challenges further deepened and expanded.  
 
during 2020, gn hearing was proud to strengthen this alli-
ance by announcing that starting november 2020, the range 
of smart hearing alliance devices offering direct bimodal 
streaming will include resound one hearing aid and coch-
lear™ kanso®2 sound processor. about 70% of all implant re-
cipients wear a hearing aid on their contralateral ear, also 
known as a bimodal listening experience. 
the vision for collaboration continues to include a focus on 
fast-moving connectivity and wireless technology to allow for 
closer integration between cochlear and gn hearing 
technologies.  
falcom  
during 2020, gn made further progress in commercializing its 
falcom product offering - intelligent communication 
solutions for defense and security forces - resulting in 
increasing revenue generation compared to 2019. gn is 
currently preparing for several relevant tenders for the 
falcom solution.

flexible 
working is 
here to stay 
in 2020, “wfh” became a widely known acronym as 
employees around the world were forced to work-from-
home due to widespread covid-19 lockdowns. 
 
throughout the past several years, gn audio has built a 
position as global leader in unified communications & 
collaborations headsets, speakers, and most recently 
conferencing cameras. during 2020, gn audio’s market 
leading position was further reinforced with significant 
market share gains.  
 
hopefully, covid-19 vaccinations will during 2021 defeat 
the global pandemic. however, companies, organizations, 
and employees will likely not return to pre-2020 work 
patterns. as gn audio has promoted for years: “work is 
not a place, it’s an activity”. flexible working has proven 
too advantageous. generally, productivity for office work-
ers did not suffer during the pandemic, work-life balance 
improved for many, and the climate benefitted from re-
duced business travel and commutes. money was saved.  
 
whereas face2face meetings and business travel will cer-
tainly return, it will likely not rebound to pre-pandemic 
levels. gn audio will continue to support an increasing 
number of companies and employees with productivity 
enhancing communication and collaboration tools that 
support work from anywhere.  
 
on march 30, 2020, gn audio launched the second gen-
eration of the evolve range, jabra evolve2, its best-selling 
and market leading unified communications headset. by 
blocking out more noise, providing better voice clarity, 
bringing distributed teams together, giving people the 
power to work from anywhere, and monitoring data to 
enable intelligent decision-making, the evolve2 is the new 
standard to elevate productivity to new heights.

away 
accept no compromise 
in september 2020, gn audio introduced the jabra 
elite 85t wireless earbud along with an upgrade of the 
jabra elite 75t true wireless earbuds series.  
 
the jabra elite 85t is engineered to defy the 
boundaries of how much noise can be removed in a set 
of true wireless earbuds. it features jabra’s most 
advanced and powerful active noise cancellation 
(jabra advanced anc™) technology, without 
compromising on the size or the signature design that 
looks and feels great to wear all day.  
 
with the jabra elite 85t, there will be no compromise in 
the discreet design or comfort, no compromise in the 
calls or music experience and no compromise in the 
effectiveness of the anc. 
 
while jabra elite 85t delivers an abundance of features 
packed in miniature, the upgrade of the jabra elite 75t 
full range was a world premier in disguise: for the first 
time ever an attractive and normally expensive feature 
such as anc for a bluetooth headphone or earbud 
could be activated for existing users through a software 
update – at no extra cost. tech reviewers and

gn audio delivered 42% organic revenue growth in 2020. the 
foreign exchange rate development contributed negatively 
with around -2%. revenue growth was 40%. the revenue in 
2020 reached dkk 8,724 million, compared to dkk 6,223

gn audio’s enterprise business – the world’s leading supplier 
in this segment – continued in 2020 to deliver strong double-
digit organic growth across europe, north america and rest 
of world accelerated by the pandemic.  
 
the consumer business was in h1 2020 negatively impacted 
by covid-19, as consumers for a large part were not able to 
purchase products in certain channels and markets, due to 
retailers being closed. in h2 2020, the consumer business 
returned to strong double-digit growth driven by the strong 
product portfolio combined with the reopening of offline 
retailers following the lockdowns in q2 2020.  
 
the continued strong performance reflects the strength of 
gn audio’s innovative world-leading product portfolio as well 
as strong execution in its supply chain and commercial 
excellence initiatives across all three regions and across the 
enterprise and consumer categories. operating in a market 
with attractive conditions accelerated by the pandemic, gn

operating expenses were dkk 2,391 million compared to 
dkk 2,010 million in 2019, corresponding to an increase of 
19%. the increase in reported operating expenses was 
primarily related to investments in future growth 
opportunities offset by a one-time gain of dkk 114 million 
from legal settlement and litigation. operating expenses in 
percent of revenue decreased from 32% in 2019 to 27% in 
2020 reflecting leverage in the business. 
 
gn audio’s ebita of dkk 2,002 million in 2020 represents an 
increase of 68% (including gain from legal settlements and 
litigation of dkk 114 million), compared to dkk 1,192 million 
in 2019. excluding the gain for legal settlement and litigation, 
ebita increased 58% corresponding to an ebita margin of 
21.6%, compared to 19.2% in 2019. the strong development 
reflects continuous leverage and was achieved on top of 
investments in future growth opportunities, increased freight, 
and production costs due to covid-19 and tariffs.  
 
the return on invested capital (roic) was 81% in 2020, 
compared to 57% in 2019 driven by continued strong growth.

million in 2020, compared to dkk 849 million in 2019

universities and schools are struggling to find ways to 
educate, healthcare providers are having to find new 
ways of providing services, and government administra-
tive workers are collaborating remotely all or part of 
the time. never has the need for strong virtual commu-
nications tools been greater, or more critical, for our so-
cieties. 
 
in 2020, the public sector accelerated adoption of 
technology in order to continue activities while 
adhering to covid-19 restrictions. jabra panacast is an 
easy plug-and-play camera, it works with all leading 
video and audio-conferencing solutions, and offers full 
180° field of view, unlike traditional video conferencing 
cameras. in combination with  
jabra speak this enables safe hybrid and remote  
activities with clear sound and full view of the room.  
 
thousands of public sector institutions particularly 
within education, healthcare and administration have 
used the jabra speak and jabra panacast to provide 
students with a virtual front-row experience and to stay 
connected with colleagues and citizens.

business highlights 
covid-19 
gn audio saw various impacts from the covid-19 outbreak. 
at the end of january 2020, gn audio’s sub-contractors ex-
tended holidays following the chinese new year in line with 
recommendations by local authorities. as a result, gn audio 
experienced difficulties serving the immediate increased de-
mand beyond own inventories. during q1 2020, the produc-
tion capacity improved and in q2 2020 the production was 
back at full capacity.  
 
gn audio experienced continued strong demand for 
enterprise products as enterprises of all sizes and across 
various industries invested in employees working from home 
due to covid-19. adversely, gn audio saw increased freight 
and production costs following the tight freight market and 
significant ramp-up of production capacity.  
 
in the face of a year characterized by uncertainty and global 
challenges, gn audio continued to invest in order to sustain 
attractive growth rates in the years to come.  
jabra mysound 
on january 6, gn audio announced jabra mysound, an inno-
vative new technology by gn audio and sister company gn 
hearing, available from q2 2020. jabra mysound was created 
to optimize and personalize sound experiences based on indi-
vidual hearing profiles. jabra mysound enables users to tailor 
an audio play book based on their unique hearing profile, thus 
delivering a truly individualized audio experience. 
jabra evolve2 range 
gn audio launched its new groundbreaking jabra evolve2 
range in march 2020, the next generation of the jabra evolve 
range, its best-selling and market leading uc headset to en-
hance productivity in the office or at home. the range 
consists of the jabra evolve2 85, jabra evolve2 65, and jabra 
evolve2 40 and is engineered to transform concentration, 
collaboration, and flexibility in the workplace. by blocking out 
more noise, providing better voice clarity, bringing distributed 
teams together, giving people the power to work from any-
where, and monitoring data to enable intelligent decision-
making, the jabra evolve2 is the new standard to elevate of-
fice and work-at-home productivity to new heights. the head-
sets are certified for microsoft teams and work with all lead-
ing uc platforms. 
jabra elite product family  
on january 6, gn audio launched the jabra elite active 75t 
earbuds – the active lifestyle edition of the jabra elite 75t 
earbuds. like the original, the active version brings the same 
great calls and music that is now expected from jabra and is 
optimized for work-out and fitness use. built with a durable 
coating providing optimized grip, the earbuds are also dust 
and sweat resistant, while simultaneously extending battery 
life by 89% (up to 28 hours).  
 
in september 2020, gn audio announced the launch of its 
newest true wireless earbuds, jabra elite 85t, which 
incorporates jabra’s most advanced and powerful active 
noise cancellation (jabra advanced anc™) technology 
without compromising on the size or the signature design. 
the 12mm speakers allow the jabra elite 85t to produce a 
big sound and powerful bass, while still enhancing comfort 
and relieving ear pressure with its semi-open design. jabra 
has also adapted the ear gels to an oval shape providing a 
better sealing in the ear, giving users a more comfortable 
earbud while maintaining a very secure fit. 
 
with the launch of jabra elite 85t and the anc technology in 
the true wireless segment, gn audio has also, for the first 
time ever, enabled a software upgrade introducing anc in 
the existing jabra elite 75t series. 
jabra panacast 
the jabra panacast continued to receive encouraging 
feedback for its best-in-class audiovisual systems supporting 
plug-and-play video conferencing. jabra panacast was during 
the year repositioned due to covid-19, from the traditional 
huddle rooms, which employees refrained from, to a covid-
19 compliant solution, supported by the intelligent 180-
degree panoramic view. jabra panacast experienced a 
significant increase in demand from the education channel, 
with schools and institutions investing to equip class rooms 
with video and audio solutions. irrespective of the need to 
reposition the product, jabra panacast more than achieved 
its original revenue targets during the year and proved gn 
audio’s ability and agility to quickly adapt to new business 
opportunities.

covid-19 risks 
due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic – which impacts gn 
in many ways – it must be stressed that the basic 
assumptions behind the guidance remain significantly more 
uncertain than normal the covid-19 situation has and will 
not only strongly impact gn’s operational performance in 
2021, but it will also impact predictability and visibility across 
gn’s markets, channels and supply chain. the financial 
guidance is contingent on a gradual reopening of society. 
 
gn hearing  
 
market projections 
gn hearing estimates the annual market growth to return to 
the historical level of around 4 - 6% in volumes with annual 
asp decline of around 1 - 2% in a normalized market. gn 
hearing’s mid-term targets of growing faster than the mar-
ket and delivering ebita-margin of more than 20% are fully 
intact. 
 
financial guidance 2021 
the fundamental assumptions behind the financial guidance 
for gn hearing are that the global hearing aid market in h1 
2021 will remain heavily impacted by covid-19 and the 
consequential volatile regional and local restrictions, 
resulting in markets being below the h1 2019 level. as 
hearing care professionals and end-users in our main markets 
will have access to the vaccine throughout h1 2021, the 
current expectation is that in h2 2021 the market will reset 
and normalize. gn hearing will continuously aim to outgrow 
the market and invest in maintaining its innovation leadership 
and improving the it infrastructure. 
 
for full year 2021, gn hearing expects an organic revenue 
growth of more than 25% and an ebita margin of more than 
16%. it is expected that the ebita margin in a more 
normalized market in h2 2021 is recovering to our mid-term 
targets of more than 20%. 
 
gn audio 
 
market projections 
gn audio expects that the favorable global enterprise mar-
ket trend will continue in 2021, creating a solid foundation for 
continued strong performance. for the coming years, gn au-
dio expects its markets to grow at around 10% in value when 
assuming a stable macro environment. gn audio’s mid-term 
targets of growing faster than the market and delivering 
ebita-margin of more than 20% are fully intact. 
 
financial guidance 2021 
the fundamental assumption behind the financial guidance 
for gn audio is that the demand for collaboration solutions 
from enterprises and organizations will continue in 2021 and 
beyond. it is expected that the gn audio organic revenue 
growth will be significantly higher in h1 2021 than in h2 
2021, mainly due to difference in comparison base. gn audio 
will continuously aim to outgrow the market and invest in 
future growth opportunities.  
 
for full year 2021, gn audio expects organic revenue growth 
to be more than 20% and an ebita margin of more than 
21%. 
 
other activities and eps 
for full year 2021, ebita in “other” is expected to be around 
dkk -185 million. 
 
gn store nord expects a growth in eps of more than 50% for 
full year 2021. 
financial guidance 2021 
based on gn’s attractive fundamental market prospects, focused strategic 
execution, and a strong track-record for developing industry-leading, user-
friendly, and increasingly individualized hearing, audio and video products and 
solutions, the group is well positioned for 2021 and beyond 
forward-looking statements 
the forward-looking statements in this interim report reflect the management's current expectations of certain future events and financial 
results. statements regarding the future are, naturally, subject to risks and uncertainties, which may result in considerable deviations from the 
outlook set forth. furthermore, some of these expectations are based on assumptions regarding future events, which may prove incorrect. 
 
factors that may cause actual results to deviate materially from expectations include – but are not limited to – general economic 
developments and developments in the financial markets, technological developments, changes and amendments to legislation and 
regulations governing gn’s markets, changes in the demand for gn's products, competition, fluctuations in sub-contractor supplies and

innovation leadership and commercial excellence 
in today’s increasingly complex world, gn contributes to 
multiple eco-systems where participants grow ever more 
dependent on each other. to stay competitive and relevant 
to partners and customers, gn continues to focus on 
innovation leadership and commercial excellence across both 
of our business divisions, e.g. demonstrated by:  
• gn’s hearing business standing out from peers by refrain-
ing from vertical integration, by integrating with multiple 
eco-systems and by partnering with other technology in-
novators to deliver the best solutions for users; and 
• gn’s audio and collaboration business driving an agnostic 
software approach to be able to integrate with an ever in-
creasing number of eco-systems as a way to remain part-
ner of choice for our channel partners in terms of unified 
communications and collaboration (uc&c) systems. 
protecting and improving the infrastructure needed to seam-
lessly integrate and operate in the different eco-systems is an 
increasingly central part of doing business for gn. 
 
market dynamics in the hearing business 
gn’s hearing business estimates market growth in line with 
the historical 4 - 6% growth in volumes with asp decline of 
around 1 - 2% annually in the mid-term post covid-19. the 
global hearing aid market was estimated to slightly more 
than 13 million units in 2020 as a result of covid-19. the 
hearing market is driven by shifting demographics with a 
growing elderly and more affluent population. additionally, 
intensifying noise pollution drives the increased prevalence of 
hearing loss and recently the increased use of face masks and 
the need for social distancing has increased awareness of 
how crucial it is for people to be able to hear and understand 
one another. the strongest hearing aid user benefits are 
achieved through a successful eco-system delivering a combi-
nation of high-quality hardware and solutions and best-in-
class service and support by hearing care professionals. 
 
market dynamics in the audio and collaboration business 
in gn’s audio and collaboration business external assess-
ments of the global enterprise market (contact centers, of-
fices, and collaboration) estimates growth of around 10% an-
nually in the mid-term. the global enterprise market is esti-
mated to usd ~2.8 billion in 2020. 
 
the audio and collaboration enterprise market is driven by 
the continued transition from desk phones to unified 
communications. companies transition from wired audio-
conferencing systems and legacy video conferencing systems 
to portable plug & play solutions. increasing flexibility 
requirements by office-workers, demands for productivity, 
focus on cloud-based solutions, and general technology 
improvements have for several years spurred growth in uc 
adoption. this was further accentuated by the covid-19 
pandemic. a significant part of our future growth is expected 
to come from the increased penetration of professional 
headsets. additionally, uc technology has the potential to 
reduce travel cost and carbon footprint by the companies 
that adopt the technology.  
serving attractive markets 
focusing on innovation leadership and commercial excellence, gn operates 
across attractive markets with high barriers to entry, further accentuated by the

gn’s strategy for 2020 and 
beyond was launched on 
february 4, 2020 and can be 
further reviewed in the

the strategy is unchanged by 
the covid-19 pandemic and

gn’s starting point for sustainability 
gn’s hearing, audio and collaboration solutions let people 
hear more: at work, at home or during leisure activities. peo-
ple are enabled to do more: improving productivity or com-
municating. this allow people to be more: improving health, 
becoming more productive, regaining a desired role in society 
or at work, or understanding colleagues. in short, gn’s prod-
ucts and solutions enable people to live better lives. 
doing business responsibly has been core to gn throughout 
our 150-year history. 2020 marked our 10th year as a signa-
tory to the un global compact, from which our sustainability 
framework has taken great inspiration. leading esg rating 
agency msci acknowledges our strong foundation, rating gn 
with an aa in 2020 for our performance across all relevant 
sustainability/esg areas, placing us in the upper quartile of 
companies in our industry. 
 
gn is committed to continuous improvement in all sustaina-
bility areas that are material to gn, by setting high standards 
in product safety and quality, human rights, diversity and in-
clusion, occupational health and safety, people development, 
business ethics and environmental and social compliance. we 
use our existing business processes to drive sustainability as 
an integrated part of how we run our company. 
 
we made progress in many areas in 2020. to name a few: the 
packaging of new large-volume product lines is now truly sus-
tainable; we intensified investigation of sustainable materials 
for future products; we worked in many parts of the world to 
support hearing loss for those most in need; and with re-
chargeable batteries as the new standard in our hearing aids 
we aim to save millions of batteries. 
 
to further improve, we have in 2020 defined three key areas 
where we by setting new goals can make true impact over the 
next years: climate change, sustainable products and packag-
ing, and health. by 2025, we: 
1. aim to be climate neutral in our own company activities, 
while also reducing our indirect emissions 
2. will use at least 50% sustainable material in new products, 
having truly sustainable packaging across gn, launching 
take-back schemes for all relevant products and regions, 
and repairing or refurbishing more products per year 
3. want to help more than 10 million people with hearing 
loss, continue to raise awareness and break down stigmas 
around hearing loss, and work with our foundations as well

in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic was the overshadowing risk 
that impacted the world and business and highlighted, more 
than anything, the need for an agile and solid risk manage-
ment approach in a world where changes can happen swiftly 
and with force. 
 
in gn, the risk management process continuously identifies 
new business risks. these are assessed by key employees and 
management teams across the entire value chain, and this 
allows us to react swiftly as it was the case at the outbreak of 
covid-19. 
 
subsequently the most significant risks are evaluated in order 
to determine what actions should be taken to reduce the risk 
or potentially turn it into opportunities. 
 
at least once a year, the risks considered the most material 
are reported to and discussed with the audit committee and 
subsequently the board of directors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the process is linked to and informs other key planning 
processes, such as strategy planning, budgeting, and ongoing 
business reviews, in order to ensure that identified key risks as 
well as opportunities are proactively managed by relevant 
risk owners.  
 
the overall aim of this integrated and proactive approach to 
risk management is to enable gn to reap the rewards of 
more coordinated, informed, and intelligent risk-taking. 
 
the main types of risk associated with gn’s business and the 
main initiatives taken to manage them are outlined in the 
following pages.

research and  
development  
 
with the rapid development of exciting new 
technologies, such as voice computing, 
artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual 
reality, 5g networks and more, the potential 
for disruptive innovation and transformation 
within our playing field is greater than ever. 
 
while this entails previously unthinkable 
opportunities for development of new gn 
products and solutions, it also entails a key 
competitive risk in case we fail to turn the 
application of new technologies into better 
customer experiences and tangible benefits 
for the users of our offerings.  
 
the accelerating pace of technology 
development makes it paramount for gn to 
be able to shorten time-to-market even 
further in the years ahead. 
 
 
with our continuous and relentless focus on 
innovation excellence we invest significantly 
in research and innovation and have 
continued to improve our product innovation 
and development processes during 2020.  
 
these improvements enable faster time-to-
market as well as making us more efficient, 
agile, and adaptable during the development 
process, without compromising on high-
quality standards. 
 
during the past years, we have also increas-
ingly focused on exploring and leveraging the 
increasing and unique technology synergies 
between gn hearing and gn audio, to the 
benefit of the customers of both businesses.  
 
 
 
 
 
b 
operations 
gn hearing and gn audio both rely on global 
supply chains for the timely delivery of critical 
materials and components, which must meet 
high-quality standards.  
 
at the outbreak of covid-19 in q1, gn 
hearing suspended operations at its xiamen, 
china, manufacturing site and gn audio’s 
subcontractors extended holidays following 
the chinese new year in line with 
recommendations by local authorities. as for 
most technology companies in general, gn 
has a high dependency on chinese suppliers.  
 
when key suppliers are unable to provide 
agreed deliverables this negatively affects 
our ability to accommodate demand for gn 
products. 
 
covid-19 or other specific events could lead 
to shunning of chinese products, or 
protectionist sentiment, which could escalate 
into new tariffs or other forms of trade 
barriers affecting the supply and cost of gn 
products or components.  
 
 
where possible and feasible, gn therefore  
targets to pursue a dual sourcing strategy to 
ensure that gn is able to source the same 
type of component from at least two 
different suppliers.  
 
for some unique suppliers, other measures 
are taken to reduce the risk, such as higher 
inventory buffers, dual sets of production 
equipment or other specific measures.  
 
further, gn closely monitors the risk of 
increasing barriers to trade and takes this into 
account in our ongoing production and 
supply chain planning in order to proactively 
mitigate any potential impact. gn engages 
with global manufacturing partners with 
production capacity in different geographies.

gn hearing 
gn hearing generates a significant part of its 
revenue from partnerships with a number of 
leading channels that occasionally put their 
business up for tender. this means that gn 
hearing is exposed to the risk of losing 
business as these are re-tendered. 
 
 
 
we mitigate the channel risk by working 
closely with our partners to continuously 
strengthen partnerships and integrate our 
products and services deeper into our 
partners’ eco-systems and customer 
journeys. accordingly, we will stay focused on 
meeting the needs and demands of partners 
and eco-systems and provide these with 
superior added benefits. further, gn 
hearing’s strategic priority of further 
expanding innovation leadership to provide 
more natural and individualized hearing 
solutions mitigates the risk of being de-
selected during tenders. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gn audio 
gn audio entered 2020 with a strong track-
record of growth in attractive enterprise mar-
kets. the already high demand rose sharply 
as enterprises and organizations increased in-
vestments in collaboration solutions allowing 
employees to work effectively from home. 
the underlying business is very strong and 
gn audio took significant market share and 
further consolidated its position as the 
world’s leading supplier of peripherals for en-
terprise collaboration.  
 
while attractive growth rates are also ex-
pected for the years to come, a global eco-
nomic slowdown due to the pandemic could 
potentially constrain the demand for con-
sumer headsets and professional audio and 
video collaboration peripherals.  
 
the attractive growth rates also entail a risk 
that new competition enters the market and 
challenges gn audio’s leading position. 
 
 
gn audio continually works to expand its 
world-leading position by developing new, in-
novative, relevant, and unique solutions 
based on deep insights into new trends and 
developments in user preferences, purchas-
ing patterns, technology and other key fac-
tors shaping user needs and demands. the 
enterprise business operates in a consoli-
dated industry with high barriers to entry and 
complex eco-systems. 
 
gn audio is well positioned to withstand the 
effects of a potential economic slowdown. 
our enterprise product portfolio is fundamen-
tally designed to support more flexible and 
hybrid working patterns. the portfolio further 
helps companies realize efficiency gains and 
productivity enhancements, reduce travel 
cost and climate footprint, all of which are at-
tractive value propositions also in an eco-
nomic downturn. furthermore, our consumer 
headsets and true wireless earbuds address a 
strongly growing market. 
 
gn audio’s scalable contract manufacturing 
and distribution model allows us to adjust 
volumes swiftly on an ongoing basis to miti-
gate fluctuating demand.

covid-19 
gn was affected in three ways by covid-19: 
(i) various impact on production capacity and 
supply of component from subcontractors in 
h1 2020, (ii) gn audio experienced strong de-
mand as enterprises continued to invest in 
employees working from home, and (iii) gn 
hearing was impacted by lockdowns and lo-
cal restrictions impacting demand severely. 
 
for gn hearing the covid-19 pandemic re-
sulted in a severe impact on revenue as the 
global hearing aid markets in h1 2020 saw a 
gradual shut-down as markets across the 
world were facing lockdowns and various lo-
cal restrictions, including advising the more 
vulnerable populations to stay home. addi-
tional waves of the virus prior to widespread 
vaccinations could pose similar challenges. 
 
for gn audio the pandemic resulted in ex-
ceptional demand as enterprises and organi-
zations increased investments in collabora-
tion solutions allowing employees to work ef-
fectively from home. 
 
 
gn’s business model with limited forward in-
tegration and operating within both the hear-
ing aid and audio & video space mitigates this 
risk. 2020 manifested the benefits of having 
both divisions under the same roof, which 
combined with speed and agility lead to a 
company that is now stronger than ever, with 
a solid financial foundation. 
 
for both business divisions organizational 
streamlining and increased focus on online 
channels and digitalization of the customer 
journey had already been instigated. the pan-
demic accelerated this development, which 
places both divisions in strong positions on 
the back of the epidemic. 
 
 
 
 
 
d 
regulatory risk 
us over-the-counter regulation 
in the us market for hearing aids, a new over-
the-counter (otc) category is expected to be 
introduced. a new fda regulation was ex-
pected in 2020 but was postponed due to the 
global pandemic. timing of a new regulation 
remains uncertain.  
 
the precise scope and timing of its implemen-
tation is still not known, and it consequently 
also remains uncertain what overall effect 
this might have on the hearing aid industry.  
 
new players may enter the market in this cat-
egory, and we may see some downward pres-
sure on prices. 
 
 
a new regulated otc hearing aid category in 
the us could present a new opportunity to 
address millions of americans that suffer 
from some degree of untreated hearing loss. 
gn could leverage its unique combination of 
hearing aid and consumer earbud expertise, 
turning an otc market into an additive op-
portunity rather than a threat. 
 
additionally, gn’s focused business model as 
a dedicated wholesale manufacturer with lim-
ited forward integration – in combination 
with strong strategic partnerships – makes 
gn less exposed to any risks arising from the 
introduction of an over-the-counter category 
than manufacturers that are vertically inte-
grated, as gn will be more agile and resilient.

medical device regulation 
regulatory requirements concerning quality 
management systems and product safety of 
medical devices, including hearing aids and 
certain accessories, are increasing.  
 
the next main piece of legislation raising the 
bar is the eu medical device regulation, 
which imposes stricter requirements regard-
ing clinical data and safety risk management. 
as a consequence of the global pandemic, 
the eu parliament voted in favor of postpon-
ing mdr by 12 months. in may 2021, the 
transition period for the regulation expires, 
after which quality systems of all hearing aid 
r&d and manufacturing sites must comply. 
 
 
in 2020, gn hearing added further resources 
to upgrade its quality management system, 
processes, and medical device files for prod-
ucts in order to ensure compliance with the 
medical device regulation. the ongoing work 
to ensure compliance will continue into 2021. 
 
given that the new regulation significantly in-
creases the requirements that gn and other 
medical device manufacturers must live up 
to, it also increases the barriers to entry in the 
industry, as the cost and resource investment 
needed to ensure compliance increases.  
 
 
 
 
 
e 
intellectual  
property rights 
as gn operates globally in highly innovative 
industries and with increased focus on cus-
tomer needs and individualized user experi-
ences, connectivity, wireless solutions, and 
software, there is a risk that our freedom to 
operate is constrained by third-party patents 
preventing commercialization of certain 
products or solutions or forcing gn to pay 
royalty. 
 
 
gn continues to strengthen its patent portfo-
lio and monitors third-party patent activities. 
from time to time gn initiates invalidation 
actions against patents considered to be 
wrongfully issued. the objective is to protect 
our freedom to operate within current and fu-
ture innovation spaces and to defend our-
selves in case of patent infringement claims 
being brought against gn. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
f 
information  
security 
gn’s business depends to a large and 
increasing degree on reliable and secure it 
systems. failure to adequately protect the it 
infrastructure and key systems against the 
risk of security incidents could potentially 
impact critical business processes such as 
manufacturing or sales or lead to unintended 
disclosure of business-critical confidential 
data or sensitive personal data. such 
incidents may negatively affect gn’s 
competitive position, damage its reputation 
and/or result in fines. 
 
 
gn works to continuously minimize these 
risks through a wide range of measures, such 
as technical security controls, process con-
trols and internal employee awareness cam-
paigns.  
 
during past years, gn has significantly 
strengthened its specific defenses in order to 
ensure that we stay vigilant of the constantly 
evolving threat landscape.

the competition for talent in our industry has 
intensified during the past few years. should 
we no longer be able to retain, attract and 
grow the right talent, we might not be able: 
1) to continue delivering innovative and 
relevant products, 2) to successfully execute 
on our strategy and 3) to build a sustainable 
organization for the future.  
 
in addition, our ability to deliver on our ambi-
tious strategic objectives depends on our abil-
ity to ensure that the entire global organiza-
tion is fully aligned behind our strategy and 
that this translates into flawless strategy exe-
cution. 
 
 
gn’s hr strategy provides the foundation for 
successfully building strong leadership and 
talent across the organization to meet our 
objectives.  
 
during 2020, we further strengthened our 
talent acquisition team to increase in-house 
search capability and complement rigorous 
talent review and succession planning. re-
cent years’ increased focus on talent man-
agement resulted in several internal recruit-
ments for executive management and global 
management team positions. 
 
gn’s strategic leadership development pro-
gram was postponed in 2020  due to covid-
19 but will restart in 2021. leadership devel-
opment will be further strengthened with 
programs for new leaders and for virtual 
leadership. a job catalogue with clear career 
paths for employees was introduced and a re-
ward framework that enables gn to attract 
and retain the right talent at the right cost 
will be deployed in 2021. gn will actively take 
steps to address mental wellbeing for em-
ployees to mitigate negative effects from re-
mote working over prolonged time. 
 
finally, a new employee engagement survey 
tool was introduced across the gn group in 
2020. going forward, gn will seek valuable 
feedback from all our employees twice a year 
ensuring that we actively can take appropri-
ate actions to continuously maintain a highly 
engaged organization.

corporate governance refers to the way a company is  
managed and controlled through ownership, management 
structure, incentive schemes, etc. gn strives to build trusted 
relationships with customers, shareholders, suppliers, 
employees, and the community. we also aim for a high 
degree of transparency and active ownership, including 
sharing information and engaging in a regular dialogue with 
all our stakeholders. 
 
on its website gn provides a statutory report on corporate 
governance, including an explanation of how gn complies 
with each recommendation (www.gn.com/corporategovern-
ance2020). this overview, as well as the risk management and 
internal control systems related to financial reporting de-

composition and responsibilities of the board of directors 
gn’s board of directors currently comprises seven members 
elected by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. 
further, three members are elected by the employees based 
in denmark.  
members of the board of directors elected by the sharehold-
ers at the annual general meeting are elected for an annual 
term until gn’s next annual general meeting. gn’s 2021 an-
nual general meeting is held on march 17 at 10am. 
 
employee representatives are elected in accordance with the 
danish companies act for terms of four years. the next elec-
tion for gn store nord will be in the first quarter of 2022. 
 
the board of directors is responsible for safeguarding the in-
terests of the shareholders while at the same time consider-
ing all other stakeholders. at least once a year, the board of 
directors assesses the most important tasks based on the 
overall strategic direction of the company, including the fi-
nancial and managerial supervision of the company. as part 
of the supervision, the board of directors evaluates the per-

gn is a global company and to successfully develop and 
maintain this position in the marketplace, gn is dependent 
upon global expertise and experience. the board of directors 
is a diverse group in terms of global experience, functional 
competencies, and industry background, which ensures that it 
can fulfill its obligations. board members possess expertise 
within med-tech, innovation, product development, 
digitalization, online marketing, and commercialization, as 
well as thorough understanding of financial and human 
resource matters and in-depth knowledge of gn’s business. 
 
the composition of the board of directors is a mix of mem-
bers with executive positions and professional board mem-
bers of both genders and diverse nationalities. this composi-
tion is deemed to provide a good balance between 
knowledge, competencies, experience, and availability for a 
substantial workload. 
 
evaluation of the performance of the executive manage-
ment team and the board of directors 
the board of directors assesses the work and results of the 
executive management on an ongoing basis as an integrated 
and natural part of their regular meetings. in the beginning of 
every year, the board establishes performance plans with spe-
cific kpis for each member of the executive management. 
the board assesses the performance of the executive man-
agement and its execution of the agreed kpis on an ongoing 
basis during the year and formally at the end of the year. the 
board also evaluates on an ongoing basis the structure and 
composition of the executive management in light of compe-
tencies and execution of the company’s strategy. at the year-
end assessment of executive management, the chairman of 
the board is having individual performance evaluation meet-
ings with each member of the executive management. in ad-
dition, the work of the executive management is also as-
sessed as an integrated part of the board’s own annual self-
evaluation, ensuring that the executive management’s work is 
evaluated in accordance with pre-defined criteria. 
 
the board of directors has – since 2009 - conducted an an-
nual self-evaluation of its work through which the board can 
track its own performance, strengths and development areas 
over time and consequently the board has been able to con-
tinuously improve its work and procedures. progress has been 
measured from one year to the other. the overall purpose of 
the board’s self-evaluation process continues to be to secure 
a high level of professionalism, solid corporate governance 
and contribution to the continued success of the company. 
furthermore, it ensures that the board continues to have the 
right composition and expertise at the board. 
 
the annual self-evaluation process covers the contributions 
of each individual board member as well as the achievements 
of the board as a whole and of the board committees. the 
self-evaluation process secures a structured and systematic 
approach for the assessment of the board’s work and is led by 
the chairman of the board. the process also includes an as-
sessment of other management positions that each board 
and executive member holds and assesses potential over-
boarding issues. the company subscribes to the concept of 
“non- overboarding” and, therefore, carefully considers the 
workload and other requirements such other management 
positions may impose on each individual board or executive 
member.  
 
the self-evaluation survey is anonymous and is based on a 
comprehensive questionnaire that among other covers the 
following evaluation criteria in accordance with the good cor-
porate governance recommendations and is managed by the 
office of the general counsel:  
• the board’s contribution and results,  
• the board’s cooperation with the executive management 
team,  
• the chairman’s leadership of the board,  
• the composition of the board (including competencies, di-
versity, and the number of members),  
• the work in the board committees and the committees’ 
structure, and  
• the organization and quality of the board materials 
each year, the questions in the survey questionnaire are being 
reviewed by the chairman of the board to ensure, that they 
are all applicable and relevant, taking into consideration any 
topics of importance for the board’s work during that year. in 
2020, the board survey was conducted in december and in-
cluded added sections on both the board’s and the executive 
management team’s handling of the covid-19 pandemic, 
both in terms of global impact on the business short term and 
long term and impact on the global workforce.   
 
each question in the self-evaluation questionnaire is answered 
by each board members and each member of the executive 
management team and is rated with a score from 1 to 5. the 
questionnaire also offers the participants the option to pro-
vide additional commentary input, all on an anonymous basis. 
the chairman also has individual meetings with each board 
member and member of the executive management team to 
follow up on the results of the survey. the results are pre-
sented in a board meeting by the chairman combined with a 
board discussion of the results 
 
the chairman of the board is furthermore responsible for 
providing an update to the annual general meeting on the 
general results of the self-evaluation. 
 
over time it is the board’s intention to obtain periodic exter-
nal assistance to the board evaluation process. the board had 
planned to do so in 2020. however, due to a new composition 
of the board with three new external members joining in 
march 2020, and the extraordinary circumstances resulting

gn store nord a/s 
from the covid-19 pandemic, which caused all board meet-
ings - except for one - to be held fully or partially as virtual 
meetings, the board decided to postpone the involvement of 
external assistance until a later point in time.  
 
the general conclusions of the 2020 self-evaluation survey 
were that the work in the board and the collaboration be-
tween the board and the executive management are con-
ducted in a professional and efficient way; and that the board 
and the executive management are aligned with respect to 
how they collaborate, how the board and board committee 
meetings are conducted; and the decision-making processes. 
with respect to the competencies represented on the board, 
the survey showed that the board possesses the skills needed. 
the survey also concluded that the board and executive man-
agement’s efforts during recent years in relation to securing 
in-house succession planning have paid off and that it should 
continue to be a focus area for the board and executive man-
agement going forward. 
 
the general conclusions and information on the board’s self-
evaluation process are also published on the company’s cor-
porate website, gn.com. 
 
diversity and talent management 
board of directors  
the board of directors firmly believes that diversity strength-
ens any governing body and acknowledges the importance of 
diversity in general, including diversity of gender, nationality, 
and competencies. 
 
at the 2020 annual general meeting, the board of directors 
was expanded from five to seven shareholder-elected mem-
bers. of the current seven members, four are women. already 
in 2018, the board reached its diversity target of 50% of its 
members being women.

gn’s current diversity focus is to advance stronger interna-
tional representation and gender diversity in our senior man-
agement, the global management teams (gmt) in gn audio 
and gn hearing. by the end of 2020, gn hearing’s gmt com-
prised 18% female leaders and 36% non-danes. gn audio’s 
gmt comprised 14 % female leaders and 64% non-danes. 
 
when gn’s diversity policy was established in 2014, women 
filled 14% of the company’s senior management positions. as 
a result of dedicated efforts women by the end of 2020 filled 
21% of senior management positions across the gn group. 
gn will continue to strengthen efforts to build a pipeline of 
future female candidates for senior positions. we have a con-
stant focus to ensure that we attract female candidates for 
both internal job rotations and for new positions. by the end 
of 2020, 43% of the newly appointed members of senior man-
agement were women. 
furthermore, to achieve our goals, we ensure that diversity – 
encompassing gender, nationality, competencies, etc. – is an 
integral part of gn’s yearly talent review and succession plan-
ning process, of talent development practices, recruitment 
procedures and leadership development programs.  
 
finally, the wording and visual identity in recruitment activi-
ties on social media and other channels are continuously de-
signed to best attract female candidates and encourage di-
versity. when external recruiters or headhunters are used, gn 
requires that viable female candidates are presented for any 
position. 
 
remuneration 
gn pursues a policy of offering the board of directors and ex-
ecutive management remuneration that is competitive with 
industry peers and other global companies to retain and at-
tract competent professional leaders of the businesses and 
members of the board of directors. 
 
remuneration of executive management is composed by a 
fixed base salary plus a cash bonus which, for each member of 
executive management, will normally be targeted at 50% but 
can vary between 25 and 75% of the fixed annual base salary. 
the cash bonus pay-out is capped at 100% of the annual base 
salary of the relevant member of executive management. in 
addition, executive management is offered to be part of gn’s 
long-term incentive program which is a share option-based 
program linked to the development in gn’s share price as well 
as two financial performance metrics (revenue growth and 
ebitda improvement) measured against a peer group of in-
novative companies similar to gn. each grant to a member of 
executive management will be made within a range of 50% to 
100% of the annual base salary calculated in accordance with 
the black scholes method at the time of grant. the gross re-
turn on the share options for each annual grant can generally 
not exceed a value equal to four times the annual base salary 
of the relevant member of executive management at the 
time of the grant.  
 
the company does not make pension contributions for mem-
bers of executive management, and executive management 
has change-of-control agreements in line with danish market 
practice. gn may terminate members of executive manage-
ment by giving 12 months’ notice, whereas a member of ex-
ecutive management may resign by giving six months’ notice.  
 
members of the board of directors receive a fixed remunera-
tion, comprising a base fee (with a multiple of two times to 
the deputy chairman and three times to the chairman) and 
fixed travel allowances. in addition, gn pays statutory contri-
butions to social security and similar taxes and charges within 
the eu/eea that gn is obligated to pay according to applica-
ble law in relation to a member of the board of directors’ po-
sition with gn. board members also receive a separate fee for 
serving on the board committees, with a multiple of two 
times the committee base fee to the committee chair.

nord.  
 
gn’s full remuneration report for 2020 is available here:

board committees 
 
chairmanship 
the chairman and the deputy chairman form the chairman-
ship of the board. the chairmanship prepares and organizes 
the work of the board of directors with a view to ensure that 
the board performs its tasks and fulfills its duties and respon-
sibilities in an efficient and responsible manner. the chair-
manship also performs preparatory tasks for and advise the 
board in relation to, inter alia, business strategy, implementa-
tion of strategy, business development, budget, and projects, 
and performs in-depth business reviews of selected areas. 
 
audit committee 
according to its charter, the audit committee, among other, 
assists the board of directors in relation to internal/external 
accounting and financial control systems, the integrity of the 
company’s financial reports and engagements with external 
auditors. the audit committee also carries out ongoing as-
sessments of the company’s financial and business risks.  
 
in 2020, the committee continued to deploy gn’s internal 
controls framework which, among other, builds on increased 
education and financial reporting process tracking. the com-
mittee reviewed the whistleblower reporting system, main ac-
counting principles, tax strategy and compliance and risk 
management processes covering key risks (including identi-
fied supplier risks), etc.  
 
additionally, the audit committee assists the board of direc-
tors in relation to monitoring the control framework and pro-
cesses to protect the company’s it infrastructure, cyber secu-
rity, and key systems against the risk of security incidents that 
could potentially impact critical business processes. 
 
in 2020, the audit committee held 6 meetings. 
 
remuneration committee 
according to its charter, the remuneration committee assists 
the board of directors in matters and decisions concerning re-
muneration of executive management and senior employees 
and in ensuring that the general remuneration policies strike 
an appropriate balance between the interests of gn's share-
holders and rewarding and motivating the executives and em-
ployees in order to secure the long-term benefits of their en-
ergy and loyalty. resolutions on remuneration recommended 
by the remuneration committee and adopted by the board 
of directors are in line with the remuneration policy as ap-
proved by the board and by the annual general meeting on 
11 march 2020.  
 
the 2020 remuneration policy for executive management is 
based on the remuneration guidelines and takes into account 
the corporate governance recommendations and the require-
ments of the danish companies act. in 2020, the remunera-
tion committee supervised and reviewed the remuneration 
policy, salary, bonus, long-term incentive process and results, 
and assisted with the preparation of the remuneration re-
port, which can be reviewed here: www.gn.com/remunera-
tion2020. the remuneration committee also considered 
grants under gn’s long term incentive program, talent devel-
opment and succession planning process and results.  
 
in 2020, the remuneration committee held 7 meetings. 
 
strategy committee 
as an innovation-driven company, it is vital for gn to maintain 
and further enhance the technological core capabilities of the 
company of today, and even more importantly of tomorrow. 
investments in a number of exploratory research projects aim 
at discovering potential future business opportunities leverag-
ing core knowledge and competencies of gn, but outside gn 
hearing’s and gn audio’s immediate area of operation. 
 
in 2020, the strategy committee oversaw a series of existing 
projects as well as new projects to explore technological inno-
vations within the broader technology space. 
 
in 2020, the strategy committee held 9 meetings. 
 
nomination committee 
according to its charter, the nomination committee advises 
and makes recommendations to the board of directors in re-
lation to the skills that the board of directors and executive 
management must have to best perform their tasks.  
 
in 2020, primary activities included a review of the general 
competencies necessary to be represented on the board. 
based on this analysis and a review of the competency pro-
files of the individual board members, the committee con-
cluded that the necessary competencies are represented in 
the board. the structure, size and diversity of the board was 
also reviewed and found to meet all governance require-
ments. 
 
the committee also reviewed the latest developments in 
good corporate governance and performed succession plan-
ning for the board. 
 
in 2020, the nomination committee held 2 meetings.

internal audit function 
in accordance with its charter, the audit committee annually 
considers the need for an internal audit function. based on 
the recommendations of the audit committee, the board of 
directors determines whether the internal control systems 
are adequate. 
 
in 2020, the group finance function of gn continued their fo-
cus on internal control of financial reporting covering the con-
trols specifically designed to address the risks of misstate-
ments in the financial statements. the compliance and inter-
nal control agenda continued to focus on the strengthening 
of the internal processes, including risk assessment, control 
activities and a defined controlling concept for gn. the pur-
pose is to strengthen the overall control environment, iden-
tify weaknesses and mitigate financial risks globally as well as 
locally. 
 
gn continuously adjusts and implements financial processes 
and control activities in our business aimed at further mitigat-
ing the risk of incorrect financial reporting. these activities 
help ensure that errors and deviations are prevented, discov-
ered, and rectified. 
 
gn focuses on having a current and functioning internal con-
trol process that provides the users of our consolidated fi-
nancial statements with a “reasonable assurance” that these 
are accurate and can be relied upon for informed decision-
making. the board of directors’ assessment, which is based 
on the company’s size and the organization of the finance de-
partment, is that there is no need to establish an internal au-
dit function at this time. 
 
compliance  
 
policy management and compliance training  
gn’s commitment to business ethics and compliance with in-
ternational regulations and internal policies is anchored in our 
ethics guide, anti-corruption policies, our supplier codes of 
conduct and other policies and guidelines. these outline the 
fundamental requirements for how gn operates and describe 
the responsibilities and ethical standards expected of all em-
ployees and relevant business partners. 
 
to ensure and document that employees are always familiar 
with our ethics guide and other key policies, relevant employ-
ees have to electronically sign off on their compliance within 
specific areas and on a regular basis take gn’s e-learning 
courses within key topics, such as anti-corruption and compe-
tition compliance. each year this is supplemented with tai-
lored compliance training for selected business units or 
groups of employees. 
 
anti-corruption compliance reviews  
as a regular part of our global anti-corruption compliance 
program, we each year conduct a number of compliance re-
views of selected gn subsidiaries or business units around the 
world. the main objective is to identify and assess relevant 
risk areas and to make sure that adequate controls are in 
place to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and gn 
policies. the selection of subsidiaries or business units for 
compliance reviews is based on an annual country risk assess-
ment consisting of defined risk indicators. 
 
third-party due diligence  
our aspiration is that all our business partners acknowledge 
our values and share our commitment to conducting business 
in an ethical manner. in 2020, gn took further steps to en-
hance the process for assessing and managing corruption 
risks associated with third-party business partners in selected 
high-risk countries. the evaluation of third parties involves 
self-assessment questionnaires and due diligence screenings 
focusing on the potential reputational and legal risks associ-
ated with the business relationship. 
 
whistleblower system 
gn’s whistleblower hotline, the gn alertline, is available in 27 
countries and 24 languages and is independently managed by 
a third party. the hotline can be used by employees as well as 
external parties to report a concern or perceived misconduct. 
access to reporting and additional details about the hotline 
can be found here: www.gn.com/alertline 
 
the system is an important tool for ensuring that alleged ille-
gal or unethical conduct is reported and immediately ad-
dressed. all complaints are treated with the needed  confiden-
tiality, and gn is committed to dealing  with any employee 
who takes action and/or participates in an investigation in a 
fair and respectful manner. this is emphasized in the gn non-
retaliation policy signed by executive management. 
 
in 2020, 14 concerns were reported through the gn whistle-
blower system. the allegations were primarily related to inap-
propriate behavior, harassment/bullying, conflicts of interest, 
and covid-19 precaution violations. all relevant cases have 
been investigated and appropriate remediating as well as dis-
ciplinary actions were taken where relevant. 
 
more details on gn’s compliance efforts and policies can be 
found via www.gn.com/documents. 
 
shareholders 
 
gn aims for transparency and active ownership towards 
shareholders through an open and active dialogue by ongoing 
communication with our shareholders at the annual general 
meeting and through investor presentations, news updates, 
conference calls, the company website, webcasts, interim re-
ports, the annual report, company announcements and media 
outreach activities.  
 
gn services national, as well as international investors, and 
ensures a continuous dialogue with shareholders, whether ex-
isting or potential, as well as equity analysts. on the

company’s website, www.gn.com/investor, detailed material 
on the interests of the shareholders can be found. gn’s 
shares are 100% free float, and shareholders have the ulti-
mate authority over the company and exercise their right to 
make decisions at the annual general meeting where they 
also approve the annual report and elect board members 
and the independent auditor. for more information, please 
see the shareholder section on pages 44 – 45. 
 
notices for the annual general meeting 
gn sends notices to convene annual general meetings by 
email. letters are sent to shareholders who have requested 
this instead of emails. thus, we encourage all registered 
shareholders to sign up at the investor portal with their email 
addresses and check the box labeled “subscribe/unsubscribe” 
in the field “notice for the annual general meeting”. share-
holders will then receive the notice by email in the future.

• apg asset management n.v. (holland) 
• société générale s.a. (france) 
 
gn store nord fondet currently owns 238,200 gn shares. a 
recent regulatory change has made it possible for gn store 
nord fondet to diversify and restructure its asset portfolio 
more efficiently and increase the fund available for donations. 
with the aim of fulfilling its ambition to continue to do valua-
ble charitable donations, gn store nord fondet is therefore 
investigating the possibility of restructuring and diversifying 
its asset portfolio, including a sale of the majority of its hold-
ing of gn shares.

hedge future obligations of the convertible bond and 
4,000,000 shares – which are held for hedging of long-term 
incentive programs.  
 
until the annual general meeting on march 17, 2021, the 
board of directors is authorized to acquire shares in gn. the 
company's holding of treasury shares may at no time exceed 
15% of the share capital of the company. 
 
dividend policy and share buyback programs  
gn’s overall financial target is to deliver a competitive 
shareholder return through a combination of dividend 
payments and share price appreciation. gn aims to pay out a 
dividend corresponding to 15 - 25% of the annual net profit 
and to distribute additional excess cash to shareholders 
through share buyback programs.  
 
dividend payments and share buybacks are subject to, among 
other factors, cash requirements to support the ongoing 
operations, strategic opportunities, and the company’s capital 
structure. as previously communicated, it is currently gn’s 
target to maintain a capital structure consisting of equity and 
debt with the net interest-bearing debt amounting to 
between one to two times ebitda. 
 
in order to preserve a strong balance sheet in uncertain times, 
gn postponed share buybacks (program intended to be 
initiated following the approvals by the annual general 
meeting on march 11, 2020), until better predictability and 
visibility into the consequences of the covid-19 was achieved 
(see company announcement no. 24 of april 3, 2020). 
 
at the annual general meeting on march 17, 2021, the board 
of directors will propose to pay out a total dividend of dkk 
206 million (equivalent to dkk 1.45 per share and 16% of the 
2020 net profit) in respect of the 2020 financial year, 
compared to dkk 206 million in 2019 (equivalent to dkk 
1.45 per share and 14% of the 2019 net profit). 
 
incentive programs 
by the end of 2020, the total number of outstanding warrants 
in gn hearing was 4,238 (0.7%) of the share capital in gn 
hearing). the total number of outstanding warrants in gn 
audio was 3,838 (1.1%) of the share capital in gn audio). the 
total number of outstanding options in gn store nord was 
1,439,890 (1.0%) of the share capital in gn store nord). 
 
investor relations policy 
as part of gn’s investor relations activities an active dialogue 
is pursued with existing and potential shareholders as well as 
with financial analysts. gn ensures that relevant and timely 
information is provided to the financial community to ensure 
that the gn share is fairly priced. this is accomplished 
through information continually announced to the market as 
company announcements and press releases, combined with 
investor meetings, conferences and presentations of the 
company’s interim and annual results. 
 
following the release of interim and annual results, gn con-
ducts roadshows where the executive management and the 
investor relations team inform investors and financial analysts 
about the recent developments in the company. gn is 
covered by sell-side analysts, who continually release analyst 
research reports on gn and the industry dynamics. a full list 
of the analysts covering gn can be found on the website 
www.gn.com/investor. 
 
gn has a four-week silent period prior to publication of a 
financial report. during these silent periods, any 
communication with stakeholders is restricted.  
 
gn’s website www.gn.com contains historic and current 
information about gn, including company announcements 
and press releases, current and historic share price data, 
investor presentations and annual and interim reports.

gn store nord a/s 
 
in the annual report the notes are grouped in sections. each note includes the accounting policies and significant accounting estimates applica-
ble to the relevant notes. the description of the accounting policies in the notes is part of the complete description of gn store nord’s ac-
counting policies. the notes are grouped in these five sections: 
 
section 1 basis of preparation 
section 2 results of the year 
section 3 operating assets and liabilities 
section 4 capital structure and financing items 
section 5 other disclosures 
 
new or revised eu endorsed accounting standards and interpretations are described as well as how these changes are expected to impact the 
financial performance and reporting of the gn store nord group. 
 
 
1.1 general accounting policies 
 
the annual report of gn store nord has been prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by 
the eu and the danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of 
listed companies. 
 
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with the histori-
cal cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value. 
 
new standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by gn 
store nord  
as of january 1, 2020, gn store nord adopted all relevant new or re-
vised international financial reporting standards and ifric interpre-
tations with effective date january 1, 2020 or earlier. the new or re-
vised standards and interpretations did not affect recognition and 
measurement materially nor did they result in any material changes 
to disclosures in the notes. apart from this, the annual report is pre-
sented in accordance with the accounting policies applied in previous 
years’ annual reports. 
 
accounting standards not yet adopted 
a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpre-
tations are effective for annual periods beginning after january 1, 
2020 and have not been applied in preparing this annual report. none 
of these new standards, amendments to standards and interpreta-
tions are expected to have significant impact on the financial state-
ments of gn store nord. 
 
gn store nord will adopt new standards and interpretations as of the 
effective dates.  
 
consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements relate to the financial state-
ments of the parent company, gn store nord, and its subsidiaries as 
at december 31, 2020. control is achieved when the group is ex-
posed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee.  
 
generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights re-
sults in control. to support this presumption and when gn store 
nord has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an in-
vestee, gn store nord considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
in assessing whether it has power over an investee. 
 
group companies are listed on page 110. enterprises that are not 
subsidiaries, but where gn store nord holds between 20% and 50% 
of the voting rights and over which it exercises significant influence, 
but where it does not have power to govern the financial and operat-
ing policies, are considered associates. when assessing whether gn 
store nord exercises control or significant influence, potential voting 
rights that are substantive and options on acquisition of additional 
ownership interests are taken into account.  
 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared as a consolida-
tion of the financial statements of the parent company and those of 
the individual subsidiaries, all of which are presented in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies. intra-group income and ex-
penses, shareholdings, intra-group balances and dividends, and real-
ized and unrealized gains and losses on intra-group transactions are 
eliminated. on consolidation, the carrying amount of shares held by 
the parent company in subsidiaries is set off against the subsidiaries’ 
equity.

gn store nord a/s 
foreign currency translation 
functional currency and presentation currency 
financial statement items for each of the reporting enterprises in the 
group are measured using the currency used in the primary financial 
environment in which the reporting enterprise operates. transactions 
denominated in other currencies than the functional currency are 
considered transactions denominated in foreign currencies. the con-
solidated financial statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk), 
which is the functional currency and presentation currency of the par-
ent company. 
 
translation of transactions and balances 
on initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rates at the 
transaction date. foreign exchange differences arising between the 
exchange rates at the transaction date and at the date of payment 
are recognized in the income statement as financial income or finan-
cial expenses. receivables, payables and other monetary items de-
nominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date. the difference between the exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date and at the date at which the receiva-
ble or payable arose or was recognized in the latest annual report is 
recognized in the income statement as financial income or financial 
expenses. 
 
translation of subsidiaries 
on recognition in the consolidated financial statements of foreign en-
tities with another functional currency than gn store nord’s presen-
tation currency, the income statements are translated at the ex-
change rates at the transaction date, and the balance sheet items are 
translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. an aver-
age exchange rate for the month is used as the exchange rate at the 
transaction date to the extent that this does not significantly distort 
the presentation of the underlying transactions. foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation of the opening balance of equity of 
such enterprises at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and 
on translation of the income statements from the exchange rates at 
the transaction date to the exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
are recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
foreign exchange adjustment of balances with foreign entities that 
are considered part of the investment in the entity is recognized in 
other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements 
under a separate translation reserve. 
 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement is presented using the indirect method 
based on the operating profit (loss). the cash flow statement shows 
the cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities for 
the year and the year’s changes in cash and cash equivalents as well 
as the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the 
year. the cash flow effect of acquisitions and disposals of enterprises 
is shown separately in cash flows from investing activities. cash flow 
from acquired enterprises is recognized in the cash flow statement 
from the acquisition date. cash flow from disposed of enterprises is 
recognized up until the disposal date. 
 
cash flow from operating activities comprises cash flow from the 
year’s operations adjusted for non-cash operating items and changes 
in working capital. working capital comprises current assets exclud-
ing items stated as cash and cash equivalents and excluding tax re-
ceivable, as well as current liabilities excluding bank loans, tax paya-
ble and provisions. 
 
cash flow from investing activities comprises payments in connection 
with acquisitions and disposals of enterprises and activities, acquisi-
tions and disposals of intangible assets, property, plant and equip-
ment and other non-current assets and acquisitions and disposals of 
securities that are not included in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
cash flow from financing activities comprises changes in the size or 
composition of the share capital and related costs as well as the rais-
ing of loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt, payment of the prin-
cipal portion of lease liabilities, acquisition and disposal of treasury 
shares and payment of dividends to shareholders. 
 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term marketable 
securities with a term of three months or less and are subject to an in-
significant risk of changes in value.

1.2 significant accounting estimates 
and judgments 
 
the recognition of certain items of income and expenses and the de-
termination of the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities im-
plies making accounting estimates and judgments. significant ac-
counting estimates and judgments comprise revenue recognition, 
computation of amortization, depreciation and impairment, useful 
lives and remaining useful lives of non-current assets. furthermore, 
recognition of pension obligations and similar non-current obliga-
tions, provisions, contingent liabilities as well as measurement of 
investment in associates requires significant accounting estimates 
and judgments. 
the estimates used are based on assumptions, which by management 
are deemed reliable, but by nature are associated with uncertainty. 
the assumptions may be incomplete or incorrect, and unexpected 
events or circumstances may arise. accordingly, the company is sub-
ject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to a situation where ac-
tual results differ from estimates.  
 
a description of significant accounting estimates and judgments is in-
cluded in the relevant notes:

this annual report includes financial measures which are not defined 
by ifrs. these measures are included because they are used by gn 
store nord’s management to analyze and manage the business and 
to provide stakeholders with useful information on the group’s finan-
cial position, performance and development. please refer to key ra-
tio definitions on page 112 for a definition of the measures.

2.2 revenue and geographical information (continued) 
 
 accounting policies 
revenue 
revenue from the sale of hearing aids and audio and collaboration solutions is recognized in the income statement when the customer obtains 
control of the goods. when considering at what point in time the customer obtains control of the goods, a number of indicators are consid-
ered, including whether: 
• 
gn store nord has a present right to payment for the goods 
• 
the customer has legal title to the goods 
• 
the customer has physical possession of the goods 
• 
the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
• 
the customer has accepted the goods 
in the majority of sales, the customer obtains control of the goods either upon shipment from a distribution hub or upon delivery to the cus-
tomer.  
 
the amount of revenue recognized varies with discounts and rebates offered to customers. discounts and rebates are estimated based on the 
expected amount to be provided to the customers and reduce revenues recognized. revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur. revenue from contracts in which gn store nord provides on-going access to research 
against a fee and in which the counterparty reasonably expects that gn store nord will continue to perform research is recognized over the 
access period. 
 
when goods are sold with a right of return, a refund liability and a right to the returned products are recognized as a provision and a current 
asset, respectively. the refund liability is deducted from revenue and the right to the returned products is offset in cost of sales. the portion of 
goods sold that is expected to be returned is estimated based on historical product returns data. the estimated amounts of both returns, dis-
counts and rebates are reassessed at each reporting date. 
 
gn store nord typically provides warranties for general repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by law. these assurance-
type warranties are accounted for as described in the accounting policies for warranty provisions. 
 
as part of a sales transaction, certain future services such as extended warranties may be included. in case such service-type warranties are 
sold, the transaction price is allocated to the promised goods and services based on stand-alone selling prices. observable prices are as far as 
possible used to determine the stand-alone selling prices but if such are not available a cost plus a margin approach is used. 
 
extended warranties are initially recognized as contract liabilities in the balance sheet and recognized in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the term of the extended warranty period. 
 
the typical payment terms for customers is between 30 and 60 days. gn store nord does not expect to have contracts with payment terms 
exceeding one year. as a consequence, the transaction prices are not adjusted for the time value of money. revenue is measured excluding 
vat, taxes and granted cash and quantity discounts in relation to the sale and expected returns of goods. 
 
production costs 
production costs comprise costs, including depreciation and salaries, incurred in generating the revenue for the year. production costs include 
direct and indirect costs for raw materials and consumables, wages and salaries, inventory write-downs, maintenance and depreciation and 
impairment of production plant and costs and expenses relating to the operation, administration and management of factories. 
 
development costs 
development costs comprise costs, salaries, and depreciation of operating assets and equipment directly or indirectly attributable to the 
group’s development activities.  furthermore, amortization and write-down of capitalized development projects are included. 
 
selling and distribution costs 
selling and distribution costs comprise costs relating to the sale and distribution of products and services, including salaries, sales commis-
sions, advertising and marketing costs, depreciation and impairment, expected losses on trade receivables etc.

gn store nord a/s 
management and administrative expenses 
management and administrative expenses comprise expenses incurred for management and administration. administrative expenses include 
office expenses, depreciation and impairment, etc. 
 
other operating income and costs, net 
other operating income and costs comprise items secondary to the principal activities of the enterprises   
 
 
 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition 
certain contracts with customers include a right of return and volume rebates that give rise to variable consideration. in estimating the varia-
ble consideration gn store nord is required to use either the expected value method or the most likely amount method based on which 
method better predicts the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. significant accounting estimates and judgments involve deter-
mining the portion of expected returns of goods as well as the amount of discounts and rebates. the portion of goods sold that is expected to 
be returned is estimated based on historical product returns data.  
 
in sales, where the customer obtains control of the goods upon delivery to the customer, the significant judgments made in determining when 
the customer obtains control of promised goods involve determining when a customer has physical possession of the goods and when the 
customer has accepted the goods due to uncertainty in transportation time

 accounting policies 
tax on profit (loss) for the year 
the parent company is jointly taxed with all danish subsidiaries. the current danish corporation tax is allocated between the jointly taxed com-
panies in proportion to their taxable income. the jointly taxed companies are taxed under the on-account tax scheme. 
 
tax for the year comprises current tax and changes in deferred tax for the year. the tax expense relating to the profit (loss) for the year is 
recognized in the income statement, and the tax expense relating to amounts recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in 
other comprehensive income.

2.5  tax (continued) 
 
current tax payable is recognized in current liabilities and deferred tax is recognized in non-current liabilities. tax receivable is recognized in 
current assets and deferred tax assets are recognized in non-current assets. 
 
deferred tax 
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carryforwards, are recognized at the expected value of their utilization, either as a set-off 
against tax on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. deferred tax is measured 
using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. 
deferred tax is not recognized on goodwill unless this is deductible for tax purposes. deferred tax is measured according to the tax rules and at 
the tax rates applicable in the respective countries at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallize as current tax. 
the change in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates is recognized in the income statement. if a tax deduction on computation of the 
taxable income in denmark or in foreign jurisdictions is obtained as a result of share-based payment programs, the tax benefit for the deduc-
tion is recognized directly in the balance sheet. deferred tax assets are subject to annual impairment tests and are recognized only to the ex-
tent that it is probable that the assets will be utilized   
 
 
 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
deferred tax 
management has made judgments in determining the company’s valuation of tax, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and the ex-
tent to which deferred tax assets are recognized. gn store nord recognizes deferred tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that taxa-
ble profit will be available against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized

in the impairment test, the discounted future cash flows of each cgu (the value in use) were compared with the carrying amounts. future 
cash flows are based on the budget for 2021, market forecasts for 2022 – 2025, strategy plans, etc. approved by the board of directors. budg-
ets and strategy plans are based on specific assumptions for the individual cgu regarding sales, operating profit, working capital, investments 
in non-current assets, etc. the calculations apply expected growth in the terminal period of 2.0% p.a. (2019: 2.5% p.a.) 
 
the gn hearing segment expects to return to positive organic growth in 2021. the gn audio segment is expecting to maintain their strong 
position in the growing market for audio and collaboration solutions. 
 
the market growth in the hearing aid industry and the audio market is driven by these main factors: 
 
gn hearing: 
• 
shifting demographics with a growing elderly and more affluent population 
• 
intensified noise pollution drives the increased prevalence of hearing loss 
• 
increased penetration rates as more people with a hearing loss will use hearing aids in the future, and 
• 
increased use of two hearing aids instead of only one, which is relatively common today  
gn audio: 
• 
continued transition from desk phones to unified communications 
• 
increasing flexibility requirements by office-workers, demands for productivity, focus on cloud-based solutions, and general technology 
improvements 
• 
a significant part of our future growth is expected to come from the increased penetration of professional headsets 
• 
uc technology has the potential to reduce travel cost and carbon footprint by the companies that adopt the technology 
the expected revenue growth in the gn hearing segment and gn audio segment is based on the current differentiated product offering with 
unique technology as well as future product launches. based on the impairment test and related assumptions, management has not identified 
any goodwill impairment at december 31, 2020. no likely change in the assumptions applied will result in an impairment. 
 
development projects and software 
in-progress and completed development projects comprise development and design of hearing instruments and audio and collaboration solu-
tions. most development projects are expected to be completed in the coming years, after which product sales and marketing can be com-
menced. management performs at least one annual impairment test of the carrying amount of recognized development costs. the recovera-
ble amount is assessed based on sales forecasts. during the year, impairments of dkk 99 million related to projects were recognized. in man-
agement's assessments, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount at december 31, 2020. 
 
software comprises development, design and test of production and planning software and reporting systems, business intelligence etc. imple-
mentation of these systems is expected to optimize internal procedures and processes. in 2020, management assessed that the expected use-
ful lives were reflected in the carrying amounts at december 31, 2020. 
 
customer relationships 
customer relationships primarily comprise acquired customer relationships. the most significant customer relationship relates to the acquisi-
tion of us beltone. the impairment loss of dkk 34 million relating to customer relationships was incurred in connection with a review of ex-
pectations and budgets for a number of previously acquired assets. the impairment loss has been expensed in the line ‘amortization and im-
pairment of acquired intangible assets’. the impairment loss has been calculated using a fair value based on multiples (fair value hierarchy 
level 3).

patents and rights 
patents and rights primarily comprise acquired patents and rights. the most significant patents and rights relate to technologies for the devel-
opment of new hearing instruments for gn hearing and rights to the use of certain technologies for development of headsets and video com-
munications solutions.

the group's other intangible assets comprise dkk 71 million (2019: dkk 80 million) related to trademarks, dkk 142 million (2019: dkk 181

 accounting policies 
goodwill 
at the acquisition date goodwill is recognized in the balance sheet at cost as described under business combinations. subsequently, goodwill is 
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once a year. the carrying 
amount of goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-generating units at the acquisition date. identification of cash-generating units is based on 
how management monitor the operation in the management reporting. 
 
as a result of the integration of acquired enterprises in the existing group, management assesses that the smallest cash-generating units to 
which the carrying amount of goodwill can be allocated are: gn hearing and gn audio. 
 
development projects, software, patents, licenses and other intangible assets 
intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over 
the expected useful lives of the assets. when changing the depreciation period, the effect on the depreciation is recognized prospectively as a 
change in accounting estimates. amortization and impairment is recognized in the income statement as production costs, development costs, 
distribution costs and administrative expenses. the expected useful lives are as follows: 
 
completed development projects 
1-5 years 
software 
1-7 years 
customer relationships 
up to 8 years 
patents, licenses, trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
up to 20 years 
 
development projects that are clearly defined and identifiable, where the technical utilization degree, sufficient resources and a potential fu-
ture market or development opportunities in the company is evidenced, and where gn store nord intends to produce, market or use the pro-
ject, are recognized as intangible assets if it is probable that costs incurred will be covered by future earnings. the cost of such development 
projects includes direct wages, salaries, materials and other direct and indirect costs attributable to the development projects. amortization 
and write-down of such capitalized development projects are started at the date of completion and are included in development costs. other 
development costs are recognized in the income statement as incurred. 
 
gains or losses on the disposal of intangible assets are determined as the difference between the selling price less selling costs and the carry-
ing amount at the disposal date, and are recognized in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively. 
 
impairment of goodwill and in-progress development projects 
goodwill is subject to at least one annual impairment test. similarly, in-progress development projects are tested for impairment at least annu-
ally. an impairment test is also performed whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
 
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together with the other non-current assets in the cash-generating unit to which the 
goodwill is allocated. goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount if the carrying amount is higher than the computed recoverable 
amount. the recoverable amount is computed as the present value of the expected future net cash flows from the enterprises or activities to 
which the goodwill is allocated.  
 
recognition of impairment losses in the income statement 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset or 
the cash-generating unit. impairment of goodwill is recognized in a separate line item in the income statement. impairment of goodwill is not 
reversed

 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
goodwill 
determining whether goodwill is impaired requires a comparison of the recoverable amount with the carrying amount. the recoverable 
amount is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which goodwill is 
allocated. 
 
development projects  
development projects are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. an impairment test is performed of the carrying 
amount of recognized development projects. the impairment test is based on assumptions regarding strategy, product life cycle, market con-
ditions, discount rates and budgets, etc., after the project has been completed and production has commenced. if market-related assumptions 
etc., are changed, development projects may have to be written down. management examines and assesses the underlying assumptions when 
determining whether or not the carrying amount should be written down. in addition, management continuously assess the useful lives of its 
products to ensure that amortization of development projects reflects the useful lives

3.2  property, plant and equipment (continued) 
 
 accounting policies 
property, plant and equipment 
land and buildings, plant and machinery and fixtures and fittings, other plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated deprecia-
tion and impairment losses. cost comprises the purchase price and costs of materials, components, suppliers, direct wages and salaries and 
indirect production costs until the date when the asset is available for use. liabilities related to dismantling and removing the asset and restor-
ing the site on which the asset is located are added to the cost. where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately. 
 
depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment. the expected useful lives are 
as follows: 
 
buildings and installations (land is not depreciated) 
10-50 years 
leasehold improvements 
 
5-20 years 
plant and machinery 
 
1-7 years 
operating assets and equipment 
 
2-7 years 
 
the basis of depreciation is calculated as the residual value of the asset less impairment losses. the residual value is determined at the acquisi-
tion date and reassessed annually. if the residual value exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation is discontinued. when changing the depreci-
ation period or the residual value, the effect on the depreciation is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimates. depreciation 
and impairment is recognized in the income statement as production costs, development costs, distribution costs and administrative expenses.  
 
expenses for repairs and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are included in the income statement. gains or losses on disposal or 
scrapping of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the sales price reduced by costs related to 
dismantling and removing the asset, selling costs and costs related to restoring the site on which the asset is located and the carrying amount. 
gains or losses are recognized in the income statement as other operating income or other operating costs, respectively

gn store nord’s leases mainly consist of property leases of e.g. offices but also include cars and office equipment. rental contracts are typi-
cally made for fixed periods but may have extension options. contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. in such cases the 
consideration in the contract is allocated to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. lease terms are 
negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. 
 
 
 accounting policies 
leases 
leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the 
group. each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. the finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. the right-of use asset is depreci-
ated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
 
assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. lease liabilities include the net present value of the 
following lease payments:  
• 
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable  
• 
variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate  
• 
amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees  
• 
the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and  
• 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. 
the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. if that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental 
borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a 
similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: 
• 
the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability 
• 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received 
• 
any initial direct costs, and  
• 
restoration costs. 
payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or 
loss. short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. low-value assets comprise e.g. it-equipment and small items of of-
fice furniture. 
 
extension and termination options 
extension and termination options are included in a number of leases across the group. these terms are used to maximize operational flexibil-
ity in terms of managing contracts

leases 
in determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension 
option, or not exercise a termination option. extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the 
lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). the assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in cir-
cumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee

rap (retirement advantage plan) and sip (savings and investment plan) are programs in which customers earn funds based on purchases 
made. dcp (deferred compensation plan) is a program in which management in certain foreign subsidiaries may choose to defer compensa-
tion. the amounts invested by the group on behalf of customers and management are recognized in other non-current assets. the group’s 
liabilities related to the programs are recognized in other non-current liabilities at dkk 230 million (2019: dkk 238 million). 
 
gn hearing's assessment of credit risk associated with non-current loans to dispensers depends primarily on change in payment behavior and 
current economic conditions. before a loan is extended the creditworthiness of the individual dispenser is analyzed. 
 
dispenser loans are provided to dispensers of gn hearing products in order to support their future growth. calculating the expected credit loss 
rates, gn store nord considers historical loss rates for each category of dispensers, and provides for credit losses against loans to customers 
by comparing the development in the actual loan balance to the agreed development in the loan balance. the majority of dispenser loans is 
related to dispensers in the us. 
 
the table below illustrates how the 12-month and lifetime expected credit loss are calculated for dispenser loans and how the credit risk expo-

 accounting policies 
loans to dispensers 
loans to dispensers and other receivables are measured at amortized cost less an allowance for expected credit losses. both loans to dispens-
ers and other receivables are held for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest. 
 
ownership interests and savings plans 
ownership interests between 20% and 50% in unlisted enterprises in which the group does not exercise significant influence on the financial 
and operating policies are recognized under non-current assets at fair value. gains and losses on such ownership interests will either be rec-
orded under financial items in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. this will depend on the group’s irrevocable election at 
the time of initial recognition to account for the ownership interests at fair value through profit (loss) or other comprehensive income.  
 
where the group has elected to present fair value gains and losses on ownership interests in other comprehensive income, there is no subse-
quent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the income statement following the derecognition of the investment. changes in the fair 
value of ownership interests at fair value though profit or loss are recognized in financial items in the income statement. 
 
the savings plans rap, sip and dcp are measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
impairment of dispenser loans 
the impairment methodology applied to calculate expected credit losses associated with dispenser loans carried at amortized cost depends on 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. loss allowances on dispenser loans are measured equal to 12-month expected 
credit losses, if the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. if the credit risk has increased significantly, the loss allow-
ance will be measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. 
 
the calculation of 12-month expected credit losses on dispenser loans are based on a weighted average of historical annual losses on custom-
ers. payment plans are agreed with dispensers when issuing loans to these. the credit risk of loans to dispensers is considered to have in-
creased significantly since initial recognition when actual loan balances differ from the agreed development in loan balances with more than 
40%. at this point the loan is considered to be in default and credit impaired. 
the calculation of lifetime expected credit losses on dispenser loans is based on the difference between the development in the actual loan 
balances and the agreed development in loan balances. the allowances are increased in steps if the difference between the actual loan bal-
ance and the agreed development in loan balances increases. 
indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of a dispenser loan include bankruptcy, change of control and change in the 
payment behavior or financial situation of the dispenser. in such cases a full or partial write-off of a dispenser loan will be recognized by derec-
ognizing the asset. where recoveries are made, these are recognized in the income statement.  
 
impairment of pre-paid discounts 
the carrying amount of pre-paid discounts is subject to an annual test for indications of impairment. when there is an indication that assets 
may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined.  
 
recognition of impairment losses in the income statement 
impairment losses are recognized in the income statement in the relevant functional line items. 
 
impairment of dispenser loans is reversed only to the extent of changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calcula-
tion

 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
financial support arrangements  
gn store nord grants loans to dispensers and acquires ownership interests in dispensers. the agreements are typically comprehensive, com-
plex and cover several aspects of the relationship between the parties. management assesses the recognition and classification of income and 
expenses for each of these agreements, including whether the agreement represent a discount on future sales. management also assesses 
whether current economic conditions and changes in customers' payment behavior could indicate impairment of the outstanding balances.  
 
ownership interests  
when considering whether or not gn hearing exercises significant influence in unlisted enterprises a number of judgments are made. these 
judgments include considering: 
• 
representation on the board of directors 
• 
participation in policy-making processes 
• 
material transactions between the entity and gn 
• 
interchange of managerial personnel

inventories 
inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the fifo-principle. inventories in gn hearing are measured at cost using the standard 
cost method. standard costs take into account normal levels of raw materials and consumables, staff costs, efficiency and capacity utilization. 
standard costs are reviewed regularly and adjusted in accordance with the fifo-principle. 
 
raw materials and goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising purchase price plus delivery costs. 
 
work in progress and finished goods are measured at cost, comprising the cost of direct materials, wages and salaries and indirect production 
overheads. indirect production overheads comprise indirect materials, wages and salaries, maintenance and depreciation of production ma-
chinery, buildings and equipment as well as factory administration and management. 
 
where the net realizable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value. the net realizable value of inventories is 
calculated as the sales amount less costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale   
 
 
 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
measurement of inventories 
the net realizable value of inventories is calculated based on the size of the inventory and decreases in the recoverable amount of purchased 
raw materials, technical obsolescence (e.g., faulty products), physical obsolescence (e.g. damaged products) and financial obsolescence (e.g., 
reduced demand or substituting products). gn store nord performs write-downs of inventories based on an individual assessment of products 
or product groups and expected product sales from 6 to 24 months following the balance sheet date

the total loss allowance of dkk 216 million is included in trade receivables at december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 150 million). gn store nord's 
assessment of credit risk associated with individual receivables depends primarily on aging, change in customer payment behavior, current 
economic conditions etc. as described in significant accounting estimates. 
 
no security has been pledged to gn store nord for trade receivables. 
 
 
 accounting policies 
measurement of trade receivables 
trade receivables are measured at amortized cost less expected lifetime credit losses. the expected loss rates are based on days past due and 
whether a receivable concerns a gn hearing or a gn audio customer. current expectations and estimates of expected credit losses are fur-
thermore based on change in customer behavior and current economic conditions. expected credit losses are based on an individual assess-
ment of each receivable and at portfolio level

if a customer’s financial condition deteriorates, further loss allowance may be required in future periods. in assessing the adequacy of expected 
credit losses, management specifically analyzes receivables, including doubtful debts, concentrations of credit risk, credit ratings, current eco-
nomic conditions and changes in customers’ payment behavior

warranty provisions concern products sold. the warranty provision covers any defects in design, materials and workmanship for a period of 1-4 
years from delivery and completion. provisions for right of return concern gns obligation to take back products sold to customers who has the 
right to return the product for credit. other provisions primarily consist of provisions for legal disputes, obligations regarding onerous con-
tracts and property leases.  
 
 
 accounting policies 
provisions 
warranty provisions are recognized as the underlying goods and services are sold based on warranty costs incurred in previous years and ex-
pectations of future costs. 
 
other provisions primarily comprise onerous contracts. provisions are recognized when, as a result of events before or at the balance sheet 
date, the group has a legal or a constructive obligation and it is probable that there may be an outflow of resources embodying economic ben-
efits to settle the obligation. on measurement of provisions, the costs required to settle the liability are discounted if the effect is material to 
the measurement of the liability.  
 
a provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract (onerous contracts). a provision for onerous contracts is recognized e.g. when 
the company has entered a binding legal agreement for the purchase of components from suppliers that exceeds the benefits from the ex-
pected future use of the components and the company can only sell the components at a loss   
 
 
 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
provisions 
warranty provisions are recognized based on historical and future warranty costs related to the group’s products. future warranty costs may 
differ from past practices and the level of costs. the amount recognized as a provision is management’s best estimate of the expenses re-
quired to settle the obligation.  
 
in accordance with gn store nord’s business policy, some products are supplied with a right of return. provisions for future returns of goods 
are recognized based on historical product returns data. the probability of future returns may differ from past practices.  
 
agreement has been made with a number of the suppliers that the suppliers purchase components for the production of hearing instruments 
and headsets based on sales estimates prepared by gn store nord. to the extent that gn store nord's actual purchases from suppliers are 
lower than sales estimates, gn store nord will be under an obligation to purchase any remaining components from the suppliers. manage-
ment assesses sales estimates on an ongoing basis, and to the extent that component inventories at suppliers are not expected to be used, gn 
store nord recognizes a provision for onerous purchase contracts

4.1  outstanding shares and treasury shares (continued) 
 
 accounting policies 
earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
earnings per share (eps) is calculated by dividing the profit for the year after tax by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the 
year. diluted earnings per share is calculated by increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding by the number of additional 
ordinary shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive shares were issued. the dilutive effect of outstanding share based payment is 
calculated using the treasury stock method. 
 
equity 
dividends 
the expected dividend payment for the year is disclosed as a separate item in equity. proposed dividends are recognized as a liability at the 
date they are adopted by the annual general meeting (declaration date). 
 
hedging reserve  
the hedging reserve includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of hedging transactions qualifying for hedge accounting. 
 
treasury shares 
treasury shares are recognized at cost. gains and losses on disposal of own shares are calculated as the difference between the purchase price 
measured in accordance with the fifo-principle and the selling price. gains or losses are recognized directly in retained earnings. dividends 
received from treasury shares are recognized directly in retained earnings. capital reductions from the cancellation of treasury shares are de-
ducted from the share capital at an amount corresponding to the nominal value of the shares. 
 
foreign exchange adjustments 
the translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements comprises foreign exchange differences arising on translation of financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies into the presentation currency used by gn store nord (dkk) and foreign 
exchange adjustments of balances considered to be part of the total net investment in foreign entities   
 
 
4.2  financial risks 
 
gn store nord is exposed to several financial risks arising from its operating, investing and financing activities, comprising currency risk, interest 
rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  financial risks are managed centrally by group treasury, except for commercial credit risk which is managed 
decentralized by the group’s operating businesses. the group’s treasury policy has been reviewed by the audit committee and approved by the 
board of directors.   
 
cash flow, liquid funds and debt are coordinated centrally to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the group. material financial risks are identified, 
managed and reported adequately. financial transactions are entered into only to mitigate risks from business activities or financing of the 
group. 
 
the areas exposed to financial risks are mainly cash and cash equivalents as well as loans and other financial indebtedness, the group’s income 
statement in financial income and expenses, the group’s cash flow through cash flow from financing activities and the group’s equity in other 
comprehensive income.  gn’s objectives, policies and process for measuring and managing the risk exposure to these items are summarized in 
the table and further explained in the notes below.

based on the current revenue and cost 
composition, the anticipated primary for-
eign exchange exposures for the group in 
2021 (excluding eur) are mainly arising 
from usd, gbp, jpy and aud, whereas 
other currencies on a stand-alone basis 
would not have a material impact. 
 
eur denominated financing carries fx re-
valuation risk. 
 
 
all hedging is conducted at group 
level. 
 
a minimum of 75% and not more than 
100% of the net currency exposure in 
each operating business  to maintain 
this hedging level at any point in time. 
 
eur denominated financing is hedged 
into dkk by natural hedging, through 
eur denominated assets or through 
foreign exchange derivatives. 
 
 
gn has hedged a substantial part of the 
expected net cash-flow in foreign curren-
cies to secure the ebita contribution of 
the material trading currencies for the 
next 12 months across both gn hearing 
and gn audio. 
 
gn is also monitoring the combined im-
pact of minor trading currencies and 
hedges those on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 
 
low risk 
 
 
 
 
interest rate 
risk 
 
a large part of the non-current financing 
carried fixed interest rates as of 31 decem-
ber 2020. 
 
 
 
at least 50% of all interest-bearing 
debt should be fixed in interest, either 
through fixed rate agreements or 
through derivative instruments. 
 
to mitigate the cash-flow risk from rising 
interest rates on its variable debt, gn will 
consider to  enter into  interest rate deriva-
tives to swap part of the floating debt into 
fixed-rate. 
 
 
 
low risk 
 
 
 
 
liquidity risk, 
funding, and 
capital  
structure 
 
gn’s net interest-bearing debt has 
decreased during 2020 to dkk 4,198 
million mainly driven through moderate 
growth with strong cash generation from 
normal operations which was off-set by 
investments,  dividend and share 
buyback.  the latest share buyback 
program was finalized in q1 2020. 
 
gn’s loans, bonds and revolving credit fa-
cilities are long-term with maturities be-
tween 2022 to 2025 with predominantly 
fixed and for a smaller potion variable in-
terest rates based on short term reference 
rates. 
 
 
gn’s cash flow, liquid funds and debt 
are coordinated centrally to ensure 
the solvency and liquidity of the 
group. 
 
to mitigate potential liquidity or refinanc-
ing risks, gn has access to a revolving 
credit facility of dkk 2,000 million (which 
can be upsized to dkk 4,000 million at the 
discretion of the lenders) as well as an ad-
ditional revolving credit facility of usd 
40 million.  at december 31, 2020 the re-
volving credit facilities were unutilized. 
 
gn has improved its maturity profile by re-
ducing short-term debt and has in 2020 
entered into a new eur 50 million loan 
maturing in 2025. 
 
 
financial 
credit risk 
 
 
low risk 
gn’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily 
from trade and other receivables.   
 
 
 
 
 
gn has established policies for credit 
risk management related to custom-
ers including the use of credit rating 
agencies. 
 
 
 
 
gn has decentralized the credit risk man-
agement relating to customer including 
the use of credit rating agencies to the  
divisions (gn hearing and gn audio).

4.2  financial risks (continued) 
 
foreign currency risk 
gn store nord has exposure towards foreign currencies exchange rate risk, mainly arising from the fluctuations of usd, in connection with 
commercial transactions. the general policy is to minimize gn store nord's currency exposure through natural matching of in- and out-flows 
to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby increasing the predictability of the financial results. 
additionally, the group uses approved hedging instruments, including currency derivatives such as fx spot, fx forward, fx swaps and fx 
option contracts, to protect the group’s ebita and free cash flow from adverse currency movements by determining the aggregate of the 
expected net cash flow 12 months forward and monetary balance sheet items. 
 
sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk 
the below sensitivity analysis illustrates the potential change in gn store nord’s profit or loss and equity in response to a weakening / 
strengthening of the currencies of which gn store nord has significant exposure to at the balance sheet date. this analysis assumes that all 
other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. at year-end an increase of 5% in the exchange rates would affect the income 
statement and equity as outlined in the table below:

the sensitivity analysis comprises cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, trade payables, current and non-current loans, intercompany 
balances and derivative exchange rate instruments as of december 31. the effects of a change in foreign exchange rates related to these 
items would be included in the income statement. a change in the value of derivative exchange rate instruments used for hedging would be 
included in other comprehensive income if hedge accounting is applied.  
the above exposure at year-end is not necessarily representative of the past or future exposure of the group. 
 
interest rate risk 
a large portion of gn store nord’s non-current debt has a fixed interest rate: listed instruments of eur 330 million bond-with-warrant-units 
0% and eur 220 million notes issued under the emtn program with 0.75% as well as bilateral loans with fixed and variable interest rates. 
 
the long-term debt with variable interest rate consist of a bilateral loan of nominal eur 100 million at short term rates plus margin.  
 
an increase of variable interest rates on the bank loans of 1 percentage point before considering the mitigating effect of the interest rate 
swaps would result in a net increase in the annual interest expenses of dkk 7 million (2019: dkk 15 million).

funding, liquidity and capital structure 
the group’s capital structure includes interest bearing long-term debt with maturities between 2022 and 2025, including bank loans, 
convertible bonds, notes under the euro medium term note (emtn) program and a drawing right attached to a dkk 2,000 million revolving 
credit facility and a usd 40 million short-term revolving facility, which on december 31, 2020 were unutilized. in addition, the group utilizes 
short-term uncommitted facilities from its main relationship banks as well as its euro commercial paper program which was utilized at eur 45 
million. 
 
in may 2019 gn store nord issued eur 330 million convertible bonds consisting of bond-with-warrant units. the bond-with-warrant units 
consists of senior unsecured zero coupon bonds due 2024 with detachable unsecured warrants expiring 2024. the bonds have a denomination 
of eur 100,000 per bond.

4.2  financial risks (continued) 
 
initially 5.2 million treasury shares are underlying the warrant units and those treasury shares will be kept to hedge the future obligations of 
gn store nord under the warrant units. the bonds carry no interest and will be redeemed at par at maturity, unless redeemed or purchased 
and cancelled earlier under their terms. 
 
any unit holder may, at any time until 2024, exercise a warrant unit and require gn to redeem the corresponding bond at its principal amount. 
gn does not expect to issue any new shares upon exercise of warrant units, but will deliver up to 5.2 million shares currently held in treasury, 
based on the initial strike price (dkk 473.8512), which is subject to adjustment from time to time upon certain customary events (anti-dilution 
clauses). the proceeds from the sale of these treasury shares at the initial strike price will amount to dkk 2,465 million corresponding to the 
nominal amount of the issued bonds of eur 330 million at the exchange rate at the time of pricing of dkk/eur 7.4684. 
 
in may 2019 gn store nord repurchased the eur 225 million convertible bonds consisting of bond-with-warrant units issued in 2017 and due 
in 2022. 
 
in december 2019 gn store nord issued eur 220 million eurobonds consisting of senior unsecured notes due 2023 under its newly 
established emtn program. the notes were issued at a price of 99.683% of the nominal amount with a fixed coupon of 0.750% per annum and 
have been listed on euronext dublin. the bonds have a denomination of eur 100,000 per bond. the bonds will be redeemed at par at 
maturity, unless redeemed earlier under their terms. gn store nord has an issuer call option and may redeem the bonds at a redemption 
margin of +0.250%. 
 
on december 31, 2020, gn store nord had an equity ratio of 31.0% (2019: 29.1%) and net interest-bearing debt of dkk 4,198 million (2019: 
dkk 5,303 million). gn has a long-term capital structure target of a net interest-bearing debt between one- and two-times ebitda. as of 
december 31, 2020 gn store nord had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of dkk 2,000 million (2019: dkk 2,000 million) and usd 40 
million (2019: 0). 
 
gn’s overall financial target is to deliver a competitive shareholder return through a combination of dividend payments and share price 
appreciation. gn aims to pay out a dividend corresponding to 15 - 25% of the annual net profit and to distribute additional excess cash to 
shareholders through share buyback programs. 
 
 
financial credit risk 
credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in cash and earnings if the customer is unable to pay its obligation in due time.  gn may incur losses 
if the credit quality of its customers deteriorates or if they default on their payment obligations to gn. gn’s exposure to credit risk arises pri-
marily from trade and other receivables.  such credit risk is managed decentralized through the divisions (gn hearing and gn audio).  assess-
ment of credit risks related to customers is further described in note 3.7 trade receivables and note 3.5 other non-current assets. 
 
surplus cash positions in gn store nord’s subsidiaries are centralized through group treasury if feasible, and cash is mainly held in current 
accounts or as short-term money market deposits. cash positions are primarily held with financial institutions through which gn store nord 
conducts its day-to-day banking transactions and which are highly rated with moody’s and standard & poor’s. gn store nord had cash and 
cash equivalents of dkk 1,657 million at december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 1,728 million).

in addition to the above, other non-current liabilities include a liability of dkk 150 million (2019: dkk 126 million) related to put options issued 
on shares held by non-controlling interests which is measured at fair value (fair value hierarchy level 3).  adjustments to the fair value are ac-
counted for as other equity transactions.

exchange rate instruments and interests rate swaps 
the fair value of the exchange rate instruments and interest rate swaps are determined using quoted forward exchange rates and forward 
interest rates, respectively at the balance sheet date and can be categorized as level 2 (observable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy. 
  
ownership interests 
the fair value of the ownership interests is based on a market approach model. the key input is market observations of sales prices of compa-
rable retail entities, combined with internal gn data such as number of sold hearing aids and the financial statements in which gn holds an 
interest. in the model, the ownership interests are divided into four groups of revenue multiple, according to the relative size and profitability 
of the dispensers. since most of the data is based on non-observable data, the model is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. the 
model is updated on a quarterly basis and any changes are reflected in the income statement or in other comprehensive income as applicable. 
the fair value models are sensitive to the dispenser’s financial performance for the last twenty-four months rolling on a quarterly basis.

4.3  financial instruments (continued) 
 
derivative financial instruments related to ownership interests 
derivative financial instruments related to ownership interests in dispensers of gn hearing products, are recognized in the balance sheet at fair 
value. the fair value model is based in a market approach model, using market observations of sales prices of comparable retail entities. the 
key inputs used are the number of hearing aid units sold by customer, average selling prices, and the estimated probability that the instru-
ments will be exercised. the fair value model is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, and is updated on a quarterly basis, and any 
material changes are reflected in the income statement. the fair value models are sensitive to the customers financial performance the last 
twelve months of any quarter and the probability of the instruments being exercised. 
 
rap, sip and dcp programs  
rap (retirement advantage plan) and sip (savings and investment plan) are programs in which customers earn funds based on purchases 
made. dcp (deferred compensation plan) is a program in which management in certain foreign subsidiaries may choose to defer compensa-
tion. the asset value is based on the fair value of the mutual fund investments, and the liability is based on the value generated by participant 
contributions, participant distributions, forfeitures, and investment earnings or losses. both asset and liabilities are categorized as level 2 in the 
fair value hierarchy.  each quarter gn receive a report regarding the fair value of the assets from a third-party contractor, and will update the 
financial statements according to this report.  
 
contingent consideration 
contingent consideration, resulting from business combinations, is valued at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business combina-
tion. the fair value is based on discounted cash flows and contractual terms of the contingent considerations and on non-observable inputs, 
such as the financial performance of the acquired enterprises. the key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each 
performance target and the discount factor.  contingent considerations are categorized as level 3 (unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierar-
chy.  the models are updated on a quarterly basis and any changes are reflected in the income statement. the fair value models are sensitive 
to the financial performance of the acquired enterprises, the probabilities of meeting the agreed objectives and the discount factor. 
 
fair value disclosures re. financial instruments at amortized cost 
based on observable inputs (fair value hierarchy level 2) the fair value of issued bonds (zero coupon) amounted to dkk 2,394 million at de-
cember 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 2,530 million), and the fair value of eurobonds amounted to dkk 1,673 million (2019: dkk 1,643 million). for 
other financial assets and liabilities, the fair value is approximately equal to the carrying amount. 
 
 
 accounting policies 
derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognized in the balance sheet at fair value. positive and negative fair values of 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as other receivables and payables, respectively. fair values of derivative financial instruments 
are computed on the basis of market data and generally accepted valuation methods.  
 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as a hedge of the fair value of a recog-
nized asset or liability are recognized in the income statement together with changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability as far as the 
hedged portion is concerned. changes in the portion of the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying as a cash 
flow hedge that is an effective hedge of changes in the value of the hedged item are recognized in other comprehensive income. if the hedged 
transaction results in gains or losses, amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred from equity to the same 
item as the hedged item. 
 
when a hedging instrument expires, or is terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any gains or losses 
previously recognized in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. when the forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to the income statement. 
 
for derivative financial instruments, where hedge accounting is not applied (economic hedges), changes in fair value are recognized in the 
income statement as either other operating income and costs, net or financial items.

4.3  financial instruments (continued) 
 
financial liabilities 
amounts owed to credit institutions and banks as well as the issued eurobonds are recognized at the date of borrowing at fair value of the 
proceeds received less transaction costs paid. in subsequent periods, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, corresponding to 
the capitalized value using the effective interest rate. accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognized in 
the income statement over the term of the loan. 
 
issued bond-with-warrant units are initially recognized at fair value less related transaction costs. the fair value of the bonds is estimated by 
calculating the present value of all contractual future cash flows using an interest rate for a bond with similar credit risk and duration as the 
issued bonds, but without the attached warrants. the difference between the fair value and the proceeds is considered to be the value of the 
warrants and is recognized in equity. the equity component is not re-measured subsequently. after initial recognition the bonds are measured 
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. by applying the effective interest method a constant interest rate is used to increase the 
carrying amount of the bonds and the difference between the carrying amount and the principal amount is in this way recognized as an inter-
est expense in financial expenses over the remaining term to maturity. in case the bonds are redeemed before maturity, the difference be-
tween the carrying amount at amortized cost and the principal amount will be recognized as a loss in financial expenses. 
 
other liabilities, comprising trade payables, amounts owed to associates as well as other payables, are measured at amortized cost

 accounting policies 
business combinations 
enterprises acquired or formed during the year are recognized in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or for-
mation. the acquisition date is the date when the parent company effectively obtains control of the acquired enterprise. enterprises disposed 
of are recognized in the consolidated income statement until the disposal date. the comparative figures are not restated for acquisitions. 
 
for acquisitions of new enterprises in which the parent company is able to exercise control over the acquired enterprise, the purchase method 
is used. the acquired enterprises’ identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. iden-
tifiable intangible assets are recognized if they are separable or arise from a contractual right. deferred tax on revaluations is recognized. 
 
any excess of the cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill under 
intangible assets. goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. the first impairment test is performed within the 
end of the acquisition year. upon acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units, which subsequently form the basis for the 
impairment test. goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign entity with another functional currency 
than the presentation currency used by gn store nord are treated as assets and liabilities belonging to the foreign entity and translated into 
the foreign entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate at the transaction date.  
 
the cost of a business combination comprises the fair value of the consideration agreed upon. when a business combination agreement pro-
vides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the amount of that adjustment is included in the cost of 
the combination if the adjustment is probable and can be measured in a reliable manner. subsequent changes to contingent considerations are 
recognized in the income statement. if uncertainties regarding measurement of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exist at 
the acquisition date, initial recognition will take place on the basis of preliminary fair values. if identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent lia-
bilities are subsequently determined to have different fair value at the acquisition date than first assumed, goodwill is adjusted up until twelve 
months after the acquisition. the effect of the adjustments is recognized in the opening balance of equity and the comparative figures are 
restated accordingly.

5.1  acquisition and divestment of companies and operations (continued) 
 
when acquiring a controlling interest in steps, gn store nord assesses the fair value of the acquired net assets at the time control is obtained. 
at such time, interests acquired previously are also adjusted to fair value. the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount is 
recognized in the income statement. 
 
acquisition of additional equity interest after a business combination is not accounted for using the acquisition method, but rather as equity 
transactions. disposals of equity interest while retaining control are also accounted for as equity transactions. transactions resulting in a loss 
of control result in a gain or loss being recognized in the income statement. 
 
when acquiring less than 100% of the shares in a company, gn store nord recognizes the goodwill on a transaction-by-transaction basis or as 
a proportion of goodwill in accordance with gn store nord’s ownership interest. 
 
in business combinations where put options have been issued regarding shares held by non-controlling interests the non-controlling interests 
are recognized initially. as long as the put options remain unexercised the non-controlling interests are updated at the end of each reporting 
period, including its share of allocations of profit or loss. the non-controlling interests are thereafter derecognized by recognizing a financial 
liability for the put options and the difference is included as an equity transaction. if the put options are exercised, the same treatment is ap-
plied up to the date of exercise. the amount recognized as the financial liability at that date, is extinguished by the payment of the exercise 
price. if the put option expires unexercised, the position is unwound so the non-controlling interest is recognized at the amount it would have 
been, had the put options never been issued. the financial liability is derecognized in equity

** in 2019 the former ceo of gn hearing, jakob gudbrand, was given a one-time sign-on bonus in the amount of dkk 7 million in connection with entering into his service agreement with 
gn. on september 20, 2019, jakob gudbrand informed the company that he needed to resign from his position as ceo of gn hearing for personal and family reasons. jakob gudbrand was 
given his base salary, car allowance, and the target bonus for the full duration of his notice period. 
***in 2019 other key management personnel remuneration includes remuneration to the former ceo of gn hearing anders hedegaard until april 30, 2019. 
 
share-based incentive plans 
the group's long-term equity-settled incentive program is specified and described in note 5.3 share-based incentive plans. 
 
executive management and board of directors remuneration 
the total remuneration of the executive management is based on the “general guidelines for incentive pay to management”, as adopted at 
gn´s annual general meeting. total salary (fixed salary, other benefits & bonus) of the executive management, decreased by 23% or dkk 
10.4 million from 2019 to 2020, partly driven by a dkk 7 million sign-on bonus to former ceo of gn hearing a/s, jakob gudbrand, in 2019. in 
light of the negative financial impact on the company of the covid-19 pandemic, executive management took a voluntary and temporary 
10% pay reduction on their base salary from may onwards (reinstated in october 2020). 
 
on september 30, 2020, gn announced that cfo of gn store nord, marcus desimoni, would step down as of december 31, 2020. as a good 
leaver of the company marcus desimoni remains entitled to his non-vested share-based incentives on the same terms, and these have been 
recognized as fully expensed in 2020. peter la cour gormsen, cfo of gn audio, was appointed new cfo of gn store nord, effective january 
1, 2021. 
 
the remuneration of the executive management is based on a fixed base salary and participation in gn store nord’s option- and warrant-
based long-term incentive programs. furthermore, the remuneration includes a yearly bonus plan with a target bonus of 50% of the base sal-
ary with a potential to underperform or outperform the target leading to an effective potential bonus range between 0 - 100% of the base 
salary. the executive management´s bonus is based on three parameters in light of the group's focus areas: 
 
• rené svendsen-tune’s bonus is subject to the performance of gn audio’s ebita, gn audio’s revenue and individual performance targets.  
• gitte pugholm aabo’s bonus is subject to the performance of gn hearing’s ebita, gn hearing’s revenue and individual performance targets.  
• marcus desimoni’s bonus is subject to the performance of gn store nord’s ebita, gn store nord’s revenue and individual performance 
targets.  
 
the group does not make pension contributions for members of the executive management. executive management has usual severance 
agreements and change-of-control agreements.

gn store nord a/s 
5.3  share-based incentive plans 
 
option and warrant programs 
gn store nord has an option-based and a warrant-based long-term equity-settled incentive program whereby the executive management and 
other employees in key positions are granted options and warrants linked to shares in gn store nord a/s, gn hearing a/s and gn audio a/s. 
for members of executive management the grant size can vary between 50-100% of their base salary. warrants and options are granted at no 
consideration.  
 
calculation of share price for gn hearing a/s and gn audio a/s 
the 2019 and 2020 option programs are based on gn store nord a/s shares, whereas the warrant programs for 2015-2018 are based on gn 
hearing a/s and gn audio a/s shares. on a quarterly basis the share price for gn hearing a/s and gn audio a/s is calculated, using a top-
down approach based on analysis of external broker reports for the allocation of gn store nord a/s’ share price into gn hearing, gn audio 
and other. this calculation is also the basis for the black-scholes valuation as stated below regarding valuation of warrants.   
 
vesting conditions and exercise of warrants 
the 2015-2018 warrant programs are incentive programs with a three-year vesting period from the grant date. warrants vest when a set of 
criteria are met: the share price of gn store nord has increased and the share price of gn hearing a/s and gn audio a/s has outperformed a 
peer group index of competitors and industry indices, as defined by the board of directors of gn hearing and gn audio, respectively. vested 
warrants may be exercised during a four-week exercise window opening each quarter for a three-year period after vesting. the quarterly four-
week exercise window will open following the release of an external valuation report concerning the value of the shares of gn hearing a/s 
and gn audio a/s. 
 
vesting conditions and exercise of options 
the 2019 and 2020 programs are long-term incentive programs with a three-year vesting period from the grant date. the programs include a 
performance multiplier, based on revenue growth and ebitda improvement relative to a broad peer group of comparable companies.  this 
means, that after the three-year vesting period, the initial share option grant can either increase, decrease or stay the same, depending on gn’s 
performance relative to a peer group. the maximum effect of the performance multiplier is to increase the number of options by a factor of 2. 
for executive management the gross return on each annual grant is capped at a value equal to four times the annual base salary at the time of 
grant. vested options may be exercised at any time outside black-out periods for a three-year period after vesting.  
 
valuation model and assumptions 
the market value of the warrants and options are calculated using the principles of the black-scholes option pricing model. for the 2015-2018 
warrants the model has taken the overperformance criteria into account using monte carlo simulation. the market values of options granted 
during the year are based on the underlying market prices at the grant dates.  
 
the following assumptions were applied for the calculation of the market value at the grant date of gn store nord a/s options:

for 2019 and 2020 the grants are based on options and the fair value includes any market vesting conditions.  
* volatility is estimated by external experts, and is calculated based on data from a historical period matching the expected time to expiry of the options 
** risk-free interest rate is estimated by external experts and based on the zero yield curve derived from danish government bonds with maturity equal to the expiry of the options 
*** the fair value includes any market vesting conditions.  
**** for 2019, the number of options and total market value for executive management have been impacted by grants to both jakob gudbrand and gitte pugholm aabo, of which 77,200 
options have been forfeited in 2019. executive management have been granted a number of options with a value equal to the same percentage of their base salary as was granted in the 
previous program.

 accounting policies 
share-based incentive plans 
the executive management and a number of key employees are included in share-based incentive plans (equity-settled plans). for equity-
settled programs, the warrants and options are measured at the fair value at the grant date and recognized in the income statement as a staff 
cost of the respective functions over the vesting period. the counter item is recognized in equity. on initial recognition, an estimate is made of 
the number of warrants and options expected to vest. this estimate is subsequently revised for changes in the number of warrants and options 
expected to vest. accordingly, recognition is based on the number of warrants and options that are ultimately vested. the fair value of granted 
warrants and options is estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating 
the fair value of the warrants and options

5.4  pension obligations (continued) 
 
at the balance sheet date the actuarial calculations for the prevailing american defined benefit plan are based on a discount rate of 2,25% 
(2019: 3%). 
 
a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate will result in a dkk 10 million increase in the defined benefit obligation and a 25 basis point in-
crease will result in a dkk 10 million decrease in the defined benefit obligation. 
 
defined contribution plans 
the group has pension commitments regarding certain groups of employees in denmark and abroad. pension plans are generally defined con-
tribution plans. the pension plans are funded by current payments to independent pension funds and insurance companies, which are responsi-
ble for payment of the pension benefits. when contributions to defined contribution plans have been paid, the group has no further commit-
ments to present or former employees. contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement when they are 
due. 
 
defined benefit plans 
the group has an american pension plan, which is not covered by payments to insurance companies but is partly off-set by the fair value of 
reserved pension funds. at july 1, 2003, the pension plan was frozen, meaning that employees covered by the plan will continue to be entitled 
to the pension payments earned up to this date. however, employees will not earn further pension payments.  
 
 
 accounting policies 
pensions 
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period to which they relate and any contributions 
outstanding are recognized in the balance sheet as other payables. 
 
defined benefit plans are subject to an annual actuarial estimate of the present value of future benefits under the defined benefit plan. the 
present value is determined on the basis of assumptions about the future development in variables such as salary levels, interest rates, infla-
tion and mortality. the present value is determined only for benefits earned by employees from their employment with the group. the actuar-
ial present value less the fair value of any plan assets is recognized in the balance sheet under pension obligations. pension costs for the year 
are recognized in the income statement based on actuarial estimates and financial expectations at the beginning of the year. any difference 
between the expected development in plan assets and the defined benefit obligation and actual amounts results in actuarial gains or losses. 
actuarial gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income

chases from suppliers, gn store nord is under an obligation to purchase any remaining components from the suppliers.

pected to be used, gn store nord recognizes a provision for onerous purchase contracts.

5.5  contingent liabilities (continued) 
 
pending litigations and disputes 
gn store nord and its subsidiaries are parties to pending litigations, claims and disputes arising out of the normal conduct of their business 
including various cases involving patent infringements. while provisions that management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been 
made for probable losses, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates. gn store nord does not expect the pending litigations and 
claims to have a material impact on gn store nord’s financial position, operating profit or cash flows in addition to the amounts recognized as 
provisions for legal disputes. 
 
 
 significant accounting estimates and judgments 
provisions, contingencies and litigations 
gn store nord’s management assesses provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities and the likely outcome of pending or threaten-
ing litigations and claims on an ongoing basis. the outcome depends on future events that are by nature uncertain. in assessing the likely out-
come of litigations, claims and tax disputes, etc., management bases its assessment on external legal assistance and decided cases

the parent company’s leases mainly consist of property leases of e.g. offices but also include cars and office equipment. rental contracts are 
typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. in such cases 
the consideration in the contract is allocated to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. lease terms 
are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

aries is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according to the equity method.

report on the audit of the financial statements 
 
our opinion 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the group’s 
and the parent company’s financial position at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the group’s and the parent company’s operations 
and cash flows for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in accordance with international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements in the danish financial statements act. 
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report to the audit committee and the board of directors. 
what we have audited 
the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of gn store nord a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020, pp 56-127 comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in 
equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies for the group as well as for the parent com-
pany. collectively referred to as the “financial statements”. 
 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements applicable in den-
mark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report.   
 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
independence 
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants’ code of ethics for profes-
sional accountants (iesba code) and the additional requirements applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibili-
ties in accordance with the iesba code.   
 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not 
provided.  
appointment 
we were first appointed auditors of gn store nord a/s on 21 march 2019 for the financial year 2019. we have been reappointed in 2020 by 
shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of two years including the financial year 2020.

key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 
2020. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
 
key audit matter 
how our audit addressed the key audit matter 
pre-paid discounts and dispenser loans (financial support ar-
rangements) 
 
the group provides financial support arrangements to certain 
of its customers, primarily in the us. the financial support con-
sists of providing pre-paid discounts and loans (dispenser 
loans). 
 
the financial support arrangements are complex due the multi-
ple and complex contract elements where the accounting 
treatment and assessment of the recoverability includes judge-
ments and assumptions.  
 
we focused on this area because of the significant impact on 
the consolidated financial statements and the multiple and 
complex contract elements in the arrangements.  
 
refer to note 3.5 in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
we assessed whether the group’s accounting policies are in accordance 
with ifrs. 
 
we selected a sample of contracts related to financial support arrange-
ments and evaluated classification of the individual elements of the con-
tracts. 
 
we examined the principles for recognition and valuation of loans and 
pre-paid discounts by obtaining external confirmations of outstanding 
balances. we examined the principles for amortisation of pre-paid dis-
counts and recalculated the amortisation schedule. 
 
we evaluated and challenged management’s assessment of valuation 
and impairment of financial support arrangements based on an assess-
ment of recoverability and history of payments. 
 
 
capitalisation and valuation of development costs 
 
the group capitalises development costs within both the hear-
ing and audio segment when certain criteria according to ifrs 
are met.  
 
the criteria for recognition and measurement of development 
costs is subject to management’s judgement and assumptions, 
which is uncertain by nature.   
 
completed development projects are assessed quarterly for 
impairment indications. for in-progress development projects 
impairment tests are performed quarterly. the impairment 
tests are based on strategy plan approved by management and 
value-in-use calculations based on expected future cash flows. 
 
we focused on this area because the criteria for recognition 
and measurement of development projects are subject to man-
agement judgements and assumptions.  
 
refer to note 3.1 in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
we assessed whether the group’s accounting policies are in accordance 
with ifrs. 
 
we selected a sample of in-progress development projects and consid-
ered whether all criteria described in ifrs were met as basis for capitali-
sation. we assessed relevant internal controls and performed substantive 
audit procedures to verify capitalised amounts. 
 
we evaluated and challenged management’s assessment of impairment 
indicators of completed development projects based on the commercial 
prospects of the projects. 
 
for in-progress development projects, we challenged the key assump-
tions applied in the value-in-use calculations. our work was based on our 
understanding of the business cases and key assumptions applied. we 
challenged whether the intent to finalise the projects remain and 
whether the projects are expected to generate future economic benefits 
exceeding the carrying values. 
 
statement on management’s report 
management is responsible for management’s report, pp 1-55. 
 
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management’s report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. 
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management’s report and, in doing so, consider 
whether management’s report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.

gn store nord a/s 
moreover, we considered whether management’s report includes the disclosures required by the danish financial statements act.  
 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, management’s report is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatement in management’s report. 
 
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial state-
ments that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggre-
gate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:  
• 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s internal control. 
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
management. 
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may 
cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde-
pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independ-
ence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the pub-
lic interest benefits of such communication.

as part of our audit of the financial statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of gn store 
nord a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file name gnst-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the european single electronic format (esef regulation) which 
includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
management is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility includes: 
• 
the preparation of the annual report in xhtml format; 
• 
the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, including extensions to the esef taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to ele-
ments in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary; 
• 
ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and 
• 
for such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the 
esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. the nature, timing and extent of 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements 
set out in the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error. the procedures include: 
• 
testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml format; 
• 
obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process; 
• 
evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial statements; 
• 
evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl elements selected from the esef taxonomy and the creation of extension 
elements where no suitable element in the esef taxonomy has been identified;  
• 
evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the esef taxonomy; and  
• 
reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements. 
in our opinion, the annual report of gn store nord a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file name gnst-2020-
12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the esef regulation.
