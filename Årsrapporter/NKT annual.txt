based on favourable 
megatrends and our strong 
technology positions, we expect 
both the power cables and the 
photonics businesses represent 
significant mid-term financial  
growth potential.
nkt runs all its power cable 
factories on renewable energy 
saving annually over 48,000 
tonnes of co2. 
this is reducing nkt's  
co2-emissions from energy 
consumption by 72%.

positive and 
sustainable 
transformation
we will turn another page 
in the long life of nkt in 
2021. we celebrate 130 year 
anniversary with promising 
market growth prospects.
these are challenging times for us as 
human beings, for our societies and the 
world economy. we strive to find purpose 
and to define the future ‘new normal’ 
once the covid-19 pandemic is defeated. 
in 2021, nkt celebrates its 130 year anni-
versary. our long history has provided us 
with robustness, experience and persis-
tence. these qualities proved to be key to 
succeed and deliver an improved financial 
performance in the past year. combined 
with innovation, these will also be the 
foundation for the expected growth of our 
businesses in the coming years. 
megatrends such as green transfor-
mation, growing and aging population, 
increased technological complexity, 
urbanisation, and electrification continue 
to guide the development of our societies.
in particular, the green agenda in terms of 
climate change, remained a key prior-
ity on the political scene and with our 
customers during 2020. nkt is well-po-
sitioned to contribute to the drive towards 
renewable energy aimed at reducing car-
bon footprint. this is to gain further pace 
in the coming years. in 2020, nkt also 
signed up for the science based target 
initiative to become a net-zero emissions 
company.
leading technologies to provide 
mid-term growth ambitions
both our power cables and photonics  
businesses are among the market leaders 
with innovative and technological complex 
solutions for our customers. our businesses 
demonstrated this position in 2020.
nkt’s record high-voltage order backlog 
of eur 3.07bn at end-2020 was driven by 
our strong position within dc technology, 
 
annual report 2020 | nkt a/s | 5
letter from chairman
which was significantly strengthened 
by our acquisition of abb hv cables in 
2017. the backlog increase came from 
more large order wins including two of 
the german high-voltage dc corridor 
projects that will provide renewable 
energy produced in e.g. the north sea to 
the southern parts of germany, replacing 
nuclear energy and fossil fuel. further 
high-voltage dc orders for offshore wind 
farms in northern europe underlined 
nkt’s position as an important contribu-
tor to the green transformation.
our photonics business supplies leading 
technology to customers and growing 
markets within innovate industries such 
as autonomous electric cars, smart-
phones, quantum computing, artificial in-
telligence, stem cell and cancer research, 
and renewable energy. 
despite significant negative impact from 
the covid-19 pandemic, nkt photonics 
continued to strengthen its commercial 
position by for example supplying lasers 
to power microscopes in detection of 
cancer cells.  
based on favourable megatrends and 
our strong technology positions, we 
expect both the power cables and the 
photonics businesses to hold significant 
mid-term financial growth potential. we 
therefore also announced the expansions 
of our high-voltage power cable plants 
in sweden and germany. investments 
in our people and our facilities will keep 
our technology relevant and competitive 
across our businesses and are key ele-
ments in our future success.  
the board of directors was therefore 
pleased to see that the two capital 
increases totalling net proceeds of 
eur 259m were well-received by our 
shareholders. we appreciate the con-
tinued support and belief in nkt as an 
attractive investment. 
the announced strategic review of nkt 
photonics to maximise value creation was 
“ based on favourable megatrends and our 
strong technology positions, we expect both 
the power cables and the photonics businesses 
represent significant mid-term financial 
growth potential”
not finalized in 2020. we intend to resume 
the review when the business and finan-
cial performance is no longer materially 
affected by the pandemic.
people, leadership and collaboration 
are reasons to success
our employees throughout the company 
deserve a special thanks for managing 
the situation in a year with covid-19 
related challenges. our production sites 
were kept in operation and at the same 
time our future was strengthened by win-
ning new key projects. this was achieved 
on top of the daily task of continuously 
improving our businesses.
we also believe in strong leadership 
and collaboration to be instrumental for 
success and a key reason for this year’s 
achievements. in august 2020, line 
fandrup joined nkt a/s as cfo and to-
gether with ceo alexander kara she now 
constitutes our executive management. 
we would also like to thank our share-
holders, customers and business part-
ners for their continuous support. this 
year has called for even more alignment, 
flexibility and creativity – and together we 
have built an even stronger foundation for 
our future relations.

nkt group improved 
financial results in 2020. 
the operational ebitda 
was eur 59.3m, a doubling 
compared to 2019. improved 
performance in the power 
cable business was the main 
driver.
 
better financial performance in nkt
nkt delivered improved revenue and 
earnings in 2020 with contributions from all 
three business lines. solutions' execution 
of recent years’ high-voltage order awards, 
and applications' turn-around of its finan-
cial performance were main contributors. 
2020 was the best-ever year for nkt 
in terms of high-voltage order intake. a 
total of eur 2.3bn high-voltage projects 
was awarded, that will contribute to the 
ongoing european transition towards 
increased renewables energy genera-
tion. the largest project awards were 
suedlink and suedostlink in germany, 
long-distance power lines to transmit 
renewable energy from north to south.
nkt photonics impacted by 
pandemic
in nkt photonics, organic growth 
was negative in 2020 as the industrial 
segment was impacted by the covid-19 
pandemic, which could not be offset by 
positive development in medical & life 
science. the board of directors intends 
to resume the strategic review of nkt 
photonics when the business and finan-
cial performance is no longer materially 
affected by the covid-19 pandemic 
and the general economic situation. the 
objectives are to maximize value creation, 
and position nkt photonics for long-term 
growth.
reduction in debt level
in 2020, the net interest-bearing debt 
improved by eur 268m to eur -25.9m 
at end-2020, driven primarily by the pro-
ceeds from the issuance of new shares in 
2020. combined with increased earnings, 
net interest-bearing debt relative to 
operational ebitda amounted to -0.4x at 
end-2020. 
improvement expected in 2021 
the improved financial performance is ex-
pected to continue in 2021. nkt expects 
a revenue* of approx. eur 1.1–1.2bn and 
an operational ebitda of approx. eur 
80–110m. nkt photonics expects organ-
ic revenue growth of approx. 0–10% and 
an ebitda margin of approx. 3–7%.

driven by solutions and service & acces-
sories, nkt increased revenue* to eur 
269m in q4 2020 from eur 262m in the 
same period of 2019. this corresponded 
to organic growth of 1%. nkt thereby 
reported improved revenue in all four 
quarters in 2020. 
the growth in revenue benefitted 
profitability, with all three business lines 
delivering improved earnings in q4 2020 
compared to q4 2019. the operational 
ebitda amounted to eur 9.1m in q4 
2020, up from eur 1.2m in q4 2019, 
equal to a margin* improvement of 
3%-points.

2020 was an unusual year for nkt pho-
tonics with negative market impact due to 
the covid-19 pandemic. in 1st half 2020, 
the revenue decreased, but stabilized 
in q3 and this continued into the final 
quarter. 
as in previous years, nkt photonics real-
ized its strongest performance in the final 
quarter, with revenue rising to eur 25.9m 
in q4 2020 from eur 25.5m in q4 2019. 
this development was largely as expect-
ed, corresponding to the midpoint of the 
forecast in the most recently announced 
financial outlook. 
nkt photonics’ financial performance in 
q4 2020 continued to be impacted by 
the covid-19 pandemic, with demand 
remaining subdued in parts of the 
industrial market due to restrictions and 
closedowns. however, the negative trend 
in industrial was offset by growth in the 
medical & life science segment.  
nkt photonics delivered ebitda of 
eur 4.2m in q4 2020, compared to 
eur 7.2m in q4 2019. the development 
was partly due to an increased cost base 
driven by preparation for future growth 
opportunities. profitability was further 
negatively impacted by the customer 
mix and by temporary yield inefficiencies 
associated with a shift to high-volume 
customers. 
solutions generated organic growth of 
6% in q4 2020. as in the previous quar-
ters of 2020, the positive development 
in revenue was driven by higher factory 
output based on the orders awarded over 
recent years. during q4 2020, nkt pro-
gressed projects across various power 
cable segments, and nkt victoria was 
utilized for installation purposes. 
in applications, the revenue development 
took a negative turn in q4 2020 and 
organic growth was -8%. the conse-
quences of the covid-19 pandemic were 
visible in some markets, such as sweden 
and denmark, leading to negative growth, 
and in germany, nkt was up against a 
strong comparison figure. despite the 
reduction in revenue, nkt improved 
earnings compared to q4 2019, driven 
by a positive change in product mix and 
continued focus on cost and production 
efficiencies.  
service & accessories continued driving 
positive revenue development, delivering 
11% organic growth in q4 2020. this 
growth was based on improved sales 
across the service and accessories 
businesses. on the service side, a large 
turnkey offshore repair was completed, 
and a higher level of activity was recorded 
in the onshore maintenance business. 
accessories benefitted from increased 
production output, and growth was driven 
by improved sales to the middle east and 
scandinavia.

financial review q4 2020
financial performance versus outlook 2020
the financial performance 
of both nkt and nkt 
photonics in 2020 was 
in line with the financial 
outlook published in 
november 2020. 
nkt
the financial outlook released in novem-
ber 2020 specified both the expected 
revenue and the expected operation-
al ebitda for the year. the realized 
revenue* was eur 1,087m, which was 
consistent with the outlook of around 
eur 1.1bn. and the operational ebitda, 
for which the forecast was in the upper 
end of approx. eur 40–60m, ended in 
line with this at eur 56.7m. 
the initial financial outlook announced at 
the beginning of 2020 was based on four 
main assumptions:
 
■
satisfactory execution on projects in 
the high-voltage order backlog
nkt photonics
the financial performance of nkt pho-
tonics for 2020 ended at the midpoint of 
the financial outlook published in october 
2020, but was below the outlook provid-
ed at the start of the year. the year was 
impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, 
which caused parts of the market to slow 
and created unusually high uncertainty. 
this meant that the financial outlook was 
withdrawn for five months during 2020. 
as expected, the primary contributor to 
revenue growth in 2020 was the medical 
& life science segment, while aerospace 
& defence saw moderate growth and 
industrial was negatively impacted by the 
covid-19 pandemic. the market situa-
tion stabilized for nkt photonics in 2nd 
half 2020, when revenue was slightly up 
compared to the same period of 2019.

orders with some financial impact in 
2020
 
■

financial performance versus outlook
nkt 
2021
nkt’s financial outlook for 2021 was 
already published in the q3 2020 interim 
report released in november 2020 and 
remains unchanged. 
revenue (in std. metal prices) is expect-
ed to be approx. eur 1.1–1.2bn and the 
operational ebitda is expected to be 
approx. eur 80–110m in 2021. this is a 
continuation of the growth achieved in 
2020. 
the targeted improvement in revenue 
and earnings compared to 2020 is mainly 
expected to be driven by solutions.
delivering on the financial outlook is 
based on several assumptions. the most 
critical are:
 
■
the global covid-19 pandemic and 
consequences thereof will not have 
material negative impact on the mar-
kets nkt is operating in or on nkt’s 
ability to execute customers’ orders
 
■
satisfactory execution of high-voltage 
projects to deliver on expected profit-
ability margin
 
■
award of additional high-voltage pro-
jects with financial impact in 2021
 
■
continued profitability improvement 
in applications driven by increased 
revenue and improved production 
efficiency
 
■
satisfactory offshore power cable 
repair work activity
medium-term ambitions
in its q3 2020 interim report, nkt also 
introduced medium-term ambitions. the 
underlying assumptions and the ambi-
tions remain unchanged. 
the ambition is to grow revenue* organ-
ically from 2019 (eur 945m) to the me-
dium-term by a cagr above 10% and to 
increase the operational ebitda margin* 
to approx. 10-14%.
to achieve the targeted medium-term 
financial ambitions, nkt has to perform 
satisfactorily in its three business lines. 
additionally, the covid-19 pandemic is 
assumed not to impact financial perfor-
mance materially.
in solutions, nkt needs to continuously 
be successful in relevant high-voltage 
project tenders across market segments 
and to ensure the projects awarded will 
be based on satisfactory terms and con-
ditions. order wins will be a prerequisite 
to have optimal utilization of production

tion efficiency and control of the cost 
level. to support profitability further, nkt 
is focusing on having the relevant product 
portfolio available and targeting the most 
attractive market segments.
in service & accessories, the overall 
focus area is to maintain growth momen-
tum. this will be achieved through various 
initiatives such as geographical expansion 
in new and existing markets. furthermore, 
the portfolio of products and services 
is continuously being expanded with a 
broader customer offering.

financial outlook nkt
nkt photonics 
2021
the organic revenue growth is expected to 
be approx. 0-10%, and the ebitda margin 
is expected to be approx. 3-7%.
nkt photonics initiated and completed a 
fte reduction exercise in january 2021. 
redundancy costs of around eur 1.5m 
will be expensed in 2021 and is part of the 
above outlook.
the financial outlook is subject to high 
uncertainty given the unknown develop-
ment of the covid-19 pandemic, which 
impacted some parts of the market nega-
tively in 2020. the pandemic is expected 
to continue impacting the market in 1st 
half 2021, while a more normalized market 
picture being anticipated later in the year. 
the forecasted positive revenue devel-
opment is assumed to be driven by the 
medical & life science segment with 
product launches and an anticipated at-
tractive market development. in industrial 
and aerospace & defence, more moderate 
growth is expected. industrial particularly 
was impacted by the covid-19 pandemic 
in 2020 that weakened market demand, 
and the pandemic is also expected to slow 
down parts of the market in 2021. 
as in previous years, the largest earnings 
contribution is expected to be generated 
in q4.

letter from the ceo 
nkt accelerated  
its role in connecting 
a greener world
2020 was a successful 
year in which our 
contribution to the 
green transformation 
gained speed 
we won high-voltage orders worth eur 
2.3bn in 2020. not only was this the larg-
est amount in nkt’s history, it was also 
driven by our world-leading high-voltage 
dc technology. across our business-
es we are well positioned to grasp the 
opportunities created by the green 
transformation. with the ongoing global 
expansion of power grids, electrification 
and e-mobility, the need for our products 
will continue to grow. 
it was satisfactory to see that in 2020 we 
were able to improve financial perfor-
mance in all our business lines and grow 
earnings. in our ambition to connect a 
greener world this is a good platform for 
the future.
i am proud of these accomplishments 
in a year where a key focus was also to 
steer nkt safely through the covid-19 
pandemic. across 2020, our priorities 
remained the same: to keep our people 
safe and ensure business continuity. i am 
grateful that due to early implementation 
of preventive measures, combined with 
flexibility and vigilance among our people, 
suppliers and customers, we have coped 
well and seen only modest impact. 
our purpose "we connect a greener 
world" reflects our role in the green 
transformation 
nkt plays a key role in the global 
transformation to renewable energy and 
increased electrification of society. the 
power infrastructure – the grid system - 
that transports electricity from the energy 
source to the socket outlet in our home, 
requires power cable solutions, accesso-
ries and services. our strong contribution 
to the green transformation is reflected 
in our revised company purpose, “we 
connect a greener world”, which was 
launched in 2020. 
all our power cable
factories run on green
electricity reducing

we also take responsibility for our own 
impact on climate change. accordingly, 
we are the first major power cable manu-
facturer to sign up to the science based 
target initiative with the aim of becoming 
a net-zero emissions company. already 
now nkt has committed to reducing its 
own greenhouse gas emissions by an 
average of 5% annually. 
record high-voltage order intake, 
and investments in future growth
the approx. eur 1.5bn order awards 
for two german interconnector projects, 
suedlink and suedostlink in 2020, 
marked a historic moment for nkt.  
these awards underline the potential 
which high-voltage dc technology has 
for both the interconnector and offshore 
wind markets in the years ahead. the 
same technology was also in demand for 
the majority of our other significant order 
awards in germany and the uk in 2020. i 
was also delighted that we were awarded 
our first project in the mediterranean, 
an area which represents good growth 
opportunities for nkt.
the orders awarded to nkt for the ger-
man interconnector projects also meant 
we took a strategically important step 
forward in 2020. in the period 2020-2022 
we are investing to expand our high-volt-
age plants in sweden and germany to 
execute on these orders and to prepare 
the way for future growth opportunities.    
confirmed turnaround in 
applications, and continued growth 
in service & accessories
applications is on the right track to regain 
satisfactory profitability in the future, 
while continued focus on productivity, 
product mix, production footprint and 
cost efficiency remain fundamental. in 
2020, earnings improved despite negative 
covid-19 impact on demand in certain 
markets. 
the service & accessories business 
line continued to perform, delivering 
double-digit organic growth. service ben-
efitted from our 10-day vessel guarantee 
to ensure faster repair of offshore power 
cable lines, while accessories started 
building its two excellence hubs in ger-
many and sweden to prepare for execu-
tion of the high-voltage dc interconnector 
projects and for future growth.
satisfactory financial performance 
and strategy execution
overall, nkt’s financial performance in 
2020 was in line with our expectations, 
with revenue and earnings even finishing 
at the high end of the outlook published 
at the start of the year. while the financial 
performance remained below the level of 
our medium-term ambitions, we firmly be-
lieve that we are on track to deliver further 
financial improvements. this is expected 
to be driven mainly by delivering strong 
execution, remaining cost-conscious, and 
exploiting the opportunities created by 
the green transformation. 
our 2020 achievements and our trajec-
tory towards further strengthening our 
“ nkt plays a key role in the global 
transformation to renewable energy and 
increased electrification of society. at nkt, 
we connect a greener world”
financial platform for the future are out-
lined in our renew strategy which began 
rollout in 2020. execution of this strategy 
is progressing to plan. 
2021 ambitions: we advance, 
connect, deliver and care
in the past year, we also updated our 
shared beliefs. combined with our pur-
pose, these shared beliefs set out why we 
are here and how we want to progress 
going forward.  our four shared beliefs, 
we advance, we connect, we deliver, 
and we care, express the commitment 
and ambitions which i and my colleagues 
in the group leadership team have for 
2021 and beyond.  
i would like to thank all our people, 
suppliers, customers and shareholders 
for a truly extraordinary year and for their 
continued good collaboration. together, 
we connect a greener world.

provides a broad range of solutions for off- and onshore 
power transmission systems, and supplies both ac and 
dc power cables. further, nkt offers complete and 
customized end-to-end turnkey solutions, including full 
installation services.
nkt has two high-voltage production facilities in germa-
ny and sweden. centrally situated in the north european 
market, these sites have sea and river access. this 
enables convenient and efficient logistics for offshore 
solutions around the world as well as ideal access to 
onshore opportunities in europe. these production sites, 
combined with nkt’s installation expertise and dedicat-
ed cable-laying vessel, make nkt a leading company in 
the high-voltage interconnector, offshore wind, and oil & 
gas segments. 
applications
offers a broad range of low- and medium-voltage power 
cable solutions. nkt markets high-quality products that 
conform to regulatory requirements and high customer 
expectations and has developed ergonomic solutions 
that are easy to install. these solutions are important 
contributors to the ongoing electrification of societies. 
telecom power cables are also developed and marketed 
with a view to addressing future opportunities in the roll-
out of 5g mobile networks.
applications has five main production sites located in the 
czech republic, denmark, poland and sweden. nkt 
holds strong positions in these markets. further, nkt is 
relatively well placed in other european markets, such as 
germany and norway. the proximity of the production 
sites to the markets are important to ensure fast delivery 
and cost-efficient solutions.
service & accessories 
supplies off- and onshore power cable services and 
offers a full portfolio of power cable accessories across 
the medium- and high-voltage categories.
the service business focuses on servicing high-voltage 
power cables. these generally require limited mainte-
nance, but unfortunate events will occur due to external 
damage caused by anchor drag, excavation works, etc. 
this can lead to power cable failures. to avoid such 
events and to shorten potential downtime, monitor-
ing solutions and rapid response are in demand. nkt 
provides these services from teams based in denmark, 
germany and sweden.
accessories are critical components in any power cable 
system. in the high-voltage market, nkt’s technological 
competence is key as only a few suppliers can match 
the requirements that accessories must deliver. nkt 
provides market support for accessories from three 
production sites in germany and sweden.

market overview
market overview
high-voltage power cable market
the solutions business line 
operates in the global high-
voltage power cable market. 
the market mainly encompasses com-
plex projects that are engineered-to-order 
and demand a high level of expertise 
for successful implementation. in some 
cases these projects even call for new 
r&d solutions as well as investment in 
both technology and production assets. 
as a project-driven segment, revenue 
and earnings streams are affected by the 
number and size of project awards in the 
market, and may therefore fluctuate over 
time.
the high-voltage segment can be divided 
into two categories with slightly differing 
characteristics depending on technologi-
cal solution and market dynamics: 
1.  high-voltage dc onshore/offshore 
and ac offshore power cable systems 
are primarily used in off-/onshore 
interconnector, offshore wind, and oil 
& gas projects. the recently awarded 
german corridor projects fall within 
this category. the increasing reliance 
on renewable energy means that more 
efficient, better connected and flexible 
power grids are required to offset peri-
ods when power generation is limited in 
some areas. 
2.  high-voltage ac onshore power cable 
systems are relevant for projects with 
voltages above 72kv used primarily 
for power transmission. the trend 
towards renewable power generation 
has increased the distance between 
the point of production and the point 
of consumption, as well as upgrade of 
existing power grids for the continuing 
urbanization and general electrification 
of societies.
the demand for high-voltage offshore 
ac power cable systems has declined in 
recent years due to the trend in the north 
sea region of moving offshore wind parks 
further from shore. over longer distances 
high-voltage dc technology offers better 
performance, and this has been reflected 
in a meaningful shift in volume from ac to 
dc in the last couple of years. while ac 
technology is expected to continue losing 
share to dc within some markets, there 
will be other emerging markets calling for 
traditional ac technology. nkt estimates 
the size of the ac offshore market oppor-
tunity to be above eur 2bn, based on the 
tenders expected to come to market over 
the next five years.
significant increase in market value 
in 2020
driven particularly by the german corridor 
projects, the value of project awards in 
the high-voltage power cable market was 
significantly higher in 2020 than in previous 
high-voltage onshore power 
cables being installed

years. management estimates that the to-
tal award level in the market (addressable 
high-voltage power cable projects larger 
than eur 5m each) amounted to around 
eur 6bn.
the majority of these project awards were 
dc technology, as they predominantly 
related to interconnector power cable 
projects and offshore wind export power 
cable projects of a significant distance.
attractive market outlook supported 
by continued tender activity
as the transition to renewable energy 
gains pace globally, nkt expects the 
need for reliable high-quality power 
transmission systems to continue increas-
ing. several countries both inside and 
outside europe have launched carbon 
reduction initiatives, including introducing 
more offshore wind into the power mix. 
entering 2021, progress continues on 
several tenders across market segments 
and geographies. 
nkt expects the value of relevant new 
high-voltage project awards (projects 
exceeding eur 5m each) to be more than 
eur 3bn in 2021. this expectation is sub-
ject to uncertainty as the pipeline includes 
a number of large projects with no fixed 
award date. based on current tender 
activity, the potential project awards in 
the market are expected to span the inter-
connector, offshore wind, and oil & gas 
segments and to include both dc and ac 
solutions.
while the timing of future project awards 
is subject to uncertainty, particularly in the 
interconnector market, the prospective 
order awards are expected to continu-
ously improve the supply and demand 
situation for power cable manufacturers in 
the years ahead.

nkt’s applications business 
line operates in the low- and 
medium-voltage market, 
primarily in northern, 
central and eastern europe. 
nkt holds the largest share of the market 
in czech republic, denmark, germany, 
poland and sweden, while other impor-
tant markets are uk, netherlands, france 
and norway. 
the offerings in the low- and medi-
um-voltage market are less complex 
than in the high-voltage market, and the 
number of market players is higher. the 
products are typically “made-to-stock”, 
with differentiated specifications and 
designs from country to country to match 
local requirements. compared to the pro-
ject-driven high-voltage market, demand 
in this segment is generally more aligned 
with macroeconomic development.
the market can be divided into two cate-
gories with different characteristics:
1.  low-voltage: the market drivers for 
low-voltage cables and building wires 
are primarily construction industry 
sentiment and the need for further 
electrification of cities due to increased 
urbanization.
2.  medium-voltage: medium-voltage 
power cables serve the power dis-
tribution grid. the transition towards 
renewable energy is an important part 
in the continuous need for power grid 
optimization. this is further driven by 
the growing electrification of society, 
including e-mobility, and the increasing 
power demand in cities. 
mixed market development due to 
covid-19 pandemic
while growth over time is expected to 
be positive in the low- and medium-volt-
age power cable markets, 2020 saw a 
slowdown due to the covid-19 pan-
demic. restrictions impacted transport 
of products across borders, power cable 
installation works, and further areas. 
the market uncertainty impacted 
individual countries in different ways. 
the most severely affected markets 
included france and uk, where market 
development was negative the swedish 
market also slowed down. the market 
development was more stable in central 
and eastern europe in countries such as 
germany, netherlands and poland.
uncertain near-term market 
conditions
despite the expectation of growth in 
the low- and medium-voltage market in 
the years ahead, the outlook for 2021 is 
subject to uncertainty and will depend on 
developments in the covid-19 pan-
demic and on the economic stimulation 
programmes launched by the eu and 
governments.
nkt believes that the underlying       
megatrends driving the markets are in 
place. a recovery to normalized levels of 
activity is anticipated when the general 
economy again develops favourably.

market overview – service & accessories
the market for power cable 
services and accessories is 
growing with the increased 
electrification of societies. 
in the accessories market, competitive 
pressure is greatest at the lowest voltage 
levels due to the higher complexity of ac-
cessories for high-voltage power cables.
the market potential for accessories is 
closely linked to the general development 
in the medium- and high-voltage power 
cable markets. the accessories business 
is expected to benefit from the growth in 
renewable energy. 
the market for servicing power cables  
is gradually growing with the expansion in 
the installed base of power cables. 
the competitive landscape among 
service providers is diverse, with different 
companies offering different solutions. 
power cable failures are costly for both 
offshore and onshore operators, and they 
are therefore increasingly demanding 
services that will improve the power cable 
efficiency along with solutions to help 
predict, and mitigate power cable failures. 
if a failure occurs, power cable operation 
must be restored fast.
moving forward, the growth in the service 
market will be driven by the installation 
of further power cables. however, the 
service market is expected to fluctuate 
depending on the number of large repairs 
to offshore high-voltage power cables.

market overview
megatrends
the power cable industry covers market segments with a variety of 
characteristics and drivers. nkt focuses on trends in these markets 
to develop new solutions and offerings and has identified four 
megatrends expected to define the overall future market direction.
sustainability
the global focus on climate change is moving 
societies towards increasing reliance on 
renewable energy sources. in several coun-
tries, the transition away from conventional 
coal and nuclear power towards renewable 
energy such as wind and solar is high on the 
political agenda and backed by an ambition to 
reduce carbon emissions in the years ahead. 
at eu level, the european green deal sets the 
direction for a sustainable eu economy with 
net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 
2050.
the shift towards renewable energy is 
important for the power cable industry as it 
requires a power grid capable of handling the 
changes in the power generation mix, and 
a displacement of power production to, for 
example, offshore wind farms generating large 
quantities of power far away from the point of 
consumption. 
urbanization
with people increasingly moving to the cities, 
the demographic landscape is gradually 
changing and the power grids in and around 
these population centres will need continuous 
upgrading. this includes both the transmis-
sion and distribution of power to households 
and the organization of power within new 
buildings. with its broad portfolio of low- to 
high-voltage power cable solutions, nkt ex-
pects to be an important contributor to power 
grid expansion and upgrade in the countries 
where it operates. 
as an example, nkt was in 2019 selected to 
supply power cable systems to the beck-
omberga-bredäng power grid expansion in 
stockholm, sweden. the full project compris-
es a planned expansion of the local power grid 
to meet rising power demand due to the city's 
population growth. 
e-mobility
globally, there is increasing transition towards 
electric vehicles. this trend is primarily driven 
by the focus on greener solutions and de-
creased reliance on fossil fuels. the transition 
requires power to be instantly available and 
easily accessible from the power grids. as the 
number of electric vehicles rises, the power 
grids will have to be expanded and upgrad-
ed to meet the increasing electrification of 
societies.
power grid expansion to support this trend 
fits well into nkt’s product offering, particu-
larly in the applications business line, where 
an extensive array of medium-voltage power 
cable solutions will be important for power 
distribution. 
digitization 
we live in an increasingly digital world. this will 
also be reflected in a growing need for digital 
solutions for the power cable industry and 
for smarter power grids. the impact will take 
place in different areas of the market, such 
as increased data collection, monitoring, and 
control of power cable systems to optimize the 
power grids.
nkt offers power cable solutions with sensors 
to monitor and collect data and continues to 
develop further solutions for the years ahead.

renew is based on four principles
strategic focus
renew strategy
nkt has realized several 
strategic milestones in 
recent years, including 
the acquisition of abb 
hv cables and several 
divestments to create a more 
focused business. on this 
basis, nkt's purpose is to 
connect a greener world by 
enabling sustainable energy 
transmission.
while nkt is viewed as holding strong 
market positions, there are areas within 
technological, operational and financial 
performance which hold potential for im-
provement. these areas are the key focus 
of the renew strategy launched in 2020
new overall business strategy  
given nkt’s situation, the markets where 
nkt operates, current megatrends 
and past lessons, nkt’s new business 
strategy – renew – is based on four 
principles:
1. business line driven
this means that nkt’s advancement will 
come from the business lines and not from group 
functions. the business lines will drive nkt forward 
and the group functions will enable this direction. 
2. improved business performance
renew places specific focus on improving 
internal business performance. it is a balanced 
strategy:  focus is given to nkt’s customers and 
markets, but there is also focus on internal capabilities 
to deliver top products and services for customers 
and on how to deliver on customer promises.
3. action-, decision- and 
implementation-oriented
this means that focus is on big-ticket items in 
business lines, and implementation is part of 
strategy and not detached. all implementation plans 
are feasible and realistic. with renew, strategy 
implementation will be a focus for management. 
4. near-term focus
for this strategy, nkt has applied a 
short-term focus. if turnaround comes sooner, nkt 
will adjust accordingly. the company works with 
concrete bottom-up plans that have been assessed 
as realistic within a near-term perspective.
strategic initiatives
renew is built around three key pillars: fix and restart. invest. 
grow. these pillars are detailed in the business line strategies.
fix and restart nkt: 
tackle, address and resolve key internal 
issues. this is the basis for successful 
operation of the business and delivery to 
customers.
invest in nkt: 
prepare nkt for tomorrow: invest in 
high-voltage technology to maintain 
technological leadership. upgrade 
applications' production plants. expand 
accessories capacities. prepare nkt for 
delivery of german corridor projects.
grow nkt: 
enter growing markets: benefit from 
green transformation, widen accessories' 
global footprint, and provide more 
services in home markets.

renew strategy
strategic focus
solutions – investing for the future
to further power the 
solutions business line, nkt 
will strengthen technology 
where required, make 
strategic investments, and 
leverage the capabilities of 
the production sites. this 
will position the business 
line favourably relative to 
competition and capture 
future market opportunities.
investing for the future
the renew strategy focuses on invest-
ing in technology and competence to 
maintain nkt’s leading market position 
in technology and quality. this means 
creating flexible sites that can react to 
dynamic markets and customer requests 
by quickly and efficiently adapting the 
product portfolio.
for solutions, the strategic plan 
consists of four key pillars 
 
■
maintain technology leadership: 
maintain position as a premium player 
with technology and quality leadership 
expressed through superior operation-
al performance
 
■
improve turnkey capabilities: strength-
en in-house turnkey, risk management 
capabilities and execute the german 
corridor projects
 
■
increase competitiveness: do this 
through operational excellence and 
continuous improvement efforts 
 
■
competence management: maintain a 
solid pool of critical competencies with 
clear forward planning
while the strategy shares a common 
foundation for solutions, it is applied 
independently to the production sites in 
karlskrona and cologne to cater for the 
differences in the competitive strengths of 
the respective business units. 
internal status quo 
solutions has in recent years been 
reorganized to increase the focus and 
accountability for the two high-voltage 
sites in germany and sweden. currently, 
the plants predominantly address differ-
ent market segments, except with regard 
to ac offshore solutions. renew defines 
how nkt will continue to optimize the two 
locations to become the best performers 
among their respective competitors, while 
also increasing flexibility as regards where 
to produce major power cable projects. 
market potential driving investment
growth is expected throughout the euro-
pean market. the european green deal is 
the eu’s roadmap for economic sustaina-
bility and climate neutrality by 2050. this 
will increase demand for both offshore 
and onshore power cable systems as 
a result of the need to transmit a larger 
amount of renewable energy at higher 
voltage levels from the remote generating 
locations to the distribution points, and 
also to upgrade the power grids to reliably 
meet the increased need for electricity. 
in addition, a promising market is emerg-
ing in the us that will require support 
from european specialist companies such 
as nkt. finally, the mediterranean is a 
potential growth area of high interest to 
nkt, driving the need for products and 
solutions adaptable to that market. 
all power cables undergo 
a number of tests before 
delivered to the customer. 
the high-voltage facility in 
karlskrona is nkt's most 
advanced test centre.

strategic focus
applications – performing through customer focus
for applications, the key 
focus of the renew strategy 
is to restore the business line 
to improved and satisfactory 
profitability levels following 
a period with earnings 
below expectations. the 
first step was the improved 
financial performance 
in 2020, but the strategy 
identifies further areas for 
improvement.
ensuring the right setup
from 2015 to 2019, nkt transitioned from 
a regional to a cross-functional organi-
zation, allocating more decision-making 
to central functions. the intention was to 
reap synergies by combining functions, 
but financial performance weakened 
during the period. to establish improved 
end-to-end accountability this setup was 
to some extend reversed at the end of 
2019, and a single applications business 
line was established with responsibility 
from production to sales.
this setup actively and simultaneously 
balances two objectives to achieve the 
desired financial performance: it ensures 
full accountability and execution of the 
strategy at regional level, while still realiz-
ing the benefits and synergies of working 
across regions and functions to take the 
next steps as an organization.
management change
to head the change, will hendrikx, an 
experienced executive within the power 
cable industry, was appointed in 2020 
to lead applications. thereafter, the 
organizational setup was changed to 
augment the power cable knowledge of 
the leadership team and create stronger 
working links within the business line 
functions (e.g. establishment of product 
development or supply chain team across 
regions/plants). in addition, a separate 
department was established to lead the 
change and improvement program.
main areas of strategic plan
the strategic plan for applications has 
been developed through both a top-
down and bottom-up process. top-down 
targets were set to guide the overall 
direction and develop the business line 
agenda. a bottom-up process was used 
to identify the improvements per produc-
tion site to develop an actionable plan 
with tangible actions. this approach was 
to ensure sufficient buy-in and accounta-
bility across the organization. 
the strategy consists of a range of initi-
atives. the cornerstones of the strategy 
relate to the commercial, operational and 
developmental areas:
1. commercial: 
 
■
diversify risk by addressing various 
customers and channels. 
 
■
build up and ensure customer centric-
ity in all actions
 
■
add value for customers as a service 
provider to secure long-term partner-
ships
2. operational: 
 
■
cost optimization with a kpi-driven 
organization and environment
 
■
specialized factories with high effi-
ciency. ensure best practice sharing 
across locations and continuous 
improvement
 
■
conduct targeted, value-creating 
investments
3. developmental:
 
■
be a part of emerging product 
technologies and exercise conscious 
portfolio steering
 
■
ensure focus on sustainability

strategic focus
service & accessories – focus on growth
as in recent years, the 
service & accessories 
business line will continue 
its focus on growth. 
it is planned to support growth for the 
service business by pre-engineered and 
expertise-driven products. focus on 
data-driven improvements will ensure 
increased efficiency and an enhanced 
offering to build value-adding products for 
customers. 
for accessories, growth will focus on 
building a solid platform to capture 
market opportunities and strengthen cus-
tomer relationships. as such, accessories 
is transforming for growth.
service: driving growth
the service business will focus on 
developing superior off- and onshore 
power cable services. this will be done 
by increasing and complementing the 
portfolio of pre-engineered products. 
future sales growth will be supported by 
expanding into additional geographically 
adjacent markets and developing them 
to the same high level as current focus 
markets. 
to enable entry into new business and 
customer markets, service will leverage 
nkt’s extensive knowledge in power 
cables and installation. going forward, 
service will offer products and expertise 
for further types of power cables and 
customers.
in its service business, nkt operates 
from three sites in denmark, germany 
and sweden. the projects and solutions 
are sold to internal and external custom-
ers, mainly across europe. 
market development 
following the introduction of the eu’s euro-
pean green deal the offshore power cable 
market is expected to grow. this will also 
lead to continued growth opportunities in 
key service categories, such as power  
cable installation and offshore repairs, 
where nkt has a competitive offering. 
offshore competitors include other power 
cable manufacturers and specialized 
marine operators. in the onshore cate-
gory the competitive landscape for xlpe 
cables consists of major construction 
players operating on large scale.
accessories: transforming for growth
in the accessories business, the following 
four focus areas will drive future growth: 
 
■
strengthen capabilities and capaci-
ty: invest in production capacity and 
efficiency, including future technologies 
such as digitization and automation, and 
build strong competence centres for 
medium- and high-voltage accessories
 
■
improve cost base: strengthen cost 
competitiveness by footprint optimiza-
tion and increased localization in key 
growth regions such as india and the 
middle east
 
■
optimize product portfolio: develop 
and launch new innovative products 
that are safe and reliable to install and 
deliver lifetime value. foster product 
cost-optimization of products
 
■
invest in strong workforce: attract and 
develop skilled and talented people
market view and nkt positioning
within a truly global market, accessories 
will particularly benefit from the global 
green agenda and associated invest-
ments in grid expansion and renewable 
energy projects. alongside solutions and 
applications, the accessories business 
expects continued demand in europe, but 
also in other focus regions such as india 
and the middle east.
nkt is well positioned to exploit the pos-
itive market trends and to further pursue 
geographical expansion in focus regions 
due to its strong global sales network and 
high-quality products.

as a key step in reducing the corporate 
carbon footprint, nkt committed to 
become a net-zero emissions company 
by 2050. to fully focus on reaching this 
target nkt committed to the science  
based target initiative providing a scienti-
fically based method to validate the corpo-
rate climate strategy. another significant 
step supporting this commitment was 
to ensure that all power cable factories 
is powered by electricity originating 
from renewable energy leading to a 72% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
from electricity compared to 2019. 
an important element of nkt’s journey

organic growth was 15%. 
the increased revenue also 
drove up earnings. cash 
flow generation was also 
positive due to the improved 
financial performance and 
favourable development in

growth in revenue across all 
business lines
driven by growth in all three business 
lines, nkt’s revenue increased to 
eur 1,087m in 2020 from eur 945m in 
2019. the main growth contributors were 
solutions and service & accessories 
through increased levels of activity and 
successful business expansion. 
nkt reported overall organic growth in 
2020 of 15%. organic growth was 26% 
for solutions, 3% for applications and 
15% for service & accessories. 
the revenue measured in market prices 
was eur 1,403m in 2020, against 
eur 1,268m in 2019.
increased operational ebitda 
driven by higher revenue
the operational ebitda for nkt in 
2020 amounted to eur 56.7m, against 
eur 15.1m in 2019. while this improve-
ment was satisfactory, nkt remains set 
to improve profitability significantly. all 
three business lines contributed with 
increased earnings on the back of the 
higher revenue and profitable efficiency 
measures. 
the earnings improvement led to an 
increased operational ebitda margin of 
5.2% in 2020, against 1.6% in 2019. 
total one-off items in 2020 amounted to 
eur -9.9m, a reduction from eur -12.0m 
in 2019. the one-off costs in 2020 mainly 
comprised legal expenses incurred in 
contesting customer claims for damages 
following the decision of the european 
commission in 2014. nkt was fined as 
a fringe player in alleged high-voltage 
power cable project cartel activities. nkt 
has since filed several appeals against the

2020.
nkt’s net result for 2020 amounted to 
eur -63.5m, against eur -78.5m in 
2019. the tax level was impacted by a 
difference between ifrs and local tax ac-
counting for revenue recognition leading 
to a temporary difference, and thereby a 
deferred tax liability, in germany. further, 
compared to 2019, no capitalization of 
deferred tax assets was done in 2020.
working capital at unusually  
low level
nkt improved its working capital position 
from an already low level of eur -146m 
at end-2019 to eur -165m at end-2020. 
due to the record-high order intake in 
2020, solutions was the main contributor 
to this improvement due to the phasing of 
prepayments and milestone payments. 
working capital at end-2020 was at an 
unusually low level, and an increase is 
expected during the upcoming quarters. 
the future development will continuously

the revenue* for the solutions business 
line amounted to eur 579m in 2020, up 
from eur 456m in 2019. this equalled or-
ganic growth of 26%. nkt’s high-voltage 
order backlog has risen gradually since 
mid-2018, and the increased revenue is 
based on higher factory output driven by 
execution on these projects.
revenue measured in market prices 
amounted to eur 653m in 2020, against 
eur 523m in 2019.
operational ebitda more than 
doubled 
the increased activity resulted in oper-
ational ebitda of eur 35.9m in 2020, 
compared to eur 14.1m in 2019. while 
the level of earnings is still not satisfacto-
ry, the performance was as expected and 
the operational ebitda margin* doubled 
from 3.1% in 2019 to 6.2% in 2020. 
during 2020, nkt progressed on several 
projects within the various stages of their 
respective execution phases. the assign-
ments included project-defined power 
cable solutions for several offshore wind 
projects as well as interconnector pro-
jects and power-from-shore applications 
for the offshore oil & gas market.
larger contributors to revenue and 
earnings in 2020 were the dc projects 
dogger bank a and b, johan sverdrup 2, 
nordlink and viking link, and the ac pro-
jects borssele alpha and beta, hornsea 
2, moray east, ostwind 2 and triton knoll. 
within the high-voltage onshore segment, 
nkt progressed and completed a multi-
tude of various ac projects 
overall project execution was satisfactory, 
with projects advancing better than antici-
pated, while a few experienced delays.
utilization of the company’s cable-laying 
vessel, nkt victoria, was in line with 
expectations in 2020. the vessel was 
deployed on a number of installation 
campaigns, including the uk offshore 
wind farms moray east and hornsea 2, as 
well as repair works.

record-high order intake driven by 
green transformation
2020 was the best-ever year for nkt in 
terms of high-voltage order intake. this 
growth in orders was primarily driven by 
the ongoing european transition towards 
increased generation of renewable 
energy. the total order intake in 2020 
amounting to eur 2.3bn was driven by 
five large dc projects: 
 
■
in may 2020, nkt was awarded the 
contract for the attica-crete intercon-
nector project in greece. the first of its 
kind for nkt in southern europe. the 
onshore cable systems delivered by 
nkt will enable transmission of green 
energy from attica on the greek main-
land to the island of crete. the order 
has a value of approx. eur 115m 
(eur 105m in std. metal prices). 
 
■
in may 2020, nkt was awarded a ma-
jor share of suedostlink, one of the 
german high-voltage dc corridor pro-
jects. the turnkey contract has a value 
of approx. eur 500m (eur 400m in 
std. metal prices).
 
■
awarded in june 2020, suedlink is 
nkt’s biggest ever order, worth more 
than eur 1bn (eur 875m in std. 
metal prices). the cable system to be 
supplied by nkt will be the world’s 
largest and longest high-voltage dc 
underground interconnector. 
 
■
suedlink and suedostlink consist of 
long-distance power lines to transmit 
renewable energy from north to south 
as part of "energiewende", germany’s 
long-term strategy for transitioning to 
renewable energies by 2050.
 
■
in july 2020, nkt was awarded 
the turnkey order for the shetland 
hvdc link, a combined on- and 
offshore project with a contract value 
of approx. eur 235m (eur 230m in 
std. metal prices). the order includes 
installation by nkt victoria.
 
■
in august 2020, nkt was awarded 
a turnkey contract with a value of 
below eur 250m (eur 235m in std. 
metal prices) to deliver and install a 
high-voltage dc xlpe power cable 
system for the borwin5 project in 
northern germany. the order includes 
installation by nkt victoria.
record high-voltage order backlog
driven by the substantial order intake, 
nkt’s high-voltage order backlog 
reached an all-time high of eur 3.07bn 
(eur 2.59bn in std. metal prices) at 
end-2020. this was up from eur 1.37bn 
(eur 1.21bn in std. metal prices) at end-
2019. nkt expects around 20% of the 
order backlog to be realized in 2021 and 
the balance in 2022 and beyond. 
in november 2020, nkt announced it 
had entered into a preferred supplier 
agreement as main contractor for delivery 
and installation of high-voltage dc on- 
and offshore export cable systems to a 
european offshore wind farm. for nkt, 
the order is expected to have an estimat-
ed contract value exceeding eur 250m 
(eur 200m in std. metal prices). this 
project is not included in the current 
high-voltage order backlog. 
investments supporting future 
growth 
to fulfil the significant order intake 
received in 2020 and to further prepare 
for demand driven by the green energy 
transition, nkt announced plans to invest 
approx. eur 150m in strengthening its 
high-voltage manufacturing facilities 
during 2020–2022.
continued tender activity 
progress continued on several tenders 
across market segments and geogra-
phies. the timing of project awards will 
depend on the timelines for the individual 
projects. for nkt, achieving optimal 
production and installation flow, and 
thereby improving earnings, is contingent 
upon high utilization of capacity across all 
production and installation phases. this 
among others requires a balanced mix of 
power cable technologies.
market activity relating to high-voltage 
project awards was not materially impact-
ed by the covid-19 pandemic.

market segments. going forward the pipeline of project 
opportunities continues to look promising with ongoing 
global transition towards renewable energy.”

in 2019. the operational ebitda margin* 
increased to 3.7% from 0.1%. after two 
unsatisfactory years, profitability was 
partly restored in 2020. the turnaround 
was due to several factors, including a 
positive change in product mix towards 
more profitable medium-voltage power 
cables, and a more profit-driven approach 
generally. 
as part of the ambition to stabilize and 
improve performance, nkt has launched 
a series of initiatives, and these started to 
take positive effect in 2020. the initiatives 
focus strongly on cost and production 
efficiencies.
furthermore, started early 2021, nkt in-
itiated the rollout of a uniform it platform 
across its eastern european sites. this 
is the second rollout phase following that 
which took place at the scandinavian 
sites in 2019. the ongoing rollout in east-
ern europe has so far developed satisfac-
torily. the overall goal is a more efficient 
and unified it setup across applications’ 
production sites.

business review – applications 
new management to drive financial 
improvement
in april 2020, to further strengthen the 
applications business line and drive 
improved profitability, will hendrikx was 
appointed to the position of evp, head 
of applications. will hendrikx brings with 
him broad experience from the power and 
telecom cable and transformer business.
market demand impacted by the 
covid-19 pandemic 
overall, the markets in applications were 
negatively impacted by the covid-19 
pandemic in 2020. nkt maintained 
stable production and delivery during the 
period, but restrictions imposed due to 
the pandemic challenged deliveries to 
some markets.
in 2020, applications grew its presence in 
germany and the netherlands driven by 
positive development in the medium-volt-
age segment, an area in which compet-
itors experienced delivery challenges. 
positive progress was similarly delivered 
in poland. 
however, the french and uk markets 
were more severely impacted by cov-
id-19 related restrictions, leading to lower 
sales to these markets. 
new frame agreements secured 
in 2020, nkt was awarded several me-
dium-voltage frame contracts spanning 
germany, sweden and denmark. the 
contracts were in many cases in response 
to major investments in the distribution 
power grids of these countries to support 
the ongoing shift to renewable energy 
generation. the contracts also cover 
power grid maintenance and expansion.
“ for applications 2020 was an important year. 
we established the foundation to turn around 
the financial performance with primary focus 
on business processes, customer centricity 
and cost awareness. this has created the right 
dynamics across the organization and should 
lead to further improvements”

both segments, service & accessories 
increased revenue* from eur 117m in 
2019 to eur 141m in 2020. this equalled 
organic growth of 15%. growing the 
business is a key strategic priority. 
in 2020, the revenue measured in market 
prices amounted to eur 141m, up from 
eur 119m in 2019.
operational ebida up driven by 
higher revenue
the operational ebitda for service & 
accessories amounted to eur 15.2m in 
2020, up from eur 13.5m in 2019. the 
operational ebitda margin* in 2020 was 
10.8%, compared to 11.6% in 2019.
the earnings improvement was driven 
by the growth in revenue. in parallel with 
this development, service & accessories 
has increased its cost level, for example 
by increased recruitment, to prepare for 
future growth opportunities. 
driving growth in service 
in 2020, the service business delivered 
solid revenue growth. this improvement 
was attributable to higher activity in the sus-
tainable onshore business and an increase 
in the number of service agreements. 
nkt has steadily expanded its portfolio of 
service agreements for both off- and on-
shore power cables. these agreements 
are delivering a higher share of recurring 
income. nkt’s service offering has also 
been expanded with a vessel mobilization 
guarantee. this guarantee is a central 
part of nkt’s overall preparedness plan 
and removes customer uncertainty from 
the repair timeline by ensuring rapid repair 
in case of power cable damage.
the level of offshore repair work was 
stable from 2019 to 2020. in 2020, nkt

business review – service & accessories
completed a number of turnkey offshore 
assignments, including repair of the 
high-voltage dc baltic cable connecting 
the power grids in sweden and germany, 
and the repair of the skagerrak 1 and 
skagerrak 2 high-voltage dc power links 
between norway and denmark.
in q3 2020 a new facility was estab-
lished in troisdorf, germany. this facility 
includes a warehouse for storing both 
customer parts as well as a customer 
training centre and an oil & gas compe-
tence centre.
accessories business growth driven 
by medium-voltage sales
2020 was another year of growth for the 
accessories business. the development 
was mainly attributable to increased sales 
of medium-voltage power cable acces-
sories, particularly in the middle east 
but also in western europe. sales of ac-
cessories for high-voltage power cables 
also gradually increased due to initiation 
of deliveries for dc projects awarded in 
recent years. 
in 2020, nkt carried out investments in 
its factory at nordenham, germany, in 
preparation for increased sales opportu-
nities and future growth potential. these 
investments will facilitate both higher pro-
duction output and additional automation 
to benefit efficiency and profitability. 
the accessories business recorded 
reduced sales in certain non-european 
markets due to restrictions related to the 
covid-19 pandemic. however, stable 
production was maintained, with limited 
impact on the supply chain.
new head of accessories
to strengthen growth of the business 
line, fredrik eskengren was appointed 
evp, head of accessories, in april 2020. 
fredrik eskengren has solid experience 
from the power cable business and has 
been with nkt since 2007.
“ we have grown our power cable accessories 
business well in the past years. this 
development was successfully continued in 
2020. we have invested in automating and 
making our production facilities more efficient. 
this benefitted our performance in 2020 and 
serves as a good foundation for future growth.”

risk management is and 
always has been a priority 
for nkt as various activities 
all pose uncertainty or risk 
that nkt needs to manage. 
as such, risk taking is 
a natural part of doing 
business. 
the nkt risk management goal is to un-
derstand, prioritize and mitigate the large 
risks. nkt’s risk-based approach allows 
nkt to operate with confidence on the 
key risks and to monitor the mitigations 
in a structured, coordinated way with 
continued focus on efficient day-to-day 
business operation in line with the com-
pany strategy.
the company’s main revenue streams 
originate from different segments of the 
power cable market with independent 
market dynamics. to some extent this 
has the effect of spreading the risk. the 
solutions business line, which is a project 
and backlog driven business, is largely 
decoupled from short-term developments 
in the general economic environment. the 
applications business line is mainly driven 
by construction development in both 
residential and non-residential buildings, 
while the medium-voltage market benefits 
from ongoing optimisation of the power 
risk management
grids by private and public stakeholders. 
finally, growth in the service & acces-
sories business line partly depends on 
large power cable repair projects. the 
development in 2020 for each business 
line is described in the business reviews 
on pages 34–39.
responsibilities
the company’s enterprise risk manage-
ment (erm) model ensures that risks are 
identified, reported and managed.
the formal responsibility for risk manage-
ment rests with the nkt group lead-
ership team via the risk board, while 
monitoring is carried out by the board of 
directors.
nkt’s risk management framework 
includes a process for reporting key risks 
and their mitigating actions. this process 
is performed and consolidated biannually 
to the board of directors via the audit 
committee.
nkt risk matrix
the company’s key risks are mapped in 
a risk matrix according to probability and 
impact. the overall risk picture remains 
unchanged compared to 2019 with the 
following material changes.
firstly, the risk of the covid-19 pandem-
ic has been introduced this year and is 
also a contribution factor in several of the 
other risks. so far however, covid-19 
has had limited disruption or operational 
impact, including supply of materials.
secondly, the risk connected to complete 
the dc qualification in cologne has de-
creased in impact as a result of the ongo-
ing investments in additional high-voltage 
dc production capacity at the production 
site in karlskrona.
as a complex, international business nkt 
is also exposed to financial risks not cov-
ered in the risk matrix. these risks arise 
from financial market fluctuations and 
primarily consist of currency and com-
modity risks. nkt utilizes varied financial 
derivatives to hedge substantial exposure 
and to protect earnings and assets from 
significant fluctuations.

nkt photonics at a glance
“ nkt photonics delivered growth in 
medical & life science, but the global 
covid-19 pandemic hit the industrial 
markets hard”
letter from the ceo
an unusual year
as for most of us, 2020 was 
an unusual year for nkt 
photonics. many of our plans 
had to be rewritten and new 
ways of working invented.
mixed market reactions during 
covid-19 pandemic 
we delivered strong growth in medical 
& life science, where our latest gen-
eration of supercontinuum white light 
lasers set new performance standards in 
advanced microscopes used in a range 
of applications. this included the pursuit 
of covid-19 vaccines. we also saw good 
traction within ophthalmology, where our 
ultrafast lasers are a key component in 
the latest generation of super-precise 
surgical equipment.
however, the global covid-19 pan-
demic hit the industrial markets hard. in 
particular, our customers from the major 
research institutions reduced their activity 
and postponed orders, as many could 
not access their facilities due to lock-
downs around the world. the restrictions 
on travel also prevented us from visiting 
these customers during much of the year 
and many projects were delayed.
overall, the demand situation meant that 
for the first time in several years we ex-
perienced negative revenue development  
in 2020. 
signs of improvement
although the pandemic affected a large 
part of our markets, the situation is gradu-
ally improving, and we are cautiously opti-
mistic for 2021. while many projects were 
delayed, the business was not lost, and 
we expect the level of activity to normalize 
this will though remain uncertain given 
the current development of the pandemic. 
we continue to see strong underlying 
megatrends that we expect to prevail as 
growth drivers for us in the years ahead. 
our order intake grew throughout 2020 
as we and our customers adapted to the 
new reality and found ways to execute 
projects despite the restrictions. we also 
launched several new products in 2020 
that will help us grow in the years ahead.
finally, i would like to thank all our employ-
ees who have worked tirelessly throughout 
the year to deliver products to our custom-
ers despite restrictions, lockdowns and the 
many other complications that the global 
pandemic has imposed on all our lives. we 
are all looking forward to returning to more 
normal operation during the coming year.

solutions for innovators
technology has the power to transform 
our lives. this was true with the invention 
of penicillin, electricity and, more recently, 
the internet. 
today, the transformation continues with 
amazing innovations such as autonomous 
electric cars, smartphones, quantum 
computing, artificial intelligence, stem cell 
and cancer research, renewable energy 
and even space exploration. nkt pho-
tonics’ customers are visionary innovators 
within these fields and many more. they 
are changing the world through their 
innovations, and we are ready to deliver 
the cutting-edge solutions they need. 
solutions for innovators. 
growth supported by megatrends
nkt photonics develops innovative solu-
tions with multiple beneficial applications. 
these technology- leading solutions are 
tapping into sustainable megatrends that 
will support growth opportunities for the 
company going forward. 
growing and ageing population 
the continued increase in global popula-
tion and life expectancy will lead to pres-
sure for more effective use of resources 
and drive up health costs. this develop-
ment will increase:
1. the demand for optical sensing and 
monitoring to optimize use of energy 
and infrastructure
2. the need for faster and cheaper medi-
cal instrumentation for mass screen-
ing, diagnostics and treatment based 
on lasers.
increased technological complexity
as technology shrinks and more functions 
are packed into the devices we use every 
day, the requirements for the technology 
used to manufacture the advanced prod-
ucts are pushed to new levels.
mechanical manipulation of material that 
was feasible a few years back is increas-
ingly being replaced by optical manip-
ulation with ultrafast lasers. this allows 
higher precision and faster throughput 
when processing the small structures in 
high-tech devices like smartphones and 
advanced medical equipment.
focus on security
as technology advances and cost 
decreases, access to autonomous 
drones, surveillance equipment, and 
other advanced technology is becoming 
easier. this is accompanied by increasing 
security concerns as small groups or indi-
viduals can harm civilian targets or disrupt 
infrastructure. consequently, there is a 
growing need for fast and efficient de-
fence systems that are safe to use in any 
environment.
directed energy systems using fiber 
lasers are uniquely suited to accomplish 
some of these tasks. for example, they 
can safely disable small drones over 
an airport, sports stadium or ship both 
effectively and cost-efficiently. in addition, 
optical remote sensing technology like 
distributed acoustic sensing, das, is 
increasingly being used for perimeter 
and border security, as well as to secure 
critical infrastructure like communication 
lines.

market overview
market segmentation 
nkt photonics has divided its main 
market into three main segments: medical 
& life science, industrial, and aerospace 
& defence. most of the products in nkt 
photonics’ portfolio have applications 
across these three market segments.
while the global covid-19 pandemic has 
temporarily shifted the size and balance 
of nkt photonics market segments, the 
total addressable market is still approx-
imately eur 2.5-3bn, the impact of the 
pandemic on industrial having been offset 
by growth in medical & life science and 
aerospace & defence.
the overall laser market is expected to 
grow at a cagr of 9.6% in 2020-2025*. 
within this, the fiber laser market is 
expected to grow at 11.5% per year in the 
same period*. here, one of the principal 
drivers is aerospace & defence, which 
is expected to grow at 22.6% per year 
with directed energy systems as the main 
contributor to growth*. directed energy 
systems is nkt photonics’ biggest sub-
segment within aerospace & defence.

market overview
medical & life science
medical & life science 
is currentlythe fastest 
growing of the three 
identified market segments. 
ultrafast fiber lasers are 
finding particular use in 
medical procedures such 
as ophthalmology, while 
supercontinuum lasers 
are used in advanced bio-
imaging, enabling new ways 
of diagnosing e.g. cancer. 
main applications for medical & life 
science are:
 
■
bio-imaging & microscopy
 
■
medical devices
 
■
ophthalmology
the medical & life science segment is 
predominantly driven by identified meg-
atrend 1: growing and ageing population.  
the unique lasers from nkt 
photonics can be used in 
many areas within medical 
and life science. from high 
resolution imaging of retinas 
and eye surgery to skin can-
cer diagnostics and advanced 
microscopy
 
annual report 2020 | nkt a/s | 50
medical & life science  
examples of current main applications
fast, low-cost detection of skin cancer 
skin cancer is the most frequent cancer type and is 
becoming increasingly common. the traditional method 
of detection using biopsies is not optimal as it can be 
painful, costly, time-consuming and even unreliable. 
around 20% of early-stage skin cancers are estimat-
ed to be missed when using biopsies. a new medical 
imaging device developed by damae medical uses nkt 
photonics’ superk supercontinuum white light laser to 
detect early-stage skin cancer faster, cost-efficiently, and 
without the need for biopsies. it eliminates unnecessary 
surgery and ultimately saves lives.
pursuing the cure for cancer with 
confocal microscopes
according to the world health organiza-
tion, 9.6 million people died from cancer 
in 2018. nkt photonics’ superk super-
continuum white light lasers power a large 
number of high-resolution confocal leica 
microscopes around the world. used 
for purposes such as cancer research, 
these microscopes offer superior image 
contrast and flexibility, enabling the user 
to see features in cells not previously vis-
ible. the superk lasers are also used in 
so-called super-resolution microscopes, 
such as sted microscopes, that offer 
even higher resolution. in 2014, stefan 
hell was awarded the nobel prize in 
chemistry for his work with sted micros-
copy using nkt photonics’ lasers.
better implants and stents enabled 
by lasers
more than 1.8 million surgical stents are 
implemented in the us alone each year. 
for stents, precision-machining and sur-
face quality are vital, and ultrafast lasers 
are uniquely suited to deliver both. more-
over, ultrafast lasers can directly modify 
the surface of stents and other implants, 
and thereby change how they interact 
with biological tissue. these so-called 
functional surfaces can increase bio-
compatibility for e.g. prosthetics, thereby 
potentially reducing complications and 
speeding up recovery.
helping to cure cystic fibrosis
the average life expectancy of a person 
with cystic fibrosis is below 40 years. 
using nkt photonics’ superk supercon-
tinuum white light lasers, researchers at 
massachusetts general hospital have 
created in-vivo scanners with cell-level 
resolution. such scanners are helping 
doctors understand the causes of cystic 
fibrosis and helping pharmaceutical 
companies design drugs to alleviate and 
eventually cure the disease. 
traceability and safety through  
dark marking
in the pharmaceutical and medical 
market, traceability is of paramount 
importance to battle counterfeit products, 
ensure the correct use of sterilized equip-
ment and avoid contamination risk during 
surgery. ultrafast lasers are used to mark 
the two most important materials in this 
area, glass and stainless steel, thereby 
enabling full traceability of equipment and 
medicine all the way from production line 
to patient.
safer eye surgery with  
ultrafast lasers
more than 20 million cataract surgeries 
are performed worldwide each year. most 
of them with manual processes where the 
results are dependent on the skill of the 
surgeon. in the latest generation of equip-
ment for cataract operations the scalpel 
is replaced with an ultrafast femtosecond 
laser from nkt photonics. using lasers 
ensures consistent quality, reduces the 
risk of complications and accelerates 
recovery.

market overview
industrial
industrial is the largest and 
most diversified segment 
of nkt portfolio’s main 
markets. customers in this 
segment use the full breadth 
of nkt photonics’ product 
portfolio, including ultrafast 
lasers, supercontinuum 
lasers, and sensing systems.
within the industrial segment, nkt 
photonics serves a wide range of subseg-
ments and applications, such as: 
 
■
device characterization, sorting and 
quality control
 
■
materials and nanostructures
 
■
micromachining and display
 
■
remote sensing
 
■
semiconductors
the industrial segment is predominantly 
driven by identified megatrend 2: in-
creased technological complexity.
as the biggest of nkt 
photonics market segments, 
the applications within the 
industrial market are numer-
ous. an important area is 
semiconductor fabrication, 
where the lasers are used in 
manufacturing and quality 
control of semiconductor 
structures for processors and 
memory chips supplied by 
some of the world’s largest 
manufacturers.

wind sensing reduces cost of 
renewable energy
more than 600 gw of wind power 
capacity is already installed worldwide, 
and the amount is increasing fast. when 
in operation, the efficiency of the turbines 
depends on how well the blades and 
tower are aligned to the wind. using nkt 
photonics’ low-noise koheras lasers, the 
wind in front of the wind turbine can be 
measured with high accuracy in three 
dimensions. by feeding this information 
to the turbine control system, turbine ef-
ficiency can be increased by 3-5%, while 
also reducing wear and maintenance. all 
this contributes to lowering the cost of 
renewable energy, thereby supporting the 
global green transformation. 
more power from renewable energy 
with power cable monitoring
with the growth in decentralized renew-
able power sources such as wind and 
solar, energy production fluctuates more 
than ever before, increasing the demands 
on the power grid. nkt photonics’ 
en.sure power cable monitoring sys-
tems are used to continuously supervise 
the health and load of the power cables, 
enabling improved load distribution and 
capacity utilization. this means that more 
of the wind or solar energy produced can 
be sent into the grid.
safer tunnels and metros  
using fiber sensors
fire safety in tunnels and metros is a 
high priority and the protection systems 
have never been better. nkt photonics’ 
de.tect linear heat detection systems 
currently monitor the temperature in 
over 300 tunnels and metros worldwide. 
the fiber optic systems can detect tiny 
increases in temperature with an accuracy 
down to 1 m over several km of tunnel. 
de.tect feeds the data to the fire protec-
tion systems, enabling fast and accurate 
response to fires or hotspots, keeping 
people safe when travelling in tunnels or 
underground. 
sorting and quality control of food
the characteristic broadband light from 
the superk white light lasers can be used 
for high-speed sorting of e.g. food and 
ingredients. using these unique lasers for 
sorting directly on the production line en-
ables the manufacturer to switch from off-
line sample-based batch quality control 
to 100% sorting of all batches. using nkt 
photonics’ lasers, the customers increase 
not only the quality of the food produced, 
but also food safety. the latter is a grow-
ing concern globally, where ingredients 
and materials are often inconsistent and/
or misleading.
smarter, thinner and flexible displays
in 2018, manufacturers shipped more 
than 600 million oled panels, and this 
market is currently growing at around 
15% annually. next-generation displays 
will be thinner, allowing screens to bend. 
oled manufacturing is complex, requir-
ing multiple processes, and any reduction 
in the number of process steps is impor-
tant to lower production costs. moreover, 
ultrafast lasers enable the use of thinner 
materials required to improve perfor-
mance and reduce power consumption.
ultrafast lasers are increasingly deployed 
to cut, process and repair displays direct-
ly, with little to no post-processing, there-
by eliminating costly steps in the man-
ufacturing process. they are also used 
to embed almost unnoticeable markings 
for authenticity and to functionalize the 
display for e.g. fingerprint readers.

sustainability photonics
product portfolio
nkt photonics offers 
a variety of innovative 
solutions within the 
photonics markets. these 
solutions are applicable for 
several market segments 
as stated in the market 
overview, and they are 
described in more detail the 
following. 
fiber lasers versus solid-state lasers
while the majority of nkt photonics’ laser 
products are fiber lasers, the company 
also produces solid-state
lasers and hybrid systems. in the last 
decade, fiber lasers have taken market 
share from solid-state lasers as they 
have a range of key advantages, such 
as robustness, scalability and mainte-
nance-free operation. solid-state lasers 
on the other hand have advantages at 
high pulse energies required in certain 
applications.
with these two types of lasers, nkt 
photonics can choose the platform that 
best suits the application and even com-
bine the two to gain benefits from both 
technologies.
photonic crystal fibers
the company’s unique and heavily pro-
tected photonics crystal fiber technology 
is at the core of most of its
laser products and is a main driver of 
differentiation and growth. nkt photon-
ics utilizes the technology to embed as 
much functionality as possible directly 
into the fibers to ensure that systems built 
with these high-function components are 
simpler, more cost effective, and reliable. 
photonic crystal fibers are unique and 
differ from e.g. telecommunication fibers 
in using a microscopic array of materials 
running along the length of the fiber. the 
fibers are also known as microstructured 
fibers.
supercontinuum white light lasers
nkt photonics is a leading global suppli-
er of supercontinuum white light lasers – 
lasers that emit high-brightness light with-
in a very broad spectral range, from uv 
light all the way into the near infrared. this 
is unique to supercontinuum technology 
as light sources are typically either bright 
or broad. the superk lasers produced by 
nkt photonics are the only light sources 
capable of doing both. this combination 
is important as it enables supercontinuum 
lasers to replace a range of other lasers 
that emit light of only one colour, thereby 
saving cost and space while improving 
reliability and robustness. moreover, the 
broad spectrum of these lasers enables 
a new level of measuring precision not 
possible with any other laser type.
narrow linewidth low-noise lasers
koheras lasers are in many ways the ex-
act opposite of superk white light lasers. 
they emit light in an extremely narrow 
and well-defined spectral range and the 
light is very well controlled. as the charac-
teristics of the light are so well known, 
it is ideal for sensing applications, even 
very small disturbances being observable 
as changes to the light from the lasers. 
primary sensing applications include 
distributed acoustic sensing (das), vibro-
metry, and lidar applications in areas 
such as pipeline monitoring, windfarm 
supervision, and intrusion detection. 
koheras lasers are also used in quantum 
technology and atomic research.
ultrafast lasers
ultrafast lasers emit very short bursts of 
high-intensity light that can be used to 
manipulate material with high precision. 
nkt photonics’ onefive and aeropulse 
ultrafast lasers are used directly in 
material processing applications within 
the medical & life science and industrial 
segments. the aerogain modules are 
supplied to other manufacturers of ultra-
fast lasers where they constitute the main 
“engine” of the lasers.
sensing systems
nkt photonics produces a range of linear 
optical sensing systems for power cable 
monitoring, fire detection, and industrial 
temperature monitoring. all these systems 
can measure temperature with high accu-
racy over many km of optical fiber. unlike 
with electronic temperature measuring, 
the optical fibers are extremely robust 
and immune to electrical disturbances. 
this makes them well suited for measure-
ments in harsh environments such as tun-
nels, metros, chemical plants, furnaces 
and inside high-power optical cables.

commercialization strategy
nkt photonics has pursued 
its strategic direction to grow 
the business and increase 
profitability by prioritizing 
focus on commercialization 
over focus predominantly 
centered on scientific 
markets. nkt photonics 
will continue to pursue 
commercialization of 
solutions and technologies 
in the years ahead to sustain 
further growth. this strategy 
is supported by four focus 
areas.
#1
move up in value chain
as part of the progression from primarily 
serving the scientific market towards a 
more industrial profile, the products which 
nkt photonics offers are rising higher 
in the value chain. this is to capture a 
larger part of the value in the market. this 
development is also a natural conse-
quence of the change in customer base, 
as industrial customers are inclined to 
choose complete solutions rather than 
the flexible building blocks sought after in 
the scientific market.
#2
focus on growth
following the acquisitions of fianium and 
onefive in 2016 and 2017, nkt photon-
ics’ product and competence matrix 
has become more balanced. the new 
businesses have been integrated into the 
company and serve as an important part 
of its growth platform for the years ahead. 
nkt photonics will continue to invest 
in business areas that offer significant 
growth opportunities, particularly in the 
aerospace & defence and medical & life 
science segments.
#3
lean operations  
as nkt photonics grows, scale in pro-
duction and lean are becoming increas-
ingly important to improve profitability and 
manage working capital. the company’s 
manufacturing sites are tied together with 
centralized functions like procurement 
and order handling. responsibility for op-
erating the sites as efficiently as possible 
across borders and for driving the lean 
process lies with the chief operating 
officer. 
 
#4
fast introduction of new products
nkt photonics’ product technology 
platform is maturing, and focus has 
shifted from fundamental development 
to faster introduction of new products 
and customer-specific variants. this also 
supports the move into more industrial 
market segments where product cycles 
are shorter, and products are typically 
tailored to individual customer needs.
nkt photonics’ office in 
boston serves as the head-
quarters for all its us-based 
sales. it also accommodates 
a state-of-the-art  single-fre-
quency fiber laser manufac-
turing facility.

financial & business review
the covid-19 pandemic 
impacted demand negatively 
in 2020, particularly in the 
industrial segment. organic 
growth for nkt photonics 
was -6% as the slowdown 
in industrial outweighed 
strong growth in medical & 
life science. this resulted 
in lower profitability for the 
year. however, performance 
stabilized during 2nd half 
2020, showing signs of 
improvements entering 
2021. 
mixed revenue development due to 
covid-19
the revenue for nkt photonics amount-
ed to eur 69.9m in 2020, compared with 
eur 74.6m in 2019, corresponding to 
-6% organic growth. revenue perfor-
mance was adversely influenced by the 
covid-19 pandemic, particularly in 1st 
half 2020. 
nkt photonics’ largest revenue con-
tributor is the industrial segment, which 
accounted for 63% of revenue in 2020. 
this market was impacted negatively by 
restrictions and uncertainty surrounding 
the covid-19 pandemic with several 
orders postponed. however, none of the 
postponements resulted in cancellations.
the slowdown in industrial outweighed 
the positive performance in the medical 
& life science segment. this market 
was relatively resilient despite the global 
economic slowdown, and nkt photonics 
is delivering new-generation solutions to 
support future growth in this market.
the revenue development in aerospace & 
defence was stable compared to 2019.
ebitda impacted by negative 
revenue development
driven by the lower revenue, the 
ebitda for nkt photonics in 2020 
was eur 2.6m. this compared with 
eur 14.6m in 2019, which included some 
positive non-recurring items. 
the customer mix and temporary yield 
inefficiencies associated with a shift to 
high-volume customers impacted profita-
bility and margins negatively in 2020.
the ebitda margin in 2020 was 3.7%, 
compared to 19.6% in the previous year. 
nkt photonics’ cost base also increased 
in 2020, reflecting the company’s 
continuous investment in future growth 
opportunities in anticipation of attractive 
future market development. however, 
new recruitment was slowed during the 
year due to the unexpected slowdown in 
revenue.
ebit and net result
the development in ebitda led to a lower 
ebit, which amounted to eur -9.5m in 
2020 against eur 4.7m in 2019. depre-
ciations and amortizations increased in 
2020, reflecting the investments made in 
recent years. 
nkt photonics reported a net result of 
eur -11.0m in 2020 against eur 2.5m in 
2019. 
modest improvement in working 
capital 
at end-2020, the working capital amount-
ed to eur 27.4m, down from eur 28.2m 
at end-2019. the working capital 
decreased as a result of strengthened 
accounts receivable collection and was 
partly offset by higher tax receivables.
the free cash flow (excl. acquisitions and 
divestments) amounted to eur -15.9m in 
2020, compared to eur -9.5m in 2019. 
this development was primarily due to 
the lower earnings level in 2020.

order intake down by 17%
despite a 20% growth in orders from q3 
to q4 2020 and a rising trend in orders 
throughout 2020 as the markets found 
ways to adjust to the covid-19 pande-
mic, the order intake for the year as a 
whole was 17% down compared with 
2019. as with revenue, the greatest 
challenges were in the industrial segment 
where several research customers post-
poned orders.
roce negatively impacted by 
earnings development
driven by the lower earnings, nkt 
 photonics saw a decline in roce 
from 4.9% in 2019 to -8.8% in 2020. 
the  capital employed amounted to 
eur 110.7m at end-2020, up from 
eur 104.4m at end-2019.
medical & life science
the medical & life science segment saw 
strong growth in 2020 despite the cov-
id-19 pandemic. this growth was driven 
by large customers within bio-imaging, 
microscopy and ophthalmology. segment 
outlook remains positive as several 
smaller customers using supercontinuum 
and ultrafast lasers gained traction within 
medical and life science applications.
industrial 
the headwinds confronting the industrial 
segment at the start of 2020 strength-
ened with the covid-19 pandemic. while 
subsegments like the semiconductor 
market performed well, the scientific and 
research markets struggled in 2020 as 
many institutions were under lockdown 
for most of the year. consequently, pro-
jects and orders were delayed. depend-
ing on developments in the pandemic, 
most parts of this market segment, espe-
cially in europe and the us, are expected 
to normalize during 2021.
aerospace & defence 
delays relating to the covid-19 pandem-
ic also affected the aerospace & defence 
segment. although the level of activity 
continued high and both new and existing 
projects saw significant progress, reve-
nue development remained largely flat in 
2020 compared with 2019. the segment 
is expected to return to growth in 2021 
alongside a projected worldwide lifting of 
covid-19 restrictions.

risk management
during 2020, several aspects 
of the market segments 
of nkt photonics and its 
business partners were 
adversely affected by the 
covid-19 pandemic. 
the board of directors and the leader-
ship team of nkt photonics are therefore 
continuously monitoring the company’s 
risk profile and mitigating actions to 
ensure that management of pandemic-re-
lated risk, is a strong and integral part 
of company policy and stays ahead of 
potentially damaging developments. 
in 2020, continuously changing market 
conditions and reduced visibility were 
key considerations in the management of 
risks and opportunities, and this position 
will remain unchanged in the short term. 
going forward, the full extent of the 
impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the 
operational and financial performance 
of nkt photonics is uncertain and will 
depend on many factors outside the 
company’s control. these factors depend 
to a large extent on the duration of the 
pandemic, the application of pandemic 
controls, and the availability and effective-
ness of treatments and vaccines world-
wide. further, the impact on the global 
economy, and the impact on demand for 
technology-leading solutions in the mar-
kets of medical & life science, industrial, 
and aerospace & defence will be key.  
changes in risk matrix
a detailed overview of the company’s 
primary risks is presented in the following. 
new compared to 2019 is risk 6 relating 
to the covid-19 pandemic.
risk 3 related to intellectual property 
rights has been increased in both busi-
ness impact and likelihood of occuring. 
the update has been due to a detailed 
assessment of the importance of this 
area. 
the final adjustment has been regard-
ing risk 4: operations dependence on 
key suppliers. the increased likelihood 
of occurence has been due to effects 
of the covid-19 pandemic, which has 
increased risks in certain parts of the 
supply chain.

overview
group financials
operational ebitda and ebit
the nkt group reported operation-
al ebitda of eur 59.3m in 2020, up 
from eur 29.7m in 2019. the doubling 
of earnings was driven by the positive 
development in the group’s power cable 
business, nkt. the operational ebitda 
margin* increased to 5.1% in 2020 from 
2.9% in 2019.
in 2020, ebit amounted to eur -47.9m, 
an improvement from eur -83.0m in 
2019. this development was driven by 
higher profitability in the power cable 
business combined with lower deprecia-
tion and amortization, and a decrease in 
one-off costs.
financial items and net result
the net financial items in 2020 amounted 
to eur -16.7m compared to eur -12.3m 
in 2019. the financial items primarily 
consisted of interest costs on debt, 
and also included interest expenses on 
leases as well as exchange gains and 
losses. earnings before tax were there-
fore eur -64.6m in 2020, compared to 
eur -95.3m in 2019.
the nkt group reported an effective 
tax rate of -15.3% in 2020. the tax rate 
was impacted by a difference between 
ifrs and local tax accounting for revenue 
recognition, leading to a temporary 
difference, and thereby a deferred tax 
liability, in germany. further, compared 
to 2019, no capitalization of deferred tax 
assets was done in 2020. the net result 
in 2020 amounted to eur -74.5m, against 
eur -76.0m in 2019.
cash flow 
in 2020, the cash flow from operating 
activities amounted to eur 136m, up 
from eur 125m in 2019. the primary 
driver for this growth was the improved 
level of earnings. in 2020, the favourable 
development in working capital in the 
group’s power cable business, nkt, was 
again a contributor to the positive cash 
generation.
the cash flow from investing activities 
amounted to eur -107.4m in 2020, 
compared to eur -66.8m in 2019. the 
increased level of investment was due 
to upgrade and expansion of production 
sites in nkt’s solutions business line.
the cash flow from financing activities 
totalled eur 203.7m in 2020, driven by 
the two capital increases completed in 
may and december, which generated net 
proceeds of eur 259m.

the net interest-bearing debt amounted 
to eur -25.9m at end-2020, a significant 
decrease from eur 242.2m at end-2019. 
the reduced debt level was mainly due 
to proceeds from the issuance of new

at end-2020, net interest-bearing debt 
relative to operational ebitda amounted 
to -0.4x, compared to 8.2x at the end of 
2019. this improvement was due to the 
combination of increased earnings and 
reduced debt level.
at end-2020, nkt group had total availa-
ble liquidity reserves of eur 536m, com-
prising cash of eur 239m and undrawn

uity, including the hybrid security issued 
in q3 2018, amounted to eur 1,076m, 
an increase from eur 804m at end-2019 
due to the capital increases during 2020.

the management structure of the nkt 
group comprises the board of directors,

leadership teams.
the board of directors
the board of directors consists of nine 
members. six members are up for 
election every year at the annual general 
meeting and three members are elected 
by the employees for a four-year term. 
five members were re-elected at the 
agm in june 2020, while karla lindahl 
joined for the first time. the employ-
ee-elected members were elected in 
2018 at an ordinary election of employee 
representatives.
jack ejlertsen, an employee-elected 
member, resigned from his employment 
at nkt with effect from 31 december 
2020 and consequently stepped down 
from the board. rené dogan, senior 
sales manager service at nkt, replaced 
him as a new employee-elected member 
of the board.
the agm-elected board members 
comprise two females and four males. 
the three employee-elected members are 
males. of the six agm-elected members, 
three live in denmark, one in finland, 
one in germany and one in luxembourg. 
two agm-elected board members have 
served for more than 12 years and are 
thereby not considered independent as 
defined by the danish corporate govern-
ance recommendations. a minimum of six 
ordinary board meetings is held annually.
the board of directors represents 
international business experience in the

■
to monitor whether the company’s 
internal control and risk management 
systems are properly designed and 
function effectively
 
■
to monitor the statutory audit of the 
annual financial statements
 
■
to monitor the independence of audi-
tors, including in particular the supply 
to the company of non-audit services
 
■

board of directors concerning the 
election of auditors 
 
■
to monitor the company’s legal

monitoring of internal control  
and risk management systems for finan-
cial reporting 
the internal control and risk manage-
ment systems for financial reporting are 
designed to ensure that the financial 
reporting presents a true and fair view 
of the company's results and financial 
position, without material misstatements, 
and in compliance with current financial 
legislation and accounting standards.
framework
the audit committee systematically 
assesses material risks in relation to 
the financial reporting process, as well 
as compliance with related key internal 
controls. the committee reviews the 
scope of the internal control system, also 
referred to as eurosox, and monitors the 
design and the effectiveness of the inter-
nal controls on an ongoing basis. 
the company’s eurosox framework is 
designed to reduce material risks in the 
financial reporting process and covers all 
material entities. the eurosox framework 
is furthermore designed so that the key 
controls cover all major financial process-
es in the material subsidiaries.
the key controls comprise both manual 
and automated controls. the key controls 
are systematically tested in conjunction 
with controller visits performed by group 
finance or by external audit. in entities 
covered by eurosox all key controls as 
well as general it controls are tested at 
least once every three years.
the audit committee also once a year 
assesses the need for an internal audit 
function. it is currently the committee’s 
opinion that such a function would not 
be beneficial, as the present compliance 
and controlling structure provides an 
adequate level of overall compliance 
assurance.
 
annual report 2020 | nkt a/s | 70
scope 
in 2020, the audit committee focused 
particularly on the company’s continued 
strengthening and extension of its internal 
controls and compliance framework, 
including the ongoing automation of key 
process controls.
furthermore, the audit committee 
reviewed the company’s policies and pro-
cedures related to information security, 
treasury and tax. 
compliance
the audit committee performs general 
supervision of compliance with policies 
and guidelines related to risk manage-
ment and financial reporting. this covers, 
among other things, policies for ac-
counting, treasury, commodity hedging, 
insurance, financial resources and tax. 
the audit committee also oversees the 
compliance programme, including the 
business code of conduct.
the company further operates a whis-
tle-blower scheme whereby employees 
and associated business partners can 
report irregularities. the chairman of the 
audit committee is notified immediately 
of any incidents reported. in the event of 
incidents of a serious nature an investi-
gation is conducted and, if substantiated, 
appropriate disciplinary sanctions are 
implemented. 
 terms of reference for the audit 
committee can be found at 
investors.nkt.com
remuneration committee
the remuneration committee is respon-
sible for establishing the remuneration 
policy for the board of directors and the 
executive management of nkt a/s, for 
proposing changes to the remuneration 
policy, and for obtaining the approval of 
the board of directors prior to seeking 
shareholders’ approval at the agm. the 
remuneration policy contains guidelines 
for setting and approving the remuner-
ation for the board of directors and the 
executive management.
the nkt a/s board of directors receives 
a fixed salary while the executive man-
agement receives both a fixed salary 
and incentive pay. this structure ensures 
commonality of interest between the 
management and shareholders, and 
maintains management's motivation to 
achieve the company’s strategic goals.
all parties must receive fair remuneration 
which is commensurate with the duties 
assigned and which represents an attrac-
tive incentive for long-term commitment.
 terms of reference for the 
remuneration committee and the 
remuneration policy can be found 
at investors.nkt.com
 
annual report 2020 | nkt a/s | 71
board of directors remuneration
at the agm in 2021 the company will pro-
pose that the remuneration for the board 
of directors be unchanged from 2020. as 
in previous years, the board of directors 
will receive a base fee as well as fees for 
committee duties. fees are evaluated 
relative to those paid by danish and other 
european companies of comparable 
size and complexity. the agm elected 
members of the board of directors will 
not participate in any of the company’s 
incentive plans.
remuneration of executive  
management
the remuneration of the executive man-
agement consists of a fixed remuneration 
and short-term and long-term incentive 
pay. the fixed remuneration is set to be 
competitive but not excessive. the short-
term and long-term incentive pay is based 
on financial measures and key perfor-
mance indicators that directly link to the 
company’s vision and strategic focus. 
 see section 2.3–2.4 on page 
94–97 and the remuneration 
report published at investors.

nomination committee
the nomination committee defines and 
assesses the qualifications required by 
the board of directors, the executive 
management and the business leadership 
teams, and initiates an annual self-as-
sessment within the board. over the last 
year, the nomination committee has also 
been actively engaged in the selection 
and onboarding of the new cfo.
self-assessments
the purpose of the annual self-assess-
ment is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the board as well as to define compe-
tencies required within the board of 
directors, considering the contribution of 
the individual members, and to identify 
future areas of focus. the self-assess-
ment for the current election period was 
performed during the autumn of 2020.
the board of directors also performs 
an annual assessment of the executive 
management covering two main areas: 
the interaction between the two parties, 
and the competencies and performance 
of the executive management. the 
assessment takes the form of a general 
discussion by the board, after which the 
assessment findings are communicated 
by the chairman of the board of directors 
to the executive management.
target figure for the  
under- represented gender 
the board of directors wishes to ensure 
that both genders are represented on the 
board, the target being to have at least 
two of six members representing the un-
derrepresented gender among members 
elected at the annual general meeting. 
this target was achieved for the board of 
nkt a/s with the election of karla lindahl 
at the agm in june 2020 and will remain 
the same for 2021. the focus on diversity 
and equal opportunities for both genders 
is described in the annual un global 
compact communication on progress 
(cop) report. the report is available at 
www.nkt.com/sustainability-report-2020.
 terms of reference for the 
nomination committee can be

sections contents
section 1 – basis for preparation
this section describes the applied 
reporting framework as well as 
changes in the accounting policies.
this section provides an overall description of the 
accounting policies applied in our consolidated 
financial statements. a more detailed description of 
the accounting policies is presented in the specific 
sections. new and amended ifrs standards and 
interpretations, and key estimates and judgements 
are discussed in detail in section 1.2 ‘implementation 
of new and amended accounting standards and 
interpretations’ and 1.3 ‘significant estimates and 
judgements’, respectively.
1.1 general accounting policies
nkt a/s is a public limited company domiciled in 
denmark. the annual report for the period 1 january 
– 31 december 2020 comprises both the consolidat-
ed financial statements for nkt a/s and its subsidiar-
ies (nkt group) and separate financial statements for 
the parent company.
the 2020 annual report for nkt group was prepared 
in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards, ifrs, as adopted by the eu and danish 
disclosure requirements for listed companies.
this annual report has been reviewed and approved 
by the board of directors and executive management 
on 24 february 2021. the annual report will be pre-
sented for approval by the shareholders at the annual 
general meeting on 25 march 2021. 
basis for preparation
the annual report is presented in eur rounded to 
the nearest eur 1,000,000 with one decimal. the 
annual report is prepared according to the historical 
cost principle with the exception of assets and liabil-
ities related to derivatives and financial instruments 
measured at fair value through profit or loss. the ac-
counting policies described in the individual sections 
have been applied consistently during the financial 
year and for the comparative figures. for standards 
implemented prospectively the comparative figures 
are not restated.
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements comprise the fi-
nancial statements of the parent company (nkt a/s) 
and the individual subsidiaries’ financial statements 
prepared according to nkt group’s accounting poli-
cies. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
of acquisition, being the date on which nkt obtains 
control, until the date that such control ceases. all 
intercompany balances, income and expenses, unre-
alized gains and losses and dividends resulting from 
intercompany transactions are eliminated in full.
foreign currency translation
transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recognized in the group entities at their respective 
functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. monetary assets and liabilities denom-
inated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rate at the reporting date. all 
adjustments are recognized in the income statement. 
non-monetary items that are measured at historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transac-
tions. non-monetary items measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date, when the fair value is determined. 
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into eur at the rate of exchange prevailing 
at the reporting date, and their income statements are 
translated at average exchange rates. exchange rate 
adjustments arising on translation are recognized in 
other comprehensive income. on disposal of a foreign 
subsidiary, the component of other comprehensive 
income relating to that subsidiary is recognized in the 
income statement.
definition of materiality
ifrs contains extensive disclosure requirements. the 
specific disclosures required according to ifrs are 
stated in the annual report unless the disclosures 
are considered irrelevant or immaterial for financial 
decisions made by the users of these financial state-
ments.
alternative performance measures (apms)
the consolidated financial statement includes financial 
performance measures that are not defined according 
to ifrs.
these measures are considered to provide valuable 
information to stakeholders and management. since 
other companies might calculate these differently 
from nkt group, they may not be comparable to 
the measures applied by other companies. these 
financial measures should therefore not be considered 
a replacement for performance measures as defined 
under ifrs, but rather as supplementary information. 
alternative performance measures are defined in 
section 7.4 in more detail and some are reconciled to 
ifrs measures in section 2.1.
going concern
as part of the preparation of this annual report, the 
board of directors and executive management has 
considered whether the financial statements can be 
presented on a ‘going concern’ basis. the conclu-
sion, based on future prospects, considering iden-
tified uncertainties and risks, expectations of future 
cash flows, existence of credit facilities, etc. is that, 
at the time of the approval of this annual report, the 
financial headroom is sufficient to manage the level of 
activity expected in 2021 for the nkt group.

section – basis for preparation
1.3 significant estimates and judgements
 significant estimates and judgements
when preparing the annual report, management 
makes accounting judgements in applying the 
accounting policies, which form the basis for the 
recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities and 
disclosures provided.  
significant estimates regarding future developments 
are regularly reassessed based on historical experi-
ence and other factors, which management assesses 
to be reliable, but which, by their nature, are associ-
ated with uncertainty and unpredictability. significant 
estimates and judgements are predominantly applied 
in relation to recognition of revenue from construction 
contracts, impairment of goodwill and assessing the 
value of deferred tax assets. these assumptions may 
prove incomplete or incorrect, and unexpected events 
or circumstances may arise, but the assumptions are 
considered reasonable under the circumstances. 
revenue from construction contracts
at contract inception management has assessed, 
whether the contract fulfills the criteria for revenue 
recognition over time. based on the fact that the 
cables provided in these projects are customized 
with no alternative use and nkt has an enforceable 
right to payment for work performed, it is manage-
ment’s assessment, that all larger cable projects 
fulfill the criteria for revenue recognition over time. 
revenue from construction contracts are measured 
based on management’s estimate of earnings on a 
project-by-project basis and includes a risk provision 
based on the risk profile of each project. assess-
ing the future earnings and risks related to each of 
these complex projects is subject to a large degree 
of uncertainty. revenue recognized in the year from 
construction contracts and the associated risks is 
presented in section 2.2. 
impairment of goodwill 
impairment test of goodwill is performed, when there 
is indication of impairment, and at least annually. the 
impairment test is based on the expectation, that the 
present value of future cash flows from the respective 
cash-generating units, which the goodwill and net 
assets are allocated to, exceed the book value. as the 
projected cash flows are related to a relatively long 
period, the uncertainty related to the risk of errors in 
the projections is reflected in the chosen discount 
rate. 
based on the increased backlog from projects won 
during the year, the certainty of the projected cash 
flows increased compared to previous years and 
as the discount rate has not changed materially, no 
impairment on goodwill was recognized in 2020. fur-
ther details regarding the assumptions and estimates 
used in the impairment test as well as sensitivities are 
provided in section 3.3.
deferred tax assets
management’s estimates when considering how 
much of the deferred tax assets related to tax losses 
carried forward shall be recognized, is to assess to 
what extent taxable income will be created in the fore-
seeable future, that can be expected to be offset by 
the deferred tax asset. the recognized deferred tax 
asset is based on the expected positive income in the 
foreseeable future. the assessment and assumptions 
behind the recognition is further discussed in section 
2.6.
management also exercise judgement, when con-
sidering and measuring risk provisions for ongoing or 
potential disputes. section 7.3 contingent liabilities 
discusses this matter in more details. further risks 
and risk management are discussed in the ‘risk 
management’ section of the management review and 
in section 5.6.

section 2 – profit for the year
this section relates to profit for the 
year, including revenue, segment 
information, staff costs, share-
based payments, research and 
development costs and tax.  
in 2020, nkt realized organic growth of 15.1% and 
revenue in market prices of eur 1,402.5m. organic 
growth was impacted by a postive development in 
solutions of 25.8% as a result of the increased level of 
high-voltage project activity, 2.9% in the applications 
business and 14.5% in service & accessories mainly 
due to growth in the service sustainable business 
and increased production capaticy in accessories. 
operational ebitda was eur 56.7m and the opera-
tional ebitda margin, in std. metal prices, was 5.2%. 
compared to last year, operational ebitda increased 
by eur 41.6m, reflecting higher activity in solutions 
and increased earnings in applications. net profit 
was negatively impacted by temporary increases in 
deferred tax liabilities further explained in section 2.6.
nkt photonics realized organic growth of -5.6% 
and revenue of eur 69.9m. the performance was 
negatively impacted by the consequences of the 
covid-19 pandemic. ebitda was eur 2.6m and the 
ebitda margin was 3.7%. the customer mix and 
temporary yield inefficiencies associated with a shift 
to high-volume customers have also impacted prof-
itability and margins negatively in 2020. furthermore, 
nkt photonics continuously invested in future growth 
opportunities in anticipation of attractive market 
opportunities in the years ahead.

2.1 segment information – continued
 
 accounting policy
segment information
the segment information is based on internal man-
agement reporting and is presented in accordance 
with the group’s accounting policies.
segment income and expenses and segment working 
capital comprise those items that are directly attrib-
utable to the individual segment and those items that 
can be reliably allocated to it. other items are shown 
as non-allocated.
the reportable segments are generally referred to as 
business lines. the business lines consist of solutions 
(high-voltage power cable solutions), applications (low 
and medium-voltage power cables), service & acces-
sories (asset management services for onshore and 
offshore power cables and power cable accessories) 
and nkt photonics (optical fiber and laser technol-
ogy). for further details please refer to the manage-
ment review section of each business line.
the board of directors assesses the operating results 
of the business lines separately to enable decisions 
concerning allocation of resources and measurement 
of performance.
inter-segment transactions are performed on market 
terms and no single customer accounts for more than 
10% of the revenue. 
other operating income
other operating income comprises items of a second-
ary nature relative to the operations of the group, in-
cluding grant schemes, reimbursements and gains on 
sale of non-current assets, adjustments of earn-out 
and negative goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries. 
gains on disposal of tangible and intangible assets 
are determined as the selling price less selling costs 
and the carrying amount at the time of sale.
change in inventories of finished  
goods and work in progress
change in inventories of finished goods and work in pro-
gress comprises changes in these items which correspond 
to staff costs and other costs charged to the income state-
ment during the year and which relate directly or indirectly 
to the cost of the items stated in the balance sheet.
work performed by the group and capitalized
work performed by the group and capitalized 
comprises income which corresponds to staff costs 
and other costs charged to the income statement 
during the year and which relate directly or indirectly 
to the capitalized cost of non-current assets of own 
manufacture.
raw materials, consumables  
and goods for resale
costs of raw materials, consumables and goods for 
resale refer to purchases and changes during the year 
in inventory levels, including shrinkage, waste produc-
tion and any write-downs for obsolescence.
other costs
other costs comprise external costs relating to 
production, sale and administration, as well as losses 
on disposal of tangible and intangible assets. losses 
on disposal of tangible and intangible assets are 
determined as the selling price less selling costs and 
the carrying amount at the time of sale. write-downs 
of receivables from sales are also included.

 significant judgements 
cable projects are to a certain degree measured based on management 
judgement in terms of when to recognize revenue and how to calculate 
the revenue in terms of stage-of-completion and estimated profit on each 
project. the estimates include a risk provision, which is based on an 
assessment of the specific risks that each project is exposed to.
the stage-of-completion is based on costs incurred against estimated 
total project costs. in essence, the total project costs are therefore to a 
large extent based on estimates.
assumptions for the recognition of revenue over time regarding larger 
cable projects are determined contract by contract.
control is transferred as the project progresses, based on assumptions 
such as:
 
■
deliveries being approved on an ongoing basis
 
■
nkt group’s ability to provide products according to specification and 
the risk that the cable is rejected
 
■
customer takes over risk and legal title to the cable installation on an 
on-going basis, and
 
■
milestone payments from the customer.

2.2 revenue – continued
projects
revenue from the sale of cable projects accounted for as construction 
contracts comprises sale of onshore and offshore highly customized 
cables in solutions, delivery of highly customized spare cables in service 
and larger projects in nkt photonics.
projects are usually significant in amount, have a long lead time affecting 
the financial statements of more reporting periods and have a high 
degree of project management. each project is normally considered one 
performance obligation as each project comprise highly interrelated and 
interdependent physical assets and services, such as production, installa-
tion and project management.
depending on the contract structure, the performance obligation may 
consist of more than one contract. cable projects are often sold as 
fixed price contracts and revenue from these are therefore recognized 
over time by applying the percentage of completion (poc) cost-to-cost 
method.
payment terms of a cable project contract usually comprise the following 
payments:
 
■
down payment from the customer at contract inception,
 
■
progress payments, linked to project milestones,
 
■
final payment upon completion and customer acceptance.
nkt group will usually obtain payment guarantees to minimize counter 
party risk during the execution of cable projects.
sale of products
sale of products relates to the sale of smaller less customized cable pro-
jects, standardized cables and equipment. small cable projects with little 
or no customization usually have a short lead time of less than one year. 
each delivered product is considered one performance obligation. most 
of the products are sold at a fixed price and revenue is usually recognized 
at the point in time when the control of the products transfers to the 
customers, usually upon delivery.
payment terms for small cable projects usually follow the payments 
described above under cable projects.
for standardized products, nkt group is usually entitled to payment 
upon delivery, and payment terms vary by market but are usually short.
service contracts
service contracts comprise various service elements to support power 
cable efficiency and prevent or mitigate power cable failures and can 
include up to 365/24 hours support. service delivered according to the 
contracts is considered as one performance obligation delivered over 
time. revenue is accordingly recognized over the life of the contract. nkt 
group is either entitled to payment once the service has been provided or 
on a periodic basis.
spare parts and other repair work contracts are determined as one per-
formance obligation. the transaction price is usually variable, depending 
on the produced output, and revenue is recognized over time, using 
the cost-to-cost method. in case of significant uncertainties related to 
measuring the revenue reliably, revenue is recognized according to pay-
ments. nkt group is entitled to payment once the work or spare parts 
are delivered.
providing new highly customized spare cables is defined as one perfor-
mance obligation. the transaction price is usually fixed and revenue is 
typically recognized over time using the percentage of completion (poc) 
cost-to-cost method.
the payment pattern for spare cables is similar to the pattern for cable 
projects described above and nkt group will usually obtain payment 
guarantees to minimize the risk during the execution of the cable project.
 
 accounting policy
revenue from construction contracts with customers with a high degree 
of individual customization and no alternative use, are recognized as 
revenue over time, provided that nkt group has secured an enforceable 
right to payment for work performed at any time. the revenue therefore 
corresponds to the sales price of work performed during the year (the 
percentage-of-completion method).
revenue from sale of goods for resale and finished goods is recognized 
in the income statement when control of the goods has transferred to 
the buyer, normally at delivery, and it is probable that the income will be 
received.
revenue from services that include service packages and extended 
warranties relating to products and contracts is recognized concurrently 
with the supply of those services.
revenue is measured at the fair value of the expected consideration 
excluding vat and taxes charged on behalf of third parties.
in determining the transaction price, revenue is reduced by probable 
penalties and other claims and discounts that are payments to the cus-
tomers. the transaction price is further adjusted for any variable elements 
of the transaction price. the variable amount is estimated at contract 
inception and revisited throughout the contract period. variable income 
is recognized as revenue when it is highly probable that a reversal will not 
occur.
the geographical disclosure of revenue is based on the country of 
delivery.
  see section 4.3 for further information concerning construction 
contracts.

2.3 staff costs
section – profit for the year
in 2020, staff costs in nkt group increased by 12,5%, and the average 
number of full time employees increased by 3.5%. in nkt, the average 
numbers of ftes increased by 3% and staff cost by 9%, mainly driven by 
the better performance in 2020 despite the covid-19 pandemic. nkt 
photonics increased average number of ftes by 10% while staff costs 
increased by 46%. the staff cost was mainly impacted by the increased 
number of employees, and higher bonus accrual as the performance was 
better in 2020 and by comparison to 2019 the effect of the reversal of 
accrual for management’s long term incentive program in 2019.
in nkt group, most employees are covered by pension schemes, 
primarily in the form of defined contribution-based plans managed by 
independent pension funds.

nkt group’s defined benefit plans, primarily relating 
to the activities in germany, are recognized at the 
present value of the actuarially measured obligations. 
if a plan is not fully covered by plan assets, a plan 
liability is recognized in the balance sheet. expens-
es relating to pension benefits are recognized as 
staff costs in the income statement. actuarial gains 
or losses are recognized in other comprehensive 
income, eur 1.4m (eur -6.5m in 2019), see note 3.4

remuneration to executive management increased in 2020 compared to 
2019, mainly due to 2020 representing a full year for the ceo, as well as 
higher ceo bonus due to improved performance. further the former cfo 
received a cash bonus of eur 0.3m as part of a one-time bonus program 
related to the demerger year 2017. 
 
 accounting policy
staff costs comprise wages and salaries, remuneration, pensions, etc., 
and share-based payment for the company’s employees, including group 
management. the board of directors does not receive share-based 
payment. 
wages and salaries, social security contributions, leave and sick leave, 
bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognized in the financial year in 
which services are rendered by the employee. when nkt provides long-
term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to match the rendering of 
services. 
termination benefits are recognized when an agreement has been 
reached between nkt and the employee and no future service is ren-
dered by the employee in exchange for the benefits.

long-term incentive programs for executive management and 
group leadership team
at the dsicretion of the board of directors, the executive management, 
the group leadership team (glt) and select employees may be awarded 
performance shares once a year, representing a conditional right to 
receive shares after a three-year performance period at nil payment. the 
performance shares vest, subject to continued employment and the 
achievement of certain performance targets over a three-year period. 
the decision to award performance shares as a long-term incentive plan 
is made by the board of directors each year after recommendation from 
the remuneration committee. the board of directors may at their dis-
cretion decide to make cash awards in a given year instead of awarding 
performance shares.
for more information on the grant of performance shares, refer to the 
group's remuneration report 2020 available on the website.
in 2020, a new performance share program was awarded to 17 partic-
ipants comprising 84.330 performance shares of which 28.731 shares 
was granted to the executive management. the vesting period is 3 years.  
the program contains two key performance targets, one relating to oper-
ational ebitda, and one relating to total shareholder return (tsr). the 
total market value at award date was eur 1.1m. 
in 2019, a performance share program was awarded to 15 participants 
comprising 106,447 shares with a 3-year vesting period. the program 
contains two key performance targets, one relating to operational ebit-
da, and one relating to total shareholder return (tsr). of the shares 
granted, 33,284 shares were granted to the executive management. the 
total market value at award date was eur 0.9m. the ebitda target is 
not expected to be met, and only costs relating to the tsr share of the 
program is recognized.
in 2018, a 3-year performance share program was granted to 
eight participants. the market value at launch was eur 0.7m 
and comprised 50,722 shares of which 28,679 was granted to 
the executive management. the targets for the program related 
to ebitda, roce and total shareholder return (tsr). no 
targets were met and no shares will be awarded.
cost relating to share-based payments in 2020 was eur 0.3m 
(2019: eur 0.5m). remaining value to be expensed relating to 
current programs is eur 1.0m (eur 0.7m in 2019).
assumptions
determining the value of each psp granted under the lti 
program requires the use of a model for the calculation. the 
value is calculated based on a number of assumptions including 
expected dividend payout during the vesting period, the volatility 
of nkts share price (usually measured over a two year period), 
risk free interest rate and expected vesting period, usually 30-36 
months. apart from the expected dividend payout, which may 
vary in terms of actual subsequent payout, none of assumptions 
listed have a material impact on the value of the psp’s to be 
distributed over the vesting period.

warrants 
up until 2015, an incentive plan was in place for nkt a/s employees that 
awarded entitlement to subscribe for nkt a/s shares at a price based 
on the market price at the grant date, plus interest calculated from grant 
date to exercise date. the board of directors, empowered by a mandate 
from the annual general meeting, approved the basis for calculation and 
allocation of share-based incentive plans.
in all cases, condition of exercise is three years’ employment. in 2020, 
the remaining 20,806 shares were exercised. the average share price at 
exercise was 139.32 dkk (eur 16.22).
the exercise periods are determined as two weeks after publication of 
the company’s annual report and two weeks after publication of the in-
terim reports. each warrant grants entitlement to subscribe for one share 
of a nominal value of dkk 20 at the exercise price of dkk 91.3. dividend 
payments after 1 january 2019 and until the date when the shares are 
received are deducted from the exercise price.

 accounting policy
the nkt group’s incentive plans include share-based 
payments which contain both internal business performance 
measures and external market return measures. at the grant 
date the value of services received in exchange for share-based 
payments are measured at the fair value and a similar amount 
is recognized in equity. the fair value of share-based payments 
is estimated using a valuation model that takes into account the 
terms and conditions upon which granting took place.
during the vesting period, the costs related to the plans are rec-
ognized as staff costs in the income statement. for the internal 
business performance elements of the plans, costs are recog-
nized over the vesting period based on the number of shares 
expected to vest, whereas for the market return elements, 
costs are recognized over the vesting period disregarding any 
changes in the number of shares expected to vest.

high-voltage power cables projects are typically com-
plex and call for ongoing investments in research and 
development. in nkt, the research and development 
spend was eur 25.8m in 2020, down from eur 
27.1m in 2019. in percentage of revenue, this corre-
sponds to 1.8% against 2.1% in 2019. the research 
and development cost was mainly driven by the 
on-going qualification of dc technology taking place 
in the cologne factory and further development of dc 
technology taking place in karlskrona.
the research and development cost for nkt pho-
tonics remained at the same level as in the previous 
year. the ratio to revenue increased slightly due to the 
decreased 2020 revenue.
 
 accounting policy
research cost are expensed in the income statement 
as they occur.
clearly defined and identifiable development pro-
jects for which the technical feasibility, adequacy 
of resources and a potential future market can be 
demonstrated, and where it is intended to manufac-
ture, market or utilize the project, are recognized as 
intangible assets provided the cost can be reliably 
determined, and provided there is also adequate cer-
tainty that the future earnings or net selling prices can 
cover the carrying amount as well as the development 
costs necessary to finalize the project. other devel-
opment costs are expensed in the income statement 
as incurred.
capitalized development projects are measured at 
cost less accumulated amortization and impairment 
losses. the cost includes wages, amortization and 
other costs relating to the group’s development 
activities.
on completion of the development work, develop-
ment projects are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful life from the date the asset 
is available for use. the amortization period is usually 
3–10 years. the amortization base is reduced by any 
impairment losses.

tax approach
nkt group complies with the tax legislation of the countries in which it 
operates and seeks to pay the right amount of tax in the countries where 
it creates value.
nkt group only uses business structures that are driven by commercial 
consideration and have the genuine substance.
nkt group does not operate in tax havens. in accordance with nkt 
group’s tax policy, any future operations in tax havens will be purely of 
commercial reasons.
nkt group believes in collaboration and transparency regarding its tax 
matters and actively pursues opportunities to engage with tax authorities 
and other relevant stakeholders with the purpose of building trust through 
collaboration and openness.
nkt group realized earnings before tax (ebt) of eur -64.6m (eur 
-95.3m in 2019), which resulted in a reported tax rate of -15.3% (20.2% 
in 2019).
the reported tax rate of -15.3% was primarily impacted by unrecognized 
deferred tax asset in denmark and germany of eur 31.7m relating to 
tax losses. further, a deferred tax liability of eur 11.9m relating to timing 
differences on recognition of revenue has been recognized in germany.

 significant estimates 
the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
is based on the corporate tax rate applicable in the 
years when the assets and liabilities are expected 
to be utilized. the measurement of the tax assets 
is based on budgets and estimates for the coming 
years, which by nature are subject to uncertainty. as a 
result, there can be a substantial difference between 
the expected use of the tax asset and actual use of 
the tax asset related to previous years in the consoli-
dated income statement.
the majority of the deferred tax assets relate to 
nkt group’s german tax unit. the utilization of the 
german tax asset is depending on a successful turn-
around of the high-voltage business. the tax losses 
carried forward from the german tax unit increased 
from eur 176.0m in 2019 to 268.5  eur in 2020. 
the total deferred tax value amounts to eur 85.9m. 
nkt group has recognized a tax asset hereof of eur 
17.5m at year-end.
the tax losses carried forward at end-2020 in the 
danish tax unit was eur 58.4m which lead to a 
deferred tax asset of eur 12.8m. nkt group has 
recognized a tax asset hereof of eur 5.3m (eur 
5.7m in 2019) at year-end, assuming continued joint 
taxation with nkt photonics.
the tax losses carried forward at end-2020 in the 
swedish tax unit sums up to eur 129.7m which lead 
to a deferred tax asset of eur 26.7m (eur 19.8m in 
2019), which was fully offset against a deferred tax 
liability.
nkt group’s total net deferred tax liabilty amounted 
to eur 17.8m (deferred tax asset of eur 18.0m in 
2019) at end-2020. the development mainly relates 
to deferred tax liability related to hedge accounting 
recognized in other comprehensive income and 
deferred tax liability related to timing differences in 
revenue recognition in germany.
management judgement regarding deferred 
tax assets and provision for uncertain tax 
positions
deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried 
forward are recognized when management assesses 
that these can be utilized in a foreseeable future. 
the assessment is performed at the reporting date 
considering local tax legislation and management’s 
business plans. planned changes to capital structure 
are included in the assessment.
as the nkt group conducts business around the 
world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with local tax 
authorities may occur. when assessing the expected 
outcome of these possible disputes, nkt group 
applies ifric 23 ‘uncertainty over income tax treat-
ments’ and methods directed herein when making 
provisions for uncertain tax positions. as this is an 
assessment, the actual obligations may deviate and 
will depend on the result of litigations and settlements 
with the tax authorities. any taxes relating to tax 
disputes are included in ‘income tax receivables’, 
‘income tax payables’ and ‘deferred tax’. 
 
 accounting policy
current income tax
tax for the period, consists of the year’s current tax, 
change in deferred tax and adjustments related to 
previous years. tax for the period is recognized in 
the income statement including the effect of coupon 
payments on the hybrid capital. tax relating to other 
items are recognized in other comprehensive income.
current tax payable and receivable is recognized in 
the balance sheet as tax estimated on taxable income 
for the year, adjusted for tax on taxable income for 
previous years and for tax paid on account.
deferred tax
deferred tax is measured according to the balance 
sheet liability method on all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount and the tax base of 
assets and liabilities. however, deferred tax is not rec-
ognized on temporary differences relating to buildings 
and goodwill that for tax purposes do not qualify for 
depreciation and amortization, respectively, nor on 
other items where temporary differences – except for 
acquisitions – arose at the acquisition date without 
influencing either net earnings or taxable income. 
where alternative taxation rules can be applied to 
determine the tax base, deferred tax is measured 
according to group management’s planned use of the 
assets or settlement of the liabilities, respectively.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax 
losses allowed for carry forward, are recognized under 
other non-current assets at their expected utilization 
value within the foreseeable future, by offset against 
tax on future income, or by offset against deferred tax 
liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction.
deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are offset if the 
company has a legal right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and intends to settle current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets 
and liabilities simultaneously.
deferred tax is adjusted for the elimination of unreal-
ized intra-group profits and losses.

that form a basis for the group’s 
operations, and non-current 
liabilities arising as a result thereof. 
the non-current assets comprise 
mainly goodwill, investment in 
manufacturing plant and machinery 
and land and buildings. the non-
current liabilities in this section are 
regarded as non interest-bearing 
and comprise employee pension 
benefits and provisions. interest-

nkt group is a relatively capital-intensive company. 
a certain level of investment in the fixed asset base 
is required each year to ensure efficient production 
and a minimum of downtime. as expected, nkt's 
investment ratio was higher than 2019 due to the 
large high-voltage orders received. the majority of the 
group's non-current assets stem from the acquisition 
of abb hv cables ab in 2017. 
nkt photonics has a high level of investment due 
to its scientific nature and development of high-tech 
products. investments are mainly related to research 
and development and production equipment. the 
investment ratio for 2020 was at the same level as 
2019.

goodwill
goodwill is initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost. subsequent-
ly, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
goodwill is not amortized.
the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to nkt group’s cash-gen-
erating units at the acquisition date. the identification of cash-generating 
units is based on the managerial structure and internal financial control. 
as a result of the integration of acquisitions in the existing nkt group, 
and identification of operating segments based on the presence of seg-
ment managers, group management finds that the smallest cash-gen-
erating units to which the carrying amount of goodwill can be allocated 
during testing for impairment are the reportable segments (section 2.1 
segment information). 
other intangible assets
development projects are described in section 2.5.
it software, trademarks, patents and licences are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortization and impairment losses. it software, trade-
marks, patents and licences are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
the remaining patent or contract period or the useful life, whichever is the 
shorter.
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful life which is:
trademarks, patents and licences, etc.  
3 –15 years

3.2 property, plant and equipment – continued
section – non-current assets and liabilities
 
 accounting policy
land and buildings, manufacturing plant and machinery, fixtures, fittings, 
tools and equipment and other property, plant and equipment, are meas-
ured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
the cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition until the asset is ready for use. the cost of self-con-
structed assets comprises costs of materials, components, subcon-
tractors and wages. the cost is supplemented by the present value of 
estimated liabilities related to dismantling and removing the asset and 
restoring the site on which the asset was utilized.
subsequent costs, e.g. relating to replacement of parts of an item of 
property, plant and equipment, are recognized in the carrying amount of 
the asset if it is likely that the costs will result in future economic benefits 
for the group. the carrying amount of the replaced parts is derecognized 
in the balance sheet and recognized in the income statement. all other 
costs relating to ordinary repair and maintenance are recognized in the 
income statement as incurred.
if individual parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have differ-
ent useful lives, they are depreciated separately. depreciation is effected 
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the assets/compo-
nents, as follows:
buildings  
10 – 50 years
manufacturing plant and machinery  
4 – 20 years
fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment  
3 – 15 years
vessel  
20 years
land is not depreciated.
the basis of depreciation is calculated according to the residual value 
less impairment losses. the residual value is determined at the acquisi-
tion date and reviewed annually. if the residual value exceeds the carrying 
amount, depreciation is discontinued.
when changing the depreciation period or the residual value, the effect 
on the depreciation is recognized prospectively as a change in account-
ing estimates.
property, plant and equipment under construction and prepayments are 
measured at cost. when ready for use, the asset is transferred to the 
relevant category and depreciation commences.
leases
nkt group leases a number of production facilities, office buildings, 
cars, forklifts, it and other office equipment. contracts relating to leased 
equipment are usually made for a fixed period, wheras lease contracts for 
buildings in some instances include an option to extend the lease. nkt 
group recognizes leases on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, 
with a corresponding lease liability. the lease  liability is equal to the 
discounted value of all future lease payments including extensions where 
relevant.
payments related to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income 
statement. short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months 
or less. low-value assets mainly comprise minor buildings, cars, forklifts, 
it-equipment and other office equipment.
when assessing the life of the leases, nkt group considers the non-can-
cellable lease term and options to extend the lease where nkt group 
is reasonably certain to extend. the lease period of offices is assessed 
to be approximately 3 – 10 years and for production facilities 5 – 10 
years. for other assets the lease term is equal to the non-cancelable 
lease period and extensions are not considered. the right-of-use asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term 
on a straight-line basis.
liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease 
payments, discounted using the implicit borrowing rate in the contracts 
if available or nkt group’s incremental borrowing rate. this rate is deter-
mined as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow 
the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and 
conditions.
nkt has no leases where the rent is variable depending on revenue etc. 
some contracts are exposed to future increases in variable lease pay-
ments based on an index or rate, which are included in the lease liability 
when they take effect.
the finance cost related to lease payments is charged to the income 
statement over the lease period in order to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

3.3 impairment test
section – non-current assets and liabilities
result of annual impairment test
at 31 december 2020, the carrying amount of goodwill, other intangible 
assets and tangible assets were tested for impairment. the impairment 
test showed no impairment for 2020 (no impairment in 2019).
cash-generating units
cash-generating units in nkt group are solutions (high-voltage power 
cable solutions), applications (low and medium voltage power cables), 
service & accessories (asset management services for onshore and 
offshore power cables and production of cable accessories) and nkt 
photonics (optical fiber and laser technology), these being the lowest level 
of cash-generating units as defined by management.
the definition of cash-generating units is based on the smallest identifi-
able group of assets that together generate cash inflows from continued 
use and which are independent of the cash flows from other assets or 
groups of assets. the definition of cash-generating units complies with 
the managerial structure and the internal financial reporting in nkt group.
for impairment test purposes, tangible assets and intangible assets are 
allocated to the respective cash-generating units.
 significant estimates 
goodwill
goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating units according to 
the split presented above. 
the goodwill level in applications was immaterial and the assumptions 
for the impairment test of goodwill are not described any further for this 
cgu. the carrying amount of goodwill was as follows:

key assumptions
the recoverable amount is based on a value-in-use calculation. for all 
cash-generating units, the calculation uses cash flow projections (budget 
period) based on financial budget for 2021 and financial forecasts for 
2022–2026, hence a 6 year budget period. significant parameters in 
these estimates are revenue growth, ebitda margin, discount rate, work-
ing capital and growth expectations for the terminal period. 
the discount rate has been revised for each cash-generating unit to 
reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free rate based on 
a 5-year german government bond, the equity risk premium and the 
cost of debt. 2020 was a special year and for that reason two changes 
has been applied. due to the current negative interest rate, the interest 
rate has been normalised for the terminal period, increasing this to a 
positive interest rate expected in the future. due to the negative impact 
from covid-19 on nkt photonics, and the corresponding uncertainty 
surrounding the long-term impact from covid-19, nkt photonics has 
further increased the discount rate in the terminal period by 0.5% to cater 
for this specific uncertainty. 
the long-term growth rate for the terminal period is based on the expect-
ed growth in the world economy as well as long-term development for 
the industries and markets in which the different cash-generating units 
operate. the expected long-term growth rate was reduced in 2019 and 
has been reduced further in 2020 to reflect the lower risk free rate for 
solutions and service & accessories. nkt photonics still expect higher 
than average growth in the future compared to other companies in the 
laser industry.
investments reflect both maintenance and expectations of organic 
growth. based on the high order intake in solutions, investments are high 
in the first two budget years before being normalized over the budget pe-
riod 2021–2026. for the terminal period, the investments are expected to 
be slightly higher than the depreciations to support the growth expected.
group management determines, as illustrated on the following page, the 
expected annual growth rate in the budget period, the expected margins 
based on historical experience and the assumptions about expected 
market developments.

solutions
in 2020, solutions was awarded several new high-voltage cable projects 
ending the year with a record high backlog, which ensure a high level of 
activity during the budget period. given the continued growth, the renew-
able power generation is an important driver in the attractive outlook for 
the high-voltage market and is expected to ensure a continuously high 
level of activity for many years to come. nkt views europe as its largest 
market and expects this market to provide significant growth opportuni-
ties in the future, projects are also expected to come to the market in the 
usa and asia.
assessing the future awards to nkt is by nature subject to uncertainty, 
and the value-in-use calculation of the solution cgu is very sensitive to 
changes in the actual share awarded to nkt in future projects, however 
the large backlog does provide higher certainty regarding the future 
revenue and earnings.
service & accessories
the market for servicing power cables is growing as the number of 
cables increase. the competitive landscape among service providers is 
diverse, with different companies offering different solutions. power cable 
failures are costly for both on- and offshore operators, hence the interest 
in service agreements, leading to an expected growth in line with the 
megatrends of the power cable market. while the market is expected to 
increase, the timing of and the number of cable repairs vary, and it is still 
expected that results will fluctuate accordingly. for accessories, deliver-
ing components for power cable systems, the market is equally expected 
to increase in the coming years and nkt expect to be able to reach even 
more markets over the coming years to accommodate increased produc-
tion capacity, development of products increase the possibility to cater for 
the higher demand for components.
nkt photonics
nkt photonics operates in the laser industry within three segments: 
medical & life science, industrial and aerospace & defense. when 
assessing the prospects of their market, nkt photonics is still expecting 
growth rates above the average growth for the general laser industry.

 sensitivity
sensitivity to changes in assumptions:
the sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that nkt will be 
awarded its fair share of the future projects. it is management's assess-
ment that likely changes in the key assumption will not cause the carrying 
amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.  however, to 
show the headroom between the carrying amount and the recoverable 
amounts, a sensitivity analysis has been included, with focus on discount 
rate, long-term growth rate and ebitda in terminal period.

goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and development 
projects are tested at least annually for impairment, and furthermore 
when a trigger event occurs which could indicate a potential impairment.
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together 
with the other non-current assets in the cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill is allocated and written down to the recoverable amount over 
the income statement if the carrying amount is higher. the recoverable 
amount is generally computed as the present value of the expected future 
net cash flows from the business or activity (cash-generating unit) to 
which goodwill is allocated.
other non-current assets
the carrying amount of other non-current assets is tested when a trigger 
event occurs which could indicate a potential impairment. if such an 
indication occurs, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. the 
recoverable amount is the fair value of the asset less anticipated cost of 
disposal, or its value-in-use, whichever is the higher. the value-in-use is 
calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows from the 
asset or the cash-generating unit of which the asset is part.
recognition of impairment loss in the income statement
impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a 
cash-generating unit exceeds the respective recoverable amount thereof. 
the impairment is recognized in the income statement under depreciation 
and impairment. impairment of goodwill is recognized in a separate line 
item in the income statement.
impairment of goodwill is not reversed. impairment of other assets is 
reversed in the event of changes having taken place in the conditions and 
estimates on which the impairment calculation was based. impairment 
is only reversed if the new carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have applied after amortization if the 
asset had not been impaired.

3.4 provisions and pension liabilities – continued
section – non-current assets and liabilities
 
 accounting policy
provisions are recognized when the group has a legal or a constructive 
obligation as a result of events arising at or before the balance sheet 
date and it is likely that there may be an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits to settle the obligation.
the amount recognized as a provision is management’s best estimate of 
the amount required to settle the obligation.
when measuring provisions, the costs required to settle the obligation 
are discounted if they significantly affect the measurement of the liability. 
a pre-tax discount rate is applied that reflects the current market interest 
rate and the specific risks relating to the obligation. the addition of inter-
ests on provisions are recognized in the income statement under financial 
expenses.
warranty provisions are recognized in connection with the sale of goods 
and services based on the level of warranty expenses incurred in previous 
years. contingent warranty commitments are recognized in connection 
with business combinations.
restructuring costs are recognized under liabilities when a detailed, for-
mal restructuring plan is announced to the affected parties on or before 
the balance sheet date.
a provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected bene-
fits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the group’s 
unavoidable costs for meeting its contractual obligations.
provisions for dismantling production installations and restoring rented 
facilities when vacated are measured at the present value of the expected 
clearance and closure obligation at the balance sheet date. the provision 
is based on existing encumbrances and estimated cost discounted to 
present value. specific risks considered to attach to the obligation are 
included in the estimated costs. a discount rate is applied which reflects 
the current market interest rate. the obligations are included as they 
occur and continuously adjusted to reflect changed requirements and 
price levels, etc. the present value of the costs is included in the cost of 
the relevant tangible assets and depreciated accordingly. the addition 
of interests on provisions are recognized in the income statement under 
financial expenses.
for the group's defined benefit plans, an annual actuarial calculation 
(the projected unit credit method) of the present value of future benefits 
payable under the plan is provided. the present value is determined 
based on assumptions about the future development in variables such 
as salary levels, interest rates, inflation and mortality. the present value is 
determined only for benefits earned by employees from their employment 
within the group. the actuarial present value less the fair value of any 
plan assets is recognized in the balance sheet under pension liabilities. 
pension expenses for the year are recognized in the income statement 
based on actuarial estimates and financial expectations at the start of 
the year. differences between calculated interest on plan assets and the 
realized values at the end of the year are designated actuarial gains or 
losses and recognized in other comprehensive income.
if a pension plan constitutes a net asset, the asset, is only recognized if it 
offsets cumulative actuarial losses or future refunds from the plan, or if it 
will lead to reduced future payments to the plan.
other long-term employee benefits included in the provision, such as 
anniversary bonuses, are similarly recognized by an actuarial calcula-
tion. actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive 
income.

section 4 – working capital
nkt group's working capital 
represents the assets and liabilities 
necessary to support the day-to-
day operations. working capital is 
defined as current assets less current 
liabilities, excluding interest-bearing 
items and provisions.
composition and drivers
nkt group’s operations are by definition highly 
capital-intensive as the manufacture of power cables 
involves a high proportion of raw materials such as 
copper and aluminium. furthermore, working capital 
is volatile in solutions, but to some extent predictable, 
and large sums may be tied up for lengthy periods as 
payments are linked to production stages and general 
contract terms.
the group’s working capital is only to a minor degree 
impacted by nkt photonics.
nkt improved its working capital position by eur 18.2m from eur -146.3m at end 2019 
to eur -164.5m at end 2020. this was driven by a positive development in construction 
contracts in solutions due to payments from various projects offset by increased inventory 
level in applications. 
in nkt photonics working capital decreased compared to last year mainly as a result of 
reduction in trade receivables.

 accounting policy
inventories are measured at cost in accordance with the fifo method or at a weighted 
average. if the net realizable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this 
lower value.
raw materials, consumables and goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising pur-
chase price plus delivery costs.
finished goods and work in progress are measured at costs, which comprises costs of raw 
materials, consumables, direct wages/salaries and production overheads. production over-
heads include indirect materials and wages/salaries, as well as maintenance and depreciation 
of production machinery, buildings and equipment, along with costs for production admin-
istration and management. in the case of qualifying assets, specific and general borrowing 
costs directly relating to production of the relevant asset are recognized in the costs.
the net realizable value of inventories is calculated as the sales amount less costs of comple-
tion and costs incurred in effecting the sale, and is determined taking into account marketa-
bility, obsolescence and development in expected sales price.

4.2 receivables
section – working capital
in nkt group, receivables comprise trade and other receivables from external companies, 
other receivables from derivative financial instruments and prepayments. receivables are 
measured at amortized cost, which in all material respects corresponds to fair value and 
nominal value.
in nkt group, total receivables increased eur 114.8m from eur 224.0m in 2019 to eur 
333.2m in 2020. the increase was mainly driven by an increase of eur 88.1m in the deriva-
tive financial instruments due to increased commodity prices.
impairment on trade receivables amounted to 1% of trade receivables down from 3% in 
2019. for further information on credit risks, please see section 5.6.

for receivables, the expected credit losses are based on the historical credit losses combined with forward-looking information in 
macroeconomic factors effecting the credit risk. in 2020 credit losses recognized in the income statements count for 0.1% of total 
revenue. the expected loss rates are updated at every reporting date.
 
 accounting policy
trade receivables are at initial recognition measured at their 
transaction price less allowance for expected credit losses over 
the lifetime of the receivable and are subsequently measured 
at amortized cost adjusted for changes to the expected credit 
losses. expected credit losses at initial recognition are calculat-
ed for portfolios of receivables that share credit risk characteris-
tics and is based on historical experience and, when applicable, 
adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and general 
economic conditions. the portfolios are primarily based on the 
debtor’s domicile and credit rating in accordance with nkt 
groups credit risk management policy, see section 5.6.
when there is an indication of impairment, expected credit 
losses are calculated at individual level and when there are no 
reasonable expectations of recovering, the receivable is written 
off in part or entirely.
the allowances for expected credit losses and write-offs for 
trade receivables are recognized in the income statement as 
other costs.

4.4 changes in working capital in cash flow
section – working capital
 significant estimates 
construction contracts are measured based on management judgement 
in terms of stage-of-completion and estimated profit on a project-by-pro-
ject approach to estimate the expected selling prices which affect the 
value recognized in the balance sheet. the estimate includes a risk 
provision, which is based on an assessment of the specific risk that each 
project is exposed to.
therefore, the recognition of revenue and related contract assets and 
liabilities are subject to uncertainty. management’s estimates are based 
on the most likely outcomes of the projects. 
 
 accounting policy
construction contracts
construction contracts are measured at the selling price of the work 
performed less progress billings and anticipated losses. construction 
contracts are characterized by a high degree of customization in the 
design of the cables produced. it is furthermore a requirement that before 
commencement of the work, a binding contract is signed that will result 
in a fine or compensation in case of subsequent cancellation.
the contract value is measured according to the stage-of-completion at 
the balance sheet date and total expected income from the contract. the 
stage-of-completion is determined on the basis of an assessment of the 
work performed, calculated as the ratio of expenses incurred compared 
to total anticipated expenses on the contract concerned.
when it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed the total 
contract revenue, the anticipated loss on the contract is immediately 
recognized as an expense and a provision.
when income and expenses on a construction contract cannot be deter-
mined reliably, the contract value is measured as the costs incurred which 
are likely to be recoverable.
where the contract value of work performed exceeds progress billings 
and anticipated losses, the excess is recognized under contract receiva-
bles. if progress billings and anticipated losses exceed the value of work 
performed, the deficit is recognized in contract liabilities.
prepayments from customers are recognized under contract liabilities.
costs relating to sales work and securing contracts are recognized in 
the income statement as incurred unless they are directly attributable 
to a specific contract and it is probable at the time that the costs are 
occurred that the contract will materialize. in this case a contract asset is 
recognized.
when there is an indication of impairment, expected credit losses are 
calculated at individual level and when there are no reasonable expecta-
tions of recovering the amount due, the receivable is written off in part or 
entirely.
the allowances for expected credit losses and write-offs for trade receiv-
ables are recognized in the income statement as other costs.

section 4.4
section 5 – capital structure and financial risk management 
this section covers the nkt group’s 
capital structure, financial items, 
and financial risk management.
the nkt group’s overall policy is to maintain a capital 
structure that supports the strategic goals to deliver 
value and profitable growth.
the nkt group aims to be perceived as a company 
with an investment grade credit profile and there-
fore strives to maintain a capital structure within 
defined targets for solvency (ratio of minimum 30%) 
and operational ebitda leverage (ratio up to 1.0x). 
in november 2020, the leverage ratio target was 
lowered from 1.5x to 1.0x. the company is targeting 
a more robust capital structure as nkt will become 
a relatively larger project dependent business due to 
the planned investments in the solutions business line 
during 2020-2022 with large-scale complex projects 
and potentially large fluctuations in cash flows.
in periods where the capital structure targets are 
satisfied, nkt group cash flows are used for share-
holder distributions, or value adding investments or 
acquisitions. the company’s dividend policy targets 
pay-out of approximately one third of net result for 
the year, provided the capital structure allows for it. 
further excess cash may be distributed as share buy-
backs or extraordinary dividends. if not, cash flows 
are prioritized to repay debt. 
at end-2020 the solvency ratio was 49% and the 
leverage ratio (net interest-bearing debt relative to 
operational ebitda) was -0.4x. the debt reduction 
in 2020 was primarily driven by the two completed 
capital increases. no dividend payment is proposed in 
2021 as the net result in 2020 was negative.

section – capital structure and financial risk management 
nkt a/s’ share capital consists of shares with a nominal value of dkk 
20 each. no shares carry special rights. nkt a/s’ articles of association 
specify no limits in respect of ownership or voting right, and group man-
agement is unaware of any agreements in this regard.
distribution of dividend to shareholders of nkt a/s has no tax conse-
quences for the company.
at end-2020, nkt a/s did not hold any treasury shares (no treasury 
shares in 2019).
in order to strengthen the capital structure and ensure the financing of the 
production expansion demanded by the backlog as described in page 6 
in the management review, nkt have undertaken two capital increases in 
may and december 2020, comprising  15,695,115 shares at an average 
price of eur 17.05. costs relating to the two increases was eur 9.0m 
for a total net proceed of eur 258.6m.
three mandates have been issued by the shareholders at the general 
meeting in relation to the group’s capital structure:
1. the share capital may, by resolution of the board of directors, be 
increased by issue of shares to a maximum nominal amount of dkk 
256m in the period until 30 april 2025. with the increases in 2020, the 
remaining amount of the authorization is thus dkk 41,119,820. 
2. for the period until 31 march 2021 the board of directors is authorized 
to arrange for acquisition of the company’s own shares up to a nominal 
value of 10% of the share capital. 
3. in the period until 30 april 2025 loans may be raised against bonds or 
debt instruments in one of several transactions with a right for the lender 
to convert this claim to shares, each of a nominal value of dkk 20, up 
to a maximum nominal amount of dkk 128m (6.4 million new shares). 
this mandate is equally to capped to dkk 41,119,820 due to the capital 
increases in 2020.

3018 are accounted for as a hybrid capital reserve in equity. the classifi-
cation is based on the special characteristics of the hybrid bond, where 
the bondholders are subordinate to other creditors, and nkt a/s may 
defer and ultimately decide not to pay the coupon. 
as the principal of the securities ultimately falls due in 3018, its discount-
ed fair value is zero due to the terms of the securities. therefore, a liability 
of zero has been recognized in the balance sheet, and the full amount 
of the proceeds have been recognized as equity. coupon payments are 
recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same way as dividend 
payments within financing activities. 
 
 accounting policy
hybrid capital is treated in accordance with the rules on compound finan-
cial instruments based on the characteristics of the bonds. the notional 
amount, which constitutes a liability, is recognized at present value, and 
equity has been increased by the difference between the net proceeds 
received and the present value of the discounted liability. the part of the 
hybrid capital that is accounted for as a liability is measured at amortized 
cost. the carrying amount, amount to nil on initial recognition and due to 
the 1,000-year term of the hybrid capital, amortization charges will only 
have an impact on the income statement for the years at the end of the 
1,000-year term of the hybrid capital.
coupon payments are accounted for as dividends and are recognized 
directly in equity when the obligation to pay arises. the obligation to pay 
coupon payments is at the discretion of group management and deferred 
coupon lapses upon maturity of the hybrid capital. coupon payments are 
recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same way as dividend 
payments within financing activities.
on redemption of the hybrid capital, the payment will be distributed 
between liability and equity, applying the same principles as used when 
the hybrid capital was issued. the difference between the payment on 
redemption and the net proceeds received on issue is recognized directly 
in equity as the debt portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil during 
the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.
on the date on which the board of directors decides to exercise an op-
tion to redeem the hybrid capital, the part of the hybrid capital that will be 
redeemed will be reclassified to loans and borrowings. the reclassifica-
tion will be made at the market value of the hybrid capital at the date the 
decision is made. following the reclassification, coupon payments and 
exchange rate adjustments will be recognized in the income statement as 
financial income or expenses. 
hybrid capital comprise issued bonds from september 2018 of eur 
150m, which is subordinated to other creditors. 
the hybrid security bears a coupon of 5.375% until the first call date on 
12 september 2022 after which the coupon resets to the 4-year eur 
swap rate prevailing at that time plus 10.225%. it has a final maturity on 
12 september 3018. coupon payments may at the discretionary decision 
of nkt a/s be deferred and ultimately any deferred coupons outstanding 
in 3018 will be cancelled. however, deferred coupon payments become 
payable if nkt a/s decides to pay dividends to shareholders. coupon 
payments are also recognized in equity.

1 interest bearing loans and borrowings includes leasing liabilities recognized in the balance sheet, but not short term and low value leases, these are specified in note 3.2.
the items in the table to the left do not include interest. the forward 
contracts are recognized at fair value and the discount element is 
considered insignificant because of short maturity. interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are consequently recognized in the balance sheet at the 
amounts stated above.
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are predominantly based on 
floating interest rates and are measured at amortized cost. the carrying 
amount therefore corresponds in all material aspects to fair value and 
nominal value.
 
 accounting policy
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognized at the amount of 
proceeds received at the date of borrowing, net of transaction costs paid. 
in subsequent periods the financial liabilities are measured at amortized 
cost using ‘the effective interest method’, and the difference between 
the proceeds and the nominal value is therefore being recognized in the 
income statement under financial expenses over the term of the loan.
interest-bearing loans and borrowings also include the capitalized residu-
al lease obligations on finance leases measured at amortized cost.

5.6 financial risks and financial instruments
section – capital structure and financial risk management 
financial risk management policy
nkt is exposed to and manages several financial risks due to its oper-
ations, investments and financing activities. as a matter of policy, nkt 
does not actively speculate in financial risks.
the risk management policy is managed by group treasury. the general 
principle is that all known risks are hedged, though with acceptance of an 
open position within a defined threshold. the risk thresholds are defined 
to provide nkt with sufficient risk protection while giving group treasury 
some room for adjustment.
nkt uses financial instruments, such as forwards, swaps, interest rate 
caps, and options to hedge exposures relating to currency, interest rates, 
and commodities. at the end of 2020 and 2019 no option contracts were 
active.
the financial risks are divided into:
1. currency risks
2. interest rate risks
3. raw material price risks
4. credit risks
5. liquidity risks
currency risks
with presence in several countries nkt is exposed to currency risks 
that may have considerable influence on the income statement and 
balance sheet. currency risks refer to the risks of losses (or opportuni-
ties for gains) resulting from changes in currency rates. currency risks 
arise through transactions, financial assets, and liabilities denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the individual business-
es. quantification and identification of existing and anticipated currency 
risks are the responsibility for the individual businesses, while the actual 
hedging is executed by group treasury.
as a basic principle, the hedging of currency risk is not performed for net 
assets (equity) in foreign subsidiaries. gains and losses relating to un-
hedged net assets in foreign subsidiaries are accounted directly in other 
comprehensive income. for the most significant investments in foreign 
currency (sek, chf, czk, and pln), a rate of exchange which is 10% 
lower than the year-end 2020 exchange rate would reduce nkt a/s’ 
equity by eur 74.4m, compared to eur 72.8m in 2019.
significant currency risks relating to receivables and payables are hedged 
to the functional currency of the businesses. balances with credit insti-
tutions are mainly denominated in dkk and eur and do, therefore, not 
result in a significant currency risk for the group.
the principal currency exposure relates to sales and purchases in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the businesses. hedging 
of these currency risks is based on assessments of the likelihood of the 
future transaction being performed and whether the associated currency 
risk is significant.
expected cash flows with significant currency risk are hedged as they 
become known. currency risks from project-related sales are considered 
on an individual basis. the fair value of the effective part of the hedge is 
recognized in other comprehensive income on a continuous basis. the 
table below shows net outstanding forward exchange hedging contracts 
at 31 december for nkt which are used for and fulfil the conditions for 
hedge accounting of future transactions.
the fair value of the total portfolio of currency hedge contracts will impact 
other comprehensive income if currency rates change. the effect on 
earnings before tax of a 10% increase in selected currency rates is shown 
in the table.
as nkt currently only uses forwards and spots to hedge the fx risks, 
the likelihood of inefficiency is very low. changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument should therefore offset changes in the hedged item. 
all currency hedges are expected to be 100% effective, as the size and 
maturity of the hedging instrument should match the underlying.
the tables on the following page show net outstanding forward exchange 
hedging contracts at 31 december for nkt a/s, which are used for and 
fulfil the conditions for hedge accounting of future transactions.

interest rate risks
interest rate risks refer to the influence of changes in market interest rates 
on future cash flows concerning interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
at year-end, nkt a/s’ net interest-bearing debt was eur -25.9m. by 
comparison, at year-end 2019 nkt a/s’ net interest-bearing debt was 
eur 242.2m.
at year-end, an interest rate hedge of eur 120m was in place in the form 
of an interest rate cap with a strike of 0% maturing in june 2021. an 
interest rate hedge of eur 50m was also in place in form of an interest 
rate swap with a fixed rate of -0.2175 maturing in june 2025.
as of end-2020, the market values of the interest rate derivatives were in 
total eur -0.2m (eur -0.3m in 2019).
based on interest rates as of end-2020, a 1%-point rise in market interest 
rate would decrease pre-tax financial expenses by eur 2.3m.

5.6 financial risks and financial instruments – continued
section – capital structure and financial risk management 
raw material price risks
raw material price risks primarily relate to metals and plastics used in 
the cable production. when changes in raw material prices cannot be 
transferred to customers, nkt uses financial instruments to hedge the 
price risks.
exposures and hedging of current and expected future raw material risks 
are managed by the businesses based on adopted guidelines.
nkt hedge raw material via london metal exchange, and changes in the 
fair value of the hedging instrument offset overall changes in the value of 
the underlying raw material because the reference prices are the same for 
the hedging instrument and the hedge item, i.e. the hedge effectiveness 
is considered 100%. thus, the fair value of the hedging instrument forms 
the basis for recognizing any hedge ineffectiveness. only the hedge for 
plastic, which is hedged via gas-oil is done via a proxy hedge. ineffective-
ness because of differences in changes between gas-oil and plastic are 
considered to be insignificant.
as at 31 december 2020, nkt a/s had current financial hedging instru-
ments relating to future raw material supplies of a value of eur 548m 
(eur 209m in 2019) with a positive fair value of eur 90.1m (positive 
value of eur 6.2m in 2019).
it is estimated that, all other things being equal, a 10% increase in raw 
material prices would influence nkt’s other comprehensive income by 
around eur 54.8m for forward transactions for raw material supplies at 
31 december 2019 (eur 14.4m in 2019).
the fair value of the effective part of the hedge is recognized on a con-
tinuous basis in other comprehensive income as hedge of future cash 
flows and transferred to the same item as the hedged item in the income 
statement when the hedged transaction materializes. the impact of inef-
fectiveness on the income statement was negligible during the year.

raw materials.

5.6 financial risks and financial instruments – continued
section – capital structure and financial risk management 
credit risks
nkt’s credit risks relate partly to receivables and cash at bank and in 
hand, and partly to derivative financial instruments with positive fair value. 
the maximum credit risk attached to financial assets correspond to the 
values recognized in the balance sheet.
nkt has no material risks relating to a single customer or partner. nkt’s 
policy for acceptance of credit risks entails ongoing monitoring and credit 
rating of important customers and other partners. nkt obtains prepay-
ments or bank guarantees from customers when considered needed. 
thus, insurance cover and similar measures to hedge receivables are 
rarely applied as nkt historically has had only few material losses.
liquidity risks
it is nkt group’s policy to maintain adequate liquidity resources to im-
plement planned operating activities and to be able to operate effectively 
in the event of unforeseen fluctuations in liquidity. nkt group’s liquidity 
resources consist of cash, cash equivalents and undrawn committed 
credit facilities
at end-2020, nkt group’s total available liquidity resources amounted to 
eur 535.9m compared to eur 266.8m in 2019.
the eur 300m rcf matures in september 2022, while the mortgage 
loan portfolio matures in 2032 and 2033.
the rcf is the only financing instrument subject to financial covenants. 
these include agreed remedies in the form of security over nkt photon-
ics and the vessel nkt victoria. 
nkt group’s financing contains change of control clauses which comes 
into effect if a shareholder or shareholder group gains control over nkt 
a/s or if nkt a/s is no longer listed at nasdaq copenhagen.

fair values
financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are 
designated as belonging to one of the following three categories (the ‘fair 
value hierarchy’):
level 1:  listed prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
and liabilities
level 2:  input, other than listed prices on level 1, which is observable for 
the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived 
from prices)
level 3:  input for the asset or liability which is not based on observable 
market data (non-observable input)
financial instruments measured at fair value consist of derivative financial 
instruments. the fair value at 31 december 2020 and 2019 of nkt 
group’s forward transactions are measured in accordance with level 2 as 
the fair value is based on official exchange rates and forward rates at the 
balance sheet date.

nkt group’s auditor fees increased from eur 1.1m in 2019 to eur 1.6m 
in 2020 driven by higher cost related to statutory audit and non-audit 
services predominantly related to review and assurance in connection 
with the capital increase. 
the fee for non-audit services delivered by deloitte statsautoriseret 
revisionspartnerselskab to the group amounts to eur 0.3 million (eur 
0.1 million in 2019) and predominantly consists of services in relation to 
q3 review and capital increase, issuance of various assurance reports as 
well as advisory services.
7.2 events after the balance sheet date
management is not aware of any subsequent matters that could be of 
material importance to nkt group’s financial position.
 significant judgements 
the nkt group is a party to various disputes and inquiries from authori-
ties whose outcome is not expected to materially affect profit for the year 
and the financial position. in connection with disposal of companies in 
previous years, guarantees have been provided which are not expected 
to materially affect on profit for the year. further, nkt is a party to various 
insurance claims whose outcome is still uncertain and not recognized in 
the financial statement at the balance sheet day.
nkt group is jointly liable for danish corporate taxes on dividend, interest 
and royalties together with nilfisk up until the demerger in october 2017.
in a few cases the nkt group’s foreign companies are subject to special 
tax schemes to which certain conditions are attached. as at 31 decem-
ber 2020 these conditions were complied with.
guarantees
as part of our commercial activities nkt has provided guarantees mainly 
relating to high-voltage projects, which is to cover for the risk relating to 
our performance inherent in such projects, the quality and delays.  
at 31 december 2020 the value of issued guarantees was eur 991.8m 
(eur 644.3m in 2019). at the balance sheet date none of the issued 
guarantees are expected to materialize.
pledges
non-current assets with carrying amount of eur 332.4m (eur 359.3m in 
2019) have been pledged as security for mortgage loans and the revolv-
ing credit facility of total eur 161.8m (eur 211.8m in 2019).

 accounting policy
contingent liabilities
disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities and when they must be 
recognized is derived from evaluations of the expected outcome of the 
individual issues. these evaluations are based on legal opinions of the 
agreements contracted, which in significant instances also include opin-
ions obtained from external advisors, including lawyers.
assets are recognized when it is virtually certain that the issue will have 
a positive outcome for the company. a liability is recognized when it is 
likely that, at the balance sheet date, there will be an outflow from the 
group’s financial resources and when the liability can be reliably stated. if 
this is not the case, the matter is disclosed in the sections to the financial 
statements. decisions relating to such situations may in future accounting 
periods lead to realized gains or losses that may differ significantly from 
the recognized amounts or disclosures.

 accounting judgements and estimates
estimation uncertainty
determining the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires 
estimates of how future events will influence the value of these assets 
and liabilities at the balance sheet date. estimates that are significant for 
the financial reporting for the parent company are made by establishing 
indication of impairment and reversal of write-down on investments in 
subsidiaries. the estimates used are based on assumptions which by 
group management are considered to be reliable, but which by nature 
are uncertain and unpredictable. the assumptions may be incomplete or 
inaccurate, and unexpected events or circumstances may arise.
furthermore, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties which 
may lead to actual results differing from these estimates.
particularly, risks relating to the nkt group are included in the sections to 
the consolidated financial statements and sections on risk management 
in the business units sections.
accounting estimates
when preparing the financial statements for nkt a/s, a number of 
accounting estimates are made that affect the profit (loss) and balance 
sheet. estimates are regularly reassessed by management on the basis of 
historical experience and other relevant factors.
if there is any indication that the carrying amount of shares or receivables 
in a subsidiary is higher than future estimated earnings in that entity, we 
test for impairment. the recoverable amount is calculated based on sig-
nificant estimates and assumptions related to the future earnings of that 
company. no impairment was recorded in 2020.

financial risk, financial instruments and management
management of capital structure at nkt a/s (parent company) is per-
formed for the group as a whole and no operational targets or policies 
are therefore established independently for the parent company. see 
section 5.6 to the consolidated financial statements and the sections 
‘risk management’ in the business units sections.
in order to strengthen the capital structure and ensure the financing of the 
production expansion demanded by the backlog as described in page 6 
in the management review, nkt have undertaken two capital increases in 
may and december 2020, comprising 15,695,115 shares at an average 
price of eur 17.05. costs relating to the two increases was eur 9.0m 
for a total net proceed of eur 258.6m.
nkt a/s has in september 2018 issued bonds of eur 150m accounted 
for as hybrid capital reserve under equity. for more information refer to

11 accounting policies
the annual financial statements for the parent company are included in 
the annual report in pursuance of the requirements of the danish finan-
cial statements act.
the annual financial statements for the parent company are prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted by 
the eu and additional danish disclosure requirements for annual reports 
for listed companies.
changes to accounting policies
the changes, as described in the consolidated financial statements, have 
not influenced recognition and measurement in the financial statements 
of the parent company in 2020. see the description of the changes in 
section 1.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
description of accounting policies
in relation to the accounting policies described for the financial state-
ments of the group (see section 1.1 to the consolidated financial 
statements), the accounting policies of the parent company differ in the 
following:
foreign currency translation
translation adjustment of balances considered part of the total net 
investment in subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than dkk 
are recognized in the annual financial statements for the parent company 
under financial items in the income statement.
dividend from investments in subsidiaries
dividends from investments in subsidiaries are recognized in the income 
statement of the parent company in the year the dividends are declared. 
if the dividend distributed exceeds the comprehensive income of the 
subsidiaries in the period the dividend is declared, an impairment test is 
performed.
investments in subsidiaries
investments in subsidiaries are measured at acquisition costs. if there is 
indication of impairment, impairment testing is carried out as described in 
the accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements. where 
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount it is written down to 
the recoverable amount.
tax
the parent company is jointly taxed with all danish subsidiaries within the 
nkt group. nkt a/s (parent company) is the administration company 
for the joint taxation and consequently settles all payments of tax with 
the tax authorities. joint taxation contributions to/from subsidiaries are 
recognized under income tax related to net profit. tax payable and tax re-
ceivable are stated under current assets/liabilities. joint tax contributions 
payable and receivable, respectively, are recognized separately in the bal-
ance sheet. companies that use tax losses in other companies pay joint 
taxation contributions to the parent company equivalent to the tax base 
of the tax losses utilized. companies whose tax losses are used by other 
companies receive joint taxation contributions from the parent company 
equivalent to the tax base of the tax losses utilized (full absorption).

the board of directors and the executive 
management have today considered 
and adopted the annual report of nkt

in our opinion the consolidated financial

situation of the group, financial results for 
the period, the general financial position 
of the group, and a description of major 
risks and elements of uncertainty faced 
by the group.

to the shareholders of nkt a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial 
statements of nkt a/s for the financial 
year 01.01.2020 - 31.12.2020, which com-
prise the income statement, statement of 
comprehensive income, balance sheet, 
statement of changes in equity, cash flow 
statement and notes, including a summa-
ry of significant accounting policies, for 
the group as well as for the parent. the 
consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements are prepared 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial 
statements give a true and fair view of 
the group’s and the parent’s financial 
position at 31.12.2020, and of the results 
of their operations and cash flows for the 
financial year 01.01.2020 - 31.12.2020 in 
accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our audit 
book comments issued to the audit com-
mittee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance 
with international standards on auditing 
(isas) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. our respon-
sibilities under those standards and 
requirements are further described in the 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements section of 
this auditor’s report. we are independ-
ent of the group in accordance with the 
international ethics standards board of 
accountants' code of ethics for profes-
sional accountants (iesba code) and 
the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. we believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, 
we have not provided any prohibited 
non-audit services as referred to in article 
5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014.
we were appointed auditors of nkt 
a/s for the first time on 21.03.2013 for 
the financial year 2013. we have been 
reappointed annually by decision of the 
general meeting for a total contiguous 
engagement period of 8 years up to and 
including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters 
that, in our professional judgement, were 
of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements for the finan-
cial year 01.01.2020 - 31.12.2020. these 
matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the parent financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
valuation of construction contracts  
refer to notes 1.3, 2.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.6 in 
the consolidated financial statements.
significant judgements are required 
by management in determining stage 
of completion and estimating profit on 
each project, including assessment 
of provisions for specific project risks. 
minor changes in the stage of comple-
tion and specific project risks can have 
a significant impact on the valuation and 
recognition of construction contracts and 
income for the year.
accordingly, the valuation of construc-
tion contracts especially relating to high 
voltage offshore contracts is considered 
to be a key audit matter.
how the matter was  
addressed in the audit
based on our risk assessment, we have 
assessed the relevant internal controls for 
construction contracts primarily relating 
to contract acceptance, change orders, 
monitoring of project development, 
costs incurred and estimation of costs 
to complete and assessment of specific 
project risks.
we obtained from management an 
overview of the group’s construction 
contracts at 31 december 2020 relating 
to high voltage offshore contracts cov-
ering both in progress contracts as of 
year-end and contracts completed during 
the year. based on assessed project risks 
and materiality, we selected a sample of 
contracts where we obtained the under-
lying contracts, including change orders, 
original budget and any changes made 
to original budgets, including estimates 
of costs to complete, project reports and 
overview of the risk register and corre-
sponding risk provision, where deemed 
relevant by us.
for the selected contracts, we assessed 
and challenged management’s assump-
tions for determining stage of completion 
with due consideration to its assessment 
of project risks and risk provisions and 
estimated profit/loss through interviews 
with project controllers, project manage-

ment, legal department and management 
representatives as well as our under-
standing and assessment of the contract 
terms, associated project risks, including 
valuation of change orders under discus-
sion with customers and final acceptance. 
additionally, we attended project steering 
committee meetings at which project 
performance, cost to complete and 
project risk register, including likelihood of 
the risk materialising, were discussed and 
assessed in detail.
for the selected completed contracts, 
we performed retrospective reviews of 
assessment of project risk and develop-
ment and utilisation of risk provisions to 
assess the completeness and accuracy 
of management’s assumptions applied 
throughout the contract period.
impairment test of  
non-current assets
refer to notes 1.1, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the 
consolidated financial statements.
the recoverable amount of non-current 
assets in the group’s high voltage power 
cable business (solutions) is dependent 
on the expected increase in operational 
ebitda and that the operational ebitda 
level can be sustained in the long term. 
the determination of recoverable amount 
for solutions is based on the value-in-
use derived from future free net cash 
flow based on budgets and the strategy 
for the coming years and free net cash 
flows from the terminal period. significant 
judgement is required by management 
in determining value-in-use, including 
cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets for 2021 and financial forecasts 
for 2022-2026, and growth rate in the 
terminal period and the discount rate to 
be applied.
accordingly, the carrying value of 
non-current assets for solutions is con-
sidered to be a key audit matter.
how the matter was  
addressed in the audit
based on our risk assessment, we have 
obtained and evaluated management’s 
determination of future cash flow fore-
casts for solutions and the underlying 
process by which they were drawn up, in-
cluding the mathematical accuracy of the 
valuation models applied and agreeing 
future growth, investments and margin 
assumptions to the latest board approved 
budget for 2021 and financial forecasts 
for 2022-2026. we used our valuation 
specialists to assist us in evaluating the 
appropriateness of key market-related 
assumptions in management’s valuation 
models, including discount rates and 
terminal growth rates. we assessed and 
challenged key assumptions applied in 
management’s future forecasts of growth, 
investments and margins included in the 
cash flow forecasts.
in assessing the level of headroom at 
solutions level we performed down-
side sensitivity analyses around the key 
assumptions, using a range of higher 
discount rates, lower terminal growth 
rates and lower ebitda levels.
valuation of deferred tax assets
refer to notes 1.1 and 2.6 in the consoli-
dated financial statements.
the valuation of deferred tax assets is 
based on an assessment of the recovera-
ble value of tax losses carried forward as 
well as the part of deductible temporary 
tax differences expected to be utilised 
within a foreseeable future. significant 
judgement is required by management in 
determining the recoverable value, includ-
ing projections of future taxable income, 
based on financial budgets for 2021 and 
financial forecasts for 2022-2025.
accordingly, the valuation of deferred tax 
assets is considered to be a key audit 
matter. 
how the matter was  
addressed in the audit
based on our risk assessment, we have, 
in assessing the valuation of deferred tax 
assets, obtained and evaluated manage-
ment’s expectations of generating future 
taxable profits in the foreseeable future, 
especially in germany and denmark, and 
the underlying process by which they 
were drawn up, including the mathemati-
cal accuracy of the models, and agreeing 
future growth and margin assumptions 
to the latest board approved budget for 
2021 and financial forecasts for 2022-
2025 as well as the expected related 
utilisation of the deferred tax asset. we 
assessed and challenged the reasona-
bleness of management’s determination 
of expected future taxable profits in the 
light of management’s plans for improving 
the operational results in germany and 
denmark.
in assessing the valuation of deferred tax 
assets, we performed downside sensitiv-
ity analysis around the key assumptions 
by using a range of lower growth rates 
and margins.
statement on the  
management commentary
management is responsible for the man-
agement commentary.
our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial state-
ments does not cover the management 
commentary, and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the management 
commentary and, in doing so, consider 
 
annual report 2020 | nkt a/s | 147
whether the management commentary is 
materially inconsistent with the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements or our knowledge ob-
tained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to con-
sider whether the management commen-
tary provides the information required 
under the danish financial statements 
act.
based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that the management 
commentary is in accordance with the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements and has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement of the manage-
ment commentary.
management's responsibilities 
for the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent  
financial statements
management is responsible for the prepa-
ration of consolidated financial statements 
and parent financial statements that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting stand-
ards as adopted by the eu and additional 
requirements of the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal 
control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements and 
parent financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial state-
ments, management is responsible for 
assessing the group’s and the parent’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern, and for using the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent financial statements unless 
management either intends to liquidate 
the group or the entity or to cease oper-
ations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
auditor's responsibilities for the 
audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent  
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidat-
ed financial statements and the parent 
financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. reason-
able assurance is a high level of assur-
ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and 
the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. misstate-
ments can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements 
and these parent financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in ac-
cordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, 
we exercise professional judgement and 
maintain professional scepticism through-
out the audit. we also: 
 
■
identify and assess the risks of mate-
rial misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent 
financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. the risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
 
■
obtain an understanding of internal 
control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are ap-
propriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opin-
ion on the effectiveness of the group’s 
and the parent’s internal control. 
 
■
evaluate the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the rea-
sonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by 
management.
 
■
conclude on the appropriateness 
of management’s use of the go-
ing concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements, and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the group's and the parent’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
if we conclude that a material uncer-
tainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent 
financial statements or, if such disclo-
sures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. however, 
future events or conditions may cause 
the group and the entity to cease to 
continue as a going concern.

■
evaluate the overall presentation, 
structure and content of the consol-
idated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements, including 
the disclosures in the notes, and 
whether the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial 
statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner 
that gives a true and fair view.
 
■
obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express 
an opinion on the consolidated finan-
cial statements. we are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we 
remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
we communicate with those charged 
with governance regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
we also provide those charged with gov-
ernance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical require-
ments regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably 
be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with 
those charged with governance, we de-
termine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidat-
ed financial statements and the parent 
financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. 
we describe these matters in our audi-
tor’s report unless law or regulation pre-
cludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such commu-
nication.
