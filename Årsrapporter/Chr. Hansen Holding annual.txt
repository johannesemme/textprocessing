antimicrobial resistance is one of the 
greatest threats we face as a global 
community. if no action is taken, 
drug-resistant diseases could cause 
10 million deaths each year by 2050. 
action is required for more prudent 
use of antimicrobials in humans and 
animals as well as the urgent phase out 
of antimicrobials as growth promoters. 
probiotics can be part of the solution.

key figures overview
letter to stakeholders 
we are now one year into delivering on our 2025 
strategy and are cementing our position as a global, 
differentiated bioscience company focused on 
microbial and fermentation technology platforms. 
2020/21 was a year of transition for chr. hansen as 
we executed on our recent portfolio changes. we have 
largely completed the integration of uas labs and hso 
health care, our hmo team is addressing some initial 
challenges, and we have successfully divested the 
natural colors division.
despite the volatile macro-economic environment 
and the increased activity generated by the portfolio 
changes, we generally delivered in line with our group 
guidance. organic growth ended at 7%, we achieved 
an ebit margin before special items of 27.7% and 
free cash flow before special items, acquisitions and 
divestment came in at eur 196m.
while our share price performance in 2020/21 was 
below our peer benchmark, we firmly believe that 
we are creating a stronger company ready to deliver 
industry-leading profitable organic growth. we will 
achieve this through a relentless focus on innovation, 
efficiencies, strong customer relationships and with 
passionate employees. 
creating value for all our stakeholders 
with the coronavirus pandemic pressuring nations, 
health care systems and supply chains, common 
global concerns about health and sustainability have 
intensified. as a result, stakeholder expectations for 
corporate citizenship have further increased. 
there is no question that companies today must focus 
on profit, planet and people to remain competitive 
going forward.
at chr. hansen, we are committed to creating value for 
all our stakeholders and we have adopted a number of 
actions in the past year to demonstrate this, including 
by reconfirming our support to the un global compact 
and combining our annual and sustainability reporting 
to describe our value creation in a holistic way. 
with regards to our diversity targets, we made 
significant progress in 2020/21 and we are proud to 
note that we have reached, already this year, our 2025 
goal of having 30% women in director+ positions. we 
are also pleased to have a 50/50 gender-balanced 
board of directors with six different nationalities 
represented. as part of our climate program, we have 
submitted our science based targets, and we have 
conducted various risk sessions as a first step in getting 
ready to implement the recommendations of the 
task force for climate-related financial disclosures. 
aiming to strengthen our governance around climate 
and social issues, our board of directors has decided to 
further enhance its oversight of esg. 
enabling healthier living
the pandemic has triggered a renewed focus on 
immunity, healthy living and climate-smart agriculture 
and food production. chr. hansen’s microbial and 
fermentation technology platforms hold vast potential 
in addressing those challenges. as an innovation-
driven company we strive to continuously raise the bar 
and bring new products with enhanced functionalities 
and better performance to our customers. 
in 2020/21, our food cultures & enzymes 
business launched an all-time high number of new 
products including our next generation cultures for 
fermentation-enabled bioprotection. the launch 
received very positive feedback from customers aiming

to fight food waste and extend the shelf life of their 
dairy products in a clean label-friendly way.
we are also pleased that our newly established 
fermented plant bases lighthouse has gotten off to 
a promising start. chr. hansen’s fermentation and 
application expertise can play a unique role in enabling 
the ‘new food world’ by securing the right texture and 
taste and helping to take the category from niche to 
mainstream. 
enabling new industries is also what we have set out 
to do with our hmo business and bacthera, our joint 
venture with swiss pharma manufacturer lonza. 
through the acquisition of jennewein in 2020, we 
added hmos to our product offering. short for human 
milk oligosaccharides, hmos are essential groups 
of milk sugars found only in human breast milk and 
known to provide a number of benefits in the healthy 
development of infants. by adding hmos as an 
ingredient produced via fermentation, we can help 
bring infant formula closer to mother’s milk. while 
covid-19 registration delays initially affected the 
hmo market, the long-term potential and market 
attractiveness of this emerging field remains intact. 
with bacthera, we are on a mission to become the 
preferred contract development and manufacturing 
partner for the live biotherapeutic industry that aims 
to bring life-changing treatments to patients, based 
on good bacteria. bacthera has already successfully 
won and executed several projects for customers, 
and reached a major milestone in may 2021, when it 
received its manufacturing licenses for clinical trial 
production. 
following the acquisitions of uas labs and hso 
health care, our human health business is uniquely 
positioned to shape the global probiotics market of 
the future. with our strain to solution™ offering 
we are now able to support our broadened customer 
base along the entire value chain from strain selection 
to consumer packaging, enabling customers to bring 
innovative probiotic solutions to consumers at all 
life stages. we have also demonstrated industry 
leadership by establishing the probiotics institute, 
a global science-based online platform dedicated 
to educating and inspiring about probiotics and the 
human microbiome. 
our plant health and animal health businesses remain 
important contributors to more sustainable agricultural 
production. by offering alternatives to chemical 
pesticides and antibiotic growth promoters they enable 
farmers to produce high quality, sustainable and safe 
foods demanded by consumers all over the world. in 
2020/21, plant health entered new markets in the us 
and canada and expanded its product offering with the 
launch of a new biostimulant. animal health further 
expanded its global presence outside of north america 
and launched new products including our first range of 
probiotics for pets.  
looking across the group, chr. hansen has a unique 
role to play in enabling healthier living and contributing 
to a more sustainable food system, supported by 
our strong innovation expertise. we own one of the 
industry’s largest culture collections with around 
40,000 microbial strains which allows for extensive 
screening and selection of the best available 
combinations of good bacteria. we have the know-how 
to transform these bacteria into safe and high-quality 
products and solutions that truly make a difference 
and help us “grow a better world. naturally.” a highly 
meaningful cause that drives us every day. 
� we are creating a stronger company  
ready to deliver industry-leading 
profitable growth through a 
relentless focus on innovation, 
efficiencies, strong customer 
relationships and with passionate

pharmacist christian d. a. hansen who invented 
an industrial process to extract rennet for cheese 
making, and has since then developed into a microbial 
powerhouse.

& nutrition. food cultures & enzymes comprises 
our dairy and food and beverages activities. health 
& nutrition comprises four business units: human 
health, animal health, plant health and human milk 
oligosaccharides (hmo).
chr. hansen’s natural colors division was divested to 
the nordic private equity group eqt in march 2021 
and no longer forms part of the group. the division is 
reported as discontinued operations in our 2020/21 
annual report.  
position within value chain and key markets
as a specialty ingredient supplier, chr. hansen 
exclusively operates as a business-to-business

strategically important for our customers as they can:
• define and differentiate the end product 
• support health and well-being
• increase productivity and yield 
• extend shelf life and increase food safety 
• contribute to reducing antibiotic usage  
• offer an alternative to chemicals.
chr. hansen is a global, differentiated bioscience company headquartered in 
hørsholm, denmark, that develops and produces microbial solutions for the 
food and beverages, nutritional, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. the

core business is very low, given that cultures and 
enzymes are indispensable ingredients in yogurt 
and for cheesemakers. in health & nutrition and our 
lighthouses, the substitution risk is higher, as our 
products compete with alternative technologies or 
non-usage. as such, adoption is more dependent on 
customers’ willingness to innovate and embrace new 
technologies. 
competitive landscape
generating eur 1,077m revenue in 2020/21, chr. 
hansen is the world’s largest food cultures and dairy 
enzymes producer and a leading manufacturer of 
probiotics and hmos.
chr. hansen operates in several niche markets with 
different competitive dynamics. market concentration 
is the highest in food cultures & enzymes, with the 
top three players combined accounting for most 
of the global market. the competitive landscape is 
relatively stable, and no meaningful new entrants have 
emerged over the past decade. in health & nutrition, 
competition is more diverse and dynamic given the 
relatively larger market opportunity. that said, chr. 
hansen holds leading positions in all its segments 
except for plant health. 
significant features of legal, regulatory and 
macroeconomic environment 
external factors such as economic growth, consumer 
income or commodity prices impact our businesses to 
varying degrees. purchasing power, for example, is an 
important indicator for discretionary product categories 
such as probiotics and hmos or regional markets 
where dairy is not a food staple. commodity prices, 
on the other hand, that drive farmer economics in the 
agricultural industry such as raw milk, livestock or feed 
prices can impact purchase decisions for our animal and 
plant health products. 
the regulatory environment depends on the targeted 
application and country of destination. in most 
jurisdictions, chr. hansen’s products are subject to 
general food law and food safety regulations. whilst 
requirements for substantiating the safety and efficacy 
of ingredients are converging, regulatory approval and 
product registration timelines for some industries, e.g. 
agricultural solutions, can be quite a lengthy process 
despite regulators’ efforts to support technologies that 
contribute to more sustainable development like the 
eu green deal. complexity and lack of harmonization 
presents another challenge, particularly for our 
probiotics business where health claim labelling varies 
considerably between regions.

chr. hansen is pioneering microbial 
science to improve food, health and 
productivity for a sustainable future. 
grow a better world. naturally.
addressing some of today’s most pressing challenges 
such as climate change, transition to a circular 
economy and restoration of biodiversity will require a 
tremendous joint effort from regulators, society and 
businesses and quantum leap innovations across many 
industries. at chr. hansen, we believe that microbial 
science and fermentation will be a key enabler in 
driving this change over the coming decades.
by unlocking the power of good bacteria™, we 
contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable 
food system - a system capable of feeding the growing 
population while reducing its adverse impact on 
climate, natural resources, biodiversity and health 
– all the way from farm to fork. 
our commitment to drive change is reflected in our 
company purpose “grow a better world. naturally.”, 
which serves as a guiding principle for innovation  
and decision-making across the company.

turning global challenges into 
microbial opportunities
as a sustainability enabler, chr. hansen 
offers food producers, farmers and the 
nutritional industry microbial solutions 
that enable more sustainable agricul-
ture, cleaner labels and healthier living 
for more people around the world.
microbial solutions carry great potential and with in-
creasing public awareness, better understanding of the 
benefits of ‘good bacteria’ and growing support from 
regulators and policymakers, we expect adoption rates 
for microbial solutions to rise over the coming years.
healthier living 
concerns about health issues are on the rise and 
consumers are fundamentally changing their views 
on health and wellness. particularly immune health 
has grown into a crucial concern for many consumers, 
prompting an increase in the consumption of vitamins 
and supplements.
chr. hansen’s probiotics strains address this rising con-
sumer demand. whether enjoyed as part of a yogurt or 
as a dietary supplement, our well-documented strains 
such as l. casei 431®, lgg® and bb-12® have the po-
tential to support the immune response and respiratory 
health1).
hmos also bring unique health benefits for infants 
from the very start of their life. hmos provide infants 
with important milk components when breastfeeding 
is not an option or choice. additionally, our cultures 
enable food producers to make dairy or meat products 
with reduced levels of sugar, salt or fat, without com-
promising on taste and texture. 
live biotherapeutics 
with an increasing number of therapies related to the 
human microbiome under development, live biothera-
peutic products, or ‘bugs as drugs’, is a very promising 
market. with the potential for targeting a broad range 
of health applications such as infectious diseases, 
immune diseases and oncology, the potential impact of 
the industry can be game changing for global health.
through bacthera, our joint venture with lonza, we 
offer pharma and microbiome players full supply chain 
support from pre-clinical development to commercial 
production. as a specialist contract development and 
manufacturing organization, bacthera will be a crucial 
partner and enabler in helping to bring the first live bi-
otherapeutic products to market and we estimate that 
the addressable market for live biotherapeutics con-
tract manufacturing for clinical and commercial supply 
has the potential to exceed eur 1 billion long-term. 
during the financial year 2020/21, bacthera reached  
a key milestone as the drug production facility in basel, 
switzerland and the drug substance facility in  
hørsholm, denmark, were granted their manufacturing 
licenses by the respective health authorities. bacthera, 
which has grown into an organization of about  
70 employees since being established in 2019, is now 
ready to offer customers one of the world’s most 
advanced pharma manufacturing supply chains for live 
biotherapeutic products. 
antibiotic resistance 
antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global 
health, food security, and development today2). antibiotic 
resistance occurs naturally, but excessive overuse of 
antibiotics by humans and in animals is accelerating the 
process. among the measures to control and prevent the 
spread of antibiotic resistance are efforts to prevent infec-
tions and stop using antibiotics as growth promoters or as 
a disease prevention method in livestock production. 
in animal health, our probiotics for cattle, swine & poul-
try such as bovamine® and gallipro® fit have shown, 
among other things, to support normal gastrointestinal 
functions, decrease weekly health events, decrease patho-
gen counts and decrease the use and costs of antibiotics. 
more sustainable agriculture
the global agricultural industry is facing ever more 
challenging conditions due to increasingly harsh weather 
conditions, pest resistance development and a decline in 
new chemical technology entering the market3). against 
this backdrop, it is vital to find new ways to protect crops 
against diseases and increase yields in a sustainable way.

turning global challenges
chr. hansen’s plant health business develops targeted 
microbial solutions for enhanced crop protection such 
as biopesticides, biofungicides and biostimulants. the 
microbes live in and on plants, roots and soil and pro-
vide them with the benefits of increased root develop-
ment and better uptake of water and nutrients, as well 
as disease protection and resilience against drought. 
bringing back naturally occurring bacteria not only 
makes sense from a performance perspective but also 
in terms of its impact on biodiversity and soil quality.
today, most of our plant health business is selling 
bionematicides for sugarcane and soybean production 
in latin america, but we are also expanding into other 
markets. in 2020/21, we launched accudo®, a new 
biostimulant for fruit and vegetables in south korea 
which can deliver meaningful yield gains. at the crop 
science forum and awards 2020, accudo® received 
the prestigious award of ‘best new biological.’ 
climate change 
with food production estimated to account for nearly 
one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions4), imme-
diate action is needed to circumvent the negative  
impact of climate change and get on a trajectory 
aligned with the paris agreement. chr. hansen is 
uniquely positioned through our food cultures & 
enzymes and animal health portfolios to enable dairy 
producers, farmers and feed mills to produce more ef-
ficiently by increasing yield per input or reducing waste 
in production e.g. through better protection against 
contaminants, improved health for animals or more 
efficient product applications. 
the rise of plant-based alternatives 
more and more consumers seek dairy and meat alter-
natives as part of a flexitarian diet in which health and 
sustainability are core values. with our long-standing 
experience in fermentation, chr. hansen is uniquely 
positioned to support customers on their fermented 
plant bases journey and be an enabler for this emerging 
industry. today, we estimate that around 1%-2% of the 
global yogurt category is based on alternative protein 
sources such as soy, oat and pulses, but this niche 
segment is expected to grow rapidly. 
as part of the 2025 strategy, chr. hansen will invest in its 
new fermented plant bases lighthouses to develop new, 
innovative solutions that will help producers overcome 
some of the key challenges relating to taste, texture and 
nutrition. with the launch of the vega� brand and the 
expansion of our culture range, chr. hansen made good 
progress in 2020/21 and now has a great product offer-
ing that covers different raw material bases and product 
needs. chr. hansen aims to be the preferred supplier for 
fermented products – no matter which protein source.  
food waste 
one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. the 
impact on climate is significant as food waste accounts 
for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. food waste 
is a global issue that is high on the consumer agenda  
– 77% of consumers worldwide try to reduce their own 
food waste. 
chr. hansen’s fermentation-enabled bioprotection 
offering can be part of the solution and help producers 
and consumers prevent food waste before it occurs. 
through the ancient art of fermentation, food cultures 
help protect dairy, meat and other non-fermented food 
products against spoilage caused by yeast and mold 
and against pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria. this 
way, they help enhance food safety and quality, while 
prolonging shelf-life and reducing food waste.

how we create value
chr. hansen’s business model is centered around our unique fermentation and microbial technology 
platforms backed by nearly 150 years of experience, a scalable production set-up as well as long-standing 
relationships with customers – all of which together puts us in a very strong competitive position. 
inputs
to unlock the full potential as a global leader in fermen-
tation and microbial solutions, chr. hansen draws on a 
variety of resources including:
• human capital: a highly skilled and diverse work-
force 
• intellectual capital: a strong r&d engine and intel-
lectual property 
• natural capital: access to nature´s microbial diversi-
ty via our culture collection of about 40,000 strains 
and natural resources such as energy and water 
• manufacturing capital: best-in-class fermentation 
facilities and a global network of application centers 
• social capital: close collaboration with customers, 
regulators, industry associations, academia and 
other stakeholders 
• financial capital: strong internal cash flows and 
access to external funding.
business activities
chr. hansen’s r&d and production backbone spans 
across food cultures & enzymes and health & nutri-
tion, whilst commercial activities and strategies are 
tailored to the different customer groups and  
end markets.
when it comes to generating value from the resources 
we deploy, we consider the following to be our most 
critical business activities:
• research & development: pioneer microbial science 
to develop new products that meet customer needs 
• global operations: secure production capacity and 
drive efficiencies to unlock fuel for growth whilst 
minimizing our environmental footprint 
• sales & application: excel in customer centricity 
with superior product offering, best-in-class  
technical support and local presence
• human resources: invest in talent and diversity 
• finance: ensure efficient capital and resource  
allocation to support strategic agenda
• stakeholder engagement: engage in partnerships 
and advocacy to promote the adoption of microbial 
solutions. 
outputs and outcomes
the outputs of our value chain are microbial products 
such as cultures, probiotics, enzymes and hmos that 
are being used in the food, nutritional and agricultural 
sectors and that on many occasions enable more 
sustainable business practices. the positive impact of 
our products is partly offset by the negative impact our 
manufacturing processes have on the environment.   
as a supplier to the dairy and animal farming indus-
tries, we also acknowledge the challenges our custom-
ers are facing when it comes to climate impact. at the 
same time, we strongly believe in dairy as an important 
source of nutrition and livelihood for a growing world 
population. as demand for dairy and meat products 
is expected to grow at a low single-digit rate for the 
foreseeable future, we want to work side by side with 
our customers to drive efficiencies in dairy farming and 
make livestock production more sustainable, whilst 
investing in solutions for alternative protein bases with 
lower carbon footprints.
materiality 
chr. hansen’s ability to create value is dependent on a number of matters 
of either a financial or non-financial nature. material matters are defined 
as matters that substantively affect chr. hansen’s financial performance 
(financial materiality) or have a meaningful impact on our stakeholders 
or the environment (environmental and social materiality). relevant 
environmental and social matters have been identified and prioritized 
using a variety of sources including desktop research, peer benchmarking, 
sustainability reporting standards, our enterprise risk management 
framework as well as an internal stakeholder survey.  
the outcome has been reviewed by representatives of the corporate 
leadership team and is reflected in detail in the business model and risk 
management chapters.

research & development 
developing products with impact
chr. hansen possesses unrivalled 
capabilities across the entire innovation 
value chain from discovery to scale-up.
the microbial powerhouse 
our r&d organization is responsible for new product 
development in food cultures & enzymes and health 
& nutrition as well as process innovations and the 
continuous improvement of our technology base.
r&d collaborates very closely with our different 
application departments that provide crucial product 
knowledge and customer insights. they are experts 
when it comes to understanding how our microbes 
work in the end application – whether it is cow’s milk, 
plant roots, a human or an animal gut – and thus are 
key contributors to the innovation process.
chr. hansen’s r&d activities are bundled at the global 
headquarters in denmark with satellites in germany 
and india, whilst application operates a network of 
28 centers across the world to ensure proximity to 
customers and local market understanding. our global 
innovation campus in denmark is currently being 
expanded with inauguration expected in 2023. 
strong base for the development of our next generation 
products.
combinatorial microbiology is used in the development 
process to determine which and how many strains 
a finished product with certain functionalities must 
contain. this is done in close collaboration with 
product management and regulatory. 
before new health & nutrition products can be 
tested in vivo, i.e. in humans and animals, the strains 
are thoroughly tested for biosafety and analyzed in 
artificial gut systems which contain live isolated cells. 
developing formulations and ensuring microbial 
stability is another priority, particularly for our animal 
health and human health solutions.
new developments in food cultures & enzymes will be 
tested directly in the respective protein bases. this is 
done at our own application centers that have small-
scale yogurt and cheese production equipment as well 
as at key customers’ sites. 
clinical trials and proof of concept studies
to get proof of concept and to document the 
effectiveness of our products, we conduct in-vivo 
studies in collaboration with contract research 
in total, more than 650 employees representing over 
30 nationalities work in r&d and application and with 
50% women in managerial positions.
our r&d process
discovery 
the heart of our r&d activities is our culture collection 
which today has grown to around 40,000 strains. 
we continually expand our strain library, either by 
acquiring external collections or by isolating new 
strains from nature. it’s not the sheer size of our library 
that gives us the competitive edge, but its diversity and 
our ability to commercialize it. 
to identify new commercial opportunities, we screen 
and characterize our strains with the help of high 
throughput screening and bioinformatics using 
specialized and advanced selection protocols, so-called 
assays, that are developed in-house. 
to improve the robustness or performance of individual 
strains, such as their ability to perform in different 
climates, we apply classical strain improvement 
techniques. furthermore, chr. hansen invests in mode 
of action research to understand why and how our 
strains behave and interact. this is highly relevant for 
the protection of our inventions and while we build a

how does gut health impact our wellbeing, 
and what role can probiotics play?
the number of genes in our intestinal 
microbiome by far exceeds the number of our 
own genes. the gut microbiome plays a very 
important role in our health by helping to control 
digestion, pathogen protection, benefitting 
our immune system and perhaps even our 
mood. an imbalance of intestinal microbes may 
contribute to health problems such as infectious 
diseases, weight gain, high blood sugar, irritable 
and inflammatory intestinal disorders etc. we 
know that a healthy balance of microbes in the 
intestines is “need” and not just “nice” to have. 
here, the use of probiotics with scientifically 
proven beneficial effects is highly desirable. 
can you elaborate on your ongoing 
probiotic studies?
we’re investigating the effect of probiotics on 
various conditions such as obesity, irritable 
bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease 
and clostridium difficile infection, thereby 
attempting to both cure and prevent disease. all 
studies are accompanied by extensive studies of 
the effect on the microbiome and the safety of 
the used probiotics.

organizations. in animal health, we work with about 
50 external partners globally, while plant health uses 
a combination of own greenhouses and partners 
to conduct field trials globally and human health 
works with a network of leading investigators and key 
customers. the science behind our probiotic strains is 
one of our key differentiators, and we will continue to 
invest in research and trials to build documentation and 
scientific evidence. across our businesses, we conduct 
clinical trials every year, some of which are financed by 
chr. hansen and others by customers or academia. 
process innovations
after a new strain has been identified for 
commercialization, the strain needs to be scaled up from 
lab size to production scale. to do so, r&d develops 
media recipes, product prototypes and inoculation 
materials and scales up processes. furthermore, the team 
collaborates closely with global operations to optimize 
manufacturing processes to increase productivity. 
emerging technologies 
continuously redefining our existing technology 
platform is crucial to remain competitive. as such,  
chr. hansen is investing in new technology target areas 
such as data sciences, modes of action research and 
genome modeling. 
approximately 25% of our r&d budget each year 
is dedicated to process innovations and technology 
development.
partnerships and collaborations with external centers 
of expertise are another way in which we accelerate 
our knowledge base, speed up projects and de-risk our 
pipeline. we are proud to partner and today have a 
broad network of partners globally and are represented 
in several scientific associations, advisory boards and 
other committees.
accelerating new innovations
bringing new products faster to market is a key priority 
of our 2025 strategy which is why we have established 
a new governance and project management set-up 
that allows faster decision-making, better prioritization 
across business units and resourcing of critical 
projects.
we invest 75% of our r&d budget in new product 
development across our core platforms and 
lighthouses. we also invest in digitalization, 
automation and data analysis to increase the 
effectiveness of our r&d activities, for example to 
simplify complex workflows, miniaturize experiments 
for more rapid prototyping or deliver product 
performance insights to customers.
safeguarding our r&d investments
chr. hansen has a proactive strategy to protect r&d 
investments. we continuously strive to strengthen 
our intellectual property portfolio and patent protect 
new products of commercial value including their 
functionalities in specific application areas as well as 
production and formulation technologies. overall,  
chr. hansen’s patent portfolio encompasses around 
3,100 patents and 3,000 trademarks.

in production, we secure high 
quality and best-in-class delivery to 
customers, while driving efficiencies 
in our manufacturing processes 
and minimizing our impact on the 
environment. 
one plant, many locations 
to unlock economies of scale, chr. hansen operates 
a consolidated manufacturing footprint with 14 
production sites globally. most volumes are produced 
at the company’s main facilities in denmark, germany, 
france and the us. with the acquisitions of uas labs 
and jennewein, three production sites in germany and 
the us have been added to the production footprint 
and a fourth is expected to follow towards the end 
of the strategy period, when the new hmo facility in 
denmark is scheduled to come on stream. 
all of our sites, except for uas labs and jennewein, are 
certified to the iso 14001 standard on environmental 
management and our two german production 
sites have an iso 50001 certification on energy 
management. the certifications together with our 
global go green initiative ensure appropriate 
management and continuous improvements across the 
environmental parameters.  
whilst chr. hansen has implemented a “one plant, 
many locations” strategy to ensure flexibility in 
production planning and agility, each site specializes in 
a certain product segment. 
the production footprint is complemented by a 
network of warehouses, so as to keep stocks available 
locally and be able to respond to sudden spikes in 
demand. this has proven to be a very solid strategy 
during the pandemic. we complete the configuration of 
our supply chain by partnering with selected contract 
manufacturers.
our production processes
chr. hansen’s dairy enzymes, cultures, hmos  
and probiotics are produced via fermentation. 
production scale is important for our cost leadership, 
because the larger the fermentation plant, the lower 
the unit costs. 
we master the handling of complexity with more 
than 400 strains and over 2,500 finished products 
manufactured at industrial scale. our production 
processes are highly automated and where possible 
supported by specialized robots.
global operations 
unlocking fuel for growth
fermentation 
the key inputs for our production are skim milk powder 
and nutrients as well as the actual microorganisms. 
cost of materials accounts for approximately 20% of 
revenue.
to start the production process, inoculation material 
with a high density of bacteria is added to a sterile 
growth media which provides optimal growth 
conditions. the microbes stay in the fermentation 
tanks from four to twenty hours for cultures and seven 
to nine days for enzymes. after the fermentation has 
been stopped, the liquid bacteria are separated from 
the waste stream. enzyme and hmo production 
requires additional purification steps, because here 
the product is not the microbial strain itself but the 
enzymes or hmos produced during the fermentation. 
between each fermentation process the pipes and 
tanks are thoroughly cleaned which is a water-heavy 
and energy-intense process.
to preserve the fermentation output, the concentrated 
bacteria is shock-frozen in a liquid nitrogen-based 
process which allows excellent storage stability at 
-55 degrees celsius. to expand logistic reach, frozen 
bacteria can be transformed into freeze dried pellets.

next in the process, our single bacteria strain building 
blocks are mixed in specific ratios into finished goods 
to achieve unique and multiple targets, e.g. taste and 
texture for dairy or different health benefits for our 
animal probiotics. the number of individual strains per 
product can vary from one to many. following the uas 
labs acquisitions, we now also have in-house finished 
goods production for human health customers with a 
wide range of dosage forms and packaging options. 
product safety and quality 
chr. hansen’s ingredients are consumed on a daily 
basis as foods, supplements and infant formula, so 
product quality and safety are of utmost importance. 
we manufacture a total of five different quality grades 
from food to dietary supplement, pharma, infant 
and pre-term infant. all of chr. hansen’s production 
sites hold the fssc 22000 food safety certification. 
the sites that produce probiotics for animal feed are 
certified under the fami-qs certification covering 
quality and feed safety management. at product level, 
we maintain certifications related to, for example, 
kosher and halal, as well as from the danish medical 
agency.

packaging and logistics
chr. hansen’s key packaging materials are paper and 
cardboard boxes, plastics and foils, and together they 
account for 70% of our packaging volumes. supporting 
the upcoming eu plastics strategy to make all plastic 
packaging recyclable by 2030, chr. hansen has set 
targets to ensure and improve recyclability of all key 
packaging materials by 2025. currently, only the foils 
for some of our frozen and freeze-dried cultures are 
not recyclable and we are working to develop ways to 
transform the foil design. 
in terms of transportation, the majority of our products 
are shipped by sea and our logistics team is working to 
further optimize the transition from air to sea or road 
freight which would also have a positive impact on the 
carbon emissions of our value chain.
reducing our environmental footprint
our global operations team actively works to reduce 
the environmental footprint of our production, by 
improving water and energy efficiency and optimizing 
our waste management, packaging and logistics.
in recent years, chr. hansen has focused on improving 
water efficiencies e.g. building water reuse systems for 
cleaning processes and defining site-specific targets. 
we are also working to improve our energy efficiency 
and shifting to renewable sources where possible.

this year, 61% of our global electricity consumption 
was powered by renewable energy. in terms of waste 
management, 97% of our total volume is biowaste. as 
this still contains valuable nutrients, it can be used for 
biogas production or fertilizers. this was the case for 
69% of our biowaste in 2020/21. recycling biowaste 
contributes to avoiding carbon emissions, which 
supports our climate journey.

support to customers worldwide. 
our customers 
chr. hansen has a broad customer base with a total of 
more than 3,500 customers in total. the top 25 cus-
tomers represent around 30% of group revenue. 
food cultures & enzymes serve a highly fragmented 
customer base ranging from local, family-owned 
specialty producers to large, multinational groups. nine 
out of ten customers operate in only one country. the 
majority of our customers are dairies but chr. hansen 
is also expanding to other food and beverage markets. 
today, our ingredients are not only found in every 
second yogurt or cheese but also in meats, salmon, 
fresh-cut salads, wine, low-alcohol beer and fermented 
plant bases. 
in health & nutrition, we serve a more diverse set of 
customers. 
our human health and hmo businesses are working 
with dietary supplement and infant formula producers. 
in dietary supplements, we doubled the number of 
customers with the acquisition of uas labs and today 
serve different customer groups from pharma over-the-
counter to e-commerce specialists. in infant formula, 
we work with both local and international brands.
our animal health probiotics are sold as feed ingredi-
ents for farm animals and pets. here, we serve the entire 
value chain from distributors, premixers and feed mills to 
large integrators and pet food producers. following the 
acquisition of npc in 2016, our animal health customer 
base has been skewed towards the us cattle market. 
plant health sells its products through commercial 
partners that have strong global distribution networks. 
since 2013, chr. hansen has been selling its bionemat-
icides for crops such as sugarcane and soybean via a 
partnership with us-based fmc. in 2021, a second 
collaboration with the indian multinational upl was 
announced to develop and commercialize microbial 
solutions for sustainable agriculture.

why is functional food on the rise?
we’re experiencing increased awareness of 
functional foods and the interplay between 
body, mind and food. this health consciousness 
seems to have accelerated during the pandemic, 
and we seem to be more intentional about 
what we consume and why. the digital age has 
accelerated the proliferation of science and 
lifestyle information that provides the necessary 
basis for awareness about functional foods. 
there’s an ever growing body of hard science 
available on probiotics just a few clicks away.  
i think it really excites people to better 
understand the functioning of their own bodies 
and how it’s affected by their diet.
how is cocojune responding?
in making our plant-based yogurt alternative, 
probiotics were important from day one. 
if you can make a product that includes 
microorganisms that support your health and 
wellbeing, why wouldn’t you? lots of customers 
are writing to tell us how cocojune is helping 
them follow their diet in a delicious way, while 
also strengthening their microbiome.

stakeholder spotlight
bringing functionality  
to consumers 
and scientific knowledge. that’s why many of our sales 
managers have a technical educational background, 
such as dairy engineers, veterinarians or health care 
professionals. 
in food cultures & enzymes, we serve very large  
customers as strategic key accounts in which co-de-
velopment and customizations play important roles. 
beyond that, chr. hansen has a standardized range 
of products that is available to all customers. a small 
part of our business comes from contract manufactur-
ing and traded products and in some smaller or new 
emerging markets we use distributors to go to market.
in human health, we work directly with all of our key 
customers. our offering spans from individual strains 
to full solutions including strain selection, formulation, 
dosage format, consumer packaging, regulatory and 
marketing support. today, approximately half of our 
customers choose a full solution and our strategy is to 
further increase our strain to solution™ business.
application and technical support
application and technical support play a critical role in 
commercializing our innovations. the teams support 
sales during the launch phase by demonstrating the 
value of our products through performance trials and 
data assessment or in case of human health by helping 
customers design the optimal product in terms of cost 
and functionality. application also provides valuable 
after-sales services such as troubleshooting and  
performance monitoring support. 
together, our high-quality technical service and local 
presence constitute one of our most essential differ-
entiators which is why we aim to further strengthen 
our capabilities here, particularly in food cultures & 
enzymes, animal and plant health. 
distributors and commercial partners
distributors and commercial partners are the founda-
tion of our route-to-market strategies for our  
agricultural businesses. in animal health, an important 
part of our sales are achieved by local sales partners 
and we put a lot of emphasis on continuously expand-
ing and optimizing our business partner network. in 
plant health, our products are currently sold exclusively 
via commercial partners.
marketing and digital services
as part of our 2025 strategy, we are also expanding 
our marketing and digital capabilities to support the 
differentiation of our products and promote the value 
of our scientific documentation. to do so, we have 
started several initiatives, including the new on-pack 
branding of our probiotic strains or the probiotics 
institute™. 
furthermore, chr. hansen also started developing da-
ta-driven services that support our product sales such 
as phagewatch™ and coagusens™. in 2020/21, 
a technical service platform was launched where cus-
tomers can collaborate with chr. hansen’s application 
teams all the way from new product development to 
troubleshooting.

human resources 
investing in our highly skilled, 
engaged and diverse workforce  
a strong culture with learning and 
inclusion at the core helps drive 
engagement and results. 
diverse skills and backgrounds characterize our 
employee composition 
chr. hansen’s ability to deliver on our strategy, pioneer 
science, develop new products and respond to market 
needs depends more than anything on our more than 
3,700 employees.
our employee base is broad and diverse; close to half 
of our employees work in our production facilities, and 
the other half is split across r&d and application, sales 
& marketing and staff functions. the average length of 
employment across all groups is close to eight years, 
and we employ more than 73 nationalities. we consid-
er this broad composition of professional competencies 
and cultural backgrounds to be a key ingredient of our 
success, today and in the future. 
our founder was a true entrepreneur with an interna-
tional outlook, and that mindset is still strongly reflect-
ed in all functions and regions and an integral part of 
how we approach people. 
critical to our success is a common mindset for how we 
work. chr. hansen’s culture model is the backbone of 
this. it is composed of four cultural drivers: we act with 
freedom; we rely on each other; we create results; and 
we work for a better world. these four drivers allow us 
to establish a common understanding between existing 
and new employees across geographies and functions. 
they serve as a guiding principle of how we can move 
forward while staying true to the core of what got us 
to where we are today. the culture model is central in 
ensuring effective onboarding and performance of new 
employees.
building an engaged learning culture 
in the light of the covid-19 pandemic, we have fast-
tracked our digital journey across the entire organiza-
tion. through increased usage of digital platforms, we 
are able to launch new and more flexible approaches to 
employee engagement and learning.
keeping engagement high can be challenging in times 
of working from home or under restrictions at the  
physical workplace; yet it is a prerequisite for the success 
of our company. this year, we rolled out employee 
engagement surveys to all employees on a quarterly 
basis. this frequency allows us to react in real-time to 
the issues that may turn up as it provides a more timely 
insight into engagement levels in the organization. 
thus, despite a turbulent year dominated by covid-19, 
engagement has been kept high at an 8.5 rating,  
leaving us in the top 10% percentile among peers. 
another new initiative expected to support employee 
engagement positively is the launch of our flexible 
workplace scheme, under which a part of the defined 
working hours may be performed from the employee’s 
own home or other designated place. we wish to 
consider the diverse needs and priorities of employees 
and strive to cultivate a flexible and high-performance 
culture aligned with our business strategy. with a 
flexible workplace guideline, we provide employees 
and managers with a framework enabling new ways 
of working, with the potential for not only stronger 
engagement, but also increased productivity, efficiency 
and a better work-life balance.
continuous learning and development is another key 
enabler for executing our 2025 strategy and reaching 
our ambitious targets. we are currently in the process 
of rolling out a new digital learning management 
platform for all employees. the vast curriculum holds 
predefined learning journeys, videos and models so 
that employees will be able to find learning opportuni-
ties and resources relevant for their specific role, just 
as it will enable leaders to ascribe specific courses to 
match the job role and development needs of their

employees. easily accessible anywhere, anytime, and 
customized to teams or individuals, this initiative is 
part of our strategic ambition to provide training and 
development to all employees across the organization, 
making this a competitive advantage. from the end of 
the next financial year, the advanced digital learning 
platforms will allow us to track global and cross-func-
tional training completed by employees. 
inclusion drives diversity 
building and maintaining a strong employee base 
means that we have an obligation to ensure that we are 
unbiased and open in our recruitment, development and 
retention efforts. we rely on our organization’s ability 
to value and recognize people’s differences and unique-
ness and cultivate this in an inclusive environment.

how have you ensured engagement  
during the pandemic? 
we’ve focused on nurturing a strong sense of 
belonging in the teams, leader visibility and 
the launch of “hansen health”; a series of fun 
and engaging activities including a health and 
fitness app, inspirational talks and support with 
tips and tools for remote management, helping 
employees through the challenges by feeling part 
of a community.
how will the lessons learned affect our 
future way of working?  
the pandemic has framed our ideas for new 
approaches and fast-forwarded the digital 
development and virtual collaboration. we 
have launched our global flexible workplace to 
reflect “the new normal”, and also introduced 
quarterly digitally powered engagement surveys 
to stay close to the atmosphere and well-being of 
our employees.

diversity of the board  
of directors
at our 2020 annual general meeting, the 
board of directors reached a 50/50 gender 
representation among its shareholder-
elected members. the board not only has 
equal gender representation but also has  
six nationalities represented.  
in our recruitment processes, we continuously seek to 
ensure, through specific requirements to recruitment 
agencies, that we meet a diverse pool of candidates 
with different educational backgrounds, gender, 
nationalities etc. internally, we see that the succession 
pipeline for top level positions is close to being gender 
balanced. this is a result of diversity and inclusion being 
high on the agenda during internal organizational review 
processes, promotions and organizational changes. 
chr. hansen’s commitment to diversity is also visible 
in the employee engagement surveys, where the ques-
tion: “i’m satisfied with chr. hansen’s efforts to support  
diversity and inclusion” scores 8.6, 0.6 above benchmark, 
indicating that awareness on this business-critical topic 
remains high. 
gender pay is another important element in our 
diversity & inclusion ambition. fairness and transpar-
ency in the remuneration of our employees are key in 
creating an inclusive workplace. after a few years of 
maturing the internal data quality and approach, this 
year we will report on gender pay for the first time. the 
number we report represents the difference in average 
earnings between the female and male workforce, in 
countries with more than 250 employees (dk, us, fr, 
de1)). the data constitutes approximately 80% of the 
total workforce. the methodology applied is inspired 
by the uk, where gender pay reporting has been a legal 
requirement for some years, giving us a mature and 
validated approach.

at the end of august 2021, 1% of the share capital was 
held through the adr program.  
to meet certain obligations to deliver shares under 
management incentive programs, chr. hansen held 
less than 1% in treasury stock.
financing and capital structure management
due to its strong cash flows, chr. hansen mainly uses 
internal funds to finance its recurring investment needs 
including capital expenditures. internal funding is com-
plemented by bank borrowings. at the end of the finan-
cial year 2020/21, net interest-bearing debt amounted 
to eur 898m and leverage stood at 2.3x ebitda. 
chr. hansen’s board of directors regularly assesses 
whether the company’s capital structure supports the 
strategy and the long-term value creation in the inter-
est of the company and the shareholders. the board 
of directors is committed to maintaining financial lev-
erage consistent with a solid investment-grade credit 
profile, while returning excess cash to shareholders. 
until and including november 28, 2022, the board of 
directors has been authorized by the annual general 
meeting to: 
• increase the share capital in one or more stages, with 
pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders, by up 
to a total nominal value of dkk 131,852,496. the 
capital increase shall be effected by payment in cash. 
• increase the share capital in one or more stages, 
without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders, 
by up to a total nominal value of dkk 131,852,496, 
provided that the increase is effected at market 
price. the capital increase may be effected by 
payment in cash or by contribution of assets other 
than cash. the authorizations to increase the share 
capital are subject to a joint cap of nominally dkk 
131,852,496.
• acquire up to 13,185,249 treasury shares, provided 
that the company’s holding of treasury shares does 
not at any time exceed 10% of the company’s share 
capital. the consideration payable for the shares 
may not deviate by more than 10% from the share 
price listed on nasdaq copenhagen at the time of 
acquisition. 
capital allocation and dividend policy
in terms of capital allocation, chr. hansen has clear 
priorities. investing for organic growth is the number 
one priority followed by bolt-on acquisitions. thirdly, 
the company aims to return excess cash to investors in 
the form of ordinary dividends, extraordinary dividends 
or share buybacks. 
distributions to shareholders are subject to the board 
of directors’ assessment of factors such as business 
development, growth strategy, current leverage and 
financing needs. there can be no assurance that a 
dividend will be proposed or declared in any given year, 
but generally the company aims to pay out an annual 
ordinary dividend of 40%-60% of net profit. 
in 2020/21, the board of directors decided not to 
propose an ordinary dividend for the financial year 
2019/20 in order to prudently manage leverage after 
the acquisitions made during the financial year and until 
the proceeds from the natural colors divestment were 
received. instead, the company paid an extraordinary 
dividend of dkk 6.54 per share in may, equal to a total 
of eur 116 million, which is equivalent to a normalized 
ordinary dividend for 2019/20. for 2020/21, the board 
of directors proposes an ordinary dividend of dkk 
6.54 per share, equal to a total of eur 116 million. the 
proposed dividend is equivalent to the dividend paid out 
in 2021 and represents 58% of the profit for the year.

through our vendor approval program, we ensure that 
clearly-defined requirements regarding social and 
environmental issues are set out for suppliers to follow 
if they wish to do business with chr. hansen. supplier 
performance is monitored closely through the vendor 
management system and high risk suppliers are  
audited on food safety, quality and sustainability. 
chr. hansen is a member of sedex, one of the world’s 
largest collaborative platforms for sharing data on  
ethical and responsible data with customers. 
third-party social and environmental audits are  
performed at all chr. hansen production sites at least 
once every three years. 
our sustainability position clearly defines our commit-
ments to respect human and labor rights. each year, 
we update our human rights due diligence assessment. 
after the sale of the natural colors division, the salient 
risks to human rights have been updated, showing sig-
nificantly reduced exposure to labor in the supply chain 
due to the different nature of the supply chain. key is-
sues for chr. hansen to continue to focus on are health 
and safety, diversity and supply chain engagement.
how can partnerships scale impact  
in local communities? 
care supports the world’s poorest and those 
most vulnerable to climate change, teaming up 
with the best experts to support us in creating a 
greener, fairer world. climate change has made 
rural farming harder, forcing small local farmers 
to spend money they don’t have on chemical 
pesticides and fertilizers with negative effects 
on the environment, because they are totally 
dependent on their crops on a daily basis. chr. 
hansen contributes excellent natural alternatives 
and expertise in their application; a great 
example of the impact partnerships can have 
where it is most needed.
what criteria are important  
when selecting a partner? 
a shared vision of wanting to contribute to a better 
world. we don’t all need to be alike, but we must 
share basic values, work in the same direction 
and bring different competencies to the table. it 
is very inspiring to work with the industry; we see 
a profound willingness to change to help create a 
more sustainable future. that has a huge impact.

2025  
strategy
as part of its 2025 strategy, chr. hansen conducted a strategic review of its 
non-microbial assets which resulted in the divestment of its natural colors 
divisions to eqt. the transaction was closed on march 31, 2021 for a total 
consideration of eur 800m. the divestment covers business operations in 
more than 30 countries and around 600 employees and the proceeds from 
the divestment have been applied to reduce the leverage and pay out an 
extraordinary dividend.

raising the bar for innovation 
and customer proximity   
we will defend and further strengthen our market position in food cultures 
& enzymes, animal health and human health by investing in new product 
development, scientific differentiation and our go-to-market strategy. 
chr. hansen has been the supplier of choice for the 
dairy industry for nearly 150 years and has built an 
industry-leading probiotic business for animal feed, 
dietary supplements and infant formula. over the 2025 
strategy period, the core platforms will continue to de-
liver most of the group’s absolute growth. accordingly, 
reinvesting in food cultures & enzymes, animal health 
and human health remains our top priority. 
to outpace competition and outgrow the market, new 
product development and faster commercialization are 
important drivers. continuously bringing new innova-
tions in our core cheese and fermented milk portfolio 
to market is key to drive upselling in food cultures & 
enzymes. in animal health and human health, we con-
tinue to invest in research and clinical trials for scientific 
differentiation as well as marketing excellence to bring 
the value proposition of our strain portfolio to customers 
and consumers. to further expand our product offering, 
we are also investing into new, adjacent spaces such as 
probiotic innovations for foods and pet health.
to increase our global reach and raise the bar in terms 
of customer centricity, we invest in local application 
and technical sales support, particularly in emerging 
markets that present attractive growth prospects. in 
animal health, we work closely with business partners 
and distributors to create a more balanced geographical 
exposure by investing outside of north america, whilst 
in human health, we aim to expand our position in the 
asian market. food cultures & enzymes has stepped up 
its efforts in application excellence whilst further advanc-
ing its digital agenda with virtual selling tools, such as 
remote trial protocols and virtual innovation days.

what’s the value of probiotics for animals?  
although we’re feeding animals, we’re 
ultimately feeding humans! by reducing food 
borne pathogens in animals, we can provide 
healthier food for processing and consumption. 
controlling these pathogens through probiotics 
to establish a healthy gut balance reduces the 
potential shedding of unwanted bacteria that can 
contaminate the carcass.
what’s your personal experience  
in this field? 
antimicrobial resistance in humans is one of 
the most significant health challenges facing 
mankind today. bacillus bacteria have become 
a key technology in replacing medically 
important antibiotics used in animal feed. 
the life cycle of bacillus bacteria provides the 
most environmentally-friendly feed-additive 
technology ever developed. after providing 
pathogenic efficacy by establishing gut 
microflora balance, the bacteria sporulate 
passing spores back in the manure that are 
beneficial to the soil microbiome and plant 
health. this is of significant interest to farmers.

what will the future of food look like?
fermentation will play a pivotal role, repurposing 
ingredient by-products as a means of working 
more creatively with food. fermentation was one 
of the first means humans developed to preserve 
foods safely and induce profound changes in flavor.  
how can we rely on fermentation  
to create the food of tomorrow?
i’m excited about the idea that  the food of 
tomorrow is deeply tied to the past. it’s a sentiment 
mirrored in the enthusiasm you see when people 
ferment their own sourdough bread, kombucha, 
kimchi or miso ... you see people connect to food 
they make. to ferment something is to invest not 
only in a project, but in your own future.
through the magic of microbiology, you can make 
vegetables and plant-based foods incredibly 
satisfying, as our bodies are hardwired to detect 
and cherish the flavors produced by fermentation. 
a sustainable food industry will be built on flavor; 
flavor is king if you want to convince people why 
eating this way is healthy for them as well as for 
the planet.

2020/21 highlights 
at chr. hansen, we see many opportunities to expand 
our business by leveraging our microbial platform to 
develop solutions for new applications. we define a 
‘lighthouse’ as a new business area of strategic impor-
tance with minimum revenue potential of eur 100m 
per year and above group-average growth rates.
whether it’s applying fermentation technology to 
optimize shelf life and food quality in our bioprotection 
lighthouse, using probiotics to protect crops from pests 
and diseases in our plant health business or offering 
contract development and manufacturing services to 
pharma companies in our bacthera joint venture with 
lonza – with all our ‘lighthouses’ we have embarked 
on a journey to pioneer emerging markets and build 
completely new businesses from scratch. 
with the launch of our 2025 strategy, two new light-
houses were added to the portfolio. encompassing  
our activities in dairy and meat alternatives as well as 
fermented beverages, fermented plant bases captures the 
trend towards alternative protein sources and healthier 
beverage choices, while human milk oligosaccharides 
(hmos) is a new adjacent technology space that we 
entered with the acquisition of jennewein and which 
has expanded our infant formula offering.

strengthening our technology  
platform via m&a and partners
we will further strengthen our microbial and fermentation technology platforms by pursuing 
inorganic growth opportunities and engaging with commercial and r&d partners.
portfolio changes pave the way for a future as a 
microbial pure play
as a bioscience company, we operate in a highly 
dynamic and fast-paced environment. staying on top 
of technology advancements and continuously refining 
and further developing our microbial and fermentation 
technology platforms is key to chr. hansen’s success.
with the divestment of natural colors in march 2021, 
chr. hansen paved the way for a future as a micro-
bial pure play. we intend to further strengthen our 
competencies in cultures, probiotics, dairy enzymes 
and value-added fermentation such as hmos through 
acquisitions. at the same time, we focus on extending 
our partnerships with external research centers and 
where we see benefits, we will engage in commercial 
partnerships.  
m&a strategy
whilst organic growth remains our number one  
priority in terms of capital allocation, inorganic  
opportunities in the form of bolt-on acquisitions will 
play an increasingly important role for chr. hansen’s 
future as we build scale in health & nutrition and our 
lighthouses and position the company for the future. 
partnerships
at chr. hansen, we believe in open innovation and 
close collaboration with customers, commercial  
partners and academia to develop microbial solutions. 
our joint venture with lonza, the partnerships with 
fmc and upl in plant health and the mista alliance  
in fermented plant bases are good examples of this.

as a microbiome leader with an 
unparalleled probiotics and hmo 
offering, we enable healthier living and 
contribute to the global health agenda. 
strengthening our human health portfolio with 
the acquisitions of uas labs and hso health care
the global dietary supplements market is expected to 
grow 4%-6% during the 2025 strategy period, driven by 
the general trend for preventative care and health opti-
mization and the increasing understanding of the human 
microbiome and probiotics amongst health care profes-
sionals, consumers and the general public. the global 
pandemic has further intensified this development. 
building on our industry-leading, documented probiotic 
strain portfolio and scientific heritage, chr. hansen 
aims to improve health and wellbeing across all life 
stages and shape the global probiotics market with an 
unparalleled offering. the acquisitions of uas labs  
and hso health care in 2020 contribute directly  
to this strategy.
diversifying customer base and expanding 
probiotic production capabilities 
with the acquisition of uas labs in july 2020 for  
a net transaction value of eur 538 million, chr. hansen 
has expanded its foothold in the fast-growing multi- 
species, high-potency market. with uas labs, we  
doubled our customer base and increased our exposure 
to e-commerce players, whilst broadening our product 
and strain portfolio across a variety of indication areas, 
including weight management and heart health with 
strains such as dds-1®, uabla-12™, bnr17™ and lrc®. 
furthermore, we expanded our fermentation capacity 
and added internal consumer packaging capabilities in 
the us. 
small bolt-on to strengthen women’s health 
offering  
women’s health is one of the fastest growing indica-
tion areas within the probiotic supplements market. 
several scientific studies suggest that taking probiotics 
may support women’s health at all life stages including 
during pregnancy and menopause. to expand our po-
sition in this space, chr. hansen acquired the austrian 
company hso health care including its award-winning 
astarte™ combination in april 2020 for a total con-
sideration of eur 119 million.
integrations completed
both uas labs and hso health care were fully 
integrated into the human health business during the 
financial year 2020/21. revenue synergies are expect-
ed to come from cross-selling and bringing a broader 
product offering to more customers worldwide as well 
as developing new concepts from the combined strain 
portfolio, whilst cost synergies will be realized from in-
sourcing the production of hso hc products and best 
practice sharing across uas labs and chr. hansen.  
entering the fast-growing hmo market with  
a new lighthouse
human milk oligosaccharides are essential groups of 
milk sugars found only in human breast milk that are 
essential for the development of infant microbiomes. 
only commercially available since 2015, hmos have 
become the ‘golden standard’ for bringing infant for-
mula products closer to mother’s milk. research also 
indicates that hmos are synergistic with probiotics 
and may be beneficial for humans across life stages  
e.g. for immune support, healthy ageing or during 
pregnancy.
chr. hansen entered this exciting, emerging market 
with the acquisition of jennewein which has expanded 
our offering to infant formula players and offers at-
tractive cross-selling opportunities with our probiotics 
business. 
registration delays due to covid-19 and longer cus-
tomer project timelines slowed the development of the 
hmo market in 2020/21 but the long-term potential is 
very promising with an estimated addressable market 
of more than eur 1bn long term. hmos are available in 
several markets today and are expected to be approved 
in the world’s largest infant formula market, china, 
within the strategy period, which will be a key catalyst 
for the business. 
hmo operates as a business under health & nutrition 
and we plan to establish a global hmo manufacturing 
site in denmark in the coming years.

financial outlook for 2021/22
assumptions
the outlook for 2021/22 is based on the following 
assumptions:
• constant currencies 
• no acquisitions
• the current political and economic environment. 
changes in the political and macroeconomic climate 
including continued covid-19 related disruptions, de-
velopment of raw material and other input costs might 
impact the outlook.
organic revenue growth
considering the high macroeconomic uncertainty and 
continued covid-19 related disruptions, we expect 
organic growth for 2021/22 in the range of 5-8%. 
food cultures & enzymes is expected to deliver solid 
mid-single-digit organic growth throughout the year, 
despite an insignificant contribution from eur-based 
pricing. 
organic growth in health & nutrition is expected to be 
supported by the businesses acquired in 2020. growth 
is expected to be volatile across quarters with human 
health impacted by the current challenges incl. limited 
access to specific raw materials in the first part of the 
year.
ebit margin before special items
ebit margin before special items is expected to be 27-
28% as cost synergies from the probiotics acquisitions 
and production efficiencies will be offset by the contin-
ued ramp-up of activities post covid-19, investments 
into the hmo business, and inflationary pressure on 
certain input costs. 
free cash flow before special items 
free cash flow before special items is expected to be 
around eur 140-170 million as improved operating 
profit is expected to be more than offset by a 
significant increase in taxes paid, as 2020/21 was 
impacted by acquisition-related activities. the free 
cash flow outlook assumes a capex level in line with 
2020/21.
sensitivity
 chr. hansen is a global company serving more 
than 140 countries through subsidiaries in more 
than 30 countries. the most significant currency 
exposure relates to usd, which accounts for 
around 35% of revenue, while exposure to other 
currencies is more modest. a 5% decrease in the 
eur/usd exchange rate would impact revenue 
measured in eur negatively by around eur 20 
million. 
organic revenue growth is sensitive to exchange 
rate fluctuations in currencies for which chr. 
hansen applies a eur-based pricing model. the 
ebit margin is also sensitive to exchange rate 
fluctuations. production in the us only partly 
offsets the impact on revenue from changes 
in the eur/usd exchange rate. therefore, the 
relative ebit exposure is higher than the revenue 
exposure. a 5% decrease in the eur/usd 
exchange rate would impact ebit negatively by 
roughly two thirds of the revenue impact. the 
sensitivity to currency developments also applies 
to the free cash flow.
the use of currency hedging of balance sheet 
exposures and future cash flows is described in 
note 4.3 to the consolidated financial statements 
2020/21.

group performance 
revenue (cont. operations)
organic growth was 7%, while revenue increased 
by 11% to eur 1,077 million. revenue was impacted 
positively by 11% from acquisitions and negatively by 
7% due to currency effects. the contribution from 
acquisitions was eur 105 million. 
organic growth was primarily driven by price increases 
in local currencies incl. the use of eur-based pricing in 
certain countries, while volume/mix growth was below 
historical levels in part due to covid-19. 
gross profit (cont. operations)
gross profit was eur 613 million, up 5% on 2019/20. 
the gross margin decreased by 3.3 percentage points 
to 56.9%, due to a more than 3 percentage point neg-
ative impact from acquisitions. production efficiencies 
were offset by a negative impact from currency, prod-
uct mix and higher freight costs.
operating expenses (% of revenue, cont. 
operations)
operating expenses totaled eur 315 million (29.3%), 
compared to eur 257 million (26.5%) in 2019/20.
total r&d expenditures amounted to eur 91 mil-
lion (8.5%), compared to eur 78 million (8.0%) in 
2019/20. 
sales & marketing expenses amounted to eur 155 
million (14.4%), compared to eur 135 million (13.9%) 
in 2019/20. the increase in cost level from the acquisi-
tions was partly offset by reduced travel expenses due 
to covid-19 travel restrictions.
administrative expenses amounted to eur 73 
million (6.8%), compared to eur 53 million (5.5%) 
in 2019/20. the increase in cost level was primarily 
driven by acquisitions. 
net other operating income/expenses was an income 
of eur 3 million, compared to eur 8 million last year, 
as 2019/20 was impacted by the single-line consol-
idation of uas labs and a favorable ruling in a vat 
dispute case.

ebitda before special items (cont. operations)
ebitda before special items amounted to eur 399 
million, compared to eur 401 million in 2019/20. the 
impact from acquisitions was eur 17 million, compared 
to eur 4 million in 2019/20. the ebitda margin be-
fore special items (incl. acquisitions) was 37.1%, down 
4.2 percentage point from 2019/20.
the underlying ebitda margin before special items 
and excluding acquisitions would have been 39.3%, 
compared to 41.0% in 2019/20. the decrease was 
mainly driven by investments into r&d activities and a 
negative currency impact. 
operating profit (ebit) before special items  
(cont. operations)
ebit before special items amounted to eur 298 
million, compared to eur 327 million in 2019/20, a 
decrease of 9%. the ebit margin before special items 
was 27.7%, down from 33.7% in 2019/20. 
the underlying ebit margin before special items (excl. 
acquisitions) would have been 31.4%, compared to 
33.6% in 2019/20. the decrease was due to the lower 
ebitda margin, and an increase in depreciation and 
amortization. 
special items (cont. operations)
special items were an expense of eur 22 million com-
pared to an expense of eur 14 million in 2019/20, and 
the increase in expenses was primarily driven by costs 
in relation to the carve-out process of natural colors 
and the acquisition of jennewein.
operating profit (ebit, cont. operations)
ebit amounted to eur 276 million, compared to eur 
313 million in 2019/20. the ebit margin was 25.6%, 
compared to 32.3% in 2019/20. adjusted for acquisi-
tions, the ebit margin would have been 29.1%.
net financials, share of jv and tax  
(cont. operations)
net financial items amounted to eur 23 million, 
compared to eur 14 million in 2019/20. net interest 
expenses were eur 22 million (incl. eur 3 million due 
to ifrs 16 leases), up from eur 13 million in 2019/20. 
the net impact from exchange rate adjustments was 
negative at eur 1 million, in line with 2019/20. 
the bacthera jv produced a eur 7 million loss to 
chr. hansen, compared to a loss of eur 4 million in 
2019/20.
income taxes amounted to eur 48 million, equivalent 
to an effective tax rate of 19.6%, compared to eur 
64 million and 21.7%, respectively, in 2019/20. the 
lower tax rate was due to a non-recurring impact from 
acquisitions.
profit for the year from continuing operations
profit from continuing operations for the year de-
creased to eur 199 million from eur 232 million in 
2019/20.
profit from discontinued operations
profit from the divested business of natural colors 
amounted to eur 647 million, compared to eur 13 mil-
lion in 2019/20. the increase was due to the eur 638 
million gain on the divestment of natural colors.
profit for the year
profit for the year amounted to eur 845 million com-
pared to eur 245 million in 2019/20.
assets (group)
at august 31, 2021, total assets amounted to eur 3,114 
million, compared to eur 2,854 million a year earlier. 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of hso 
health care, uas labs and jennewein, and invest-
ments in the microbial production platform, partly off-
set by the divestment of the natural colors business.
total non-current assets amounted to eur 2,685 
million, compared to eur 2,247 million at august 31, 
2020. goodwill and intangible assets increased by 
eur 299 million, while property, plant and equipment 
increased by eur 127 million.
total current assets amounted to eur 429 million, 
compared to eur 405 million at august 31, 2020. in-
ventories increased by eur 12 million, or 9%, and trade 
receivables increased by eur 43 million, or 30%. cash 
decreased by eur 41 million to eur 55 million. 
for more information, see note 2.1 in the annual 
report.
net working capital (group)
net working capital was eur 190 million, compared to 
eur 208 million in 2019/20 (of which eur 166 million 
was from continuing operations). net working capital 
amounted to 17.6% of revenue compared to 17.1% in 
2019/20 for continuing operations. the change in net 
working capital for continuing operations was mainly 
driven by a eur 43 million, or 30% increase in trade 
receivables, part of which was due to the acquisitions 
of uas labs and jennewein. this was partly offset by 
higher trade payables, which were up by eur 31 million, 
or 31%, while inventories increased by eur 12 million, 
or 9%. 
equity (group)
total equity amounted to eur 1,626 million at august 
31, 2021, compared to eur 893 million a year earli-
er. following the divestment of natural colors, chr. 
hansen paid out an extraordinary dividend of eur 116 
million, equal to a normalized ordinary dividend for 
2019/20.
net debt (group)
net interest-bearing debt amounted to eur 898 mil-
lion, or 2.3x ebitda before special items, compared to 
eur 1,345 million, or 3.1x ebitda before special items, 
at august 31, 2020.

return on invested capital  
(roic, cont. operations) 
the return on invested capital excluding goodwill was 
24.8%, compared to 33.6% in 2019/20. the de-
crease was driven by the acquisitions of uas labs and 
jennewein. invested capital excluding goodwill from 
continuing operations increased to eur 1,303 million, 
compared to eur 1,098 million at august 31, 2020.
the return on invested capital including goodwill was 
11.6%, compared to 16.5% in 2019/20. invested capital 
including goodwill from continuing operations in-
creased to eur 2,793 million, compared to eur 2,347 
million at august 31, 2020. for more information, see 
note 2.1 in the annual report.
cash flow (group)
cash flow from operating activities was eur 311 
million compared to eur 365 million in 2019/20. the 
operating cash flow from continuing operations was 
eur 328 million, which was in line with 2019/20 (eur 
330 million), as a lower contribution from the operat-
ing profit adjusted for non-cash items, higher interest 
paid and a negative impact from working capital was 
offset by lower taxes paid partly due to a non-recurring 
impact from acquisitions. cash flow from discontinued 
operations was an outflow of eur 17 million, compared 
to a positive contribution of eur 35 million last year.
cash flow used for operational investing activities was 
eur 159 million (of which eur 154 million, or 14% of 
revenue, was from continuing operations), compared to 
eur 140 million in 2019/20 (of which eur 119 million, 
or 12% of revenue, was from continuing operations). 
the increase in spending was driven by the acquisition 
of the kalundborg, denmark site for hmo produc-
tion, investments across the microbial platform and 
insourcing of packaging capacity for human health in 
north america.  
free cash flow before special items, acquisitions and 
divestments was eur 184 million (of which eur 196 
million was from continuing operations, while discon-
tinued operations resulted in an outflow of eur 12 
million), compared to eur 245 million in 2019/20 (of 
which eur 225 million was from continuing opera-
tions).
the free cash flow before special items, acquisitions 
and divestments of eur 196 million from continuing 
operations was higher than the full-year outlook, main-
ly driven by the timing of certain payables.
investments and loans to associates amounted to eur 
15 million compared to eur 11 million in 2019/20, and 
represented investments in the bacthera jv.

market developments
according to the company’s own estimates, the end 
markets for fermented milk declined globally by 2-3% 
in 2020/21 due to reduced production output and 
weaker demand in china and latin america, compared 
to the same period last year.
the global production of cheese is estimated to have 
grown by around 1-2% in 2020/21, driven by north 
america and europe which both benefited from the 
re-opening of the food service channel in the second 
half of the year.
revenue 
organic growth was 8%, while revenue increased by 
1% to eur 701 million. revenue was impacted nega-
tively by 7% due to currency effects. organic growth 
comprised 3% from volume/mix and 5% from price 
increases in local currencies.
organic growth was driven by cultures and enzymes 
for the cheese segment, which was supported by 
positive developments in underlying production 
volumes and market penetration by previous product 
launches such as chy-max® supreme. nola® fit 
for lactose-free dairy products also supported organic 
growth.  
cultures for fermented milk incl. probiotics was 
impacted negatively by the decline in end markets in 
china and latam, and reduced upselling activity due 
to covid-19.
bioprotection and fermented plant bases delivered 
double-digit growth in 2020/21 and launched new 
products including the third generation of freshq® 
for fermented milk and white cheeses and a new range 
of texturizing cultures for different plant protein bases. 
the lighthouses accounted for around 8% of food 
cultures & enzymes revenue in 2020/21.
ebit
in food cultures & enzymes, ebit before special items 
amounted to eur 224 million, compared to eur 238 
million in 2019/20. the ebit margin before special 
items was 32.0%, down 2.3 percentage points from 
34.3% last year, primarily due to product mix and 
a negative currency impact that offset production 
efficiencies.
“despite weaker demand and limited 
customer access we delivered above-
market growth and launched a record 
number of new products.”

market developments
management estimates the overall market for human 
health to have grown by 3-5% during 2020/21. while 
online sales channels showed strong growth, the 
traditional sales channels continued to be impacted by 
elevated inventory positions.
the market for microbial-based solutions for animals 
and plants developed favorably in 2020/21, supported 
by favorable commodity prices and an increased 
focus among farmers on reducing antibiotic usage 
in livestock production and finding alternatives to 
chemical pesticides. 
revenue
organic growth was 5%, while revenue increased 
by 36% to eur 377 million. revenue was impacted 
positively by 37% from acquisitions and negatively by 
6% due to currency effects. h&n accounted for around 
35% of group revenue in 2020/21 compared to 29% 
last year. 
organic growth was driven by animal health and plant 
health, whereas human health declined.
human health experienced a significant drop 
in demand in the second half of 2020/21 from 
customers serving the traditional sales channels as 
end market growth for the segment did not pick up as 
expected. the decline was partly offset by very strong 
momentum in the acquired businesses (not included in 
organic growth) which benefitted from strong growth 
in the online markets. 
organic growth in animal health was driven by 
cattle, poultry & swine supported by good uptake of 
gallipro® fit and the global roll-out of our silage 
product offering. 
organic growth in plant health was driven by sales of 
quartzo® and presence® in latin america.
hmo revenue was lower than originally expected, but 
with good momentum in securing customer contracts 
and the hmo business resolved outstanding patent 
litigation cases with favorable results.
ebit
in health & nutrition, ebit before special items 
amounted to eur 75 million, compared to eur 89 
million in 2019/20. the ebit margin before special 
items was 19.8%, down 12.4 percentage points on 
2019/20 mainly due to the acquisitions. excluding the 
acquisitions, the underlying ebit margin before special 
items for health & nutrition was 30.0% compared to 
31.9%, mainly driven by a negative currency impact.
“health & nutrition delivered 
solid organic growth despite 
a challenging second half in 
human health.”

product performance1)
revenue contribution 
the percentage of revenue generated from products 
that contribute to sdgs no. 2, 3 or 12 increased from 
81% last year to 82% in 2020/21. the percentage is 
an indication of the type of products we sell. products 
that enable our customers, the food industry, health 
companies and the agricultural sector, to choose more 
sustainable solutions. in the figure, we do not take 
into account the negative effect related to for example 
the production footprint. chr. hansen does not sell 
any products that harm any of the impact categories 
defined in the methodology2).  
supporting sustainable agriculture
in 2020/21, we increased our coverage of our natural 
solutions for sustainable agriculture – biological plant 
protection and silage inoculants – by 4.4 million 
hectares. the increase is driven by improvements in 
the market and revenue as described in the financial 
review section. since base year 2015/16, we have 
covered an accumulated area of 18 million hectares 
with our natural solutions, enabling farmers to enhance 
crop protection, get a higher yield and higher crop 
resilience without the use of chemical pesticides.
improving health
through our well-documented probiotics, we are 
able to support global health. this year 149 million 
people consumed our probiotics either as a dietary 
supplement or as part of their diet, e.g. in a yogurt. 
this is a slight decline from last year, when it was 163 
million people. the decline is related to challenges in 
our human health business in the second half of the 
year (for more information, see financial review).
reducing food waste 
our contribution to preventing food waste within 
yogurt remained at the same level as last year, as our 
fermentation technology helped prevent 160,000 tons 
of yogurt from being wasted. since base year 2015/16, 
we have helped prevent an accumulated 870,000 tons 
of yogurt from being wasted, leaving us on track to 
reach our 2025 target of reducing global yogurt waste 
by 2 million tons. 
1)   data from uas labs and jennewein is not included in the revenue contribution or improving health figures this 
year. as the integration matures over the coming year, we expect to include them as of next year.

science-based targets 
chr. hansen has submitted its climate targets for 
validation by the science based targets initiative. 
as part of the preparation, chr. hansen has ensured 
organizational anchoring and outlined specific actions 
in a climate roadmap that will guide our decarbon-
izing journey across our operations and across our 
entire value chain. as a result of the process of setting 
science based targets we have updated our overall 
ambitions from a 1.5° c commitment to a more general 
commitment to science based targets. we expect to 
communicate our targets and climate program later 
this year.  
renewable energy and co₂e 
during 2020/21, 61% of global electricity consumption 
was based on renewable energy, compared to 40% 
last year. the majority of this was secured by a power 
purchase agreement with the organization better 
energy, which covers the electricity consumption of all 
our danish sites. this year, our site in nienburg entered 
into an agreement to purchase green electricity from 
the local industrial park supplier through renewable en-
ergy certificates. to reach our target, we continue our 
work to get all of our sites covered by a power purchase 
agreement that creates additionality to the market. as 
a result, of the increased use of renewable electricity, 
scope 2 co₂e emissions (market-based) decreased 
considerably.  
our energy consumption increased by approximately 
5,000mwh. this was due to a mix of factors such as 
colder winters in denmark, which increased the use of 
district heating, production increases at some of our 
sites and activation of new buildings and freezers. 
we experienced an improvement in scope 3 emissions 
– currently covering up- and downstream transpor-
tation. the reduction is a result of targeted efforts to 
transfer transportation from air to sea, a focus on de-
veloping concentrated products as well as continuous 
improvements to data quality. 
waste management 
this year, 69% of our biowaste streams were re- or 
upcycled as e.g. biogas or fertilizer compared to 68% 
last year. we are working to identify relevant partners 
across our global production sites to accelerate our 
performance on the target. we have also seen a 13 per-
centage point improvement in recycled solid waste as a 
result of a our continuous ambitions to improve waste 
recycling across all our sites. due to water contami-
nation at our headquarter, the amount of wastewater 
increased over the course of the year. the issue has 
now been fixed. 
recyclable key packaging solution
key packaging categories are defined as representing 
10% or more of the yearly global packaging spend. 
1)   data from uas labs and jennewein is not included in the planet figures this year.  
as the integration matures over the coming year, we expect to include them as of next year. 
the solutions represent close to 70% of total pack-
aging material in chr. hansen. to assess progress, 
annual spend is assessed yearly to identify the scope. 
a solution is considered recyclable if it is made from 
material that is technically or mechanically recyclable. 
this year, our performance remained stable at 68%. 
the solutions are split across six categories, out of 
which four are currently recyclable. the two remaining 
categories covers foils used for our cultures. current-
ly, feasibility studies are being carried out to identify 
alternative compositions that can make it recyclable. 
the requirements of the material are high as it needs to 
ensure food quality and safety and low temperatures. 
water
there was a slight increase in water consumption 
during the year. this is primarily a result of water 
contamination at our headquarter which required 
additional water for cleaning and flushing. we also saw 
an increase across some of our sites due to increased 
production and increased need for cleaning.
environmental violation 
this year, two environmental violations were recorded. 
the violations are related to a spill and a potential spill 
at our sites in copenhagen and arpajon respectively. 
both violations are categorized as a low severity.

people performance
diversity 
during the year we exceeded our 2025 target as we 
now report 32% women at directors+ level, up from 
27% last year. this is a result of a focused effort 
especially around recruitment processes. 21% of our 
corporate management teams are diverse, meaning 
that there is at least 30% of each gender and 30% 
non-locals. this ambitious threshold is defined to 
ensure that our teams actually benefit from the diverse 
composition. this year, we are starting to report on 
retention of employees under 30 to further support our 
diverse employee composition, knowledge and skills. 
during the year, we retained 83% of the employee 
base in that age group. through a specific focus on 
leadership and engagement of this group, the ambition 
is to reach 90% by 2025. 
employee turnover
this year, we have seen an increase in employee 
turnover from 10% to 14%. this is a reflection of 
the current state of the labor market with employee 
scarcity, making it more difficult to attract and retain 
highly specialized labor. another factor affecting this is 
that the general workload across all functions in  
chr. hansen has been higher than normal during the 
past year, in the light of our acquisitions and the carve-
out of the natural colors business. 
employee engagement 
our performance on employee engagement relative 
to the benchmark increased considerably during the 
year from the 34th percentile to the 10th. in addition 
to changing provider of the employee engagement 
surveys, we have moved from sending out a survey 
once a year to do so on a quarterly basis. this allows us 
to react much faster to issues that may arise. 
gender pay equality 
the gender pay analysis performed shows we have 
an average gender pay gap of 6.2%. as gender pay 
is a new diversity & inclusion target, we believe a 
focused effort over time can reduce the gap. there are 
a number of cultural and systemic issues that need to 
be addressed in order to reduce the gap, and these will 
take time to work through. over the next year, we will 
focus on creating better gender balance across all job 
levels and roles, use the salary review process to iden-
tify gender pay gaps and put more focus on increasing 
the number of female managers.
safety
in 2020/21, we continued the good safety performance 
with a lost time incident frequency of 0.99 down from 
1.3 last year. there was a slight decline in the number of 
lost time incidents and the severity of these decreased 
from eight to two days lost. we are particularly proud 
of being able to maintain the good safety performance 
in a year characterized by restrictions and different 
ways of working as a result of covid-19.  
business integrity 
this year, we implemented new targets and 
measurement methods for e-learning moving away 
from a fixed annual roll-out to training assigned on 
an ongoing basis. the new method will enable us to 
better accommodate optimal timing needs within 
the business globally and more timely training in 
accordance with the individual training cycles. focus 
for the coming year will be to complete the change, 
generate comparable data for external reporting and 
guide actions and priorities.

risk management
the achievement of chr. hansen’s long-term purpose 
and business strategy requires a shared understand-
ing of key risks and the overall level of risk exposure 
throughout the company.
the company’s position on enterprise risk stipulates 
how chr. hansen applies enterprise risk management 
as a concept, how it applies to all areas of the organ-
ization, and how it is integrated into the business 
processes and the strategy development process. the 
risk management process ensures a healthy balance 
between risk and return in the company’s business 
model. therefore, for chr. hansen, enterprise risk man-
agement is not about risk avoidance but about ensuring 
risk awareness and that adequate control  
and mitigations are in place.
the company works with concrete and specific risks, 
providing the ability to track and work in a dedicated 
manner with the individual risks and mitigations. 
through cross-organizational participation, the 
company takes a holistic approach to analyzing risks, 
ensuring that risks are addressed from all perspectives. 
to achieve clear risk ownership and an embedded 
risk culture within the company, risk champs are 
appointed in each business unit. the purpose of risk 
champs is to facilitate risk management discussions 
locally and support the risk review processes, enabling 
decentralized risk structure and management, where 
appropriate.
governance structure
the board of directors and the executive board main-
tain a strong focus on the enterprise risk management 
process to safeguard that risk management remains an 
integral part of decision-making processes. the audit 
committee is responsible for reviewing the effective-
ness of risk management. 
risk reviews are conducted on a quarterly basis with 
the executive board, and bi-annually with the board 
of directors. through these reviews, management 
discusses current risks and ensures that the right risk 
mitigation strategies are adopted and are effective.
the enterprise risks are assessed in terms of six  
impact drivers: safety, compliance, financials, business 
interruption, environment, and brand & reputation. 
the risks are assessed in respect of the likelihood of 
the impact materializing. 
the company operates a three-tier risk system ensur-
ing clarity and transparency in the reporting process. 
tier 1 risks, the most significant risks, are reported 
to, and monitored by, the board of directors. tier 2 
risks are managed by the executive board, while tier 3 
risks are managed locally by the respective leadership 
teams. 
at chr. hansen, risk management is a mindset of 
continuous risk-conscious vigilance. 
each enterprise risk has a risk owner appointed who 
is responsible for overseeing the management of the 
risk, including for developing and executing mitigation 
action plans.

enterprise risk case study 
ensuring stable delivery 
during covid-19 
over the past years, chr. hansen has built up a strategic 
set-up with strong logistics partners around the globe, 
as part of the company’s business continuity program. 
when covid-19 tested the company’s supply chain 
robustness, this strategic set-up along with the general 
competence of all colleagues in global customer service 
and global logistics, proved its worth. 
chr. hansen maintained business continuity and ensured 
reliable supply to all global customers in the face of 
sudden and lasting risks and disruptions caused by 
covid-19. 
chr. hansen doubled down on its climate commitments 
and made a targeted transition from air freight to sea 
freight. significant volumes of avoided emissions can 
be attributed to this initiative, and the actual emissions 
reductions are a crucial step forward on the company’s 
engagement with the science based targets initiative. 
this also helped mitigate the company’s exposure to 
transport costs due to increased costs of air freight 
resulting from capacity shortages.

overview of selected key enterprise risk areas
product quality and safety
it security
description
as chr. hansen develops and manufactures natural solutions and ingredients within the 
food and healthcare segments, ensuring that its products do not have unintended health 
effects for the end consumer and that the quality of the products always meets the  
expectations of the customers constitutes a risk. 
digital connectivity continues to transform the way chr. hansen does business and became 
even more important due to covid-19. like all other organizations, chr. hansen is heavily 
dependent on an it infrastructure and technology supporting the day-to-day business. 
a breakdown or an attempt to cause damage to chr. hansen, its customers, its suppliers 
or partners through unauthorized access, destruction, corruption, manipulation of data or 
systems, would pose a significant risk to the company.
risk assessment 
consequences, should the risk materialize, are potential health effects for the end 
consumer, damage to the customers’ final products, significant brand and reputational 
damage and corporate fines/penalties.
the likelihood is considered to be low given the already established food safety manage-
ment system. chr. hansen’s food safety program is certified to internationally recognized 
food safety standards. all food production sites are fssc 22000 certified,  
and central product development functions are certified to iso 22000 standards.
consequences, should the risk materialize, are potentially substantial financial implications, 
long-term business disruption with a high impact on deliveries to chr. hansen’s customers, 
reputational damage and a potential loss of customers to competition.
the likelihood of a breakdown or malicious interference with major impact is considered to be 
low, due to the protected technology platform.
risk development and 
mitigation 2020/21
the risk remains unchanged.
during 2020/21, the company incorporated the new us food safety legislation (fsma) 
and had all sites recertified, ensuring compliance with the newly released  
iso 22000 and fssc 22000 food safety standards.
as part of the recent acquisitions, focus is on aligning the quality management systems to 
ensure the standards are consistently applied across the group. a mapping  
has been completed and execution will begin in 2021/22.
digitalization and remote working have accelerated the risk of emergence of specific cyber-
attack. the risk has been controlled through maintaining the extensive network of technical 
security controls, policy enforcements mechanisms, monitoring systems and management 
oversight to address these threats. 
the divestment of the natural colors diversion has introduced separate risks to ensure a safe 
and structured transfer of business applications and data to the new owners. several resourc-
es have been allocated as risk mitigation, ensuring a smooth and safe transfer.
as part of the recent acquisitions there is a focus to ensure alignment to the same it  
infrastructure and business applications that are applied across the group. this activity  
will continue.
risk focus 2021/22
due to the divestment of the natural color division, the quality risk picture for the  
sourcing landscape of raw materials has changed in terms of geographic focus and type  
of raw materials. the change will be used proactively to pursue a more active follow-up 
with the remaining supplier base of the business. 
implementation of the planned alignment of the quality management systems of the 
acquisitions will take high priority and requires a coordinated implementation of key  
it systems. the company continuously ensures that the quality management system is in 
compliance with relevant global product safety standards and national legislation.
to ensure a high level of product safety, chr. hansen maintains an extensive quality  
assurance and food safety program spanning the entire value chain, from the sourcing  
of raw materials to delivery of finished products to customers. 
the company will stay focused on the integration of business applications as part of the 
post-merger integration, through the development of a strong it architecture set-up.
furthermore, maintaining a protected technology platform is important for ensuring that 
the company’s critical and sensitive data, assets and reputation are protected against the 
increasing global threat of cyberattacks and theft.
chr. hansen continues the work to enhance its it disaster recovery organization and to 
develop a structured training program in order to enable the company to withstand potential 
threats.
it security is a strategic focus area with a concrete and ambitious digitalization strategy. 
hence, more resources are continuously put into protecting chr. hansen from cyber crime.

supply disruptions
protection of knowledge and brand
description
with a global production footprint, a sustainable sourcing program and a complex 
distribution network, there is a risk that disruption could affect the delivery to customers, 
which would lead to disruption of the global dairy supply chain. disruption may result 
from property damage, non-accessibility to raw materials, natural catastrophes or global 
network disruptions. pandemics, as seen during the covid-19 crisis, may also have a 
significant effect.
chr. hansen’s products have been perfected throughout our more than 145-year history. 
hence, protecting this innovative knowledge is essential to maintaining our position as market 
leader. copyright pirates, brand impersonators and trade secret thieves pose an increasing 
risk to the company.
risk assessment 
consequences, should the risk materialize, are a potential impact on deliveries to  
chr. hansen’s customers, significant brand and reputational damage and a potential  
loss of customers to competitors. 
the likelihood of property damage, leading to significant disruption in deliveries to our 
customers, is considered to be low. however, global covid-19 challenges have shown 
how quickly even a solid distribution network may become disrupted, impacting deliveries 
to customers. 
consequences, should the risk materialize, are a potentially high financial impact due to loss 
of customers, legal disputes, and potential damage to the company’s brand and reputation.
although an increased aggressiveness towards intellectual property (ip) theft has been reg-
istered in the market, the likelihood is considered to be medium. the company protects new 
knowledge, through a proactive ip strategy designed to support and protect the business.
risk development and 
mitigation 2020/21
the risk has increased due to the covid-19 implications.
due to covid-19, the global logistical supply chain was challenged by the global lockdown. 
in particular, the lack of air freight capacity, combined with significant increased cost for 
the limited air freight capacity available, encouraged the company to accelerate the shift 
into sea freight, limiting the additional costs that would otherwise have incurred, yet still 
ensured a steady flow of deliveries to customers. 
access to particular production materials, such as dry-ice and liquid nitrogen, was also a 
challenge. however, given the company’s overview of critical materials and with a robust 
business continuity set-up, the risk exposure remained low. 
the risk has increased, as the company has seen an increasing infringement activity in the 
probiotics market, with third parties attempting to take advantage of the chr. hansen brand 
equity. 
an online brand enforcement activity has been implemented, enabling digital surveillance of 
e-platforms for automated actions against infringement of chr. hansen and its key brands, 
supporting the company’s enforcement strategy.
in addition, a specific task force with relevant internal stakeholder participation has been 
established, to proactively manage the complex ip environment in china. the objective has 
been to act quickly on any infringement occurring in the marketplace.
during the year, the company successfully defended a number of disputes related to ip rights 
through legal action.
risk focus 2021/22
maintain a constant focus on and evolution of business continuity, where an essential ele-
ment is the company’s “one plant many locations” philosophy, allowing a swift switchover 
in production to reduce the impact on business and delivery performance. for value chains 
not fully duplicated, the company ensures increased levels of bulk product inventories.
the company will focus on moving even more freight from air to sea. as air freight capaci-
ty is anticipated to remain disrupted for the coming years, the company will be optimizing 
the logistical setup to the new normal, ensuring reliable supplies to customers. 
the company will continue its partnerships with insurance carriers and risk engineering 
experts providing valuable knowledge to reduce the risk of property damage. regular 
follow-ups are performed with the insurance carriers to ensure progress in eliminating 
identified shortcomings.
stay focused on value creation from ip activities by establishing an ip advisory board. further, 
the company will implement the “business focus ip strategy” for new business areas. 
a significant element of the post-merger integration of the acquisitions is to align the level 
of protection of knowledge and brand across the group. the company will continue to be 
focused on proactive and strict governance of ip/knowledge across the organization. 
moreover, the company enforces an aggressive strategy towards infringers of its intellectual 
property rights (ipr).

chr. hansen supports the 
recommendations of the task 
force for climate-related financial 
disclosures  
in 2020/21, chr. hansen took an important step towards further 
strengthening the climate-related risks and opportunities of our business 
by committing to start reporting in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of the task force for climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) 
from 2021/22. 
the purpose of tcfd is to enable better disclosure of the financial impact 
of climate-related risks and opportunities, in order to enable investors, 
lenders and insurance underwriters to make informed financial decisions. 
during 2020/21, initial steps towards the recommendations were taken, 
including integrating tcfd into the existing enterprise risk management 
framework. as such, any climate-related risks will follow the erm gov-
ernance structure to ensure adequate board and management oversight, 
and a common approach to identifying, analyzing and managing risk. 
workshops and deep-dives have been conducted to understand the 
climate-related risks and opportunities the company is facing as a result 
of changes to regulation, technology, markets, products and consum-
er demands. work is still in progress to further quantify these risks.      
similarly, natural catastrophe (natcat) simulations have been conduct-
ed by a third party to identify potential physical climate-related risks 
at our global sites to ensure the company’s business continuity plans 
covers potential situations.
at chr. hansen, we have been working with physical climate risks for 
several years, one example being the risk of flooding at our copenhagen 
site. however, tcfd brings a broader perspective to climate-related 
risks, and it is believed that the internal discussions and processes this 
generates are of value to our further work and climate resilience. in 
2021/22, we will dive further into the framework and our risk work to be 
able to share our first reporting on the recommendations.
enterprise risk case study 
understanding climate risk  
with chr. hansen’s largest site located at avedøre holme, an artificial 
island created through dredging in the 1960s, on the bay of køge, the risk 
of flooding has had a high-risk rating. if the site is flooded, it could cause 
significant disruption of the production process. 
during the past year, chr. hansen has allocated substantial resources to 
analyze the risk in partnership with its insurance carriers, external advisors 
and municipal authorities. a dike has been established to protect the dammed 
and dried-up area against water penetration and lack of drainage from a 
potential surge. around the island is a water ditch. water pumps are installed 
and continously tested at the avedøre holme industrial island to push back 
water from the ditch into the bay. hence, the risk of flooding caused by a surge 
remains small. 
in partnership with an engineering consultancy company, additional natcat 
simulations have been conducted. a 750-year-event simulating torrential rain 
provided valuable mitigation measures and has been included in our capacity 
expansion program. this will ensure that the risk of a serious disruption to 
business continuity remains low.

  board competency profile
sustainability & esg board oversight 
environmental, social and governance (esg) are 
increasingly recognized as imperative for conducting 
sustainable business. in this era, companies must seek 
long-term value creation by taking into account the 
needs of all their stakeholders, and society at large. 
hence, there are increasing expectations for board 
stewardship on esg issues. chr. hansen’s board of 
directors has therefore adopted an enhanced oversight 
on esg, with expanded fiduciary duties of the board of 
directors and at committee level from 2021/22. by im-
plementing this, we will be at the forefront of expected 
regulation and requirements from proxy advisors. 
board competencies and diversity 
the composition of the board of directors must be such 
that the consolidated competencies of its members 
enable it to inspire, guide and oversee the development 
of the company and diligently address and resolve the 
issues and problems faced by the company at any time. 
the board of directors has determined a competency 
profile for the shareholder-elected board members 
according to which the board members should possess 
the personal characteristics matching chr. hansen’s 
culture model and leadership essentials. in addition, em-
phasis is placed on experience and expertise within the 
food and dairy industry, global sales and marketing of 
fast-moving consumer goods, preferably food, strategic 
r&d, leadership and hr development, m&a and alli-
ance management, and finance and accounting. when 
recommending candidates for nomination to the board 
of directors, the nomination committee shall seek to 
achieve a balance between renewal and continuity and 
take diversity in relation to age, international experience, 
gender and diversity of perspectives into consideration.
the boards’ gender diversity target of having at least 
three women elected by the shareholders by 2022 has 
been met with four out of the current eight sharehold-
er-elected members being women. the board has 
adopted a new gender diversity target of having at least 
three shareholder-elected members of each gender by 
2025. the diversity level of the board of directors of 
chr. hansen a/s also had equal gender representation 
with two out of the three shareholder-elected members 
being women.
corporate governance statement
the board of directors regularly reviews chr. hansen’s 
corporate governance framework and policies in 
relation to the activities of chr. hansen, business 
environment, corporate governance recommendations 
and statutory requirements. section 107b of the danish 
financial statements act requires chr. hansen holding 
a/s to prepare a statement on corporate governance 
for the 2020/21 financial year. this statement includes 
a description of our governance structure and the main 
elements of the group’s internal control and risk man-
agement in connection with its financial reporting, as 
well as an overview of our position on each of the rec-
ommendations. the statement is available at https://
www.chr-hansen.com/en/investors/governance/
corporate-governance and forms part of the manage-
ment’s review but is not covered by the independent 
auditor’s report.
board evaluation
the chair of the board of directors is overall responsi-
ble for conducting an annual evaluation of the board’s 
performance. the evaluation includes all members 
of the board and the executive board. the evaluation 
addresses the efficiency of the board, the board com-
position and dynamics, the processes supporting its 
work, the value contributions of the board committees, 
the chair’s performance and the collaboration with the 
executive board. further, the process evaluates topics 
such as strategy development and implementation, 
risk awareness, monitoring and reporting, evaluation, 
succession planning, and potential overboarding of 
board members. in addition, each member of the board 
of directors is provided with feedback from all other 
members of the board and the executive board on their 
individual performance. the evaluation is directed by 
the chair and was in 2019/20 conducted internally for 
the first time in recent years. 
in 2020/21 the board decided to once again conduct 
an internal board evaluation facilitated by the corpo-
rate secretary, during which members of the board 
and the executive board anonymously completed a 
comprehensive online questionnaire, the responses 
of which were summarized in a report. in addition, the 
audit committee, the nomination committee, the re-
muneration committee and the science & innovation 
committee all conducted informal self-evaluations, 
the outcome of which was reported to the board in 
september 2021. 
the results of the evaluation presented to the board of 
directors in september 2021 showed a strong and pro-
fessional performing board having a very good collab-
oration with the executive board. overall, all the areas 
for improvement identified in the 2019/20 evaluation 
had been addressed. the 2020/21 evaluation resulted 
in a continued focus on strengthening enterprise risk 
management reporting and follow-up on the execution 
on recent acquisitions, incl. implementing learnings. 
further, there is also a focus on continuing to look at 
the balance between presentation and discussion and 
to revert to physical board meetings subject to the 
covid-19 environment. the chair of the board held 
individual meetings with each of the other board mem-
bers to review their performance. in addition, the board 
without the presence of the chair conducted a review 
of the chair’s performance, which was presented to the 
chair by a member of the nomination committee. in 
2021/22, the board evaluation will be facilitated by an 
external consultant.

 remuneration policy  
  2020/21 remuneration report  
the remuneration of the board of directors and the executive board 
of chr. hansen must contribute towards ensuring that the company 
is able to attract and retain highly qualified members to its board of 
directors and executive board. the remuneration and its composition 
are structured in such a way as to create a suitable alignment of the in-
terests of management and those of the shareholders. in this context, 
the remuneration must contribute towards promoting the strategy, 
long-term sustainability and creation of value in the chr. hansen 
group by supporting the group’s long-term and short-term objectives.
chr. hansen’s remuneration policy forms the basis of the framework 
governing remuneration of the board of directors and the executive 
board. the remuneration policy was most recently approved at the 
2019 annual general meeting held on november 27, 2019.  
chr. hansen has prepared a separate remuneration report in accord-
ance with section 139b of the danish companies act and the recom-
mendations. the remuneration report describes the remuneration 
received by each member of the board of directors and the executive 
board of chr. hansen holding a/s in the 2020/21 financial year. the 
remuneration report will be submitted to the 2021 annual general 
meeting for an advisory vote. 
remuneration 
what is the board of directors’ response 
to the increased focus on esg?
sustainability is an integral part of chr. hansen’s 
strategy, purpose, culture and product offering. 
in recent years, we’ve seen how esg has become 
a vital parameter for commercial success, and 
hence expectations for board stewardship on 
reporting climate, social and governance issues 
are on the rise. chr. hansen’s board of directors 
recognizes this, and we have therefore decided 
to enhance our oversight on esg from fiscal year 
2021/22. 
how do you link esg to executive 
remuneration?
chr. hansen’s purpose and strategy centers 
around a quest to ´grow a better world. 
naturally’. with the launch of the 2025 strategy 
in 2020, we introduced shared non-financial 
kpis including key esg elements constituting 
20% of the corporate leadership team’s short-
term incentive. we have taken this approach 
because we believe that a strategic focus on 
sustainability, diversity, safety and quality is 
paramount for staying competitive, attracting 
the brightest minds and delivering strong 
business results.

statement of the board of directors 
and executive board
the executive board and the board of directors have 
today considered and approved the annual report  
of chr. hansen holding a/s for the financial year 
 september 1, 2020 – august 31, 2021.
the annual report has been prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements in the 
danish financial statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements give a 
true and fair view of the financial position at august 
31, 2021 of the group and the parent company and 
of the results of the group’s and parent company’s 
operations and cash flows for 2020/21. in our opinion, 
management’s review includes a true and fair account 
of the development in the operations and financial 
circumstances of the group and the parent company, 
of the results for the year, and of the financial position 
of the group and the parent company, as well as a de-
scription of the most significant risks and elements of 
uncertainty facing the group and the parent company.

our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial statements give a 
true and fair view of the group’s and the parent com-
pany’s financial position at 31 august 2021 and of the 
results of the group’s and the parent company’s opera-
tions and cash flows for the financial year 1 september 
2020 to 31 august 2021 in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s  
long-form report to the audit committee and the 
board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements of chr. hansen holding 
a/s for the financial year 1 september 2020 to 31  
august 2021 comprise income statement and statement 
of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of 
changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes,  
including summary of significant accounting policies 
for the group as well as for the parent company.  
collectively referred to as the “financial statements”.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with interna-
tional standards on auditing (isas) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. our responsibili-
ties under those standards and requirements are  
further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance  
with the international ethics standards board for  
accountants’ international code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and the additional ethical 
requirements applicable in denmark. we have also 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the iesba code.  
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited 
non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of  
regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided. 
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of chr. hansen  
holding a/s for the first time after the initial public  
offering on 30 november 2010. we have been  
reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a 
total period of uninterrupted engagement of 11 years 
including the financial year for the period 1 september 
2020 to 31 august 2021. we were reappointed following 
a tendering procedure at the general meeting on 25 
november 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements for the period 1 
september 2020 to 31 august 2021. these matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the  
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
business combinations
in october 2020, chr. hansen acquired jennewein 
biotechnologie gmbh. management has prepared a 
purchase price allocation (’ppa’) regarding the acquisi-
tion, resulting in assets and liabilities being separately 
recognised and measured at fair value in the opening 
balance sheet.
when preparing the ppa, management used the 
group’s valuation methodologies. in order to deter-
mine the fair value of the separately identified assets 
and liabilities in a business combination, the valuation 
methodologies require input based on assumptions 
about the applied discounted cash flow forecasts, 
including determination of a wacc. 
the significant judgements and estimates involved in 
the ppa mainly relate to assessing the fair value of the 
identified acquired assets and liabilities at the opening 
balance sheet date, including the fair value of customer 
relationships and technology.  
we focused on this area because the ppa requires 
significant judgements and estimates by management.
refer to note 5.3 in the consolidated financial  
statements.
 
we assessed whether the acquisition met the criteria 
for a business combination.
we verified the assets and liabilities recognised in  
the opening balance sheet by performing audit proce-
dures in relation to the opening balance sheet. 
we involved our internal specialists in assessing the 
valuation methodologies used by management and 
the fair valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities.
we challenged the significant assumptions and 
judgements used to determine the fair value of the 
acquired assets and liabilities in the business  
combination.
we assessed the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures provided in the consolidated financial 
statements.

statement on management’s review and 
supplementary information
management is responsible for management’s review, 
pages 3 – 67 and supplementary information, pages 
137 – 142.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
management’s review and supplementary informa-
tion, and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read management’s re-
view and supplementary information and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review and supple-
mentary information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s 
review includes the disclosures required by the danish 
financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, in our view, 
management’s review and supplementary information 
is in accordance with the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company financial statements 
and management’s review has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the danish  
financial statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in management’s review or 
supplementary information.
management’s responsibilities for the financial 
statements
management is responsible for the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements and parent compa-
ny financial statements that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and further require-
ments in the danish financial statements act, and 
for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, dis-
closing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the group or 
the parent company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. misstate-
ments can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain profes-
sional scepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
• identify and assess the risks of material misstate-
ment of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collu-
sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresenta-
tions, or the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effec-
tiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by  
management.
71
chr. hansen annual report 2020/21
06 financial statements
• conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to contin-
ue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group or the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in  
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-
garding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence and, where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
from the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. we describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes pub-
lic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

group – equity
basis of preparation 
the consolidated financial statements of the chr. hansen group have been prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards 
board (iasb) and as adopted by the european union, and further requirements set out in the danish 
financial statements act.  
 
general information on recognition and measurement  
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost method, except for 
the measurement of certain financial instruments at fair value. 
 
the accounting policies are unchanged from last year, except for the implementation of new and 
amended ifrs/ias standards as stated below 
 
new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations  
chr. hansen adopts new ifrs standards, amendments and interpretations (ifrics) from the mandatory 
effective date at the latest. the following amendments were adopted as from september 1, 2020: 
 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 “definition of material” 
• amendments to ifrs 3 “business combinations” 
 
the adoption of new amendments and interpretation taking effect on september 1, 2020 had no material 
impact on the recognition, measurement or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for 
2020/21 and is not expected to have any significant impact on the financial reporting in future periods. 
 
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
the iasb has issued new or amended standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective 
and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2020/21.  
 
chr. hansen expects to adopt the new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations as they 
become mandatory, none of which are expected to have any significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
presentation of accounting policies  
where possible, the accounting policies for an accounting area are presented in the individual notes for 
that area. accounting policies not directly related to an area covered by a note are presented below.  
 
defining materiality  
the consolidated financial statements are a result of large numbers of transactions processed and 
aggregated into classes according to their nature or function. when aggregated, the transactions are 
presented in classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. if a line item is not 
individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial 
statements or in the notes. there are substantial disclosure requirements throughout ifrs. management 
provides specific disclosures required by ifrs unless the information is considered immaterial to the 
economic decision-making of the users of these financial statements or not applicable.   
 
translation of foreign currencies 
translation from functional currency to presentation currency 
items in the financial statements of each of the reporting companies of the group are measured in the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the company operates (the functional currency). 
 
assets, liabilities and equity items are translated from each reporting company's functional currency to eur at 
the balance sheet date. the income statements are translated from the functional currency into the presentation 
currency based on the average exchange rate for the individual months. differences arising on the translation of 
equity at the beginning of the period and translation of the income statement from average rates to the 
exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as a 
separate reserve in equity. 
 
the functional currency of the parent company is the danish krone (dkk). however, due to the group’s 
international relations, the consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (eur). 
 
translation of transactions and amounts  
transactions in foreign currencies are initially translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates at the 
transaction date. 
 
exchange adjustments arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the 
payment date are recognized in financial income or financial expenses in the income statement. receivables, 
payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
 
exchange adjustments arising due to differences between the rates at the balance sheet date and the transaction 
date are recognized as financial income or financial expenses in the income statement.  
 
 
 
1.1 general accounting policies 
78
chr. hansen annual report 2020/21
06 financial statements – group
group – note 1.1
basis of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of chr. hansen holding a/s (the 
parent company) and subsidiaries controlled by chr. hansen holding a/s, which are prepared in accordance 
with the group's accounting policies. 
 
intercompany transactions, shareholdings, balances and dividends are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
entities satisfying the criteria for joint control are accounted for as investments in joint ventures.  
 
revenue 
chr. hansen produces a wide range of cultures and enzymes. revenue includes the sale of goods and related 
services and royalties and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which chr. hansen 
expects to be entitled.  
 
revenue from a straightforward sale of goods to customers is recognized when control of the goods is 
transferred to the customer, i.e. when the goods are delivered to the end-customer.  
 
the performance obligations in the contracts are to deliver produced cultures or enzymes to the customers, and 
each batch delivered is considered a separate performance obligation, as each batch is distinct.  
 
products are often sold at a discount. such an agreement can be set up in various ways, but for all discount 
agreements, revenue is recognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discount. 
discounts are estimated based on historical data as well as forecasts. estimated discounts are reassessed at the 
end of each reporting period.  
 
a relatively small part of revenue originates from commission agreements under which agents undertake sales 
to third parties in return for commission on realized sales. revenue from such agreements is recognized when 
the goods are delivered, as the nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods.  
 
a trade receivable is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and an invoice is issued, as this 
is the point in time when the consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before 
payment is due. typical payment terms are around 45 days, but there may be country-specific deviations from 
typical payment terms.  
 
the obligation to provide a refund for products that are not of agreed quality or according to agreed 
specifications under the standard warranty terms is recognized as a provision. 
cost of sales 
cost of sales comprises the cost of products sold. cost comprises the purchase price of raw materials, 
consumables and goods for resale, direct labor costs and a share of indirect production costs, including costs of 
operation and depreciation of production facilities as well as operation, administration and management of 
factories. 
 
other operating income and expenses  
other operating income and expenses comprise income that is not related to the principal activities. this 
includes income from government grants, rental income, gains and losses on the disposal of intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment, and other income of a secondary nature in relation to the main activities of 
the group. 
 
alternative performance measures 
chr. hansen presents certain financial measures of the group’s financial performance, financial position 
and cash flows that are not defined according to ifrs.  
 
these non-ifrs financial measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies using the same 
method and may not be comparable.  
 
the financial measures should not be considered as a replacement for performance measures as defined 
under ifrs, but rather as supplementary information.

key accounting estimates and judgments 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes various accounting estimates 
and assumptions that form the basis of the presentation, recognition and measurement of the group’s 
assets and liabilities. the most significant accounting estimates and judgments are presented below. 
 
in applying the group’s accounting policies, management makes judgments that may significantly 
influence the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. determining the carrying 
amount of some assets and liabilities requires judgments, estimates and assumptions to be made 
concerning future events.  
 
the judgments, estimates and assumptions made are based on historical experience and other factors 
that management considers to be reliable, but which are inherently associated with uncertainty and 
unpredictability. these assumptions may prove incomplete or incorrect, and unexpected events or 
circumstances may arise.  
 
the group is also subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to actual results differing from these 
estimates, either positively or negatively. 
 
assumptions about the future and estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are described in the 
notes if there is a significant risk of changes that could result in material adjustments to the carrying 
amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year. 
 
management considers the key accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements to relate to the following:

segment information 
the reportable segments are based on the segmentation in the internal financial reporting received by the 
corporate leadership team and the executive board. the reportable segments are business units offering 
customers different products and services.  
 
food cultures & enzymes produces and sells innovative cultures, enzymes and probiotic products that 
help determine the taste, flavor, texture, shelf life, nutritional value and health benefits of a variety of 
consumer products in the food industry, especially in the dairy industry.  
 
health & nutrition produces and sells products for the dietary supplement, over-the-counter 
pharmaceutical, infant formula, animal feed and plant protection industries.  
 
segment performance is evaluated on the basis of ebit before special items consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements. special items, financial income and expenses, and income taxes are 
managed at group level and are not allocated to the business units. 
 
accounting policies 
segment information is provided for the group’s two continuing business units: food cultures & enzymes, 
and health & nutrition. the information is based on the management structure and internal management 
reporting to the corporate leadership team and the executive board, and constitutes our reportable 
segments. 
 
the identification of the segments on which to report does not involve aggregation of operating segments. 
the recognition and measurement principles used in the segment information are identical to the ones 
used in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
the geographic distribution of revenue is based on customer location. 
 
when presenting segment information from the income statement and balance sheet, disclosed amounts 
are split according to internal management information. some costs, assets and liabilities are not directly 
attributable to the business units and are distributed according to allocation keys used in internal 
management reporting. these allocation keys are reassessed at least annually, based on planned activity 
in the business units, and are subject to management’s judgment.

tax governance  
chr. hansen views tax governance as an integrated part of its business operations, and tax impacts are 
considered to avoid tax risks and ensure compliance with local legislation. the adherence to tax policies 
and the effectiveness of tax compliance and risk management are overseen by the audit committee on a 
regular basis.  
 
in 2020/21, chr. hansen updated its tax policy to include a tax governance structure and details on how 
the model supports chr. hansen’s ambitions as a sustainable company.  
 
chr. hansen’s tax policy highlights the importance of tax transparency. during the year, a review of tax 
processes in respect of the gri:207 framework concluded that this framework is well suited for a 
balanced approach to tax transparency on relevant tax matters, including the country-by-country data 
points. hence, chr. hansen has decided to publish a gri:207 report prepared in the context of chr. 
hansen’s business operations from 2021/22. 
 
key accounting estimates and judgments 
the recognition of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions is assessed by management. deferred 
tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised if management estimates 
that the tax assets can be utilised within a foreseeable future by offsetting against future positive 
taxable income. the assessment is made annually on the basis of budgets and business plans for the 
following years. while conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes, etc. with tax 
authorities may occur, and management judgment is applied to assess the possible outcome of such 
disputes. the most probable outcome is used as the measurement method, and management believes 
the provision made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with local tax authorities is adequate. 
 
accounting policies 
current tax liabilities and receivables are recognized in the balance sheet at the amounts calculated on 
the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and for taxes paid 
on account. 
 
deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. 
 
apart from assets acquired as part of business combinations, deferred tax is not recognized in respect 
of temporary differences concerning goodwill, office premises and other items where temporary 
differences have arisen at the time of acquisition without affecting profit for the year or taxable income. 
in cases where the computation of the tax base may be performed according to different tax rules, 
deferred tax is measured on the basis of management’s intended use of the asset or settlement of the 
liability.

in 2020/21, chr. hansen acquired jennewein biotechnologie gmbh. the acquisition has been allocated in 
full and tested for impairment within the health & nutrition business unit, refer to note 5.3. in 2019/20, 
the addition to goodwill related to the acquisition of hso health care and uas labs, both of which were 
allocated in full to the health & nutrition business unit.  
 
at august 31, 2021, management had performed an annual impairment test of the carrying amount of 
goodwill. no basis for impairment was identified. the impairment tests compare the carrying amount of 
the assets to the discounted value of future cash flows (value in use). the future cash flows are based on 
budgets and management's estimates of expected developments over the next five years. revenue 
growth assumptions, ebit, working capital and discount rate constitute the most material parameters of 
the calculations. 
 
at august 31, 2021, the growth rate for food cultures & enzymes business unit was projected to be above 
the average of the underlying market in the five-year period. chr. hansen continues to prioritize the core 
dairy business whilst developing new adjacencies to outgrow the market and protect/expand its 
leadership position. the growth projections in food cultures & enzymes are expected to be reached 
through fundamental market growth, pricing and market share gains; upselling and innovation; 
conversion; and adjacencies. 
 
in the health & nutrition business unit, an average growth rate exceeding the market growth in the five-
year period has been applied for revenue in alignment with our long-term ambitions for organic growth in 
health & nutrition. future growth in health & nutrition is to be derived through vast growth opportunities 
to expand and grow the businesses through driving penetration of probiotics and reinforcing the position 
in growth markets globally. 
 
the expected growth rate is based on the company’s own market intelligence process, through which 
information is collected from all key markets to form the basis for future market growth expectations.  
 
as a market leader with a global presence, the company has a unique opportunity to assess the market 
through direct interactions with customers. the internal expectations are then verified against available 
market data from external resources, including global market intelligence and research companies. as 
well as market growth, the company also assesses commercial opportunities to attract new customers 
and pricing and upselling to existing customers within the five-year period to establish expectations for 
growth above the expected level of market growth. the assessment is based on the company’s current 
product portfolio and ongoing and potential new projects with existing and potential new customers. 
 
growth rates for revenue have been applied at the lower end of the long-term financial ambitions set out 
in grow a better world, naturally. over the five-year period, an expected improvement in the ebit 
margin to more than 30% has been applied for both business units. a pre-tax discount rate of 8.4% 
(7.8% in 2019/20) has been applied in the impairment test for both business units. 
 
sensitivity tests covering key assumptions have been performed in connection with impairment testing. 
these additional sensitivity tests did not identify any potential impairment. 
 
key accounting estimates and judgments 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment, whereby an estimate is made to determine whether the 
cash-generating units related to goodwill will be able to generate sufficient future positive net cash 
flows to support the value of goodwill, trademarks with an indefinite useful life and other net assets of 
the entity in question. 
 
the estimate of future free net cash flows is based on budgets and business plans for the coming five 
years and on projections for subsequent years. budgets and business plans are based on specific future 
business initiatives for which the risks relating to key parameters have been assessed and recognized in 
estimated future free cash flows. projections for years following the five-year period are based on 
general expectations and risks. key parameters are revenue development, profit margins, proposed 
capital expenditure and growth expectations. the discount rate used to calculate recoverable amounts 
is the weighted average cost of capital before tax. 
 
accounting policies 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets of the acquired company. the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the group’s cash-
generating units, which are the operating segments at the acquisition date.

patents, trademarks, customer relationships etc. 
in 2020/21, chr. hansen acquired intangible assets through acquisitions amounting to eur 81.5 million 
(eur 123.9 million in 2019/20) which primarily related to patents, trademarks, and customer 
relationships. 
 
the carrying amount of technology arising from the acquisition of jennewein amounts to eur 39.2 million 
and the remaining useful life is nine years. 
 
development projects 
completed development projects and development projects in progress comprise development and 
testing of new strains for cultures and enzymes as well as production techniques. the value of the 
development projects recognized has been compared to expected sales or cost savings. in cases where 
indications of impairment have been identified, the relevant assets have been written down. the 
impairment tests were prepared similarly to the goodwill impairment test described in note 3.1, based on 
the value in use of the assets. 
 
chr. hansen recognized impairment losses of eur 1.6 million in food cultures & enzymes division and 
eur 0.3 million in health & nutrition division in 2020/21 in respect of capitalized development costs 
assessed not to be commercially feasible in light of the latest knowledge of the market potential. in 
2019/20, impairment losses amounted to eur 3.2 million (health & nutrition division).  
 
software 
software comprises expenses for acquiring software licenses and expenses related to internally 
developed software. the value of the recognized software has been compared to the expected value in 
use. no impairment losses were recognized in 2020/21 (eur 0.3 million in 2019/20). 
 
transfers to/from assets classified as held for sale 
the line item ”transferred to/from assets classified as held for sale” contains the net movement of cost 
and amortizations from 2019/20 – when assets were classified based on best estimate at the time – until 
2020/21, when the actual transfer of assets was realized. 
 
 
 
key accounting estimates and judgments 
finished development projects are reviewed at the time of completion and on an annual basis to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. if so, an impairment test is carried out for the 
individual development projects. for development projects in progress, however, an annual impairment 
test is always performed. the impairment test is performed on the basis of various factors, including 
future use of the project, the fair value of estimated future earnings or savings, interest rates and risks. 
 
for development projects in progress, management estimates on an ongoing basis whether each project 
is likely to generate future economic benefits for the group in order to qualify for recognition. the 
development projects are evaluated on both technical and commercial criteria. 
 
accounting policies 
research expenses are recognized in the income statement as incurred. development costs are 
recognized as intangible assets if the costs are expected to generate future economic benefits. 
 
costs for development and implementation of substantial software and it systems are capitalized and 
amortized over their expected useful lives. 
 
trademarks, patents and customer lists acquired are recognized at cost and amortized over their 
expected useful lives. 
 
other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. 
borrowing costs in respect of construction of assets are capitalized when it takes more than 12 months 
for them to be ready for use. 
 
amortization is carried out systematically over the expected useful lives of the assets: 
 
⋅ patents, trademarks, customer relationships etc. 
5-20 years 
⋅ software 
5-10 years 
⋅ development projects 
3-15 years

and amortizations from 2019/20 – when assets were classified based on best estimate at the time – until 
2020/21, when the actual transfer of assets was realized. 
 
accounting policies 
property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any 
accumulated impairment charges. property, plant and equipment in progress are measured at cost. cost 
comprises expenses for materials, other expenses directly related to making the asset ready for use as 
well as re-establishment expenses, provided that a corresponding provision is made at the same time. 
borrowing costs in respect of construction of assets are capitalized when it takes more than 12 months 
for the assets to be ready for use.  
 
the useful lives of the individual groups of assets are estimated as follows: 
 
⋅ buildings 
25-50 years 
⋅ plant and machinery 
5-20 years 
⋅ other fixtures and equipment 
3-10 years 
 
land is not depreciated. 
 
depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis.

lease liabilities are classified as part of borrowings in the balance sheet. for further information related to 
lease liabilities, refer to note 4.2.  
 
accounting estimates and judgments 
the lease relating to company headquarters in hørsholm is part of the transition to ifrs 16. 
management has assessed that the lease term for the current leases is 27 years including a five-year 
extension option. this is considered a judgment as a change hereto would have an impact on lease 
liabilities and right-of-use assets. 
 
accounting policies 
lease assets are ‘right-of-use assets’, which is a contract or part of a contract that conveys the lessee’s 
right to use an asset for a period of time. the lease asset is initially measured as the present value of 
future fixed lease payments plus upfront payments and/or other initial direct costs incurred, less any 
lease incentives received. if, at inception of the lease, it is reasonably certain that an extension or 
purchase option will be exercised, future lease payments will be included.  
 
the lease liability is measured using the group’s average incremental borrowing rate. 
 
lease assets are classified alongside owned assets of similar type under property, plant and equipment. 
the lease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. lease assets are 
tested for impairment in case of indication hereof.  
 
short-term leases and leases of low value are recognized as expenses in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.  
 
chr. hansen’s portfolio of leases covers mainly land, buildings, cars and equipment.

key accounting estimates and judgments 
the calculation of indirect production costs is reviewed regularly in order to ensure that relevant 
assumptions such as prices, production yield and measures of utilization are incorporated correctly. 
changes in the parameters, assumed production yield and utilization levels, etc. could have a significant 
impact on cost and, in turn, on the measurement of inventories and production costs. 
 
accounting policies 
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. cost is determined using the 
first-in, first-out method. the cost of goods for resale and raw materials and consumables comprises 
purchase price plus delivery costs. 
 
finished goods and work in progress are measured at cost, comprising costs incurred to bring the 
product to the current stage of completion and location. costs include the cost of raw materials, 
consumables, direct wages and salaries and indirect production overheads. indirect production 
overheads comprise indirect materials, wages and salaries, maintenance and depreciation of production 
machinery, buildings and equipment, and production administration and management.

accounting estimates and judgments 
the allowance for expected credit losses for trade receivables is based on historical credit loss 
experience combined with forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the credit 
risk. the expected loss rates are updated at every reporting date.  
 
accounting policies 
trade receivables are measured at amortized cost less allowances for lifetime expected credit losses.  
 
to measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk 
characteristics and days overdue. furthermore, an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for trade 
receivables is recognized on initial recognition.   
 
trade receivables are written off when all possible options have been exhausted and there are no 
reasonable expectations of recovery. the cost of allowances for expected credit losses and write-offs for 
trade receivables are included in sales and marketing expenses.

employee benefit plans in the group 
other employee benefit obligations consist of obligations regarding payments made in connection with 
employee service tenure, long-service benefits and other social benefits. 
 
the group has entered into pension agreements with a significant share of its employees. the majority of 
the plans are defined contribution plans, and only a small proportion are defined benefit plans. 
 
defined contribution plans 
the group finances the plans through regular premium payments to independent insurance companies, 
which are responsible for the pension obligations. once the pension contributions to the defined 
contribution plans have been paid, the group has no further pension obligations toward current or former 
employees. 
 
defined benefit plans 
for certain groups of employees, the group has entered into agreements on the payment of certain 
benefits, including pensions. these obligations are not or only partly covered by insurance. unfunded 
plans are recognized in the balance sheet, income statement and other comprehensive income as shown 
above. 
 
accounting policies 
contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year to which 
they relate. in a few countries, the group still operates defined benefit plans. the costs for the year of 
defined benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. this reflects services 
rendered by employees up to the valuation dates and is based on actuarial assumptions, primarily 
regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits and projected rates of 
remuneration growth. discount rates are based on the market yields of highly rated corporate bonds in 
the country concerned.  
 
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. past service 
costs are recognized immediately in the income statement. pension assets are only recognized to the 
extent that it is possible to derive future economic benefits such as refunds from the plan or reductions 
of future contributions. the group’s defined benefit plans are usually funded by payments from group 
companies and by employees to funds independent of the group. where a plan is unfunded, a liability 
for the retirement obligation is recognized in the balance sheet.

accounting policies 
provisions are recognized when, as a consequence of an event occurring on or before the balance sheet 
date, the group has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic benefits must be 
given up to settle the obligation. the obligation is measured on the basis of management’s best 
estimate of the discounted amount at which the obligation is expected to be met.

in 2018/19, chr. hansen entered into lease agreements related to renovation of group headquarters in 
hørsholm. the project is expected to be finalized in 2023. the contracts amounting to eur 77.4 million 
(undiscounted) have not commenced and are consequently not accounted for in lease assets and lease 
liabilities.  
 
pending court and arbitration cases 
certain claims have been made against the chr. hansen group. management believes the outcome of 
these disputes will not have a significant impact on the group's financial position. 
 
at august 31, 2021, chr. hansen had settled all diacetyl-related lawsuits based on alleged personal 
injuries as a result of exposure to diacetyl vapors.

financial risks 
being an international company, chr. hansen is exposed to currency and interest rate fluctuations. 
chr. hansen's corporate treasury department monitors and manages risks related to currency exposure 
and interest rate levels in accordance with the corporate treasury procedure approved by the board of 
directors. the procedure reflects how chr. hansen manages financial risks and contains rules defining not 
only how financial instruments are used to hedge risks, but also an acceptable level of risk exposure and 
use of counterparties. 
 
funding and liquidity  
funding and adequate liquidity are fundamental factors in driving an expanding business, and 
management of both is an integral part of chr. hansen's continuous budget and forecasting process.  
to ensure focus on managing the risks related to funding and liquidity, chr. hansen's corporate treasury 
department manages and monitors funding and liquidity for the entire group and ensures the availability 
of the required liquidity through cash management and uncommitted as well as committed facilities. 
 
foreign exchange risk 
to reduce exposure to exchange rate changes, chr. hansen trades primarily in eur and usd. however, 
trading also takes place in other currencies. currency exposure is mainly managed by having revenue and 
expenses in the same currency. where this is insufficient to manage the risk, chr. hansen's corporate 
treasury department performs hedging in accordance with the treasury procedure. refer to note 4.3 for 
further information.  
 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or 
the fair value of financial instruments. exposure relates to bank loans with floating interest rates. the risk 
is managed by entering into interest hedging agreements in accordance with the treasury procedure. 
refer to note 4.3 for further information.  
 
credit risk 
credit risk mainly relates to trade receivables and other receivables. the risk is limited due to chr. 
hansen’s diverse customer base representing multiple industries and businesses on international markets 
where the company cooperates with many large and medium-sized partners. when dealing with smaller 
businesses, the company sells mainly through distributors, thus reducing the credit risk regarding these 
customers. 
 
counterparty risk 
counterparty risk for cash, deposits and financial instruments is handled by only engaging with financial 
institutions that have a satisfactory long-term credit rating. chr. hansen's core financial counterparties 
currently have long-term credit ratings of aa or a. chr. hansen's treasury procedure also defines a credit 
limit for each counterparty.

accounting policies 
the group classifies financial assets in the following measurement categories: 
⋅⋅ those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through oci or through profit or loss), and 
⋅⋅ those to be measured at amortized cost. 
 
the classification depends on the group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the 
contractual terms of the cash flows. 
 
for assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in either profit or loss or oci.  
 
the group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those 
assets changes. 
 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and unrestricted deposits with banks. 
 
financial liabilities, including mortgage loans and loans from credit institutions, are initially measured at 
fair value less transaction costs incurred. subsequently, the loans are measured at amortized cost. 
amortized cost is calculated as original cost less installments plus/less the accumulated amortization of 
the difference between cost and nominal value. losses and gains on loans are thus allocated over the 
term so that the effective interest rate is recognized in the income statement over the loan period. 
financial liabilities are derecognized when settled. 
 
the portion of the debt maturing after one year is recognized as non-current debt and the remainder as 
current debt. 
 
other debts are measured at amortized cost. however, derivative financial instruments recognized 
under other payables are measured at fair value. refer to note 4.3.

the fair value is calculated using a valuation model based primarily on observable market data, 
corresponding to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. there is no currency risk related to the group’s swaps. 
 
the interest on the group's financing facilities is based on a floating interest rate plus a margin. in the 
financial year 2020/21, interest rate floors in loan agreements were renegotiated and the eur swaps 
were therefore effective at the end of the financial year. the average fixed rate on usd swaps is 1.60% 
and eur 0.04%. both eur and usd swaps are designed as bullet notional.

the fair value is calculated using a valuation model based primarily on observable market data, 
corresponding to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. all contracts are used for fair value hedges. 
 
the overall purpose of managing currency risk is to minimize the effect of short-term currency 
movements on earnings and cash flows. the group's main currencies are eur, usd and usd-related 
currencies. exposure is limited by assets, debt and expenses to a certain degree matching the geographic 
segmentation of sales. investments in subsidiaries are not hedged. the fair value is based primarily on 
observable market data, corresponding to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

the group is exposed to market risk, primarily risks relating to currency and interest rates, and uses 
financial instruments to hedge recognized risks. the group only enters into hedging agreements that 
relate to the underlying business. 
 
financial instruments used by the group are cash instruments, foreign exchange spot trades, foreign 
exchange forwards, forward exchange swaps, and current and non-current loans.

interest rate swaps are used for cash flow hedging where the underlying floating interest rates are hedged 
into fixed interest rates. at least 50% of the group’s bank loans must carry fixed interest rates directly or 
through derivatives. the cfo has the mandate to approve a threshold below 50% for a 12-month period. 
 
gross debt (fixed-rate period) must have a duration of a minimum of 1 year. 
 
the balance between fixed and variable interest rates and gross debt duration (fixed-rate period) is 
measured on a monthly basis.

(continued)

chr. hansen annual report 2020/21
06 financial statements – group
accounting policies 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. the fair values of derivative financial 
instruments are included in other receivables and other payables, respectively, and positive and 
negative values are offset only when the group has the right and the intention to settle financial 
instruments net. fair values of derivative financial instruments are computed on the basis of current 
market data and generally accepted valuation methods. 
 
certain derivative financial instruments are designated as one of the following: 
 
⋅⋅ hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges) 
⋅⋅ hedges associated with highly probable forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) 
 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition 
as a fair value hedge of recognized assets and liabilities are recognized in the income statement 
together with changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability with respect to the hedged portion. 
 
the effective part of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for cash flow 
hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate reserve in equity. the 
reserve is transferred to the income statement on realization of the hedged transactions. if a derivative 
financial instrument used to hedge expected future transactions expires, is sold or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting, any accumulated fair value reserve remains in equity until the hedged transaction is 
concluded. if the transaction is no longer expected to be concluded, any fair value reserve accumulated 
under equity is transferred to the income statement. 
 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for net investment hedges that 
effectively hedge currency fluctuations in these entities are recognized directly in the consolidated 
financial statements in a separate translation reserve in equity. 
 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement as 
financial income or financial expenses.

matching shares program 
long-term matching share programs are granted to members of the executive board and certain key 
employees. 
 
under the program, participants are required to acquire a number of existing shares in chr. hansen 
holding a/s (investment shares) and retain ownership of such shares for a predefined holding period of 
three years. upon expiration of the holding period and subject to fulfillment of certain predefined 
performance targets and continued employment at the vesting date, participants will be entitled to 
receive up to 7.5 additional shares in chr. hansen holding a/s (matching shares) per investment share 
at no consideration. 
 
the theoretical market value of the program in 2020/21 was eur 4.4 million, based on the fulfillment of 
all predefined performance targets (eur 3.2 million in 2019/20). the fair value at grant was eur 3.8 
million, taking into consideration the assessed likelihood of meeting the non-market condition (eur 2.8 
million in 2019/20). 
 
eur 1.5 million was expensed in 2020/21 relating to the matching shares programs, including 
accelerations and reversals (eur 0.1 million in 2019/20). 
 
accounting policies 
the share programs are accounted for on an accrual basis over the service period. rsus issued are 
measured at fair value at the grant date multiplied by the probability of vesting. matching shares are 
measured as the value of the maximum number of matching shares to be granted multiplied by the 
probability of vesting. probabilities are adjusted every year until vesting.

acquisitions during 2020/21 
the acquired business was recognized in the consolidated financial statements from the time of the 
acquisition. the purchase price allocation was prepared in accordance with ifrs by fair value assessment 
of identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. 
 
the following valuation techniques were applied in the fair value assessment of significant net assets 
acquired:  
⋅ property, plant and equipment; were assessed for fair value by applying replacement cost approach.  
⋅ technology; was assessed applying relief from royalty method. 
⋅ customer relationships; were assessed using a multi-period excess earnings model approach as the 
valuation methodology. 
 
jennewein biotechnologie gmbh 
on october 9, 2020, chr. hansen acquired full ownership and control of the jennewein biotechnologie 
gmbh (subsequently renamed chr. hansen hmo gmbh). the acquisition of the german-based b2b 
company expands chr. hansen’s microbial and fermentation technology platforms by adding the 
emerging and exciting high-growth business area of human milk oligosaccharides. jennewein is 
recognized as a global leader in the hmo market with six commercialized hmos, a strong product 
pipeline, a global customer base and a strong ip portfolio of more than 200 patents granted in key 
markets. 
 
chr. hansen obtains access to intangible assets comprising customer relationships, patents and 
technology. the acquisition was conducted as a share deal. goodwill relates to expected commercial and 
operational synergies from significant potentials and know-how with respect to production, innovation 
and commercialization accumulated by the workforce in jennewein. 
 
transaction costs related to the acquisition of jennewein amounted to eur 5.1 million, of which eur 4.0 
million was recognized in the income statement as special items in 2020/21 (eur 1.1 million in 2019/20). 
 
earnings impact 
revenue and ebit comprise eur 19 million and negative eur 18 million, respectively, reported by 
jennewein since the date of acquisition. on a pro forma basis, if the acquisition had been effective from 
september 1, 2020, jennewein would have contributed an estimated eur 21 million to revenue and 
negative eur 18 million to ebit. 
 
other 
in 2020/21, a settlement of cash consideration of eur 0.7 million was recognized, which relates to the 
prior-year acquisition of hundsbichler.

austria‐based b2b company specializing in probiotics for women’s health.  
 
on july 27, 2020, chr. hansen completed the acquisition of the full ownership and control of uas 
laboratories llc (uas labs), a us‐based b2b company specializing in clinically documented probiotics.

chr. hansen annual report 2020/21

key accounting estimates and judgments  
the most significant assets acquired generally comprise goodwill, trademarks, patents, ip rights and 
property, plant and equipment. no active market exists for the majority of the acquired assets and 
liabilities, in particular in respect of acquired intangible assets. accordingly, management makes 
estimates of the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. depending on the 
nature of the item, the determined fair value of an item may be associated with uncertainty and possibly 
adjusted subsequently. 
 
accounting policies 
on acquisition of entities and joint ventures, the acquisition method is applied. acquired assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value at the time control is 
deemed to exist. identifiable intangible assets are recognized if they can be separated and the fair value 
can be reliably measured. deferred tax on revaluations is recognized.  
 
any positive differences between cost and fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognized as goodwill under intangible assets. the cost is 
stated at the fair value of shares, debt instruments, and cash and cash equivalents. goodwill is not 
amortized but is tested annually for impairment. negative balances (negative goodwill) are recognized 
in the income statement at the date of acquisition. positive differences on acquisition of joint ventures 
are recognized in the balance sheet under investments in joint ventures.  
 
if the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of 
the period in which the combination is effected, adjustments made to the provisional fair value of 
acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities or cost of the acquisition within 12 months of the 
acquisition date are reflected in the initial goodwill. the adjustment is calculated as if it had been 
recognized at the acquisition date, and comparative figures are restated.  
 
changes in estimates of the cost of the acquisition that are contingent on future events are recognized 
in the income statement.  
 
acquired entities are recognized in the consolidated financial statements from the time of the 
acquisition.

key accounting estimates and judgments  
when classifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, management makes a number of judgments as to 
the estimated fair value of the disposal group. depending on the nature of the disposal group’s 
activities, assets and liabilities, the estimated fair value may be associated with different levels of 
uncertainty, and subsequent adjustments are thus possible.  
 
accounting policies 
a major separate line of business is classified as a discontinued operation if it is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within 12 
months from the balance sheet date.  
 
the results of the discontinued operations are presented as one separate line item in the income 
statement, and the assets and liabilities expected to be transferred are presented as a single line item 
within current assets and current liabilities, respectively. in the cash flow statement, cash flows from 
discontinued operations are presented as separate line items under operating, investing and financing 
cash flows. 
 
assets and liabilities attributable to discontinuing operations are measured at the lower of the carrying 
amount at the time of classification as 'held for sale' and fair value less selling costs. the carrying 
amount is measured in accordance with the group's accounting policies. a profit from the sale will be 
recognized when closing has taken place. 
 
no depreciation or amortization will be effected on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
from the time of classification as 'held for sale', which is considered to be the last day of the financial 
year 2019/20.

venture with lonza. the joint venture, bacthera, was established in september 2019. bacthera operates 
in the emerging market for live biotherapeutic products and positions itself as the leading contract 
development and manufacturing partner (cdmo) for biotech and pharma customers. 
 
as part of the joint venture agreement, the parties have agreed on a total investment of eur 90 million to 
be financed and shared equally between chr. hansen and lonza over a period of three years, after which 
bacthera is expected to be largely self-funding.

accounting policies 
investments in joint ventures are recognized and measured under the equity method. the item 
“investments in joint ventures” in the balance sheet includes the proportionate ownership share of the 
net asset value of the enterprises calculated on the basis of the fair values of identifiable net assets at 
the time of acquisition with deduction or addition of unrealized intercompany profits or losses and with 
addition of the remaining value of any increases in value and goodwill. joint ventures with a negative net 
asset value are recognized at eur 0. if the group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit 
in the joint venture, the deficit is recognized under provisions.

impairment losses in 2020/21 primarily comprise dividend received from subsidiaries exceeding the total 
comprehensive income in the period in which the dividend is declared. there were no indications of 
impairment of the investments in 2019/20. 
 
disposals during the year relate to the divestment of the natural colors business. 
 
see note 5.8 to the consolidated financial statements for a list of group companies.  
 
key accounting estimates and judgments 
management performs an annual test to identify any indications of impairment of investments in group 
companies. impairment tests are conducted in the same way as for goodwill in the chr. hansen group, 
see note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.  
 
accounting policies 
dividends from group companies are recognized as income in the income statement of the parent 
company in the financial year in which the dividend is declared. if the carrying amount of an investment 
in a subsidiary exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets in the subsidiary’s financial statements, or 
the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the period in which the 
dividend is declared, the carrying amount of the subsidiary is tested for impairment. 
 
investments in group companies are measured at cost. if the cost exceeds the recoverable amount, it is 
written down.

accounting policies 
intercompany loans and receivables are reviewed for impairment on the same basis as external 
receivables. the expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 12 
months and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. the historical loss 
rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors 
affecting the ability of intercompany customers to settle receivables.

financial risks 
chr. hansen holding a/s is exposed to market risks, primarily risks relating to currency and interest, 
and uses financial instruments to hedge recognized and future transactions. chr. hansen holding a/s 
only enters into hedging agreements that relate to the underlying business. 
 
funding and liquidity 
see note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
foreign exchange risk 
the overall purpose of managing currency risk is to minimize the impact of short-term currency 
movements on earnings and cash flows. the main currency risk for the company is loans denominated in 
usd. 
 
it is company policy not to hedge investments in subsidiaries. 
 
interest rate risk  
interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or 
the fair value of financial instruments. exposure relates to bank loans with floating interest rates. the risk 
is managed by entering into interest hedging agreements in accordance with the treasury procedure. 
 
the interest on the company's financing facilities is based on a floating interest rate plus a margin. at 
august 31, 2021, 50% of the outstanding debt was hedged through interest rate swaps or loans at fixed 
interest rates (32% at august 31, 2020). the total debt had an average maturity of 2.7 years at august 31, 
2021 (2.2 years at august 31, 2020). an increase of 1 percentage point in the average interest rate on the 
company’s interest-bearing debt excluding swaps would reduce the company's earnings before tax by 
eur 4.6 million over the next 12-month period (eur 9.3 million in the financial year 2019/20). the effect 
of a 1 percentage point interest rate change on the swaps entered into would be eur 3.0 million (eur 3.0 
million in 2019/20).

matching shares programs 
long-term matching share programs are granted to members of the executive board and certain key 
employees. 
 
under the program, participants are required to acquire a number of existing shares in chr. hansen 
holding a/s (investment shares) and retain ownership of such shares for a predefined holding period of 
three years. upon expiration of the holding period and subject to the fulfillment of certain predefined 
performance targets and continued employment at the vesting date, participants will be entitled to 
receive up to 7.5 additional shares in chr. hansen holding a/s (matching shares) per investment share at 
no consideration. 
 
the theoretical market value of the program in 2020/21 was eur 3.6 million, based on the fulfillment of 
all predefined performance targets (eur 2.7 million in 2019/20). the fair value at grant was eur 3.1 
million, taking into consideration the assessed likelihood of meeting the non-market condition (eur 2.4 
million in 2019/20). 
 
eur 1.4 million was expensed in 2020/21 relating to the matching shares programs, including

vest after up to three years subject to the person still being employed with chr. hansen. 
 
the value of rsus allocated in 2020/21 (rsu program 12) was estimated at eur 1.8 million (eur 1.4 
million in 2019/20). the number of rsus allocated, their value, and underlying assumptions will be finally 
determined in november 2021. 
 
eur 2.0 million was expensed in 2020/21 relating to the short-term rsu programs (eur 0.2 million 
in 2019/20).

what we are assuring
the scope of our work was limited to assurance over 
the percentage of the gross revenue from products 
with an impact on sdgs no. 2, 3 and 12 as stated on 
page 140 of the annual report 2020/21. the per-
centage is consolidated both for the continuing and  
the discontinued operations.
professional standards applied and level of 
assurance
we performed a limited assurance engagement in 
accordance with international standard on assurance 
engagements 3000 (revised) ‘assurance engage-
ments other than audits and reviews of historical 
financial information’. a limited assurance engage-
ment is substantially less in scope than a reasonable 
assurance engagement in relation to both the risk 
assessment procedures, including an understanding 
of internal control, and the procedures performed in 
response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level 
of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engage-
ment is substantially lower than the assurance that 
would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control 
we have complied with the independence requirements 
and other ethical requirements in the international  
ethics standards board for accountants’ international 
code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba 
code), which is founded on fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality and professional behaviour and 
ethical requirements applicable in denmark. 
pricewaterhousecoopers applies international standard 
on quality control 1 and accordingly maintains a compre-
hensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements. 
understanding reporting and measurement 
methodologies 
the percentage of gross revenue from products with 
an impact on sdgs no 2, 3 and 12 needs to be read and 
understood together with accounting principles, which 
management is solely responsible for selecting and 
applying. the absence of a significant body of estab-
lished practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but accept-
able, measurement techniques and can affect compara-
bility between entities and over time.
independent practitioner’s limited assurance 
report on the 2020/21 contribution of chr. hansen 
holding a/s to the un global goals.
to the stakeholders of chr. hansen holding a/s
chr. hansen holding a/s (chr. hansen) engaged us to 
provide limited assurance on the company’s percent-
age of gross revenue from products which contribute to 
the un sustainable development goals (sdgs no. 2, 3 
and 12) for the period 1 september 2020 to 31 august 
2021. chr. hansen has mapped its product portfolio 
with respect to sdg impact and concluded that sold 
products in an amount of 82% of its gross revenue 
from continued operations and 97% from discontinued 
operations, respectively, have a positive impact on one 
or more of the sdgs no. 2, 3 and 12.
our limited review conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and the evi-
dence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that 
causes us not to believe that the 2020/21 percentage 
of gross revenue from products contributing to the un 
sustainable development goals (sdgs no. 2, 3 and 12) 
for both the continuing and the discontinued opera-
tions as stated on page 140 in the 2020/21 annual 
report have not been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with  the accounting principles as 
described in the “resume of sustainability accounting 
principles” on page 140 of the annual report.

management’s responsibilities
management of chr. hansen is responsible for: 
• designing, implementing and maintaining internal 
controls over information relevant to the prepara-
tion of the percentage of the gross revenue from 
products with an impact on sdgs no. 2, 3 and 12 that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error;
• establishing objective accounting principles for 
preparing data; and
• consolidating and reporting the gross revenue per-
centages based on the accounting principles.
our responsibility 
we are responsible for: 
• planning and performing the engagement to obtain 
limited assurance about whether the percentages of 
gross revenue from sold products with an impact on 
sdgs 2, 3 and 12 as stated on page 140 in the annual 
report 2020/21 are free from material misstate-
ment, and are prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the accounting principles;
• forming an independent conclusion, based on the 
procedures we have performed, and the evidence 
obtained; and
• reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of chr. 
hansen holding a/s.
work performed
we are required to plan and perform our work in order 
to consider the risk of material misstatement of the 
data. in doing so and based on our professional judge-
ment, we:
• made inquiries regarding the preparation of product 
data sheets;
• assessed underlying documentation in support 
of product’s impact on sdgs whether based on 
scientific trials, externally reviewed impact studies, 
customer appraisals or internal r&d test results;
• assessed consolidations of sold amounts of products 
and reconciled whether total gross revenues per 
product are aligned with net revenue in the audited 
consolidated financial statements for 2020/21;
• conducted show me meetings with key individuals 
at chr. hansen responsible for sales and preparation 
of product datasheets as well as for calculations and 
consolidation.
• evaluated the evidence obtained.

1) 
 data from uas labs and jennewein is not accounted for in the gross revenue or in the sdg contribution or in the improving

2) 
 to improve the methodology behind the calculation, minor adjustments have been made to assumptions around dosage.  
as a result, the numbers have been recalculated. this still leaves us on track to meet the 2025 target.
3)

4) 
for 2020/21, natural colors are included for seven months until the divestment.

resume of the sustainability accounting principles
scope 
the revenue contribution to the un sdgs 
is the result of an annual assessment of 
 chr. hansen’s product portfolio. all products 
are assessed in terms of their contribution/
impact on sdgs no. 2, 3 or 12. the impact is 
assessed according to eight defined impact 
categories: 
• increase productivity and yield  
(un sdgs 2 or 12) 
• reduce waste  
(un sdgs 2 or 12)
• substitute artificial ingredients  
(un sdgs 3 and 12)
• increase food safety  
(un sdgs 3 and 12)
• enhance animal welfare  
(un sdg 2)
• promote health and well-being  
(un sdg 3)
• reduce salt, sugar, fat and lactose  
(un sdg 3)
• ensure access to affordable and available 
nutrition (un sdgs 2 and 12)
uas labs and jennewein are not accounted 
for in the planet or product performance this 
year. this is due to the progress of the inte-
gration process. as this will further mature 
and data processes be more automated, we 
expect to include data as of next year. in case 
of divestments, products and gross revenue 
are accounted for in group numbers until the 
divestment is reported in the financial state-
ments as discontinued business.
documentation requirements 
the documentation reports include one of the 
following types of documentation for each of 
the product categories):
• results from scientific trials or clinical trials
• reviewed impact studies or articles 
• customer trials and feedback
• r&d internal tests (should, to the extent 
possible, be supported by additional doc-
umentation and interviews with relevant 
internal stakeholders)

1)  2019/20 and 2018/19 numbers have been adjusted to more accurately reflect the carve-out of natural colors. 
2)  a team is considered diverse if there is at least 30% of each gender and 30% non-locals. 
3)  covid-19 has affected the onboarding process, making it more online based. as a result we are not able to report on this indicator for 2020/21.

forward-looking statements 
this report contains forward-looking statements that reflect 
management’s current views with respect to certain future events 
and potential financial performance. forward-looking statements 
are statements other than of historical facts. the words “believe,” 
“expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “outlook,” “will,” “may,” 
“continue,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking 
statements. 
forward-looking statements include statements regarding: objectives, 
goals, strategies, outlook and growth prospects; future plans, events 
or performance and potential for future growth; liquidity, capital 
resources and capital expenditures; economic outlook and industry 
trends; developments of the company’s markets; the impact of 
regulatory initiatives; and the strength of competitors. the forward-
looking statements in this report are based upon various assumptions, 
many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including 
without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating 
trends, data contained in records and other data available from third 
parties. 
although the company believes that these assumptions were 
reasonable when made, these assumptions are inherently subject to 
significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies 
and other important factors which are difficult or impossible to 
predict and may be beyond our control. such risks, uncertainties, 
contingencies and other important factors could cause the actual 
results of the company or the industry to differ materially from those 
results expressed or implied in this report by such forward-looking 
statements.
the information, opinions and forward-looking statements contained 
in this report speak only as at the date of this report, and are subject 
to change without notice. the company and its respective agents, 
employees or advisors do not intend to, and expressly disclaim 
any duty, undertaking or obligation to, make or disseminate any 
supplement, amendment, update or revision to any of the information, 
opinions or forward-looking statements contained in this report to 
reflect any change in events, conditions or circumstances beyond what 
is required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange rules and 
regulations.
