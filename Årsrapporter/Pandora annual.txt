the big picture
for pandora, 2020 was a paradox. on the one hand, the pandemic  
forced us to temporarily close most of our stores and revenue 
declined dramatically. many commercial plans had to be cancelled or 
postponed, as focus shifted to protecting customers and employees. 
on the other hand, 2020 marked a milestone in the company’s 
turnaround. we are reigniting the desire for pandora. the positive 
brand development that started towards the end of 2019 continued, 
as we cemented our position as a desirable and affordable luxury 
brand. the strategic initiatives under programme now showed very 
strong results, and our share price increased 135%. total shareholder 
return topped both the danish c25 and the stoxx 600 personal & 
household goods indices. 
we were able to leverage new consumer insights across the business 
and despite the disruption from covid-19, our retail operations 
proved their resilience. this was particularly evident in our online 
stores. as social distancing put limits on physical retail, and brick-
and-mortar stores had to close, we were able to recoup a lot of 
revenue thanks to our significant investments in digital initiatives in 
recent years. pandora’s online revenue doubled in 2020.
we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities, omnichannel 
initiatives, and data analytics. these are core elements of the brand’s 
future, as we aim to stay relevant to different consumer groups while 
being very competitive in our go-to-market strategies.
in 2020, we changed the way pandora operates. we completed a 
strategic reorganisation to bring pandora closer to consumers and 
ensure more consistent global execution of our product and market-
ing concepts. the reorganisation has enabled faster decision-making 
and better collaboration. our agility and operational excellence 
during the pandemic are solid evidence of the new organisation.
pandora also made great progress on the sustainability front in 2020. 
we committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 
2025, reducing emissions in our full value chain in line with the paris 
agreement, and switching to using only recycled silver and gold in 
our products by 2025. these decisions will greatly benefit the envi-
ronment and have set a new standard for responsible production 
in the jewellery industry. we also extended our collaboration with 
unicef after having raised usd 3.4 million for vulnerable children in 
the first year of the partnership. some of the funds were directed to 
covid-19 relief.
we are now preparing a new chapter for pandora. programme now 
was launched in late 2018 as a two-year transformation programme 
with the main objective of halting the decline in revenue. it has 
changed the company, and the transformation is nearing its comple-
tion. we look forward to presenting a new strategy and embarking 
on the next era for the company – an era of growth – in support of 
our aim to give a voice to people’s loves.
we would like to thank all pandora’s employees for their commit-
ment, innovation and perseverance during a very challenging year.

a review of 2020 can only begin with one topic. a terrible pandemic 
swept the world, upending lives and societies everywhere. the im-

and we all hope for brighter times in the new year.

solid performance 
as brand strengthens
executive summary
over the past two years, we have worked to 
transform our business with the programme 
now initiatives and infuse new energy into  
the pandora brand.  
our strong performance during the pandemic and our high 
consumer engagement show that pandora’s brand momentum 
continues to strengthen.
the main commercial initiatives of programme now kicked 
off with the brand relaunch on 29 august 2019. in q4 2019, we 
saw the first encouraging results, as like-for-like sales growth 
improved compared to the prior quarters of 2019. this trend 
continued in early 2020, where pandora generated positive  
like-for-like in january and february (excluding china).
in 2020, pandora’s financial results were severely impacted by 
covid-19 and the temporary closures of most of our stores 
and reduced footfall in open stores. despite the impact,  
pandora generated 4% organic growth in q4.
it is clear that pandora has taken significant steps in 2020  
towards the key objective of programme now, stabilising  
the top-line after years of like-for-like revenue decline. 
read more about programme now on page 17  
since the outbreak of covid-19, we have taken a number of 
steps to navigate through the crisis in a socially responsible 
way. we have prioritised a safe environment for employees and 
customers, and we have put in place all necessary measures to 
comply with local authorities’ guidelines on social distancing 
and other safety requirements. when stores were forced to 
close, we guaranteed full base pay for our employees. 
during the first lockdowns in spring, pandora took a number 
of steps to secure a very robust liquidity position and protect 
our profitability as revenue declined. these measures enabled 
a strong commercial comeback when stores reopened after 
the lockdowns. the commercial plan was based on ensuring 
available and motivated store staff, actively managing fresh

sales growth  
accelerated

inventory, and continuing a strong media and marketing push. 
these decisions produced encouraging results, as consumers 
returned to stores and pandora has taken market share, exclud-
ing china, in a highly fragmented industry.

the big picture
global sell-out growth (equivalent to like-for-like growth 
including temporarily closed stores) improved step by step 
from the low-point in april 2020. from november 2020, a wave 
of covid-19 lockdowns in key european markets, including 
france, the uk and germany, and restrictive retail guidelines 
in most other european markets had a negative impact on our 
performance in the important fourth quarter. the negative 
impact on performance from covid-19 store restrictions ap-
pears to have been (partially) offset by a non-recurring positive 
impact from reallocation of consumer spending away from 
travelling and services towards gifting and discretionary goods. 
sell-out growth was -39% in q2 2020, -2% in q3 2020 and 1% in 
q4 2020. the full-year ended at -12%. 
e-commerce has been a positive highlight in 2020 and a 
significant driver of our resilient and robust performance. we 
relaunched our online business in 2019 and have been deliver-
ing strong results ever since. online sales growth accelerated 
significantly during the lockdowns, as pandora successfully 
steered customers from offline to online, generating 103% 
online sell-out-growth for the year. digital initiatives will con-
tinue to be prioritised and are considered core for the brand’s 
future.
brand momentum remains strong in a changed retail 
environment
in q4 2020, we took a number of actions to manage the busy 
holiday shopping in stores operating under social distancing 
requirements. these initiatives centred on three objectives:
 • accommodate peak traffic into physical stores through a com-
bination of increasing available store space and decreasing 
transaction time in an already fast transaction environment.  
 • stretch peak trading periods over longer time through a  
combination of tactical promotions and managing media push. 
 • transfer traffic from offline to online through digital offerings, 
media planning, and by providing other incentives for consumers  
to access the pandora brand online. 
the initiatives were successful, and from mid-november to 31 
december online transactions increased by 87% on last year.
financial performance
even though 2020 was an exceptionally challenging and 
unpredictable year, pandora was still highly profitable and 
cash-generative. the ebit margin excluding restructuring costs 
was 20.4% and cash conversion including lease payments was 
183%. this is testimony to the robustness and inherent financial 
attractiveness of the business.
sell-out growth was -12% and organic growth -11%. permanent 
store closures negatively impacted revenue by around 1% and 
adverse foreign exchange developments impacted revenue by 
-3%. total reported revenue ended at dkk 19.0 billion (-11% 
growth in local currency compared with 2019). 
the two new global business units, moments and collabs and 
style and upstream innovation, generated sell-out growth of 
-13% and -12% respectively. the total share of business for 
charms and bracelets was 71%, in line with 2019 and continuing 
to be the core of pandora business. pandora will continue to 
invest in new designs and develop the product offering.
earnings before interest and tax (ebit) excluding restructuring 
costs were dkk 3.9 billion in 2020. restructuring costs amount-
ed to dkk 1.2 billion.

strategic reorganisation to build  
a world-class brand 
in 2020, we reorganised pandora to move us closer 
to consumers. we brought local markets closer 
to our global office by closing our three regional 
organisations, and we set up two global business 
units with product responsibility across the full 
value chain. we established a new retail centre of 
excellence to drive best practice across stores 
and improve merchandising, store development, 
planning and execution. among other benefits, the 
reorganisation has enabled faster decision-mak-
ing and better collaboration in the company. this 
has improved supply chain management and mer-
chandising and led to higher conversion rates.
all jewellery to be made from 
recycled silver and gold  
to reduce carbon emissions and other 
harmful environmental and social impacts 
from mining, we announced that we will 
stop using newly mined silver and gold in 
our jewellery by 2025 and buy only from 
recycled sources. the emissions for  
recycled silver are one third compared  
to mined silver, while recycling of gold  
emits 600 times less carbon than mining 
new gold. in 2020, around 60% of our  
silver and gold was recycled. 
in summer 2020, pandora funded unicef’s 
one love campaign to prevent the pandemic 
from becoming a lasting crisis for children. as 
part of the campaign, the family of bob marley 
re-recorded 'one love' – the iconic song with  
a universal message of love and solidarity.  
pandora matched public donations to the 
campaign up to usd 1 million. in 2019, we 
formed a long-term partnership with unicef 
to help reach more than 10 million children 
and young people worldwide and provide 
them with opportunities to learn, express 
themselves and find work in the future. in total, 
we raised usd 3.4 million for unicef in the 
partnership’s first year. 
silver is the most used material in 
pandora jewellery, accounting for 
over half of all purchased product 
materials measured by weight.

launch of the digital hub  
in july 2020, we inaugurated the digital hub,  
a new office space in copenhagen that houses 
a group of almost 100 software engineers, user 
experience designers and web and data ana-
lysts. the group is tasked with boosting pan-
dora’s digital presence, omnichannel expertise 
and use of data. due to covid-19, our digital 
capabilities were immediately in high demand, 
and we introduced a number of new solu-
tions to create an exciting and safe shopping 
experience. these solutions included a remote 
shopping assistant, a virtual try-on simulation, 
online queueing and appointment booking.

online sales set records
lockdowns and social distancing changed global retail  
dramatically in 2020. we had to temporarily close 
most of our stores during the year, but we were able 
to recoup a large part of the lost sales through our 
online stores. online sales increased 103% in 2020 
compared to 2019 to make up 29% of revenue. in 
q2, online sales surpassed physical retail for the first 
time ever, making up 52% of revenue in the quarter.  
bringing the star wars galaxy  
to life through jewellery  
we launched a 12-piece capsule collection 
of star warstm-inspired jewellery in collabo-
ration with lucasfilm. the highly-anticipated 
line included a bracelet and charms featuring 
beloved star wars characters and symbols.  
the collection proved popular among consum-
ers and accounted for 4% of total revenue in 
its first month. the child charm was the most 
popular piece, selling more than 100,000  
pieces in december alone.

in the absence of covid-19 impact, we would guide for slightly 
positive organic growth in 2021 versus 2019. however, we 
expect 2021 to be impacted by covid-19 and performance 
therefore remains highly uncertain. 
including an assumed -6% covid-19 impact on organic growth 
in 2021, pandora guides as follows for 2021:
stabilising the topline 
in 2021, pandora expects to reach an impor-
tant milestone: returning to top-line growth 
after three years of decline.

above 21%
excluding the assumed covid-19 impact in 2021, the guidance 
represents 2% organic growth compared to 2019 and an ebit 
margin above 23%. 
revenue guidance
the guidance is based on the assumption that approximately 
25% of the stores will be temporarily closed during the first  
half of 2021 and that organic growth will be negatively impacted  
by around -16% in the first half (around -6% full year impact). 
for the second half of 2021, it is assumed that there are no 
significant store closures and that covid-19 related store 
restrictions will have limited impact. 
the guidance is also based on the assumption that the posi-
tive impact seen in late 2020 from reallocation of consumer 
spending away from travelling and services towards gifting and 
discretionary goods was not larger than the negative impact 
from temporary store closures. 
pandora expects china will remain a drag on total revenue 
growth in 2021 and that revenue in china in 2021 will be well 
below 2019. china remains top priority and a significant growth 
opportunity for pandora.

forward integration is expected to add around 1% to revenue  
in 2021. furthermore we expect headwind from foreign ex-
change rates of approximately -1% taking total revenue growth 
in dkk to above 8% in 2021.
profitability guidance
the 2021 ebit margin is expected to be “above 21%” including 
negative covid-19 impact of around 2pp . the building blocks 
in the guidance are illustrated by the bridge. it shows there is 
significant positive operating leverage in the business model. in 
the ebit margin guidance for 2021, however, this is not directly 
visible due to continued covid-19 headwind and higher com-
modity prices.
the quarterly phasing of the ebit-margin obviously depends on 
the covid-19 development. as in prior years and in line with 
normal seasonality, q4 is expected to be by far the most profit-
able quarter of the year. 
2021 guidance – other parameters 
capex for the year is expected to be in the range of dkk 1.0-1.2 
billion. this includes investments in pandora’s physical stores, 
the crafting facilities in thailand as well as digitalisation and 
technology. no major changes to the overall concept store 
network is expected in 2021. the effective tax rate is expected 
to be 22-23%, in line with 2020.
capital structure policy and cash distribution 
entering 2021, pandora’s leverage is 0.5x ebitda and thereby in 
the very low end of the capital structure policy. based on the 
guidance, pandora is – everything else equal and in the absence 
of cash distribution – likely to end 2021 with a leverage close 
to 0. this is a strong position to be in and would under normal 
circumstances allow for significant cash distribution to the 
shareholders in 2021. 
due to the unprecedented situation caused by the pandemic  
and the elevated uncertainty following this, pandora will 
postpone further cash distribution until the pandemic is under 
sufficient control. pandora stresses that the capital structure 
policy is unchanged. while we await a more stable and predicta-
ble situation, pandora will preserve the cash and be ready to 
distribute it in an accelerated manner later on. in order to 
prepare for a potential re-initiation of cash distribution later in 
2021, pandora will ask the shareholders at the annual general 
meeting in march 2021 to authorise the board of directors to 
potentially pass one or more resolutions to distribute extraor-
dinary dividends up to a total amount of dkk 15 per share until 
the next annual general meeting.

building for  
a digital future
from strategy to impactful execution
pandora has moved fast on its digital transformation. since 
the brand relaunch in 2019, we have completed a compre-
hensive overhaul of our online stores and consolidated the 
technologies they run on, making it much easier to implement 
new features and update content. in key markets, pandora 
has also launched several new omnichannel features, such as 
click & collect, and we have introduced personalised market-
ing initiatives that are more relevant for each consumer.
in 2021, pandora will accelerate the digital journey, in particu-
lar by building more capability in data science and engineer-
ing and by further leveraging data and advanced analytics to 
drive growth. our continued focus on creating great digital 
experiences for our customers will move pandora to a digital 
leadership position in the industry.
at pandora, we have established a specialist 
digital unit at our headquarters in copenhagen 
to boost our digital presence, omnichannel  
expertise and smart use of data. 
20 different nationalities 
work at our new digital hub 
in copenhagen.
in 2020, almost 100 software engineers, user experience 
designers, web and data analysts, and other digital profes-
sionals moved into the digital hub, a new office space at our 
copenhagen headquarters. they are tasked with progress-
ing pandora’s digital customer experience and driving sales 
through digital channels. 
the group will also strengthen pandora’s ability to capture, 
analyse and apply customer data to enable better personali-
sation of the customer experience.
“today’s consumer demands more personalised products, 
services and interaction. how we derive the benefits from 
technology and data to create a great customer experience is 
key for us as a global brand. by making significant investments 
in our technological capabilities, we will enhance the direct 
and meaningful connection with our customers,” says david 
walmsley, chief digital & technology officer.

our business
launch and leverage
in 2018, pandora conducted a company-wide health and effi-
ciency assessment. we had high brand awareness, a global retail 
footprint, great creative capabilities, and an unrivalled produc-
tion setup. however, comparable sales (like-for-like) were in 
decline, and the brand was in need of rejuvenation. 
the ensuing turnaround plan, programme now, was designed 
around four transformation objectives to create the needed 
stabilisation of the business: brand relevance, brand access, cost 
reset, and commercial reset.
brand relevance
the brand relevance objective has focused on reigniting brand 
identity and enhancing the brand’s relevance and ability to 
excite consumers. in august 2019, we relaunched the brand 
with a clearer definition of the brand purpose and position. 
we stripped the pandora brand back to its core, focusing on 
self-expression, collectability and affordability, and we signifi-
cantly increased our media and marketing investments.
the brand relaunch showed encouraging results towards the 
end of 2019, and the brand momentum drove positive organic 
growth in january and february 2020. then the global pandemic  
hit, but we continued to see encouraging results from our 
brand initiatives. as stores reopened after the lockdowns in 
spring, we used our strong financial position to create addi-
tional brand awareness by increasing media spend across all 
channels ranging from tv campaigns and digital ads to e-mail 
marketing. more personalised e-mails have performed particu-
larly well, proving the effectiveness of data-driven marketing 
initiatives. 
central to all these efforts has been an ambition to strengthen 
the focus on the brand’s core: affordable jewellery that allows 
for collectability and self-expression. 
brand access
another key objective of programme now was to improve  
consumers’ experience when they access the brand. following 
the brand relaunch, we upgraded our online stores to our new 
programme

we upgraded  
the online  
stores to

navigation
for two years, programme now has set the direction for pandora's  
turnaround, aiming to stabilise the top-line while maintaining our  
industry-leading profitability. the programme is nearing its conclusion, 
and the company is preparing to enter the next phase. 
since q3 2020, we have been applying a new 
”launch and leverage”-approach when launching 
products. instead of short-lived launches, we ex-
tend the lifecycle of new concepts by continuous-
ly building upon them. the objective is to properly 
invest in successful product collections and to 
build long-term, recognisable platforms. 
august & september 
we launched new collections 
with the focus as much on base 
products as newness in cam-
paigns and merchandising.

our business
visual identity and significantly improved website navigation, 
imagery, and check-out flow to enable a smoother and faster 
shopping experience. 
with the establishment of the digital hub in 2020, our digital 
initiatives have gained significant momentum, benefiting impor-
tant aspects of the business such as faster code roll-out to sites, 
personalisation and stronger merchandising. the digital hub has 
also been instrumental in connection with the roll-out of new om-
nichannel capabilities in the markets, such as click & collect and 
“boris” (buy-online-return-in-store). in the us, almost 300 stores 
now offer click & collect, and so do most of pandora’s uk stores.  
to overcome some of the social distancing challenges in q4, we ac-
celerated the roll-out of “endless aisle” (go-in-store-buy-online) 
to cover major european markets and australia. 
during 2019, we ran pilots of a new store design in our physical 
stores. consumers appreciated the pilot, but overall sales perfor-
mance did not match expectations. we have established a new 
team to drive our future store design concept. their focus will be  
to optimise and redesign the in-store consumer journey.
cost reset
the cost reset objective served to fund programme now’s growth 
initiatives and support profitability, particularly by reducing costs 
in production, stores, it and administration. during 2019 and 
2020, we have gradually raised our annual cost savings target from 
dkk 1.2 billion at the outset of the programme to dkk 1.6 billion. 
exiting 2020, the target has been reached. the cost reset initiatives 
have been integrated into daily operations and will continue after 
programme now.
commercial reset
the programme now analysis showed that excessive promotional 
activity up until 2018 had diluted pandora’s brand equity and led 
consumers to wait for the next promotion instead of buying at full 
price. additionally, too many new product introductions coupled 
with an immature merchandising process had led to a cluttered 
assortment presentation in stores and a build-up of inventory.
the commercial reset initiative addressed these issues by sig-
nificantly reducing non-value adding promotions and lowering 
inventory levels at franchise partners. this initiative has delivered 
a healthier promotional dependency, appropriate inventory levels 
at franchisees, and fewer products, leading to less complexity and 
more cost savings. the initiative was completed in 2019.
from turnaround to growth
in late 2018, we launched programme now as a two-year trans-
formation with the main objective of halting the revenue decline. 
now, two years into the programme, programme now has changed 
pandora and delivered very strong results. pandora has now built 
the foundation to embark on a new era of growth. 
despite covid-19 disruptions, the formal restructuring pro-
gramme was completed in 2020. consequently, there will be no 
further programme now restructuring costs in 2021 and onwards.
in 2021, we will continue to improve brand relevance and drive 
retail metrics leveraging the learnings from programme now. we 
have initiated preparations for a new strategy, which we expect to 
launch during 2021.
in 2021, we

investing in our people 
and organisation
building a high-performance organisation
the new operating model led to a significant strengthening of 
the organisation. we hired more than 800 colleagues globally, 
bringing new capability and competency to our transforma-
tion. additionally, we introduced a new global six-layered 
career band and title structure to drive transparency and 
facilitate career development, talent management and re-
cruitment. 
“our global restructuring has been a key component in deliv-
ering our turnaround and preparing us for long-term growth. 
the changes have helped reduce organisational complexity, 
strengthen decision-making, and add critical capabilities and 
talents. it’s been a well-placed investment in growth and build-
ing a leading organisation for top talent and professional devel-
opment,” says erik schmidt, chief human resources officer.
supporting store employees during lockdown
at pandora, we continued to invest in our employees during 
the pandemic. to protect the livelihoods of our store staff, 
we maintained normal scheduled base pay during lockdowns. 
this reflects our commitment to people and also meant 
that pandora was ready to capture demand when markets 
reopened. 
building for the future, pandora made signif-
icant investments in our global organisation 
during 2020 with a new consumer-oriented 
operating model and a commitment to sup-
port our more than 11,600 store employees by 
maintaining salaries when stores were closed 
during pandemic lockdowns. 
in the midst of the first lockdowns, we launched our new 
operating model to bring pandora closer to consumers and 
ensure faster and more consistent execution. the strategic 
reorganisation was a key component of programme now, 
and we established two global business units responsible for 
product performance all the way from early market research 
to final sales.  
 
in addition, we removed the regional layer and grouped our 
more than 100 markets into ten clusters that report to the 
newly hired chief commercial officer, martino pessina. at the 
same time, we built stronger global functions at our copenha-
gen headquarters, including marketing, digital, merchandising, 
human resources and business intelligence, and we optimised 
our crafting facilities in thailand to support fast delivery.

our global headquarters

story
the business landscape is currently undergoing dramatic  
changes, some of which have been accelerated by covid-19.  
four major industry trends are of particular relevance to pandora. 
trend
data-driven personalisation
one of the fundamental shifts in consumer behaviour is the 
demand for personalised products, services and interactions. 
as an example, more than 80% of americans are willing to  
share personal information in exchange for a more personalised 
experience. in recent years, the retail industry has implemented 
more personalisation at consumer touchpoints across physical 
and online channels. investments in machine learning and data 
analytics to increase the relevance of customer interactions are 
paying off.
pandora’s response
by personalising our channels, we offer our customers a better 
experience and allow them to be more efficient in their search. 
in a uk trial, our personalised banners increased click-rates by 
17% and the number of items added to the cart by 4%. fur-
thermore, pandora’s machine learning algorithms help predict 
customer interests. initial results from personalised campaign 
newsletters are very positive, showing a 60% revenue boost 
when compared to standard newsletters. 
trend 
acceleration of e-commerce
covid-19 has accelerated the ongoing shift to digital with 
more consumers choosing to shop from their homes. in 2020, 
global online retail sales increased by 30% in major european 
markets. brands responded with digital innovations to bring the 
in-store experience online, such as virtual fitting rooms aided 
by augmented reality and online shopping events. 
it is believed the changes will continue beyond the covid-19 
crisis, forcing companies to adjust their operating models to 
the new reality: 56% of consumers say they will continue to buy 
online and pick up in store after the pandemic. 
pandora’s response 
at pandora, we have invested 
significantly in our digital 
capabilities in recent years. 
we have established the 
digital hub and upgraded our 
online stores. we have more 
than doubled our online 
order volume capacity. we 
are gradually rolling out new 
omnichannel features, such 
as click & collect, and we 
have also introduced a num-
ber of other digital features 
such as chat bots and digital 
gifting tools.

trend 
repurposing store space
the high street environment continues to change and has also 
had to adapt to new social distancing and safety guidelines in 
2020. customers have become more purposeful when visiting 
stores leading to a decrease in shopping frequency and density, 
less patience for queues, and higher demand for an efficient 
experience. further, store staff remain critical to the store 
experience. in a us consumer survey, 74% of responses tied  
a positive experience to a human interaction.
while there has been a notable shift to online shopping due to 
covid-19, physical retail is expected to continue to play a sig-
nificant role in the way consumers shop in the future, and the 
pandemic could be a catalyst for change. for example, brands 
experiment with creating modular spaces that can be used for 
retail as much as for events. the look and feel of retail units is 
also seen to adapt to current consumer sentiments, convey-
ing positivity through the use of colour and lights while also 
providing consumers with an escape from the everyday through 
immersion into utopian and retro worlds.
pandora’s response 
because of covid-19, we 
introduced a number of  
in-store initiatives during the 
year to minimise congestion. 
to speed up store service and 
queues, we implemented a 
faster check-out process, and 
we used digital services to 
engage with queuing custom-
ers. this allowed customers 
to browse products, try ring 
and bracelet sizes, sign-up for 
pandora club, and start trans-
actions while queueing. 
to handle traffic peaks and 
reduce congestion outside 
our stores, we created tem-
porary pop-up spaces and 
introduced virtual queuing  
apps. we also enabled 
customers to book store 
appointments, and we intro-
duced a remote shopping 
assistant. these can provide 
styling advice over video 
calls and add products to 
the customer’s online basket 
for checkout via pandora.
net. the customer does not 
need to come to the store, 
but will still receive the same 
personal service.
trend 
running the business, sustainably
consumers are increasingly loyal to brands with strong social 
and environmental profiles. in many sectors, sales of more sus-
tainable products are growing faster than sales of less sustaina-
ble alternatives. in the jewellery industry, consumers care about 
companies’ environmental impact, supply chain traceability, 
working conditions and more. during 2020, the global pandemic 
generated even greater interest in social responsibility initia-
tives, notably related to safeguarding the health and safety of 
customers, employees and local communities.
pandora’s response 
on many sustainability  
issues, pandora has taken 
an industry lead by crafting 
jewellery responsibly and 
providing safe, healthy and 
rewarding working conditions. 
by 2025, we will be carbon 
neutral and use only recycled 
silver and gold in our prod-
ucts. in 2020, we received 
the highest ranking in msci's 
annual sustainability rating 
for the fifth consecutive year. 
we also improved our ranking 
from ‘moderate’ to ‘strong’ 
in human rights watch’s 
annual rating of the jewellery 
industry. 
in 2020, we also continued 
our partnership with unicef 
to support children, espe-
cially girls, around the world 
through education.

peak-season trading 
marked by covid-19
we also worked to stretch peak trading periods to avoid large 
crowds. in the us, black friday deals were accessible every 
friday throughout the month of november. 
“we have shown our innovation, resilience and agility during 
this crisis. we were able to engage with our customers and 
make their shopping experience enjoyable despite the tough 
environment,” says martino pessina, chief commercial officer. 
the new initiatives proved successful and trading in november 
and december was strong. despite covid-19 and lockdowns, 
organic growth was positive in the fourth quarter. 
with a global pandemic and lockdowns in sever-
al countries, pandora entered the busiest time 
of the year with a range of new initiatives. 
november and december are key trading months for many 
brands – not least a brand like pandora, where gifting makes 
up a large proportion of sales. in a normal year, pandora  
generates almost 30% of annual revenue in those two months. 
the holiday season of 2020 was different. covid-19 put new 
demands on retailers to handle hygiene and social distancing 
among the shopping crowds. 
to navigate these challenges in the best possible way, we in-
troduced 11 initiatives in key markets to ensure a good shop-
ping experience while keeping employees and customers safe. 
among these initiatives were a remote shopping assistant, 
enabling customers to talk to a sales assistant online. we also 
introduced virtual try-on – an augmented reality technology 
that enables online shoppers to view jewellery on their own 
hands and wrists. and we launched virtual queueing, where 
customers scan a qr code and are notified when it is their 
turn to enter a store, allowing them to do something else while 
waiting in line.

shopping assistant feature to  
guide a customer.

sustainability
we strive to embed sustainability considerations across our business, from 
how we craft our high-quality jewellery to the workplace we offer our employ-
ees. reducing what we take from the planet, protecting our environment and 
respecting those touched by our business are key components of pandora’s 
business success and simply the right thing to do. 
we continue to align our strategy with the united nations (un) 
sustainable development goals, the un guiding principles on 
business and human rights, and the paris agreement. using 
these pillars of the global sustainability agenda to guide us, we 
regularly review sustainability issues and complete a materiality 
assessment to ensure that we build a sustainable business and 
meet stakeholder expectations.
our strategic priorities
pandora’s sustainability strategy is multifaceted. we adopt 
strategies that will minimise our carbon footprint. we innovate 
to minimise the resources that we use in our products and 
recycle them to “close the loop”. and we strive to ensure that 
our employees and suppliers work in safe and fair conditions.  
we are committed to reducing our 
climate footprint and helping the 
jewellery industry make progress.

performance and thus have a significant effect on people and the

low-carbon business
we are committed to reducing our climate footprint and help-
ing the jewellery industry to make progress as a whole. we will 
become carbon neutral in our operations by 2025 (scope 1 
and scope 2) and will set a science-based target for reducing 
carbon emissions across the full value chain (scope 3). 
we made great progress on this ambition in 2020, as we  
significantly reduced pandora’s carbon footprint by sourcing 
100% renewable energy at our crafting facilities in thailand.  
the crafting facilities account for approximately half of our  
energy consumption globally, and the switch to renewable  
energy lowered our emissions by more than 25,000 tonnes 
co2e and put us on track to meet our carbon neutral target.  
the remaining emissions predominantly come from our more 
than 1,300 pandora owned stores and more than 230 other  
points of sale. in 2021, we will evaluate renewable energy 
sources for our stores and continue to identify opportunities 
to increase energy efficiency in both our stores and crafting 
facilities. for all remaining unavoidable emissions linked to our 
direct business activities, we will purchase carbon offsets to 
meet our target of becoming carbon neutral.
in 2020, we mapped our full value chain’s emissions (scope 3). 
we are currently finalising our science-based target commit-
ment to reduce these emissions in line with the paris agree-
ment. we have engaged industry experts and suppliers to build 
a detailed understanding of the footprint of key materials and 
identify opportunities to reduce the associated emissions. 
at pandora, we are committed to transparent reporting to aid 
investors and other stakeholders in their decision-making. in 
2020, we responded to the cdp for the first time and joined 
the list of over 1,500 organisations to support the task force on 
climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) recommendations. 
we will  
become  
carbon  
neutral  
in our  
operations  
by 2025
circular innovation
we strive to ensure that raw materials, used in both the craft-
ing and manufacturing of jewellery and in the development of 
point-of-sales materials and in-store fixtures, leave as little 
negative impact as possible on the environment, people and 
communities. this commitment is in line with our vision to 
adopt a circular approach to how we design, craft, source and 
offer our products. 
in 2020, we took steps to increase the use of recycled silver 
and gold in our products and committed to using only re-
cycled silver and gold by 2025. this will reduce our carbon 
emissions, water usage and other environmental and social 
gender equality 
we are an inclusive brand committed to 
advancing equality and diversity, for example 
through our partnership with unicef to fund 
programmes that support girls’ education and 
empowerment. 
decent work and economic growth 
across offices, stores and crafting, we strive to 
provide safe and healthy working conditions for 
more than 26,000 employees. 
responsible consumption  
and production 
circularity is central to how we design, craft, 
source and offer our products. for example, 
we use recycled metals in our products and 
the majority of our crafting waste is reused. 
climate action 
we are intensifying our climate efforts by 
committing to become a carbon neutral 
company and set an emission reduction target 
in line with the paris agreement and best 
available science recommendations.
pandora and the sustainable  
development goals
we have assessed pandora’s opportunities to support the 
sustainable development goals (sdgs) and concluded that 
our business aligns most closely with four of these goals. in 
particular, we support sdg 12, responsible consumption and 
production, by committing to use only recycled gold and silver 
in our products by 2025.

learn, express themselves and find work in the future. through-
out the first year of the partnership, pandora designed and 
marketed a series of jewellery pieces in support of unicef.  
we also engaged employees across our global organisation in 
our work for unicef. as a result, pandora raised usd 3.4 million 
to unicef, including a usd 1 million donation to unicef’s  
reimagine campaign, which seeks to respond, recover and  
reimagine a world currently besieged by the covid-19 pandemic. 
impacts, as metals recycling requires fewer resources than 
mining new metals. in 2020, around 60% of our silver and gold 
was recycled1. this figure is revised down from the previously 
reported figure of around 70% for 2019, as increased trans-
parency and more engagement with our suppliers have led to 
a better understanding of our recycled supply chain. 
to make a full shift to recycled silver and gold, pandora is tak-
ing an active role in engaging and developing the industry as 
well as our supplier base. we see this as necessary stakeholder 
engagement to help increase the availability of recycled silver 
and improve production standards and transparency in the 
value chain.
more than 99% of the stones we use in our jewellery are man-
made. stones created in a laboratory have a significantly lower 
environmental impact than mined stones. they lead to less 
environmental degradation and require less energy to produce.
we also continuously work to reduce water usage and waste 
at our crafting facilities. the crafting of our jewellery gener-
ates four main types of process waste: gypsum, glass, wax 
and rubber. in 2020, we managed to recycle or reuse 100% of 
these waste streams. overall, 90% of all waste at our craft-
ing facilities was recycled. we continue to look for ways to 
reduce waste. in addition, our crafting facilities consume over 
970,000m³ of water and increasing water recycling is a key 
priority. in 2020, we recycled 16% of the water used at our 
crafting facilities. 
inclusive & fair culture
at pandora, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity 
and inclusion, and we strive to ensure that our employees and 
suppliers work in safe and fair conditions.
in 2020, pandora initiated a global listening and learning project 
to better understand where we stand in this context, and how 
we can work to ensure progress.
gender diversity 
our diversity policy lays out gender diversity targets for the 
board of directors and for senior management, requiring no 
less than 40% representation for each gender. pandora’s cur-
rent gender split looks as follows: 
 • on our board of directors, 75% of the members are women 
and 25% are men (six out of eight members are women). this is 
an increase of female representation since last year and above 
average for large publicly-listed danish companies. 
 • our executive leadership team has 12.5% women and 87.5% 
men (one woman out of eight members). 
with a clear majority of women on the board of directors and 
men on the executive leadership team, our 40% targets were 
thus not met in 2020. our primary focus during the turnaround 
of our business has been to ensure the necessary management 
capacity, irrespective of gender, to rapidly improve our growth 
trajectory. ensuring diversity, in all shapes and forms, on our 
leadership teams will remain an area of particular focus going 
forward.
a workplace respecting human rights
pandora’s human rights policy states our commitment to the 
un guiding principles on business and human rights and the 
core conventions of the international labour organization. it 
describes how our employees are expected to respect human 
rights, including but not limited to freedom from discrimina-
tion, the right to collective bargaining, and the right to a safe

only recycled  
silver and gold
“silver and gold can be recycled forever without losing their 
quality. metals mined centuries ago are just as good as new. we 
want to do our part to build a more circular economy and pre-
vent these fine metals from ending up in landfills,” says chief 
supply officer jeerasage puranasamriddhi.
silver recycling on a global scale
pandora is one of the largest silver buyers in the jewellery 
industry, and silver is the most used metal in our jewellery. 
around 15% of the world’s silver is recycled, and much can be 
done to improve this situation. recycling of consumer electron-
ics is particularly low – in europe only around 40% of electronic 
waste is recycled and in asia only around 10%.
by using only recycled silver and gold instead of mined metals, 
pandora can save 37,000 tonnes co2. this equates to more than 
the annual electricity use of 6,000 homes or driving 145 million 
km in a car.
have you ever wondered what happens to your 
old mobile phone after you get rid of it? parts of 
it may end up in pandora jewellery.
silver and gold used to be primarily for coins, jewellery and 
other household items. today, these precious metals are also 
used in electronics and for industrial purposes, because they 
perform well compared to other metals. 
as the first large jewellery brand, pandora will stop using newly 
mined silver and gold and buy only from recycled sources by 
2025. 
quality forever
mining requires a lot of energy, so by using recycled metals we 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. the emissions for recycled 
silver are one third compared to mined silver, while recycling 
of gold emits approximately 600 times less carbon than mining 
new gold. 
according to the world economic forum, 
there is 100 times more gold in a tonne of 
mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore.

our approach to risk management 
pandora’s enterprise risk management is focused on identifying 
risks early, assessing them candidly, and taking actions to miti-
gate them so they will not prevent the company from achieving 
its business objectives. we see a well-functioning risk man-
agement process as key to maintaining and building pandora’s 
position as the world’s largest jewellery brand. 
at pandora, risk management is an enterprise-wide effort, with 
management teams across our value chain responsible for the 
continuous identification, assessment, mitigation, and report-
ing of current and emerging risks. pandora also has a dedicated 
risk management policy.
pandora’s chief financial officer heads the company’s risk 
management board, which consists of senior management 
representatives from across our value chain. management 
teams are required to report their most significant risks to the 
global risk office, along with assessments of those risks and 
managing 
risks
pandora carefully monitors and assesses potential risks to the compa-
ny on an ongoing basis. as a global brand with a fully integrated value 
chain, some of the key risks facing pandora are brand relevance and 
supply disruption.
an overview of implemented mitigations and next milestones. 
all risk assessments take into account the likelihood of an 
event and its potential impact on the business. the impact is 
quantified and assessed in terms of potential financial loss or 
reputational damage. 
the risk management board is assisted in its work by the global 
risk office, which serves as secretariat to the board. the global 
risk office’s role is to review risks, support management on risk 
information, and consolidate the corporate risk profile contain-
ing the company's key risks. the final risk profile is reviewed by 
executive management, the audit committee, and the board of 
directors.
the board of directors is ultimately responsible for assess-
ing the nature and extent of risks associated with pandora’s 
strategic direction and for the implementation of effective risk 
identification, assessment, and mitigation. 
pandora’s risk  
management policy 
pandora proactively manages risk to protect our  
people, assets and reputation and to minimise the 
risk of disruption to our continued value creation. 
this means that we:
• utilise an effective and integrated risk management 
system while maintaining business flexibility
• identify and assess material risks associated with 
our business 
• monitor, manage and mitigate risks – and leverage 
related opportunities, where possible
all risk  
assessments

our key risks 
the board of directors considers the key risks that could 
threaten our business model or the future performance, 
solvency, or liquidity of pandora. these key risks make up 
pandora’s consolidated risk profile and do not represent all 
the risks associated with our business. additional risks not 
presently identified or those currently deemed to be less 
material may also have an adverse effect on our business. 
pandora’s consolidated risk profile and our responses to 
them are described in the following.
brand and product relevance
description  
as a large, global brand the strength and integrity of our 
brand is a fundamental asset. it is important that our 
product offerings remain relevant to our customers. 
risk 
a lack of brand or product relevance constitutes a signif-
icant business risk that could result in lower traffic to our 
stores and online shopping sites and reduce our revenue. 
mitigation
 • consumer-centric innovation of new products, fuelled by 
more powerful customer insights.
 • establishment of two global business units.
 • establishment of the digital hub.
 • significant additional investments in marketing.
 • investments in data and analytical capabilities and  
technology.
 • continued monitoring of trademarks and patents and 
fighting infringements.

brand access
description 
we sell our products globally and depend on a strong 
channel network and solid insights to engage with con-
sumers in their preferred marketplace. a personalised and 
unique shopping experience is important for developing 
customer loyalty.
risk 
not being able to engage consumers and provide them 
with a relevant omnichannel shopping experience can 
result in a decline in revenue.
mitigation 
 • investment in improving digital and omnichannel  
customer experiences.
 • stronger focus on personalisation of shopping  
experiences across channels.
 • launch of new initiatives and services connecting digital 
and physical store experiences, such as click & collect 
and endless aisle.
 • mapping of current and potential future store locations 
to assess current store viability and potential areas  
for growth.
 • development and testing of new store concept.

pandemics, including covid-19 
description 
continued covid-19 outbreaks, or new pandemics, may 
have an effect on the economy in general, consumer be-
haviour and demand. it may also require significant invest-
ments in and changes to pandora’s operating model etc.
risk  
pandemics can result in lower revenue and higher costs 
through store and crafting facility closures, labour short-
ages, decreases in productivity, supply chain disruptions, 
and changes in the macroeconomic environment and 
consumer behaviour.
mitigation
 • expansion of online capacity.
 • introduction of new initiatives, such as curb side pickup, 
pop-up stores, and click & collect, aimed at making 
shopping safer for our customers.
 • review of supply chain, including dependency on 
individual suppliers and own production facilities and 
distribution centres.
read more about new initiatives to tackle 
covid-19 on page 22  
supply disruptions
description
procurement of raw materials and the ability to produce 
and distribute finished products are critical for meeting 
customer demand.
risk 
lockdowns, breakdowns, political unrest, fire, natural 
catastrophes etc. at pandora’s or key suppliers’ sites may 
result in disruption of our supply chain and have a signifi-
cant impact on our financial performance. 
mitigation
 • dual sourcing where feasible.
 • buffers of production components and finished goods.
 • crafting at two separate locations in thailand.
 • engagement of external manufacturers to provide 
flexibility.
 • online distribution capacity has been ramped up.
talent attraction and succession
description
pandora needs highly talented and capable people across 
all functions and markets to drive growth and sustainable 
performance for our future.
risk 
our employees are our most valuable asset. failure to at-
tract, develop and retain the right talent poses a significant 
risk to our growth plans. succession planning for leadership 
and critical roles is one of our biggest risks for sustainable 
performance and growth.
mitigation
 • strengthening the global hr organisation.
 • annual employee engagement survey.
 • enhanced focus on employer branding.
 • enhanced focus on key positions and succession  
planning.
 • strengthening how we attract digital, operational, and 
functional talents to support our business priorities.

facing up to  
environmental  
risks
across all of these 
trends runs a growing 
and widely acknowl-
edged concern for the 
global environment, 
particularly in relation 
to climate change. we 
understand the need 
to prepare for the risks 
and opportunities that 
will arise from changing 
weather patterns, rising 
sea levels, and other 
climate impacts. we 
have taken initial steps 
and will expand on these 
in the future. 
as recommended by 
the task force on cli-
mate-related financial 
disclosures, we are inte-
grating climate-change 
scenarios to identify 
short-, medium- and 
long-term risks in our 
production and supply 
chain to ensure a steady 
supply of our products.
market fluctuations  
description
our products are made of precious metals, mainly silver 
and gold. as a global business, pandora has significant 
revenue in usd, usd-related currencies and gbp. our 
crafting facilities are based in thailand and hence we 
have significant net cost in thb.
risk 
pandora is exposed to a weakening of the usd, usd-re-
lated currencies and gbp and a strengthening of the thb 
and precious metal prices. currency fluctuations and 
increases in the price of precious metals can have a sig-
nificant impact on the company’s financial performance 
and cash flow.
mitigation
 • hedging at least 50% of the combined commodity, 
exchange rate and interest rate risk. however, at least 
70% of estimated annual commodity purchases must 
be hedged. 
responsible business behaviour
description
pandora has a reputation for responsible business behav-
iour. this reputation benefits the company in several ways, 
from attracting new employees to acknowledging consumer 
concerns.
risk 
if pandora violates legislation, disregards principles of good 
corporate citizenship, or fails to adhere to social or envi-
ronmental standards, it could damage our brand, reputa-
tion and financial situation.
mitigation
 • launch of a new global code of conduct.
 • mandatory ethics and compliance training. 
 • upgrading external access to our whistleblower hotline.
 • responsible supplier programme, including training and 
vendor audits.
 • recurring responsible jewellery council certification.
 • environmental, social, and governance reporting to ensure 
transparency.
 • climate targets and other focused sustainability initiatives.
 • all taxes and charges are paid according to local laws and 
regulations in the countries where pandora operates.
it security breaches
description
reliable it systems and infrastructure are critical for the  
company’s ability to operate effectively. we also have a duty 
to safeguard the data of our customers and partners as well 
as our own information.
risk 
breaches of it security, caused by malware attacks for  
example, could have a severe impact on pandora’s ability  
to maintain operations and, hence, its financial stability.  
the disclosure of confidential information could compro-
mise the privacy of customers or other individuals.
mitigation 
 • ongoing security monitoring supported by  
incident-response teams.
 • third-party vulnerability and security maturity  
assessments.
 • cyber and information security awareness training  
and phishing tests to monitor response.

management structure
the corporate authority is divided between the board of 
directors (“the board”) and executive management, existing 
independently of each other. the board outlines the overall  
visions, strategies and objectives of pandora’s business activi-
ties and supervises the performance of executive management. 
the board’s primary tasks are to ensure that pandora has a 
strong management team, optimal organisational and capital 
structures, efficient business processes, transparent book-
keeping and practices, and responsible asset management. 
additionally, the board oversees pandora’s financial develop-
ment, related planning and reporting systems as well as internal 
controls and risk management.
the board has established audit, remuneration and  
nomination committees and appoints members and chairs 
to these committees from within the board. the committees’ 
terms of reference are disclosed on pandora’s website —  
www.pandoragroup.com.  
members of executive management are appointed by the 
board. executive management is responsible for the day-to-day

board self-assessment
the board conducts an annual self-assessment to monitor its 
performance and its cooperation with executive management. 
in 2020, the assessment was conducted in collaboration with an 
independent third party. 
the assessment comprised of a collective survey and interviews 
with each board member individually. the topics included board 
composition, nomination process, competencies, overboarding 
and board culture. the assessment also included topics such as 
the board’s involvement in risk and financial management, con-
trol and strategy, committee work and personal contributions.
the report and conclusions of the assessment were shared with 
the board and executive management, followed by a thorough 
discussion. the assessment identified that the board continues 
to consist of individuals who possess relevant competencies 
and are engaged and well-prepared. the board structure and 
committee work are effective and well-functioning, including 
interactions with executive management.
board activities in 2020
the board held 14 board meetings in 2020. its primary focus was 
to handle and steer through the global covid-19 crisis together 
with executive management, including securing the safety and 
well-being of pandora’s employees and customers and protect-
ing the business during the crisis. furthermore, the board spent 
considerable efforts to ensure sufficient financial and liquidity 
resources to withstand the ramifications of shifting restric-
tions affecting consumer behaviour and the retail environment. 
finally, the board oversaw the progress of programme now as 
well as the execution of the strategic reorganisation announced 
in march 2020.
 • meet with executive management to review interim financial 
reports;
 • review key accounting principles, significant accounting esti-
mates, key financial risks and compliance with tax regulations;
 • monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of pandora’s internal 
controls and risk management systems;

internal controls and risk management systems  
in relation to the financial reporting process
responsibility for pandora’s internal controls and risk man-
agement systems in relation to the financial reporting process 
rests with the board and executive management.
the purpose of these internal controls and risk management 
systems is to ensure that the financial statements provide a 
true and fair view, free from material misstatements, and that 
the internal and external financial statements are presented  
in accordance with international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as adopted by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act. while the internal controls 
and risk management systems are designed and aim to ensure 
that material misrepresentation of assets, losses and/or 
significant errors or irregularities and omissions in the financial 
reporting are avoided, they provide no absolute assurance that 
all errors are detected and corrected.
internal controls and risk management systems are under  
continuous development and are described below.
control environment
the board has established an audit committee that assists the 
board in supervising the financial reporting process and the 
efficiency of pandora’s internal controls and risk management 
systems. the audit committee reviews significant risks related 
to pandora’s business, activities and operations as well as risks 
related to financial reporting. the audit committee seeks to 
ensure that such risks are managed proactively, efficiently and 
systematically.
executive management is responsible for maintaining controls 
and an effective risk management system and ensuring neces-
sary steps are taken to address the risks identified in relation  
to financial reporting.

corporate governance
in addition, an internal audit and compliance controlling 
(iacc) function helps pandora accomplish its objectives by 
bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluat-
ing and improving the effectiveness of internal controls, risk 
management, compliance and governance processes. the iacc 
function assists pandora’s executive management and the  
audit committee in identifying, avoiding and mitigating risks. 
the composition of the board, the audit committee and  
executive management together with the iacc function ensure 
the availability of relevant competencies with respect to internal  
controls and risk management systems in relation to the  
financial reporting process.
risk assessment
the board and executive management assess risks on an  
ongoing basis, including risks related to financial reporting,  
and assess measures to manage, reduce or eliminate identified 
risks. the audit committee reviews selected high-risk areas on 
a frequent basis, including significant accounting estimates and 
material changes to accounting policies.
at least once a year, the audit committee oversees a review of 
current internal controls to determine whether they are effective 
in relation to the risks identified in the financial reporting process.
control activities
the group finance function reports to the chief financial 
officer (cfo). the controlling function within group finance 
is responsible for controlling the financial reporting from the 
pandora a/s and its subsidiaries, and monitoring compliance 
with relevant legislation on an ongoing basis.
the company has adopted and defined an internal control 
framework that identifies key processes, inherent risks and 
control procedures in order to secure appropriate account-
ing processes. the control procedures include a variety of 
processes in order to prevent any misrepresentation, signif-
icant errors, omissions or fraudulent behaviour. the control 
procedures are tested on an ongoing basis and reported to  
the audit committee.
information and communication
the iacc function is present at all audit committee meetings 
and provides regular status updates to the committee. further-
more, the head of iacc has regular meetings with the cfo. this 
set-up ensures transparency and that communication is shared 
with the audit committee on a timely basis. the board has 
adopted an investor relations policy that requires all commu-
nication to stakeholders, including financial reporting, to be 
conducted adequately, timely and openly – both internally and 
externally – and to be conducted factually and truthfully and in 
compliance with laws and applicable regulations.
monitoring
pandora’s internal controls and risk management systems, 
including the whistleblower function, are continuously moni-
tored, tested and documented. the audit committee monitors 
internal controls and the risk management process to ensure 
that any weaknesses are eliminated and that any errors in the 
financial statements identified and reported by the auditors 
are corrected, including controls or procedures implemented 
to prevent such errors.
pandora’s independent auditors are appointed for a term of 
one year at the annual general meeting following the recom-
mendation of the board. prior to recommendation, the board 
assesses, in consultation with executive management, the inde-
pendence, competencies and other matters pertaining to the 
auditors. the framework for the auditors’ duties, including their 
remuneration, audit and non-audit services, is agreed annually 
between the board and the auditors following the recommen-
dation of the audit committee.

capital structure and cash allocation
pandora’s capital structure serves to ensure that the company 
has sufficient financial flexibility to pursue its strategic goals 
and preserve a stable financial structure based on a strong 
balance sheet.
pandora’s capital structure policy is to maintain nibd to ebitda 
before restructuring costs between 0.5 and 1.5.
cash distribution suspended until there is further  
certainty on covid-19
pandora continues to be highly cash generative and has ample 
liquidity to initiate cash distribution to shareholders. due to 
the unprecedented uncertainty caused by covid-19, pandora 
considers it appropriate and prudent to await further certainty 
about the pandemic before re-initiating cash distribution to 
the shareholders. at the annual general meeting in march 2021, 
pandora will ask the shareholders to authorise the board of  
directors to potentially pass one or more resolutions to distribute  
extraordinary dividends of up to a total amount of dkk 15 per 
share until the next annual general meeting.
in addition to being listed in copenhagen, pandora has a spon-
sored level 1 american depository receipt (adr) programme.  
the adrs are traded in the us over-the-counter under the symbol 
pandy. further information regarding the adr programme can be 
found on the pandora group website.
in 2020, the lowest closing price for the pandora share was dkk 
195.2 on 16 march. the highest closing price was dkk 681 on 30 
december 2020 (last trading day of 2020), corresponding to an 
increase of 135% compared to the end of 2019 (dkk 289.8). by 
the end of the year, the total shareholder return was 145%.
around 173 million pandora shares were traded in 2020. the 
trading volume averaged around 699,000 shares per day.

review of 2020 share buyback and dividends
in 2020, pandora paid out an ordinary dividend of dkk 9 per 
share. the total amount paid was around dkk 0.8 billion. 
the board of directors proposed a share buyback programme in 
2020, under which pandora would buy back own shares to a maxi-
mum consideration of up to dkk 2.1 billion. as covid-19 escalated 
throughout q1 2020, leading to the closure of many of pandora’s 
physical stores, the programme was suspended to strengthen the 
balance sheet during these uncertain and unprecedented times.
shareholders
as of 31 december 2020, pandora had three major sharehold-
ers. blackrock has disclosed holdings of voting rights amounting 
to 7.4% of the total outstanding voting rights while parvus has 
disclosed holdings amounting to 5.1%. additionally, société 
générale has disclosed holdings of voting rights through shares 
and financial instruments amounting to 5.3%. 
as of 31 december 2020, the geographical split of institutional
investors was:
 • investors in denmark held 9% of the share capital.
 • the largest share of international investors resided in the  
united kingdoms (23% of share capital) and in the united 
states (22% of share capital).
as of 31 december 2020, pandora’s board of directors and execu-
tive management held a total of 86,074 and 264,099 pandora shares 
respectively, corresponding to 0.4% of the total share capital.
investor relations
the executive management is responsible for the existence of an 
investor relations (ir) function, which is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with pandora’s investor relations policy. ir reports 
directly to the chief financial officer.
the purpose of pandora’s ir activities is to ensure that relevant, 
accurate and timely information is made available to the capital 
markets to serve as a basis for regular trading and a fair pricing of 
the share. prior to the announcement of interim and annual re-
ports, a four-week silent period is in place. in addition, members 
of the board of directors and executive management are only al-
lowed to trade shares in a four-week trading window following the 
announcement of interim and annual reports. pandora will ensure 
that the company is perceived as visible, accessible, reliable and 
professional by the capital markets and that pandora is regarded 
among the best relative to peers. this will be achieved by comply-
ing with the rules and legislation for listed companies on nasdaq 
omx as well as pandora’s internal policies.
company website
the pandora group website (pandoragroup.com  
 ) provides 
comprehensive information about the company, its activities, 
share performance and shareholders. additionally, all company 
announcements, including interim and annual reports, as well as 
investor presentations, webcasts and conference call transcripts 
are made available on the website in due time. furthermore, the 
website contains a constantly updated financial and event calen-
dar showing events and actions related to investors.
a comprehensive list of the 21 analysts covering the pandora share 
is maintained, including names, institutions and contact details.

2020 marked a milestone in pandora’s turna-
round with several strong signs that the ini-
tiatives under programme now are working. 
pandora has experienced increased brand 
momentum, increased desire for the brand  
and has seen several digital and commercial 
initiatives paying off.  
despite being a tough and uncertain year, pandora came 
through 2020 in good shape. pandora started the year with 
positive organic growth in january and february before a global 
pandemic swept the world forcing pandora to temporarily 
close stores. focus then shifted away from commercial plans 
and into protecting customers and employees. as pandora was 
forced to temporarily close stores, demand shifted towards 
online sales where pandora was able to successfully recoup 
significant revenue thanks to the large investments in digital in-
itiatives made in recent years. pandora saw the initiatives drive 
an increased level of traffic online, which together with a much 
stronger conversion rate saw online sales grow more than 100% 
compared with 2019. on the other hand, pandora experienced 
a double digit revenue decline in the physical network. traffic 
into physical stores was down all year by high double digits, 
following the temporarily closed stores and social restrictions 
guidelines in most countries putting pressure on retail opera-
tions. 2020 ended at -11% organic growth, as the online sales 
were not able to fully mitigate the lost revenue in the physical 
network, yet pandora saw a sequential improvement during the 
year ending q4 with 4% positive organic growth. 
revenue by key market
pandora delivered a strong underlying performance in many of 
its key markets. especially in the uk the large and mature online 
store secured a strong performance throughout the year despite 
lockdowns. performance in the us was particularly strong in the 
second half of the year, when the commercial comeback and 
large share of voice delivered significant results. italy started 
the year well, but performance was impacted by store closures 
and lockdowns as italian consumers have a clear preference for 
accessing the brand in physical stores. china continues to be 
structurally challenged. 
revenue by product
the two new global business units, moments and collabs and 
style and upstream innovation, generated sell-out growth of 
-13% and -12% respectively. the total share of business for 
charms and bracelets was 70%, in line with 2019 and continues 
to be the core of pandora business. 
store network development
in 2020, pandora closed net 80 of the concept stores due to a 
general pruning of the store network. the closed stores were 
performing unsatisfactorily, even before the lockdowns. some 
store openings were delayed or put on hold due to covid-19, 
particularly in latin america and china.

profitability
gross margin was slightly down compared with 2019 (-0.9%) 
mainly following negative impacts from higher silver prices, for-
eign exchange rates and a higher share of online revenue, which 
was partially offset by continued cost reductions.
opex excluding restructuring costs decreased by 4% compared 
with 2019 driven by cost measures during the lockdown peri-
ods following an overall decision to protect cash and foreign 
exchange development favourably impacting opex by dkk 0.2 
billion. in 2020, pandora received dkk 225 million in govern-
ment covid-19 relief. we have deliberately continued to invest 
heavily in marketing to ensure continued strong brand momen-
tum and share of voice, leveraging pandora’s favourable cash 
position. the ebit margin excluding restructuring costs ended 
at 20.4%, a very profitable and healthy level despite significant 
disruption from covid-19.

the operating working capital ended historically low at -2% of

not consider the current level of working capital sustainable. 
in 2021, pandora plans for a higher inventory level and expects 
lower trade payables resulting from the cessation of programme  
now restructuring costs.

despite a decline in all product categories due to the outbreak 
of covid-19, the performance within each product category 
is satisfactory. we will continue to invest in new designs and 
develop the product offering.

a more detailed description of accounting policies and  
significant estimates related to specific reported amounts 
is presented in the respective notes. the purpose is to  
provide transparency on the  disclosed amounts and to

financial statements
pandora a/s is a public limited company with its registered 
office in denmark.
the annual report for the period 1 january – 31 december 
2020 comprises the consolidated financial statements of  
pandora a/s and its subsidiaries (the group).
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the danish financial 
statements act.
the annual report has been prepared on a historical cost basis, 
except for derivative financial instruments, which have been 
measured at fair value. 
the annual report is presented in danish kroner and all 
amounts are in million (dkk million), unless otherwise stated. 
due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this report 
may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may 
not precisely reflect the absolute figures.
after the reorganisation announced on 4 march 2020, the  
reportable segments have been reorganised as of q2 2020  
in two global business units: moments and collabs and style 
and upstream innovation. for information on segments, see 
note 2.1.  
as part of pandora’s reorganisation, the cost of certain func-
tions in the markets previously recognised under administra-
note 1.1 
principal accounting policies
tive expenses is reclassified to sales & distribution expenses. 
this change has been applied prospectively from 1 january 
2020 and the comparative figures have not been restated. the 
impact of the change in 2019 would have been an increase in 
sales & distribution expenses of approximately dkk 350 million 
and a corresponding decrease in administrative expenses.
due to covid-19, pandora was entitled to government grants 
in 2020. these are recognised where there is reasonable assur-
ance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions 
will be complied with. when the grant relates to an expense 
item, it is recognised as a deduction in reporting the related 
costs, for which it is intended to compensate, and over the 
time these costs are expensed.
apart from changes listed above and changes due to the imple-
mentation of new or amended standards and interpretations 
as described in note 1.2  
 , accounting policies are unchanged 
from last year. 
    accounting policies  
the overall accounting policies applied to the annual report 
as a whole are described below. the accounting policies 
related to specific line items are described in the notes to 
which they relate. 
the description of accounting policies in the notes forms part 
of the overall description of pandora’s accounting policies.

alternative performance measures
pandora presents financial measures in the annual report that 
are not defined according to ifrs. pandora believes these non-
gaap measures provide valuable information to investors and 
pandora’s management when evaluating performance. since 
other companies may calculate these differently from pandora, 
they may not be comparable to the measures used by other 
companies. these financial measures should therefore not be 
considered to be a replacement for measures defined under 
ifrs. for definitions of the performance measures used by 
pandora, see note 5.6.  
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. subsid-
iaries are fully consoli dated from the date of acquisition, being 
the date on which pandora obtains  control, until the date that 
such control ceases. all intercompany balances, income and 
expenses, unrealised gains and losses and dividends resulting 
from intercompany transactions are eliminated in full.
functional and presentation  currency
the consolidated financial statements are presented in danish 
kroner, dkk, which is also the functional currency of the parent 
company. each subsidiary determines its own functional cur-
rency, and items recognised in the financial statements of each 
entity are measured using that functional currency.
transactions and balances
transactions in foreign currencies are initially  recognised in the 
group entities at their respective functional currency rates 
notes
52
52
financial statements
prevailing at the date of the transaction. monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date. all adjustments are recognised in the income statement.
non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the initial transactions. non-monetary items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
group companies with another functional currency than dkk
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated 
into dkk at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting 
date, and their income statements are translated at the ex-
change rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
exchange rate adjustments arising on translation are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. on disposal of a foreign subsidiary, 
the component of other comprehensive income relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
consolidated income  statement
the consolidated income statement is presented based on costs 
classified by function. cost of sales comprises direct and indirect 
expenses incurred to generate revenue for the year, compris-
ing raw materials, consumables, production staff, depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment losses in respect of production 
equipment.

implementation of new or amended standards and 
interpretations
pandora has adopted all new or amended standards (ifrs) and 
interpretations (ifric) as adopted by the eu and which are ef-
fective for the financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020. the 
implementation of these new or amended standards and inter-
pretations had no material impact on the financial statements 
for the year apart from the amendment in ifrs 16. 
amendment to ifrs 16 leases
on 28 may 2020, the iasb issued covid-19-related rent  
concessions – amendment to ifrs 16 leases. the iasb amend-
ed the standard to provide relief to lessees from applying ifrs 
16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent conces-
sions arising as a direct consequence of the covid-19 pandemic.  
as a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess 
whether a covid-19 pandemic-related rent concession from a 
lessor is a lease modification. a lessee that makes this election 
accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the 
covid-19 pandemic-related rent concession the same way it 
would account for the change under ifrs 16 if the change was 
not a lease modification. the practical expedient applies only 
to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the 
covid-19 pandemic and only if all of the following conditions 
are met: 
 • the change in lease payments results in revised consideration 
for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the 
consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change 
sales, distribution and marketing expenses comprise expenses 
related to the distribution of goods sold and sales campaigns, 
including packaging materials, brochures, wages and salaries 
and  other expenses related to sales and distribution staff as 
well as depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses in 
respect of distribution equipment. 
administrative expenses comprise expenses incurred in the 
year to manage pandora, including expenses related to admin-
istrative staff and depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
losses in respect of assets used in the administration.
the allocation of amortisation and impairment losses from 
intangible assets is presented in note 3.1  
  and allocation of 
depreciation and impairment losses from property, plant and 
equipment in note 3.2.  
financial statements of the parent company
under section 149 of the danish financial statements act, these 
consolidated financial statements represent an extract of  
pandora’s complete annual report. in order to make this report 
more manageable and user-friendly, we publish group consoli-
dated financial statements without the financial statements of 
the parent company, pandora a/s. the annual report of the par-
ent company is an integrated part of the full annual report and 
available on www.cvr.dk when approved at the annual general 
meeting. profit sharing and supplementary payment from the 
parent company are set out in the equity section of the consol-
idated financial statements. the full annual report contains the 
statement from the board of directors and the executive board 
as well as the independent auditor’s report.

management’s judgements 
and estimates under ifrs
    significant accounting estimates  
in preparing the consolidated financial state-
ments, management makes various accounting 
estimates and assumptions that form the basis 
of the presentation, recognition and measure-
ment of pandora’s assets and liabilities. 
determining the carrying amounts of some 
assets and liabilities requires estimates 
and assumptions concerning future events. 
estimates and assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other factors, which 
management assesses to be reasonable, but 
which by their nature involve uncertainty and 
unpredictability. these assumptions may 
have to be revised, and unexpected events or 
circumstances may occur.
pandora is subject to risks and uncertainties 
that may lead to actual results differing from 
these estimates, both positively and negatively. 
covid-19 
due to the covid-19 outbreak, pandora has 
assessed the value of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment. due to the 
change of operating segments, an impairment 
test was carried out in q2 2020. no impair-
ment was identified and the impairment test is 
still considered to include sufficient head-
room. as there is limited visibility on the future 
covid-19 development, pandora will continue 
assessing the value of the assets including the 
terms of the leasing contracts and any gov-
ernment grants. pandora has also considered 
the recoverability of accounts receivable and 
the inventory value and has not identified any 
impairment write down. 
specific risks for pandora are discussed in the 
relevant sections of the management’s review 
and in the notes. 
the areas that involve a high degree of judge-
ment and estimation and are material to the 
financial statements are described in more 
detail in the related notes.

new accounting policies  
and disclosures (continued)
 • any reduction in lease payments affects only payments 
originally due on or before 30 june 2021 (for example, a rent 
concession would meet this condition if it results in reduced 
lease payments before 30 june 2021 and increased lease 
payments that extend beyond 30 june 2021) 
 • there is no substantive change to other terms and conditions 
of the lease.
pandora decided to apply the practical expedient issued by 
iasb for all contracts with rent concessions occurring as a direct 
consequence of covid-19 and where it meets all conditions of 
the practical expedient. the effect of the amendment and its 
impact on financial statements are presented in note 3.3.

note 2.1 
segment and revenue information
as part of pandora’s reorganisation, the reportable segments 
have been reorganised as of q2 2020 in two global business 
units, each responsible for the end-to-end performance of 
products. one global business unit will have the responsibility 
mainly for core collections, including moments and collabs, 
while the other global business unit will drive the newer collec-
tions and innovations. the comparative figures for 2019 have 
been restated to reflect the new segments.
the two operating segments include all channels relating to the 
distribution and sale of pandora products.
both segments derive their revenue from the types of products 
shown in the product information.
management monitors the profitability of the operating seg-
ments separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance management. segment 
results are measured as gross profit.
as programme now restructuring costs cannot be meaningfully 
allocated to segments, segment performance is measured and 
reported excluding restructuring costs. segment information is 
recognised and measured in accordance with ifrs.

segment and revenue information (continued)
revenue by product category of pandora products does not 
differ materially between segments. product offerings are also 
similar between segments and grouped into the collections. 
the use of sales channels for the distribution of pandora jewel-
lery depends on the underlying market maturity and varies with-
in markets but is consistent when viewed between segments.

note 2.1 
segment and revenue information (continued)
    significant accounting estimates  
recognition and measurement of revenue is based on 
estimates and judgements relating to expected sales returns 
allowed to customers in most countries. these judgements 
can have a material impact on the timing and measurement 
of recognised revenue as well as the level of the refund 
liability. reductions in revenue from expected sales returns is 
calculated based on historical return patterns and on a case-
by-case basis for commercial reasons.
    accounting policies  
retail sales – products 
revenue from the sale of products through pandora owned and 
operated stores is recognised when a store sells a product to the 
customer. payment is usually due when the customer picks up 
the product in the store or the product is delivered from an on-
line store. however, in some instances collection is delayed and a 
receivable recognised, see note 3.6 trade receivables.
a refund liability and a right-of-return asset are recognised for 
products expected to be returned, see note 3.8 contract assets 
and liabilities. the estimate for returned products is based on 
historical experience and expectations. based on knowledge of 
the nature of returns, it is considered highly probable that a sig-
nificant reversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. 
provisions for rebates and discounts granted to customers are 
recognised as a reduction in revenue.
the group’s obligation to repair or replace faulty products is part 
of the standard terms and is therefore recognised as a contract 
liability, see note 3.8 contract assets and liabilities. revenue is 
further measured excluding sales taxes and duties when these 
are passed on to customers. sales taxes and duties incurred on 
sales that are not recoverable from the local taxation authorities 
are reported gross as part of revenue and cost of sales.
wholesale and third-party distributors – products 
pandora manufactures and sells jewellery to wholesalers and 
third-party distributors. revenue is recognised when control of 
the products has been transferred to the wholesaler or third-par-
ty distributor. change of control of the products occurs when the 
products have been delivered to the wholesaler or distributor 
and no further obligation exists that can affect the transfer of 
control. delivery has taken place when the products have been 
shipped to the location of the wholesaler or distributor and 
control of the goods has been transferred to the buyer. revenue 
from the sale is recognised based on the price specified in the 
contract. revenue is only recognised to the extent it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur. a refund liability 
and a right-of-return asset are recognised for products expected 
to be returned, see note 3.8 contract assets and liabilities. the 
estimate for returned products is based on historical experience 
and expectations. based on knowledge of the nature of returns 
in the wholesale and distributor channels, it is considered highly 
probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recog-
nised will not occur. provisions for rebates and discounts granted 
to wholesalers and franchisees are recognised as a reduction in 
revenue.
the group’s obligation to repair or replace faulty products is 
recognised on a gross basis in the income statement as both a 
reduction in revenue and a decrease in cost of goods sold. this is 
due to the handling of warranty claims, which leads to replace-
ments instead of repairs. revenue is further measured excluding 
sales taxes and duties when these are passed on to customers. 
sales taxes and duties incurred on sales that are not recoverable 
from the local taxation authorities are reported gross as part of 
revenue and cost of sales.
when control has been transferred, a receivable is recognised as 
the consideration to be paid is conditional only on the passage 
of time. the price specified in the contract is not adjusted for any 
financing element as payment terms never exceed 12 months.

programme now restructuring costs
programme now
programme now costs are reported in the income statement 
within the cost types it relates to. 
 
restructuring costs amounted to dkk 1.2 billion (dkk 2.0 billion 
in 2019). restructuring costs impacted the income statement 
as follows: 
 •  cost of sales, dkk 0.2 billion primarily related to optimisa-
tion in production (2019: dkk 1.0 billion, primarily related to 
inventory buyback of dkk 0.6 billion and product portfolio 
optimisation of dkk 0.3 billion). 
 • operating expenses, dkk 1.0 billion, primarily related to or-
ganizational restructuring (dkk 0.3 billion), it transformation 
(dkk 0.2 billion) and consultancy expenses (dkk 0.4 billion) 
(2019: dkk 1.0 billion, primarily related to brand restructuring 
activities (dkk 0.2 billion), it transformation (dkk 0.1 billion), 
accelerated amortisations (dkk 0.2 billion) and consultancy 
costs (dkk 0.4 billion)). 
 
restructuring costs impacted marketing expenses by dkk 0.1 
billion (2019: dkk 0.2 billion), sales and distribution expenses 
by dkk 0.1 billion (2019: dkk 0.2 billion) and administrative 
expenses by dkk 0.8 billion (2019: dkk 0.6 billion). 
    significant accounting estimates  
estimates mainly relate to judgement applied by executive 
management in distinguishing between restructuring and 
normal operation.
    accounting policies  
in 2019 and 2020, pandora is restructuring the business 
under the programme name “programme now” to restore 
long-term sustainable growth and protect profitability. 
the restructuring costs are significant non-recurring items 
assessed by executive management, making a distinction 
between normal operation and restructuring.
as programme now restructuring costs cannot be meaning-
fully allocated to reportable segments, segment performance 
is measured and reported excluding restructuring costs.
pandora has received government subsidies of dkk 225 million 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic for operations mainly in 
europe and australia. the majority of the subsidies were relat-
ed to employee retention and facility cost and included among 
others the government programmes “job retention scheme” 
and “business rates relief scheme” in the united kingdom, 
“jobkeeper program” in australia and “erte” in spain. there 
are no unfulfilled conditions or other contingencies attached 
to the received subsidies. during the pandemic pandora has 
retained all staff onboard, including store staff while stores 
were closed. the government subsidies partially fund the cost 
hereof.
note 2.3
government grants
    accounting policies  
government grants are recognised where there is reasona-
ble assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with.
income from government subsidies as a result of covid-19

    accounting policies  
wages and salaries, social security contributions, leave and 
sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recog-
nised in the financial year in which services are rendered by 
employees of pandora. whenever pandora provides long-
term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to match the 
rendering of the services by the  employees.
termination benefits are recognised at the time an agree-
ment between pandora and the employee is made and no 
future service is rendered by the employee in exchange for 
the benefits.

decisions to grant share-based incentive programmes are 
made by the board of directors in accordance with general 
guidelines on incentive pay for pandora.
the total cost related to share-based payments was dkk 70 
million (2019: net cost of dkk 20 million). the programme for 
2020 was recorded at target level as the target is expected 
to be met. the cost of share-based payments are included in 
staff costs. in the remaining vesting periods, an amount of dkk 
95 million (2019: dkk 52 million) is expected to be recognised 
in respect of the current programmes. the weighted average 
remaining contractual life of performance shares at the end of 
the period was 2.9 years (2019: 2.1 years).
for shares exercised in 2020, the average share price at the 
time of exercise was dkk 306.
long-term incentive programmes
each year, two incentive programmes are launched targeting ei-
ther executive management or other employees. the calculated 
value of each programme is recognised over the vesting period 
(three years) based on the likelihood that programme targets 
will be met. for executive management, a further two-year 
holding period applies.

1  although technically structured as options for legacy danish tax treatment reasons, the awards have the characteristics of performance share units because the option exercise price is 1% of the share price.
assumptions
the volatility of the shares is based on the historical volatility of 
the price of pandora a/s’ shares. the risk-free interest rate
is based on a danish government bond with similar maturity. 
the dividend yield applied is equal to 4.5% for the 2020 pro-
gramme and 5.9% for the 2019 programme and is based on the 
assumed future dividend over the vesting period and the share 
price on the date of the grant. actual paid dividends may differ 
from the assumptions applied in the valuation of the market 
value. given that the exercise price for one performance share 
equals up to 1% of the market price of one share at grant date, 
the fair value almost equals the market value of one share at 
grant date. the assumptions in the table therefore have very 
limited impact on the estimated fair value of performance 
shares granted.
    accounting policies  
selected pandora employees receive remuneration in the form 
of share-based payment transactions, whereby programme par-
ticipants render services as consideration for equity instruments 
(“equity-settled transactions”).
equity-settled transactions 
the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is meas-
ured by reference to the fair value at the grant date. the calculat-
ed fair values are based on either the black-scholes model or the 
monte carlo model according to the performance conditions of 
each programme. the cost of equity-settled transactions is recog 
nised as staff costs together with a corresponding increase in 
equity over the period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled.
the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transac-
tions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. the income statement expense or income for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative expenses recog-
nised at the beginning and end of that period.

income tax expense
income tax expense was dkk 556 million in 2020, correspond-
ing to an effective tax rate of 22.3% (2019: dkk 884 million, 
23.1%) for the group. the tax rate of 22.3% was negatively im-
pacted by adjustments to previous years and paid withholding 
tax. the effective tax rate was reduced by non-taxable income 
in thailand due to the board of investment agreements (bois).
 
the corporate income tax rate in most of pandora’s key markets is  
higher than the danish tax rate of 22%, except for uk and thailand.

    significant accounting estimates  
pandora is subject to income tax in the countries in which 
the group operates, comprising various tax rates worldwide. 
significant judgements are required in determining the ac-
crual for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and 
provision for uncertain tax positions. provision for uncertain 
tax positions is measured according to ifric 23.
as part of pandora conducting business globally, tax and 
transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur. any 
unresolved disputes with local tax authorities are recognised 
as income tax payable/receivable based on the expected val-
ue method or the most likely amount. management believes 
that the provision made for uncertain tax positions is ade-
quate. however, the actual obligation may deviate from this 
and is dependent on the result of litigations and settlements 
with the relevant tax authorities.
    accounting policies  
income tax expense for the year comprises current tax and 
changes in deferred tax, including changes in tax rate, adjust-
ment to prior years and changes in provision for uncertain tax 
positions. tax is recognised in the income statement, except 
to the extent that it is related to items recognised in equity or 
other comprehensive income. the tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amounts are those enacted or substantively 
enacted, by the reporting date, in the countries in which 
pandora operates and generates taxable income.

deferred tax
at the end of 2020, deferred tax assets amounted to dkk 
764 million (2019: dkk 675 million) and deferred tax liabilities 
amounted to dkk 368 million (2019: dkk 235 million). net de-
ferred tax assets amounted to dkk 396 million (2019: dkk 440 
million). 
of the total deferred tax assets recognised, dkk 14 million 
(2019: dkk 3 million) related to tax loss carryforwards, the 
utilisation of which depends on future positive taxable income 
exceeding realised deferred tax liabilities. it is management’s 
opinion that these tax loss carryforwards can be utilised. 
tax assets not recognised, dkk 28 million (2019: dkk 30 million), 
relate to tax loss carryforwards that are not expected to be 
utilised in the foreseeable future. tax losses that can expire 
amounted to dkk 14 million (2019: dkk 7 million).
no deferred tax has been recognised in respect of entities’ 
earnings that are intended for distribution in the short term,  
as no tax will be payable on distribution.
only insignificant latent tax liabilities remained at 31 december 
2020. these liabilities are not recognised as the group is able 
to control this liability and it is considered probable that the 
liability will not crystallise in the foreseeable future.

taxation (continued)
    accounting policies  
deferred tax on all temporary differences between the car-
rying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax 
base of assets and liabilities is measured using the balance 
sheet liability method. no deferred tax is recognised on 
temporary differences that arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of the transac-
tion, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or 
loss.
the recognition of deferred tax assets includes the expected 
tax value of tax loss carryforwards to the extent that these 
tax assets can be offset against positive taxable income in 
the foreseeable future. the same applies to deferred tax 
assets related to investments in subsidiaries. management 
has considered future taxable income and applied judge-
ments to determine whether deferred tax assets should be 
recognised.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured according to 
current tax rules and at the tax rates expected to be effec-
tive on elimination of the temporary differences. deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset if the group has a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred tax relates to the same taxa-
ble entity and the same tax authority.

tax policy
pandora is a large taxpayer and it is of great importance for 
pandora to be a responsible taxpayer as well. this means that 
we focus on paying the correct amount of taxes at the right 
time in all countries where we do business. pandora is commit-
ted to ensuring compliance with the letter and spirit of tax laws 
in the markets in which we operate, while striving to maximise 
shareholder value in a responsible way. pandora will not engage 
in aggressive tax planning and will only optimise the group’s 
tax position in connection with the evolution of its operational, 
commercial and economic activities. tax will be an outcome of 
the business strategy and will not drive business strategy.
pandora aims to minimise the level of tax risks at all times and 
actively seeks to identify, quantify, manage and monitor the tax 
position to ensure it will remain in line with the group’s tax pol-
icy. pandora will refrain from unnecessarily complex tax set-ups, 
keeping a simple, business-aligned model that is well under-
stood and based on in-depth analysis of tax and reputational 
impacts.
pandora will consider government-sponsored tax incentives 
where appropriate and in line with our code of conduct to 
support economic development, transfer of knowledge, job 
creation and maintaining good corporate citizenship.
the group tax policy, which has been approved by the audit 
commitee of pandora, is available on www.pandoragroup.com.  
paid income tax
in 2020, pandora paid dkk 192 million in income tax. most of 
the tax payments are attributable to pandora’s key markets 
shown in the table below. the significant decrease in tax paid 
compared with previous years (2019: dkk 1,233 million) is 
caused by lower profit in general compared with 2019 as a 
result of covid-19. the significant decrease is further caused 
by a refund in denmark (related to 2019) which exceed 2020 
paid taxes of dkk 309 million resulting in a  net refund of dkk 
97 million (2019: 876 million which also included tax payments 
related to previous years).

additions in 2020 relate to acquisitions of activities.  
note 3.4  
  includes an overview of acquired goodwill for  
the year.
brand 
the ‘pandora’ brand is the only brand of the group that is 
capitalised in the financial statements. it comprises a group of 
complementary intangible assets relating to the brand, domain 
name, products, image and customer experience related to 
products sold under the pandora brand. the brand was ac-
quired as part of the pandora core business in 2008. 
distribution 
distribution includes distribution network and distribution 
rights. these are presented aggregated in 2020. 
the distribution network covers pandora’s  relations with its 
distributors. the main part of the distribution network was 
acquired with the pandora core business in 2008.
distribution rights mainly relate to the distribution rights for 
pandora products in north america. these were acquired with 
the american distributor in 2008 and the carrying amount at 
31 december 2020 was dkk 1,034 million (2019: dkk 1,034 
million). 
other intangible assets 
other intangible assets mainly comprise software. 
note 3.1 
intangible assets (continued)
    accounting policies  
all intangible assets are tested for impairment if there 
is any indication of impairment or at least annually.
in addition, impairment testing of goodwill was per-
formed in q2 2020 after the change in the operating 
segments in pandora. all the assumptions used are 
described on the following page. 
goodwill  
goodwill is initially recognised at the amount by 
which the purchase price for a business combina-
tion exceeds the recognised value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities acquired. goodwill comprises 
future growth expectations, buyer-specific synergies, 
the workforce in place and know-how. subsequent to 
initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not amor-
tised, and impairment losses charged in previous years 
cannot be reversed. 
brand  
brand is initially recognised at cost based on the 
“relief from royalty” method, which is considered to 
have an indefinite useful life and is impairment tested 
annually.
distribution  
the distribution network is initially recognised at fair 
value based on an estimation of the costs the entity 
avoids by owning the intangible assets and not need-
ing to rebuild the network (the cost approach). 
the distribution network is amortised over an expect-
ed useful life of 15 years. 
the distribution rights for pandora products in the 
north american market are measured based on a 
residual model, since the distribution agreement 
underlying the distribution rights is non- terminable. 
consequently, the distribution rights are considered 
to have an indefinite useful life. 
other acquired distribution rights are initially  recognised 
at cost based on the “multi-period  excess earnings” 
model and amortised over their expected useful lives. 
other intangible assets 
software is initially recognised at cost and amortised 
over 2-5 years. 
amortisation is allocated to segments on a pro-rata 
basis based on the standard cost per segment.
impairment 
at each reporting date, pandora assesses whether 
there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
if any such indication exists, or when annual impair-
ment testing of an asset is required, pandora estimates 
the recoverable amount of the asset. 
the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of 
the fair value of the asset or cash-generating unit 
(cgu) less costs to sell and its value in use. the recov-
erable amount is determined for the smallest group 
of assets that is independent from other assets or 
groups of assets. where the carrying amount of an as-
set or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset 
is written down to its recoverable amount.
in assessing the value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. in determining fair value less 
costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.
the most significant factors when assessing the po-
tential need for impairment are:
— decreasing revenue 
— decreasing brand value 
—  changes to the product mix.
the indicators above should be viewed in the context 
of pandora’s relatively high margins and low asset base.
the brand is applied and supported globally in all 
of the group’s entities. the brand is maintained and 
preserved through common strategy and  product 
development at group level and marketing in the indi-
vidual sales entities. the brand is consequently tested 
for impairment at group level.
like the brand described above, goodwill is reported 
and managed internally at group level. due to the 
constraint in ias 36 impairment, goodwill is allocated to 
the grouped cgus in the two operating segments for 
impairment testing purposes. it is management’s opin-
ion that this best reflects pandora’s value creation.

method for impairment testing
in the impairment test, the recoverable amount was compared 
with the carrying amount. the recoverable amount is based 
on a calculation of the value in use using cash flow estimates 
based on the budget for 2021 and expectations for the next 
three years. the long-term growth rate in the terminal period 
has been set so that it equals the expected long-term rate of 
inflation.

assumptions 
the calculations of the recoverable amounts of cgus or groups 
of cgus are based on the following key assumptions: 
discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the 
risks specific to each cgu or group of cgus. the group dis-
count rates have been estimated based on a weighted average 
cost of capital for the industry. the rates have also been adjust-
ed to reflect the market assessment of any risk specific to each 
group of cgus.
the ebit figures used in the impairment test are based on the 
budget for next year, prepared and approved by management, 
and a forecast for the two subsequent years.
the 2% growth rate applied is an estimate of the expected 
average inflation in the terminal period. as such no real growth 
is applied to the terminal period when calculating the recover-
able amounts. 
the ebit margin in the budget of each group of cgus is based 
on historical experience and expectations concerning: 
 •  revenue development taking into account development in 
network (stores, retail/wholesale share), product mix and 
market share as well as the covid-19 impact on temporarily 
closed stores and online revenue growth
 •  cost of sales based on raw materials consumption affected by 
mix of materials (stones, gold, silver and salaries) and average 
lagged hedge commodity prices at the time the budget is 
note 3.1 
intangible assets (continued)
prepared. this includes also the potential impact of cov-
id-19 in the metal prices that has surged since q2 2020 and 
the impact after the cost and commercial mitigating actions 
was considered
 •  development in operating expenses
 •  currency rates are based on actual rates at the time the 
budget is prepared.
net working capital in the budget for next year, relative to the 
revenue of each group of cgus, is based on historical experi-
ence and is maintained for the remainder of the expected lives. 
net working capital thus increases on a linear basis as the level 
of activity increases.
the impairment test of the brand at group level is based on the 
"relief from royalty" method.
due to the change of operating segments, an impairment test 
was carried out in q2 2020. the impairment tests did not 
identify any need for impairment losses to be recognised. as 
there is limited visibility on the future covid-19 develop-
ment, pandora will continue assessing the value of the assets. 
based on sensitivity analyses, it is management’s opinion that 
no probable change in any key assumptions would cause the 
carrying amounts of grouped cgus or at group level to exceed 
the recoverable amount.
even with a significant reduction in growth rate and a decrease 
in discount rate, management has not identified any impair-
ment indicator.

covid-19-related rent concessions of dkk 112 million have 
been recognised within sales and distribution expenses in the 
income statement in 2020.
rent of dkk 52 million has been deferred, meaning that rent 
payments have been postponed under agreements with land-
lords. overall financing cash flow was positively impacted by 
dkk 164 million due to rent relief and rent deferrals.
total cash outflow relating to leases was dkk 1,164 million 
(2019: dkk 1,643 million) for the period. this comprises of fixed 
lease payments in scope of ifrs 16 of dkk 839 million (2019: 
dkk 1,138 million), variable lease payments of dkk 196 million 
(2019: dkk 371 million), interest paid of dkk 96 million (2019: 
dkk 104 million), and short-term and low-value leases of dkk 
33 million (2019: dkk 30 million). many of the group’s property 
leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to the 
volume of sales made from leased stores according to normal 
market practice. in 2020, around 17% (2019: 23%) of the lease 
payments recognised in the income statement were variable 
rent. pandora has estimated that a 1% increase in annual phys-
ical store revenue would consequently result in a 0.7% (2019: 
0.5%) increase in lease payments. the average usual store 
leases are five years with a three to five year option to extend 
in approximately 23% (2019: 23%) of current leases. approxi-
mately 20% of current leases are up for renegotiations in 2021. 
the estimated value of lease extensions that pandora is not 
reasonably certain to exercise is around dkk 0.6 billion (2019: 
dkk 0.4 billion).

note 3.3
leases  (continued)
    accounting policies  
pandora applies a single recognition and measure-
ment approach to all leases, except for short-term 
leases and low-value leases.
pandora recognises right-of-use assets at the com-
mencement date of the lease when the asset is avail-
able for use. right-of-use assets are measured at cost, 
less any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. the cost of right-of-use assets includes the 
amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, key money, less any lease in-
centives received. key money is measured at cost and 
amortised over the term of the contract. right-of-use 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s 
useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
at each reporting date pandora assesses whether 
there is any indication that a right-of-use asset may 
be impaired. if any such indication exists, pandora 
carries out impairment testing for the relevant cgu.  
pandora recognises lease liabilities at the commence-
ment date of the lease, measured at the present value 
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. 
lease payments include fixed payments less any lease 
incentives receivable. some leases are exposed to 
potential future increases in variable lease payments 
based on an index or rate, which are not included 
in the lease liability until they take effect. payments 
relating to services are not included in lease liabilities. 
some property leases contain variable payment 
terms that are linked to sales generated from a store. 
variable lease payments that depend on sales are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the 
condition that triggers those payments occurs and 
are not included in the lease liability. 
in calculating the present value of lease payments, 
pandora uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest 
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
after the commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments made. 
in addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the 
lease term or a change in the lease payments.
pandora applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases.
payments related to short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets continue to be recognised on 
a straight-line basis as an expense in the income 
statement. short-term leases are leases with a lease 
term of 12 months or less. low-value assets comprise 
some it equipment and other office equipment. 
on 28 may 2020, the iasb issued covid-19- related 
rent concessions - amendment to ifrs 16 leases. as 
a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess 
whether a covid-19 pandemic-related rent conces-
sion from a lessor is a lease modification. pandora de-
cided to apply the practical expedient for all contracts 
with rent concessions occurring as direct consequence 
of covid-19 and where all conditions of the practical 
expedient are met.
    significant accounting estimates  
when assessing the life of leases, pandora considers the 
non-cancellable lease term and options to extend the lease 
where pandora is reasonably certain to extend. leases in 
pandora mainly comprise stores, office buildings, cars, it and 
other office equipment. usual lease contracts for stores 
average five years with a three to five year option to extend 
in approximately 23% of current leases. the lease term for 
stores is assessed to be up to 10 years, depending on an 
internal store rating based on location, revenue and earnings. 
for office buildings, the lease term is usually five to 15 years. 
for other assets, the life is equal to the non-cancellable lease 
term, and extensions are not considered for these.
the covid-19 outbreak is deemed a significant change in the 
circumstances, which has led pandora to re-negotiate store 
leases where possible. pandora is renegotiating most of the 
lease contracts and does not intend to extend the existing 
contracts within existing terms. pandora has also decided to 
execute termination options and communicated the decision 
to the landlords by sending termination letters. both gave rise 
to the reassessment/reduction in the right-of-use assets by 
around dkk 0.4 billion.

business combinations
acquisitions in 2020
no acquisitions, to an extent of significance to pandora, were completed during 2020. 
acquisitions after the  reporting period
no acquisitions took place after the reporting period.
    accounting policies  
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisi-
tion method. the cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at 
acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-con-
trolling interests in the acquiree.
for each business combination, the acquirer measures the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. acquisition costs incurred are expensed. subse-
quent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses.
as goodwill is reported and managed internally at group lev-
el, goodwill acquired should also be allocated to the group. 
however, goodwill acquired is allocated to the grouped 
cgus in the two operating segments for impairment testing 
purposes due to the constraint in ias 36 impairment.
if any part of the cost of an acquisition is contingent on 
future events or performance, the cost is recognised at fair 
value at the time of acquisition. changes to the fair value of 
the contingent payment is recognised in net financials in the 
income statement.
any changes to the fair value of obligations to acquire 
non-controlling interests (put options) are recognised 
directly in equity.

inventories

inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable

(fifo). besides raw materials, costs also include labour and 
a proportion of production overheads based on normal 
operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
point-of-sale materials comprise purchase costs regarding 
equipment, displays and packaging materials etc. and are 
also accounted for on a fifo basis.

assumptions concerning capacity utilisation, lead times and 
other relevant factors. 
net realisable value
net realisable value is based on the estimated  selling price less 
estimated costs of completion and distribution. alternatively, 
for inventories that are not expected to be sold, net realisable 
value is based on the remelt value of the reusable raw  materials 
(primarily silver and gold).

trade receivables are amounts due from the sale of goods sold 
in the ordinary course of business to wholesalers and distrib-
utors or to landlords, malls or e-commerce providers respon-
sible for the collection of cash on behalf of pandora related to 
retail sales. 
while realised losses are immaterial and remain low, pandora 
has applied an increased risk factor in light of covid-19. the 
impairment on receivables has slightly decreased for the year. 
realised losses remain within the expected range.
pandora applies the simplified approach to measure expected 
credit losses, using a lifetime expected loss allowance. in view 
of the low historical loss rates on receivables, adjusting these 
    accounting policies  
trade receivables are initially recognised at the amount 
of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain 
significant financing components, and consequently recog-
nised at fair value. the group holds trade receivables with 
the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and 
therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method.
rates to reflect current and forward-looking information on 
macroeconomic factors such as gdp and the unemployment 
rate that affect the ability of customers to settle receivables 
will not increase the risk of losses significantly. the low risk is 
further supported by the compilation of receivables as these 
consist of a large population of immaterial amounts.  
management continues to assess credit risks in order to ensure 
credit risk never exceeds the recognised write-down on trade 
receivables. for a further description of credit risk, see note 4.4 
financial risks.  
  changes in impairment are presented in the

provisions are recognised when pandora has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. the expense relating to any provision is recog-
nised in the income statement net of any reimbursement.

    accounting policies  
pandora recognises a refund and warranty liability related  
to return rights provided to customers in most countries.  
a corresponding right-of-return asset is also included as 
part of contract assets. the value of the right-of-return asset 
is determined by how many of the returned products are 
expected to be sold. remaining products are written down 
to remelt value together with returns covered by warranties.
the refund liability for estimated sales returns is recognised 
when there is historical experience or when a reasonably 
accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise 
be made. the income effect recognised is the gross margin 
of the expected returns and the potential effect of writing 
down parts of the returned goods to remelt value. changes 
to the right-of-return asset and refund liability are recog-
nised gross in the income statement, i.e. as both revenue 
and cost of sales.
refund liability to cover warranty claims is based on expect-
ed replacements provided for products still covered by 
warranty at the end of the period. the liability is recognised 
gross in the income statement, as both a reduction in rev-
enue and in cost of goods sold. this is due to the handling 
of warranty claims, which lead to replacements instead of 
repairs.
no costs to obtain contracts with customers have been cap-
italised as part of contracts with customers either in 2020 or 
previous years. this is common practice in pandora.
    significant accounting estimates  
in most countries, pandora has provided return and warranty 
rights to customers. the handling of warranty claims leads to 
replacements instead of repairs. the recognised refund liabil-
ity relating to return and warranty rights is assessed to a large 
extent on the basis of historical return patterns.

section 4
this section includes notes related to pandora’s capital structure 
and net financials, including financial risks (see note 4.4  
 ). as a 
consequence of its operations, investments and financing, pandora 
is exposed to a number of financial risks that are monitored and 
managed by pandora’s group treasury. pandora uses a number of 
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctu-
ations in commodity prices and similar. derivative financial instru-
ments are described in note 4.5.  
pandora’s capital structure policy is to maintain a leverage ratio 
(nibd to ebitda ratio) between 0.5 and 1.5 (excluding restructuring 
costs and including committed leases in accordance with ifrs 16). 
at 31 december 2020, the ratio excl. restructuring costs was 0.5x 
compared with 1.1x at 31 december 2019. the cash conversion was 
183% in 2020 including committed leases payments compared 
with 133% in 2019.

at 31 december 2020, the share capital comprised 100,000,000 
shares with a par value of dkk 1. no shares have special rights.
in 2020, pandora launched a share buyback programme under 
which pandora expected to buy back own shares to a value of 
dkk 2.1 billion. the 2020 programme was suspended on 16 
march due to the unprecedented covid-19 circumstances. in 
2020 pandora bought 1,303,455 treasury shares, corresponding 
to a total purchase price of dkk 431 million. of these 1,215,595 
treasury shares corresponding to a total purchase price of dkk 
412 million related to the 2019 share buyback programme, 
and 87,860 treasury shares corresponding to a total purchase 
price of dkk 19 million related to the 2020 share buyback 
programme.
on 5 may 2020, pandora sold 8,000,000 treasury shares through 
an accelerated book-building sale, generating approximately 
dkk 1.8 billion in net proceeds.
treasury shares
all treasury shares are owned by pandora a/s. treasury shares 
include hedges for share-based incentive plans and restricted 
shares granted to the executive management and other

dividend
due to the uncertainty from covid-19 pandora does not 
propose any dividend relating to the 2020 results. declared 
dividend of dkk 9 per share, corresponding to dkk 825 million 
in 2019, was paid to the shareholders in 2020. no dividend was 
paid on treasury shares.
furthermore, in 2019 dkk 860 million was paid as part of the 
commitment to pay bi-annual dividend in 2019 relating to the 
2019 results.
dividend paid has had no effect on the group’s tax expense for 
the year.
for additional shareholder information about dividend, read 
more on page 39

dividend proposed is recognised as a liability at the date of 
the adoption at the annual general meeting (declaration 
date). bi-annual dividend is recognised as a liability at the 
declaration date.
distributable reserves
distributable reserves are based on the reserves of the parent

1 includes the effect of the reclassification of the non-current portion of interest-bearing loans and borrowings, including lease liabilities, to current due to the passage of time, the effect of accrued but not yet paid interest on 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings, including lease liabilities, the upfront prepayment of lease liabilities and the effect of the lease modification & reassessment. the group classifies interest paid as cash flows from operating 
activities.
note 4.3 
net interest-bearing debt
    accounting policies  
on initial recognition, interest-bearing debt and borrowings 
are measured at fair value less transaction costs. subsequent 
to initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the liabilities are derecognised and through 
the effective interest rate method. amortised cost is cal-
culated by taking into account any discount or premium at 
inception, and fees and other costs. 
pandora has historically entered into put options with 
non-controlling interests of certain group entities. the put 
option gives the non-controlling shareholder the right to 
sell its non-controlling interest to pandora at a predefined 
exercise price, which is based on revenue.
financial liabilities relating to the acquisition of non-con-
trolling interests are measured at fair value as if the put op-
tions have already been exercised. the value is determined 
using the estimated present value of the expected cash out-
flows required to settle the put options. the value is based 
on projected revenue and assuming that the put options will 
be exercised by the non-controlling interests at year end in 
the current financial year. changes in the value of these lia-
bilities as well as differences on settlement between actual 
cash outflows and expected cash outflows are accounted 
for as transactions directly in equity. all financial liabilities 
relating to the acquisition of non-controlling interests had 
been settled at the end of 2020.
subsidiaries whose non-controlling shareholdings are 
subject to put options are fully consolidated, i.e. with no 
recognition of a non-controlling interest.

financial statements
it is pandora’s policy to hedge at least 50% of the combined 
commodity, exchange rate and interest rate risk. however, at 
least 70% of estimated commodity purchases must be hedged.
the table below illustrates the sensitivity on 2020 revenue, ebit 
and ebit margin from exchange rates and commodity price 
movements. in addition, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities 
as of 31 december from currency movements is illustrated on 
the next page.
commodity price risk
raw material risk is the risk of fluctuating commodity prices 
resulting in additional production costs. the most important 
raw materials are silver and gold, which are priced in usd. 
it is the policy of pandora to ensure stable, predictable raw  
material prices. based on a rolling 12-month production plan, 
the general policy is for group treasury to hedge at least 70%  
of the group’s expected purchases. 
purchases are hedged from 1 to 12 months forward with a 
hedge ratio target that decreases with time to maturity as  
illustrated in the table. any deviation from the policy must  
be approved by the audit committee. 
commodity hedging is updated at the end of each month or in 
connection with revised 12-months rolling production plans. 
actual production may deviate from the 12-months rolling 
production plan. in case of deviations, the realised commodity 
hedge ratio may deviate from the estimated hedge ratio. the 
profit (loss) from commodity hedging goes to cost of sales as 
the hedges matures. for the fair value of hedging instruments, 
see note 4.5.  
 
foreign currency risk 
pandora’s presentation currency is dkk, but the majority of 
pandora’s activities and investments are denominated in other 
currencies. consequently, exchange rate fluctuations may have 
a substantial impact on pandora’s cash flows, profit (loss) and/
or financial position in dkk. 
 
the majority of pandora’s revenue is denominated in usd, cad, 
aud, gbp, cny and eur. the functional currency of subsidiaries 
is generally the local currency, and a substantial portion of  
pandora’s costs relates to raw materials purchased in usd.  
as a consequence of its operations, investments and financing, 
pandora is exposed to a number of financial risks that are moni-
tored and managed by pandora’s group treasury.
to manage financial risks, pandora may use a number of finan-
cial instruments, such as forward contracts, silver and gold 
swaps, currency and interest rate swaps, options and similar 
instruments within the framework of its current policies. finan-
cial risks are divided into commodity price risk, foreign currency 
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.

it is pandora’s policy to hedge foreign currency risks related to 
the risk of declining net cash flows resulting from exchange rate 
fluctuations.  pandora does not hedge balance sheet items or 
ownership interests in foreign  subsidiaries. for 2021, 70% of the 
cash flows from the main currencies have been hedged based 
on a rolling 12-months liquidity forecast. cash flows are hedged 
from 1 to 12 months forward with a hedge ratio that decreases 
with time to maturity. foreign currency hedging is updated at 
the end of each month or in connection with revised 12-months 
rolling cash forecasts. the realised profit (loss) from exchange 
rate hedging goes to financial items.
the table below illustrates the currency revaluation impact in 
dkk million on net profit and changes in equity resulting from 
a change in the group’s primary foreign currencies after the 
effect of hedge accounting. 
credit risk 
credit risk is primarily related to trade receivables, cash and 
unrealised gains on financial contracts. the maximum credit risk 
related to financial assets corresponds to the carrying amounts 
recognised in the consolidated balance sheet. 
it is pandora’s policy for subsidiaries to be responsible for 
credit evaluation and credit risk on their trade receivables. in 
case of deviation from standard agreements, group treasury 
and/or the cfo must approve any significant deviations from 
standard terms. 
note 3.6 includes an overview of the credit risk related to trade 
receivables. rating of trade receivables does not differ materi-
ally either by type of customer or geographic location. the risk 
of further impairment is considered to be limited. 
credit risks related to pandora’s other financial assets mainly in-
clude cash and unrealised gains on financial contracts. the cred-
it risk is related to default of the counterparty with a maximum 
exposure corresponding to the carrying amount of the assets. 
group treasury is responsible for managing these credit risks. 
liquidity risk 
pandora’s cash conversion is high and pandora maintains an 
adequate level of cash, debt and unutilised credit facilities to 
meet financial obligations when due. pandora’s liquidity risk is 
considered to be low.

the movements in the income statement arise from monetary items (cash, borrowings, receivables and payables) where the functional currency of the entity differs 
from the currency that the monetary items are denominated in. the movements in equity arise from monetary items and hedging instruments where the functional 
currency of the entity differs from the currency that the hedging instruments or monetary items are denominated in. the impact would have been the opposite if ex-
change rates had been decreasing by similar percentages. the analysis is based on the transaction currency.
in addition, pandora incurs costs denominated in thb. changes 
in the exchange rate of these currencies versus dkk will result in 
changes to the translated value of future ebit and cash flows.
pandora finances the majority of its subsidiaries’ cash require-
ments via intercompany loans  denominated in the local currency of 
the  individual subsidiary. a devaluation of these currencies against 
dkk will result in a foreign exchange loss in the parent company.
exchange rate fluctuations may lead to a decrease in revenue 
and an increase in costs and thus declining margins. in addition, 
exchange rate fluctuations affect the translated value of the profits 
or losses of foreign subsidiaries and the translation of foreign  
currency assets and liabilities.

financial risks (continued)
pandora has revolving credit facilities of dkk 6,998 million com-
mitted until may 20221. also, pandora has a committed term 
loan of dkk 2,976 million maturing end-2021. furthermore, 
pandora has uncommitted credit facilities to ensure efficient 
and flexible local  liquidity management. the credit facilities are 
managed by group treasury.
pandora’s loan and credit agreements contain one financial 
covenant that was amended during the refinancing exercise 
in april 2020 to cater for potential covid-19 impacts. the 
covenant was amended to 4.25x nibd/ebitda leaving material 
headroom before getting close to the covenant.
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk of interest rate fluctuations result-
ing in changed interest rate payments and market value of the 
loan portfolio. at the reporting date, all interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings were based on floating interest rates.
all else being equal, it is estimated that a general increase in 
interest rates by one percentage point would have no impact 
on profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect (2019: dkk 
75 million decrease).
contractual maturities of financial  liabilities
the table to the right breaks the group’s financial liabilities 
down into relevant maturity groupings based on contractual 
maturities for: 
 • all non-derivative financial liabilities, and 
 • net and gross settled derivative financial instruments for 
which the contractual maturities are essential for an under-
standing of the timing of the cash flows. 
the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undis-
counted cash flows. balances due within 12 months equal their 
carrying amounts as the impact of discounting is insignificant. 
the obligation of dkk 42 million to acquire non-controlling 
interests in japan was settled in 2020. 
the following table includes the earn-out payment relating  
to pandora jewelry central western europe a/s recognised at  
dkk 0 (2019: dkk 0).
based on the group’s expectations for the future operation 
and the group’s current cash resources, no other significant 
liquidity risks have been identified.

classification according to the fair value hierarchy
the fair value at 31 december 2020 and 2019 of pandora’s 
derivative financial instruments was measured in accordance 
with level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (ifrs 13). level 2 is based 
on non-quoted prices, observable either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). pandora uses input from 
third-party valuation specialists to quote prices for unrealised 
derivative financial instruments. the value of unrealised silver 
and gold instruments is tested against the prices observable at 
london bullion market association (lbma). the value of unreal-
ised foreign exchange instruments is tested against observable 
foreign exchange forward rates. 
the value of financial instruments recognised in other com-
prehensive income is recycled from equity at the time the 
instrument is settled, i.e. within 12 months.
derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash 
flow hedge accounting 
the hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature 
of the economic relation between the exposure and the hedge.
the effective portion of the unrealised gain or loss on all hedg-
ing instruments is recognised directly as other comprehensive 
income in the equity hedging reserve. the ineffective portion  
is recognised in net financials.
the effective portion of the realised gain or loss on a commod-
ity hedging transaction is recognised in group inventories and 
subsequently to cost of sales whereas the ineffective portion is 
realised in net financials. 
note 4.5 
derivative financial instruments
    accounting policies  
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value at the date on which a contract is entered into 
and are subsequently measured at fair value. for derivative 
financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair 
value is determined using appropriate valuation methods. 
such methods may include comparison with recent arm’s 
length market transactions, reference to the current fair 
value of another instrument that is substantially the same, or 
discounted cash flow analysis.
pandora has designated certain derivative financial instru-
ments as cash flow hedges as defined under ifrs 9. hedge 
accounting is classified as a cash flow hedge when the hedg-
es of a particular risk is associated with the cash flows of 
recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast 
transactions. 
pandora designates and documents all hedging relationships 
between commodity contracts and purchase transactions.
 
the realised gain or loss on all forward exchange contracts is 
recognised in net financials.
the ineffectiveness impact in net financials is a gain of dkk 31 
million (2019: gain of dkk 16 million).

    accounting policies  
finance income and costs comprise interest income and 
expenses, realised and unrealised gains and losses on pay-
ables/receivables and transactions in foreign currencies.
for all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, 
interest income or expense is recognised using the effective 
interest rate, which is the rate that discounts the estimated 
future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of 
the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appro-
priate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or 
liability.

financial statements
the board of directors and the executive management have 
today discussed and approved the annual report of pandora 
a/s for 2020.
the annual report has been prepared in accordance with inter-
national financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial statements act.
it is our opinion that the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair

financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020, which comprise 
statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement 
of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, includ-
ing accounting policies, for the group and the parent company. 
the consolidated financial statements and the parent company 
financial statements are prepared in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial statements act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the group and the parent company at 
31 december 2020 and of the results of the group’s and the par-
ent company’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 
1 january – 31 december 2020 in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and addi-
tional requirements of the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit report to 
the audit committee and the board of directors.
basis for opinion

year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the finan-

separate opinion on these matters. for each matter below, our 
description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided 
in that context.

statement on the management’s review
management is responsible for the management’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
management’s review, and we do not express any form of assur-
ance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the management’s review and, in doing 
so, consider whether the management’s review is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materi-
ally misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the man-
agement’s review provides the information required under the 
danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
the management’s review is in accordance with the financial 
statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial statements act. we did 
not identify any material misstatement of the management’s 
review. 
management’s responsibilities for the  
financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements and parent company financial statements 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with internation-
al financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial statements 
act and for such internal control as management determines 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
our procedures in relation to revenue recognition and 
measurement of expected sales returns included consid-
ering the group’s accounting policies for revenue recog-
nition, including those related to expected sales returns, 
and assessing compliance of policies with applicable 
accounting standards. we identified and assessed internal 
controls related to the timing of revenue recognition and 
measurement of expected sales returns. we tested the 
effectiveness of the group’s internal controls in relation 
to calculation of expected sales returns and timing of 
revenue recognition. on a sample basis, we tested sales 
transactions taking place at either side of the balance 
sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the balance 
sheet date to assess whether those transactions were 
recognised in the correct period. we assessed the key 
assumptions applied by management regarding expected 
sales returns based on our knowledge of the business and 
by reviewing the supporting documentation prepared by 
management. furthermore, we evaluated the disclosures 
provided by management in the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company financial statements 
to applicable accounting standards.
revenue and sales return 
revenue is recognised when control of the goods has 
been transferred to the buyer and it is measured at fair 
value of the expected consideration to be received, 
less rebates, discounts, sales taxes, duties and expected 
sales returns. revenue recognition and measurement of 
the related expected sales returns was a matter of most 
significance in our audit due to the inherent risk in the 
estimates and judgements which management makes in 
the normal course of business as to timing of revenue 
and measurement of expected sales returns. 
details on revenue recognition and expected sales 
returns are provided in sections 2.1 and 3.8 of the 
consolidated financial statements and in section 2.1 
and 3.5 of the parent company financial statements, to 
which we refer.
taxation 
the group has extensive international operations 
and in the normal course of business, management 
makes judgements and estimates in determining 
the recognition of income taxes, deferred taxes and 
provisions for uncertain tax positions. in thailand, 
the group is subject to board of investment (boi) 
agreements, where many, but not all, types of net 
income are tax-exempt, and therefore, changes 
in profit allocation could significantly impact the 
group’s consolidated tax expense. on this basis, 
taxation was a matter of most significance in our 
audit. additional details on income taxes are pro-
vided in section 2.6 of the consolidated financial 
statements, to which we refer.
our procedures in relation to recognition of income 
taxes, deferred taxes and provisions for uncer-
tain tax positions included assessing the group’s 
processes for recording and continual re-assess-
ment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. our 
procedures also covered evaluating the assump-
tions applied by management in determining the 
recognition and measurement of income taxes and 
deferred taxes while taking into account relevant 
correspondence with relevant tax authorities. our 
own tax specialists performed an assessment of the 
group’s recognition of income taxes and deferred 
taxes, including correspondence with relevant tax 
authorities to consider the completeness of the tax 
provisions. in addition, we assessed the assump-
tions used, taking into consideration our own tax 
specialists’ knowledge and experience. further, we 
evaluated the disclosures provided by management 
in the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent company financial statements to applicable 
accounting standards.
inventory 
the group carries inventory in the balance sheet at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. significant 
management judgements are required with regards 
to valuation of inventories due to the uncertainty as-
sociated with the estimate of slow-moving items and 
expected value of the reusable raw materials, as well 
as calculations of elimination of internal gain. given 
the level of significant management judgements and 
estimates, inventory valuation was a matter of most 
significance in our audit. additional details on the 
valuation of inventories are provided in section 3.5 
of the consolidated financial statements and in sec-
tion 3.4 of the parent company financial statements, 
to which we refer.
our procedures in relation to inventory valuation 
included assessing the group’s processes related 
to inventory valuation including on a sample basis 
testing of direct costs related to raw materials, 
labour costs and attributable overhead costs 
incurred in the manufacturing process, recording of 
write-downs and understanding of the process for 
internal gain elimination. we challenged the basis 
for write-downs and performed analytical proce-
dures to assess slow-moving items. we assessed the 
key assumptions applied by management regarding 
items life-cycle status and expected value of the 
reusable raw materials based on our knowledge of 
the business, including initiatives under programme 
now and on a sample basis tested the supporting 
documentation. further, on a sample basis we test-
ed the calculation of elimination of internal gain at 
group level. furthermore, we evaluated the disclo-
sures provided by management in the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company finan-
cial statements to applicable accounting standards.

consideration of the matter in the audit

financial statements
in preparing the financial statements, management is respon-
sible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going con-
cern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements 
unless management either intends to liquidate the group or 
the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a mate-
rial misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also:
 • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a ma-
terial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of 
internal control. 
 •  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropri-
ate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of express-
ing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the 
parent company’s internal control. 
 •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management. 
 • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the finan-
cial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related dis-
closures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. however, future events or conditions may cause the 
group and the parent company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
 • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of 
the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair 
view.  
 •  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. we are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regard-
ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a state-
ment that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all re-
lationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with gov-
ernance, we determine those matters that were of most signifi-
cance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation pre-
cludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequenc-
es of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and parent company financial statements of pandora a/s we 
performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the 
annual report of pandora a/s for the financial year 1 january to 
31 december 2020 with the file name pand-2020-12-31.zip  
is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the

commission delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the euro-
pean single electronic format (esef regulation) which includes 
requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in 
xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements.
 
management is responsible for preparing an annual report that 
complies with the esef regulation. this responsibility includes:
 • the preparing of the annual report in xhtml format; 
 • the selection and application of appropriate ixbrl tags, 
including extensions to the esef taxonomy and the anchoring 
thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for financial information 
required to be tagged using judgement where necessary; 
 • ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged data and the 
consolidated financial statements presented in human read-
able format; and 
 • for such internal control as management determines nec-
essary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is 
compliant with the esef regulation. 
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on wheth-
er the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation based on the evidence we 
have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. 
the nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material departures from the requirements set out in 
the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or error. the proce-
dures include:
 • testing whether the annual report is prepared in xhtml 
format; 
 • obtaining an understanding of the company’s ixbrl tagging 
process and of internal control over the tagging process; 
 • evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tagging of the  
consolidated financial statements; 
 • evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of ixbrl 
elements selected from the esef taxonomy and the creation 
of extension elements where no suitable element in the esef 
taxonomy has been identified; 
 • evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to 
elements in the esef taxonomy; and 
 • reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the audited consoli-
dated financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of pandora a/s for the 
financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 with the file 
name pand-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material re-
spects, in compliance with the esef regulation.
