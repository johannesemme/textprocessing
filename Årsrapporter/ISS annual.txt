letter to our stakeholders
at iss we want to make a difference 
to the success of our customers and 
the lives of our employees. in 2020, 
that difference was made abundantly 
clear during the global pandemic 
– and our key role as a partner in 
connecting people and places to 
make the world work better will 
continue to be central in the post-
covid recovery.
along	with	the	entire	world,	iss	was	affected	
by the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
during this challenging year, our focus was 
squarely on business continuity for customers 
and the health and wellbeing of their employees 
and our own. with our own people at customer 
facilities – trained, equipped, motivated and 
working to high standards – we have been able 
to	offer	customers	a	unique	level	of	transpar-
ency and agility in responding to the crisis. our 
customers have been overwhelmingly positive 
about our response to the covid-19 crisis, which 
has showcased the strength of our self-delivery 
model as well as large outsourcing partner-
ships with a single point of contact for facility 
management. 
making the world work better
as a global leader in facility services and 
workplace management, we play a key role in 
society. when the pandemic radically changed 
our ways of working, our people – cleaners, 
technicians, chefs and other service profes-
sionals	–	contributed	significantly	to	keeping	
workplaces and essential infrastructure running, 
including hospitals, pharmaceutical production 
facilities, and data centres. the societal impact 
of iss frontline colleagues every day is central to 
our value proposition to customers. 
in 2020, we addressed the full range of customer 
needs around the workplace during the pandem-
ic. with our back to work concept, we provided 
a complete set of solutions for protecting the 
workplace against infection, redesigning places to 
meet social distancing requirements and helping 
customers scale up or scale down their on-site ac-
tivities. focus on cleaning and hygiene increased 
significantly	among	customers.	to	meet	this	de-
mand, we introduced pure space, an iss product 
that leverages technology and data to evidence 
cleanliness, troubleshoot the risk of contamination 
and	influence	the	right	behaviour.	above-base	and	
project work revenue on key accounts increased 
organically by 11% and 14%, respectively, driven 
by deep-cleaning and disinfection.
strategic focus  
on key accounts confirmed
in 2020, our retention rate for key accounts 
was	93%.	our	long-term,	mutually	beneficial	
partnerships with key account customers are

the covid-19 pandemic has underscored the key 
role we play in society, connecting people and places 
to make the world work better. as the pandemic 
diminishes, businesses across the world are already 
rethinking the role of the future workplace and 
work culture. as their strategic partner, we’ll be right 
beside them, helping to shape the workplace of 
tomorrow to meet their strategic goals.

particularly resilient in tough times. organic 
growth for key accounts was (4.3)% vs. (10.8)% 
for non-key accounts. in 2020, we won a new 
5-year integrated facility services (ifs) contract 
with a large international industry and manu-
facturing customer corresponding to approx. 
1% of group revenue. we also won, expanded 
and renewed contracts with major players in 
banking & professional services, healthcare, and 
transportation & infrastructure.
it is with these key account customers that our 
value proposition resonates most strongly. facility 
management and workplace services, including 
globally leading cleaning solutions, have become 
more important to customers’ strategic agendas. 
long-term key account partnerships are more 
likely to be built around ifs and a mutual aim to 
attain	excellence	through	quality,	efficiency	and	
compliance. that results in greater value for every-
one – our customers, our people, our investors 
and society at large. 
sharpening our focus with oneiss
in	response	to	an	unsatisfactory	financial	
performance in recent years, we launched a 
strategy refresh in december 2020. the oneiss 
strategy	confirms	our	key	account	focus	and	ifs	
business model while sharpening our approach 
to select customer segments, accelerating 
technology investments, and introducing a 
new globally aligned operating model. these 
changes will allow us to use our global scale to 
drive superior value for all our stakeholders. in 
the process, we will become the most respected 
global leader in integrated facility services and 
strengthen our position as global number one 
in cleaning. 
executive group management (egm) saw signif-
icant change as well. we said goodbye to group 
ceo	jeff	gravenhorst	at	the	end	of	august	2020	
after 18 years in the business. on behalf of iss, 
we want to extend once more our special thanks 
to	jeff	for	his	lasting	achievements	–	he	has	built	
the foundation upon which our new strategy will 
launch us into the future. a new strengthened 
egm was announced in december to deliver 
on the oneiss strategy and transformation. 
the team comprises a strong mix of seasoned 
internal talent and external additions with 
diverse backgrounds, broad expertise and new 
capabilities, and will ensure we deliver on the 
goals and ambitions of our oneiss strategy. 
our financial performance
with the dual impact of coronavirus and malware 
attack, 2020 was a year without precedent in 
terms	of	financial	performance.	full-year	organic	
growth was (6.5)% and 2020 was thereby only 
the second year in our 119-year long history 
with negative growth. the loss of revenue was 
driven	by	lockdowns	and	significant	restrictions	
in all major markets, particularly impacting our 
food services. adjusted for restructuring and 
one-off	costs	of	dkk	3.5	billion,	our	operating	
margin came in at 0.5%, in line with our latest 
financial	outlook.	restructurings	were	part	of	
our response to the pandemic along with certain 
actions targeting our operational challenges to 
prepare the business for the future. free cash 
flow	was	dkk	(1,794)	million	impacted	by	our	
operating losses but supported by strong focus 
on collections and strict investment discipline. 
in	spite	of	an	exceptionally	difficult	year,	we	have	
laid	the	groundwork	for	a	stronger	financial	
performance in the future, including through 
our oneiss strategy, which will ensure we 
strengthen our execution. 
the post-covid global ifs leader 
with the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 
workplaces, partnership with a strong, integrat-
ed facility management provider has become 
more important than ever before. our role in 
these partnerships is not just to deliver world-
class services but to serve as a key strategic 
adviser to customers in how to bring their real 
estate strategies and workplace cultures to life. 
as we move towards a post-covid world – hope-
fully taking big strides in that direction in 2021 
– this strategic relationship will only increase in 
importance. the role of the workplace in attract-
ing and retaining talent will only increase, but now 
the concept of where we work has broadened. 
according to our workplace study, up to 65% 
of participants are expected to follow a partially 
hybrid remote model post-pandemic. customers 
are grappling with how to bring employees back 
into the workplace while also establishing new 
ways of working that seamlessly connect e.g. 
corporate	offices	with	the	home	base	to	ensure	
people are healthy, happy, and engaged. 
technology will play a key role in our ability to 
bring the workplace into the post-covid era. 
our ambition is to become the world’s best, 
tech-enabled facility services company. we are 
therefore increasing investment in our digital 
capabilities and it architecture while accelerat-
ing roll-out of customer-facing tools. improved 
collection and use of data and insights from 
across the globe will drive better-quality 
outcomes for customers, which includes 
providing them with even more value from the 
integration of our services.
with continued strong demand for integrated 
facility services – in particular cleaning – in-
creased focus on the workplace as a driver 
of corporate culture and collaboration, and 
ongoing needs to reduce costs, the market for 
outsourcing will grow in the years ahead. we are 
well-positioned in an attractive usd 400 billion 
key account market, where our modest market 
share of 2% leaves plenty of room for growth. 
in 2021, iss is in a unique position to further 
bring to life our purpose – connecting people 
and places to make the world work better – and 
continue to strengthen our role and responsi-
bility in society, for the duration of this global 
pandemic and far beyond.
thank you for your continued support.
yours faithfully,

side, we come to understand every aspect

nities when they arise. we see it as our job to

industry leadership
iss is a leading, global provider of workplace 
and facility service solutions in a growing and 
attractive market with continued strong demand 
for ifs, in particular cleaning, and increased 
focus on the workplace as a driver of corporate 
culture post covid. 
our leadership position has been established over 
more than a century. we serve our customers 
across the globe in locations that account for the 
vast majority of the world’s gdp. this leadership 
position has allowed us to win some of the largest 
workplace and facility management contracts. 
both private and public sector organisations 
outsource these services to us because we bring 
insight, scale and excellence – driving intelligent 
solutions,	greater	efficiency	and	allowing	them	to	
focus on their own purpose.
oneiss  
– stronger, simpler, closer
oneiss was launched in december 2020, follow-
ing	an	extensive	business	review,	which	confirmed	
that the key account strategy and the ifs business 
model remained both attractive and sustainable. 
execution has however not been satisfactory in 
recent years. in response, we are sharpening our 
focus even further on key segments, accelerating 
technology investments, and introducing a new 
globally aligned operating model.
the key changes to the operating model are 
alignment of country structures and a newly 
established operations performance function 
to enhance delivery to customers. further a 
significant	strengthening	of	the	commercial	
organisation will bring both customer expertise 
as well as innovation in a tightened bid and 
transition risk management process.

oneiss will create longer term structural 
improvements and is outlining a clear recovery 
path	back	to	a	healthy	and	profitable	business	
by the end of 2022. 
this is articulated by our new turnaround 
targets – replacing our previous medium-term 
targets – created to focus on a fast recovery 
of	the	business	with	improved	profitability	and	
positive	free	cash	flow.	
near-term priorities supporting the achievement 
of the turnaround targets are:
1
restructuring of certain countries and 
business units in the wake of covid-19 
2
 gradual recovery of lost revenue due to 
covid-19; and 
3
	improvements	of	specific	underperforming	
contracts and countries.
furthermore, to fund the investments to 
improve our operating model, we are initiating 
a cost savings programme with a savings target 
of dkk 150 million to materialise gradually from 
2021 to 2023. the initiatives mainly relate to 
centralisation of costs and optimisation of the 
leased real estate portfolio.
following the completion of the turnaround 
journey	by	the	end	of	2022,	iss	will	be	profitable	
and operating at a healthy leverage ratio, 
thereby poised to embark on an even more 
ambitious agenda towards 2025 and create 
value for customers, colleagues, society and 
shareholders. 
new	specific	medium-term	targets	will	be	
announced when iss has successfully delivered 
measurable progress on the turnaround. 
dividend payments will not be reinstated before 
the leverage target has been achieved.

outlook
outlook 2021
on 16 december 2020, we launched our 
refreshed strategy, oneiss, and our preliminary 
outlook 2021. based on the development since 
the launch, including the ongoing recovery of 
our	four	key	operational	challenges	(specific	
underperforming contracts and countries), the 
preliminary	guidance	is	confirmed.
global	uncertainties	remain	significant	as	
governments across the globe continue to 
either ease or tighten workplace restrictions 
and	lockdowns	in	the	fight	against	covid-19.	
consequently, activity levels within our core 
services continue to be impacted. the outlook 
is consequently communicated in open-ended 
ranges	reflecting	the	elevated	uncertainty.
organic growth is expected to be positive 
(2020: (6.5)%) but with high uncertainty related 
to the impact from covid-19. revenue in q1 
2021,	is	expected	to	be	significantly	impacted	
by restrictions and lockdowns, leading to 
negative growth in line with h2 2020. we expect 
to gradually recover part of our lost covid-19 
revenue over some years starting from q2 2021. 
as	part	of	the	covid-19	restructuring	efforts,	iss	
has trimmed the customer portfolio, which is 
expected to negatively impact organic growth by 
around 1%-point.
operating margin is expected to be above 2% 
(2020: (4.6)%). the main drivers of the improve-
ment	are	a	significant	reduction	in	restructuring	
and	one-off	costs,	the	ongoing	recovery	of	
the underperforming contracts and countries 
(our	key	operational	challenges)	and,	finally,	
improved operational results on the back of the 
restructurings initiated in 2020 in response to 
covid-19.
free cash flow is expected to be slightly 
positive (2020: dkk (1.8) billion) despite material 
cash payments related to restructuring costs 
recognised in 2020. the factoring level is expect-
ed to increase slightly related to the launch of 
the ifs contract with the large customer across 
americas in early 2021. the factoring level is still 
expected to end at a level lower than the level 
realised by the end of 2019.
expected revenue impact from 
divestments, acquisitions and 
foreign exchange rates in 2021 
we expect the divestments and acquisitions 
completed by 14 february 2021 (including in 
2020) to have a negative impact on revenue 
growth in 2021 of approximately 0-1%-point. in 
the absence of acquisitions, the negative reve-
nue impact is likely to increase slightly during the 
year as we execute on the strategic divestment 
programme. countries to be divested continue 
to be reported as discontinued operations and 
will not impact revenue growth upon divestment.

growth,	operating	margin	and	free	cash	flow,	
2020 ended as shown in the table to the 
right compared to the outlook announced in 
connection with the annual report 2019 and 
subsequent updates.
the spread of covid-19 in early 2020 and 
resulting elevated global uncertainties led to 
withdrawal of our initial outlook on 20 march 
2020. the escalation of covid-19 coincided with 
a serious malware attack on iss, making the 
initial management of the pandemic and its 
implications particularly challenging. an updated 
outlook was reinstated in connection with the 
h1	interim	report	2020,	which	was	confirmed	
with the q3 trading update and again with the 
announcement on 16 december 2020 of the 
refreshed strategy, oneiss.

agnes adamer started working as a 
part-time recruiter at iss austria while 
studying. taking full advantage of iss’s 
long-term career opportunities, agnes 
participated in a variety of iss’s formal 
learning and development programmes. 
eight years, one mentorship programme, 
a	key	account	manager	certification	and	
an internal talent programme later, she 
is the site manager at one of the largest 
hospitals in europe, where she leads a 
450-person team and is a key part of the 
patient journey.
a multi-cultural team
as site manager at a key account, agnes 
adamer is responsible for all iss services 
at the hospital, from cleaning wards and 
windows to making up beds and serving 
food to patients. she coordinates with 
the customer to establish exactly what is 
needed and then works with her team to 
ensure those needs are met. those needs 
often go well beyond cleaning, with iss 
team	members	helping	visitors	find	their	
way or translating between doctor and 
patient, if language issues occur.
“the hospital has patients from across 
austria and abroad – and some patients 
don’t understand the language or health 
system very well,” explains agnes. “our 
team is multi-cultural, so we speak many 
languages. that is why we are often asked 
to step in to help.”
“i just love the fact that iss is a big multi-
national company that feels like a family. 
my team members come from all over the 
world, but we all support each other, and we 
are all here for the good of the patients. it is 
a great feeling to be part of that.”
the ultimate ‘thank you’ note
agnes and her team are guardians of the 
health	and	safety	of	patients	and	staff	
– work that is essential for hygiene and 
cleanliness in the hospital.
when the hospital receives a ‘thank you’ 
note from a patient, they often mention 
the nice man or woman who brought their 
food or cleaned their room. reading this 
is a fantastic feeling, and i make sure to 
share it with the team,” says agnes. “in the 
light of the covid-19 situation, patients are 
increasingly grateful for the work we do. 
they	understand	the	difference	it	makes	to	
their safety and recovery – and i am proud 
that my team is able to deliver it.”
“we are all here for the good

organic growth bridge
operating margin bridge
group 
performance
2020 proved to be one of the 
most challenging years in the 
119-year history of iss.
our financial performance was 
severely impacted by external 
events in the form of the global 
covid-19 pandemic and the it 
security incident in february, but 
also by significant operational 
challenges in four countries.
in response, we initiated certain 
actions in the late part of the 
year leading to significant 
restructuring and one-off costs 
to position us for a profitable 
post-covid recovery as it comes 
through.
operating results
group revenue for 2020 was dkk 69.8 billion, a 
decrease of 10.1% compared with 2019. organic 
growth	was	(6.5)%,	currency	effects	were	(1.8)%	
and divestments and acquisitions, net reduced 
revenue by 1.8%.
organic growth was negatively impacted by 
covid-19 from the second half of march 2020 
due to lockdowns and other measures to 
contain the pandemic. additionally, the expiry 
of the novartis contract on 31 december 2019 
reduced	group	revenue	significantly,	though	
partly	offset	by	growth	from	the	launch	of	
deutsche telekom on 1 july 2019.
our key accounts showed some resilience with 
organic growth of (4.3)% vs. organic growth 
of (10.8)% for non-key accounts. projects and 
above-base work grew organically by 9.9%, 
driven by strong demand for deep-cleaning and 
disinfection. 
the scale of the decline in revenue, has varied 
across service type, customer segment and 
geography.	the	services	suffering	most	from	
reduced demand due to covid-19 were those 
depending on our customers’ employees being 
on site. consequently, revenue from food ser-
vices decreased 34% in 2020 to account for 11% 
of group revenue (2019: 15%). all other services 
were less impacted.
in terms of customer segments, the most 
significant	impact	was	within	hotels,	leisure	&	
entertainment, and aviation (part of the trans-
portation segment) with a combined revenue 
reduction of 25% in 2020 to account for 9% of 
group revenue (2019: 11%).
all regions reported negative organic growth in 
2020	due	to	covid-19,	though	with	significant	vari-
ations from region to region, largely depending on 
service mix and exposure to industry segments. 
americas was most severely impacted with 
organic growth of (19)% due to the food services 
business and large customers within aviation 
(within the transportation & infrastructure 
segment). northern europe was also relatively 
hard hit with organic growth of (8)% mainly due to 
food services in denmark and norway and addi-
tionally due to hotels in norway. the uk was also 
significantly	impacted	due	to	these	services	and	
segments as well as across the private sector and 
in hospitals due to reductions in retail sales. con-
tinental	europe	and	asia	&	pacific	were	both	less	
impacted with organic growth of (3)%, however, 
with large variations between countries within the 
regions. in continental europe, especially france, 
belgium and spain were negatively impacted 
and reported double digit negative growth rates, 
which	was	also	the	case	for	india	in	asia	&	pacific.
operating profit before other items was dkk 
(3,226) million in 2020 for an operating margin of 
(4.6)%	(2019:	4.2%).	the	significant	decrease	com-
pared to last year was largely due to restructuring 
and	one-off	costs	of	dkk	3.5	billion.	adjusted	for	
these, operating margin was around 0.5%.
where	customer	activity	has	been	significantly	
reduced or stopped and demand for our ser-
vices has been impacted, we have been forced 
to	react	to	protect	our	financial	health.	we	have	
made use of various government furlough 
schemes where possible, but unfortunately, we 
have also had to permanently let employees go 
which	was	the	driver	of	a	significant	part	of	the	
decrease in number of employees in 2020.

1) before other items. 
operating	margin	decreased	significantly	due	
to covid-19-related revenue reductions, though 
with	significant	variations	from	region	to	region	
depending on service mix, exposure to industry 
segments,	and	differences	in	the	level	of	support	
schemes	offered	by	individual	governments.	as	
such, we received employee-related covid-19 
grants of dkk 1.3 billion. depending on the 
specific	commercial	model,	our	customers	were	
appropriately and accordingly compensated.
in northern europe, the most severe impacts 
were seen in the uk and denmark, which were 
both severely impacted by covid-19-related 
revenue reductions, e.g. within food services. in 
continental	europe,	spain	was	materially	affected	
due to limited availability of government support 
schemes. americas reported a sharp decline 
in margins, mainly due to food services and in 
asia	&	pacific,	indonesia	was	negatively	affected	
following complete lockdown in large periods.
in addition, operating margin was impacted 
by	significant	operational	challenges	in	four	
countries. in germany, on the deutsche telekom 
contract,	significant	delay	of	the	it	migration	as	
well as operational challenges led to a material 
cost overrun. in denmark, the danish defence 
contract has been operating at a loss-making 
level in 2020. additionally, in the uk and france 
operational challenges continued. in france, 
the	benefits	from	the	ongoing	reorganisation	
was further delayed due to the impact from 
covid-19. these challenges are being addressed 
through	action	plans	and	as	a	result	significant	
restructuring	and	one-off	costs	have	been	
incurred in 2020 as explained below.
corporate costs amounted to 1.3% of revenue 
(2019:	0.8%)	impacted	by	certain	one-off	costs	
mainly related to management changes, the 
strategy refresh and increased it costs. 
restructuring and one-off costs we are 
continuously reviewing our business platform 
to ensure the right basis for execution of our 
strategy.	in	response	to	the	significant	impact	
from covid-19 and our four key operational chal-
lenges, certain actions and restructurings were 
initiated, which resulted in restructuring and 
one-off	costs	of	around	dkk	3.5	billion	in	2020.
restructurings were initiated in a number of 
countries to adjust our cost structure to the 
lower activity level following covid-19. the 
initiatives include contract exits, termination of 
redundant employees and various reductions of 
overhead costs, mainly in countries, services and 
customer segments that were heavily impacted 
by covid-19. in 2020, restructuring costs 
amounted to dkk 1.2 billion (2019: dkk 0.3 
billion) and related predominantly to germany, 
france, spain, and the uk.
in	addition,	one-off	costs	of	dkk	2.3	billion	were	
incurred predominantly in germany, the uk 
and denmark. due to operational challenges 
related to certain contracts in these countries 
we reassessed the value of capitalised transition 
costs and recognised write-downs amounting 
to approximately dkk 600 million. further, we 
recognised	one-off	costs	amounting	to	dkk	1.7	
billion covering other contract-related risks and 
claims primarily in germany, the uk and den-
mark. these included a provision for an onerous 
contract	in	denmark	and	one-off	costs	following	
the detailed review of the business platform in the 
uk	on	the	back	of	risks	identified	in	2019,	which	
led to changes in the management structure in 
the uk as already communicated at h1 2020.

other income and expenses, net was an 
expense of dkk 983 million (2019: net expense 
of dkk 91 million), predominantly due to 
incremental costs related to the it security 
incident in february, as also communicated in 
detail throughout the year. total costs were dkk 
887 million, including a non-cash write-down of 
dkk 365 million. 
we have regained control of our it infrastruc-
ture and relaunched business critical systems. 
rebuild of certain it assets will continue into 
2021	and	will	lead	to	a	significantly	stronger	and	
more secure platform going forward. generally, 
we will accelerate our it investments in the 
coming years as a key element of our oneiss 
strategy.
goodwill impairment was dkk 432 million 
(2019: dkk 304 million) of which dkk 400 
million related to an impairment loss in france 
identified	in	the	impairment	test	performed	
at 30 june 2020. the loss was due to a reas-
sessment of business plans following covid-19 
leading to lowered expectations for the future. 
the remaining impairment loss of dkk 32 
million was related to the divestment of parking 
management in indonesia and healthcare 
catering in poland.
operating profit was dkk (4,730) million (2019: 
dkk 2,522 million). the decrease was mainly due 
to	restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	it	security	inci-
dent costs and the adverse impact from covid-19.
financial income and expenses, net was 
an expense of dkk 542 million (2019: dkk 703 
million). the decrease was mainly a result of 
lower costs related to intercompany hedging, 
driven by the decrease in usd interest rates.
the effective tax rate for 2020 was 0.8% 
(2019: 36.6%) calculated as income tax of 
dkk	(41)	million	divided	by	profit	before	tax	of	
dkk	(5,272)	million.	the	effective	tax	rate	was	
negatively	impacted	by	significant	valuation	
allowances on deferred tax assets in germany, 
france, spain and the netherlands. further-
more, non-tax deductible costs had an impact 
on	the	effective	tax	rate	due	to	the	negative	
profit	before	tax.
net profit from discontinued operations was 
dkk 36 million (2019: dkk 218 million), including 
a net gain of dkk 339 million on countries divest-
ed in 2020, consisting of thailand (gain of dkk 
394 million) and brazil (loss of dkk 55 million) 
whereas the divestment of malaysia was neutral. 
this	was	partly	offset	by	negative	fair	value	
remeasurements of dkk 294 million on countries 
being	classified	as	discontinued	operations	
and held for sale at 31 december 2020, mainly 
portugal, taiwan, and russia.
net profit was dkk (5,195) million (2019: dkk 
1,371 million), primarily due to the covid-19 
impact,	restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	it	
security incident costs and goodwill impairment 
in france.

key account development
key account revenue was 67% of group revenue 
in 2020 (2019: 63%), and generated organic 
growth of (4.3)%, which was slightly better than 
the group’s organic growth. as such, the de-
mand from key accounts showed some resilience 
despite the covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns.
growth was supported by the launch of the 
deutsche telekom contract in july 2019, partly 
offset	by	the	expiry	of	the	novartis	contract	on	
31 december 2019. the net impact was around 
0.1%-point on group organic growth in 2020. 
furthermore, we experienced strong key account 
growth in a number of countries, especially 
turkey, australia and italy. these positives were 
offset	by	the	negative	impact	from	covid-19.
in 2020, the general bidding environment 
slowed down materially across the globe as a 
result	of	covid-19,	also	reflected	in	the	low	level	
of new wins. however, we managed to maintain 
a high key account retention rate of 93%. in the 
late part of 2020, we did see signs of the bidding 
activity slowly picking up again. despite the 
slow-down,	a	number	of	significant	key	account	
contracts were secured in 2020. we signed a 
five-year	ifs	contract	with	a	large	international	
manufacturing customer across the americas 
corresponding to approximately 1% of group 
revenue with a gradual start-up from q1 2021. 
in turkey, we signed three new key account 
contracts. additionally, we signed a seven-year 
contract	with	a	hospital	in	the	uk	and	a	five-year	
contract with iberdrola in spain.
furthermore, a large number of contracts were 
extended and expanded, see overview to the right, 
the	most	significant	being	a	five-year	extension	
of	a	financial	services	customer	in	the	business	
services & it segment across 14 countries and a 
one-year extension until end of 2022 with a global 
key account customer in the business services & 
it segment. 
contract maturity 
the majority of our customer contracts have an 
initial	term	of	three	to	five	years.	a	significant	
share of our revenue is therefore up for renewal 
every year. to mitigate this inherent risk, we 
have a strong focus on customer satisfaction 
and proactively work with our customers to 
seek renewals in advance of expiry. in 2020, 
despite covid-19-related revenue reductions, 
our retention rate was maintained at 91% (2019: 
91%) and 93% for key accounts (2019: 94%), 
both negatively impacted by 1%-point due to the 
expiry of the novartis contract.
in 2020, large key accounts (annual revenue 
above dkk 200 million) generated revenue of dkk 
20.5 billion, or 29.4% of group revenue. going 
into 2021, no large key accounts have been lost 
but customer contracts representing annual reve-
nue of dkk 2.8 billion (4.0% of group revenue) are 
up for renewal in 2021, see chart above.

our performance
free cash flow bridge
cash generation  
and free cash flow
our ability to manage the capital intensity 
required to operate, grow and improve our 
business is paramount and driving strong cash 
flows	remains	a	key	priority	for	iss.
in 2020, we generated nominal free cash flow 
of dkk (1,794) million (2019: dkk 366 million), 
which was highly impacted by covid-19-related 
impacts on operating performance, our four key 
operational challenges, the it security incident, 
restructuring	and	one-off	costs.	this	was	partly	
offset	by	positive	changes	in	working	capital	and	
provisions as well as reduced investment spend 
due to strict capital discipline.
despite the unprecedented challenging environ-
ment we faced in 2020, our priority throughout 
the year has been on maintaining a tight control 
of	our	cash	flows.	
during	the	year,	various	governments	offered	
support schemes to strengthen liquidity 
available to businesses, e.g. possibility to 
postpone payment of vat and social charges. at 
30 june 2020, such postponements amounted 
to approximately dkk 1.7 billion. however, at 
31 december 2020 we have fully repaid such 
support.
cash flow from operating activities was 
dkk (361) million (2019: dkk 2,064 million). the 
decrease was mainly due to covid-19-related 
impacts on operating performance, our four key 
operational challenges and payment of incre-
mental costs related to the it security incident. 
this	was	partly	offset	by	positive	changes	in	
working capital and provisions.
the positive changes in working capital was due 
to strong focus on collections and the general 
reduction in activity caused by covid-19. further, 
we	saw	a	significant	reduction	in	other	receiv-
ables, mainly due to write-down of transition 
costs relating to certain contracts in gernamy, 
denmark and the uk. utilisation of factoring 
was reduced from dkk 1.4 billion in 2019 to dkk 
1.0 billion in 2020 as a result of the covid-19- 
related revenue reductions and the expiry of the 
novartis contract on 31 december 2019. 
this	was	partly	offset	by	a	reduction	in	payables,	
including employee-related payables, resulting 
from covid-19. additionally, we saw an increase 
in the share of self-delivered services in 2020 
leading to reduced subcontractor payables. 
furthermore, in some countries statutory 
requirements on payment terms led to a slight 
acceleration of payments.
the positive changes in provisions related to the 
significant	restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	as	
only a minor part was paid in 2020.
income tax paid was dkk 666 million (2019: 
dkk 513 million) mainly resulting from payment 
on	account	for	2020,	and	final	payments	related	
to 2019 and tax audits in a few countries. 
2019	was	positively	impacted	by	significant	tax	
refunds.
cash flow from investing activities was a net 
outflow	of	dkk	326	million	(2019:	net	outflow	
of dkk 530 million). investments in intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment, net, of 
dkk 681 million (2019: dkk 1,095 million), repre-
sented 1.0% (2019: 1.4%) of total revenue (includ-
ing discontinued operations). the reduction was 
a result of strict investment discipline to manage 
cash	flows	during	the	covid-19	pandemic	as	well	
as increased investment levels in 2019 due to 
start-up of the deutsche telekom contract. 
cash	flow	from	divestment	of	activities	was	an	
inflow	of	dkk	505	million,	most	significantly	
related to the divestment of our business in 
thailand.
cash flow from financing activities was a net 
inflow	of	dkk	1,103	million	(2019:	outflow	of	dkk	
5,871 million). proceeds from the issuance of the 
5-year emtn bonds for a principal amount of 
eur 500 million amounted to dkk 3,694 million, 
which – together with cash proceeds – were 
used to early repay the eur 300 million emtn 
bonds maturing january 2021 amounting to dkk 
2,234 million. 
repayment of lease liabilities was dkk 1,019 
million (2019: dkk 1,080 million).

our performance
capital structure
it is, and remains, our primary capital allocation 
priority to ensure that we maintain a strong and 
efficient	balance	sheet	and	that	our	liquidity	
position supports our operational needs and 
our continued strategy execution, even in times 
of turmoil. 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, strong 
focus on our liquidity position was necessary 
throughout 2020. total readily available liquidity 
at 31 december 2020 was dkk 14 billion sup-
ported by additional credit facilities of eur 700 
million maturing 31 march 2022 secured from a 
club	of	five	banks	earlier	in	the	year.	the	facility	
remained undrawn at 31 december 2020.
additionally, on 30 june 2020, iss finance b.v., 
a wholly owned subsidiary of iss global a/s, 
successfully issued a 5-year emtn bond for a 
principal	amount	of	eur	500	million	with	a	fixed	
rate coupon of 1.250%. the net proceeds were 
used for the early repayment in november of 
eur 300 million emtns maturing in january 
2021 and to further strengthen the group’s 
liquidity position.
we have no unaddressed material debt matur-
ities until 2024 onwards. in addition, we have no 
financial	covenants	in	our	capital	structure.
we are committed to our financial policy of 
maintaining	an	investment	grade	profile	and	iss	
currently holds corporate credit ratings of bbb-/ 
negative outlook assigned by s&p and baa3/ 
stable outlook assigned by moody’s. our finan-
cial	policy	financial	leverage	target	of	below	2.8x	
pro forma adjusted ebitda, taking seasonality 
into account is calculated for the entire group, 
i.e. including discontinued operations. 
at	31	december	2020,	the	financial	leverage	was	
(11.5)x (2019: 3.0x) due to a negative reported 
ebitda.	excluding	restructuring	and	one-off	
costs, leverage at 31 december 2020 was 7.3x. 
net debt increased from dkk 14.7 billion at 
31 december 2019 to dkk 15.8 billion at 31 
december	2020.	leverage	was	significantly	
impacted by lower operating performance and 
lower	ebitda	due	to	the	significant	adverse	
impact from covid-19. 
while leverage is expected to peak in 2020, it is 
expected	to	reduce	significantly	during	2021	and	
2022 as operating performance and free cash 
flow	is	expected	to	gradually	improve.	as	such,	we	
have set a turnaround target of deleveraging to 
below 3.0x to be achieved by 31 december 2022. 
based on our ordinary dividend policy targeting 
a pay-out ratio of approximately 50% of net 
profit	(adjusted),	the	board	of	directors	will	
not propose a dividend for 2020 at the annual 
general meeting on 13 april 2021. no dividend 
payment or share buyback will be made in 2021 
and 2022 as the leverage target is not expected 
to be met until by the end of 2022.
statement of financial position
at	31	december	2020,	our	statement	of	financial	
position	was	significantly	impacted	by	covid-19,	
the it security incident, our four key operational 
challenges and the actions initiated to position 
us for recovery in the future.
total assets amounted to dkk 43,605 million at 
31 december 2020 (2019: 50,061 million), a reduc-
tion of dkk 6,456 million compared to last year.
intangible assets of dkk 22,518 million 
decreased dkk 2,047 million mainly due to 
the reassessment of business plans in france 
following covid-19 leading to an impairment 
loss of dkk 400 million. in addition, the it 
security incident led to damage to certain 
software and a write-down of dkk 365 million. 
finally, our divestment programme contributed 
to the decrease as fair value remeasurement 
of	businesses	classified	as	held	for	sale	led	to	
impairment losses of dkk 307 million.
property, plant and equipment and leases 
amounted to dkk 3,546 million or a decrease 
of dkk 926 million due to strict investment 
discipline across the group to manage our cash 
flows	during	the	covid-19	pandemic.
trade receivables was dkk 9,861million, down 
dkk 2,224 million from last year. the main driver 
was covid-19-related revenue reductions as well 
as strong focus on collections to ensure tight 
control	of	our	cash	flows.
other receivables of dkk 1,567 million decreased 
dkk 1,536 million, the main driver being write-
down of capitalised transition costs relating to 
certain contracts in germany, denmark and the uk 
amounting to approximately dkk 600 million. in 
addition, in the uk, we saw a reduction in certain 
receivables following changed systems. finally, low-
er activity levels as a result of covid-19 led to lower 
receivable rebates and prepayments to suppliers. 
equity at 31 december 2020, equity was dkk 
6,545 million, equivalent to an equity ratio of 
15.0% (2019: 25.1%). the decrease of dkk 6,002 
million	was	mainly	a	result	of	net	profit	of	dkk	
(5,195) million and negative currency adjust-
ments of dkk 750 million relating to investments 
in foreign subsidiaries, mainly the usa, the uk, 
turkey and singapore.
total liabilities amounted to dkk 37,060 
million, which was in line with last year.
provisions of dkk 1,926 million increased dkk 
1,360 million primarily due to restructurings 
initiated following covid-19 of dkk 1,174 million 
of which dkk 787 million were unpaid at 31 
december 2020. furthermore, a loss related 
to the onerous contract with danish defence 
in denmark was recognised and an additional 
amount was provided in relation to the onerous 
contract in hong kong. finally, costs were 
recognised for contract-related risks and claims 
in germany, denmark and the uk.
loans and borrowings amounted to dkk 
18,643, an increase of dkk 1,138 million 
mainly	due	to	the	net	effect	of	issuing	eur	500	
million emtn bonds maturing in 2025 and the 
early redemption of eur 300 million of bonds 
maturing in 2021. 
trade and other payables and other liabil-
ities was dkk 12,982 million or a decrease of 
dkk 2,677 million. the main driver was covid-19 
leading to a decrease in activities and employees

strategic divestment 
programme
we have been on a journey to sharpen our stra-
tegic focus since 2018, when we announced our 
intention to divest 15 countries and a number 
of business units. in december 2020, additional 
three countries and several business units were 
added to the divestment programme following 
the announced strategy refresh.
our	divestment	activities	in	2020	were	signifi-
cantly	impacted	by	covid-19,	which	effectively	
put most negotiations on hold in q2. however, 
in the second half of the year, negotiations were 
reinitiated, which led to the divestment of brazil, 
malaysia and thailand. as such, by the end of 
2020 we had divested seven countries out of 
the total 18 countries to be divested. further-
more, in november we reached an agreement 
to divest slovenia with expected completion in 
q1 2021.
in terms of business units, we divested some 
minor non-core activities in 2020 in austria, 
singapore, poland, bulgaria and sri lanka as 
well as the parking management business in 
indonesia,	which	was	classified	as	held	for	sale	
at 31 december 2019.
the combined net consideration received since 
the initiation of the divestment programme 
was dkk 1,452 million (approximately 65% of 
the expected total) – consisting of net cash 
proceeds of dkk 1,196 million and loans and 
borrowings of dkk 256 million divested as part 
of the transactions. the remaining combined 
net proceeds from the divestment programme 
(including countries and businesses added in 
2020) are expected to be up to dkk 2 billion. 
at 31 december 2020, 14 businesses (2019: 
13	businesses)	were	classified	as	held	for	sale	
comprising 11 countries and three business 
units; one business in continental europe, one 
business	in	asia	&	pacific	and	one	business	in	
americas. assets and liabilities held for sale 
amounted to dkk 1,861 million and dkk 838 
million, respectively.
in 2020, divestments and fair value remeasure-
ment	of	businesses	classified	as	held	for	sale	
(including discontinued operations) resulted in a 
net loss before tax of dkk 89 million (2019: loss 
of dkk 425 million), see note 3.2 to the consoli-
dated	financial	statements.

land, germany, france and spain. most markets 
are	developed,	but	with	significant	differences	in	
ifs market maturity and macroeconomic envi-

services & it, industry & manufacturing, public 
administration, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. 
financial update
revenue decreased to dkk 27,634 million in 
2020 (2019: dkk 30,068 million). organic growth 
was (3)%, divestments and acquisitions, net 
and	the	impact	from	currency	effects	reduced	
revenue by 4% and 1%, respectively. 
covid-19	lockdowns	contributed	significantly	to	
the negative organic growth from march 2020 
and throughout the year in the majority of coun-
tries,	most	significantly	in	france,	belgium	and	
spain. organic growth was 10% in q1 and (7)% in 
the 9 month-period from april to december 2020.
the adverse impact on certain customer seg-
ments, e.g. automotive in france and aviation 
in austria and switzerland, and lower occupancy 
of buildings in general led to negative organic 
growth of more than 5% in the portfolio 
business,	which	was	partly	offset	by	projects	and	
above-base work, particularly increased demand 
for deep cleaning and disinfection. projects and 
above-base work grew organically by 11% and 
comprised 17% (2019: 15%) of revenue.
contract exits and impacts from the it security 
incident also contributed to negative growth, 
particularly in belgium, france and spain. 
further, the expiry of the novartis contract on 31 
december 2019 led to negative organic growth in 
switzerland and austria.

these	negatives	were	partly	offset	by	the	launch	
of the deutsche telekom contract on 1 july 
2019. furthermore, turkey reported positive 
growth supported by price increases due to 
high	inflation	and	the	launch	of	a	large	hospital	
contract and a new contract with a customer in 
the industry & manufacturing segment. 
commercially, our key account focus secured 
a few new wins to the region as well as several 
extensions. our key account retention rate 
remained high at 93% (2019: 94%), due to a 
1%-point negative impact from the expiry of the 
novartis contract.
operating profit before other items was dkk
(2,030) million for an operating margin of (7.3)%,
impacted by restructuring costs, mainly in 
france,	spain	and	germany,	and	one-off	costs	
primarily in germany and spain. adjusted for 
restructuring	and	one-off	costs	of	dkk	2.2	
billion,	operating	profit	before	other	items	was	
dkk 129 million, for an adjusted operating 
margin of 0.5%.
all major countries contributed to the margin 
decline, with covid-19, restructuring and 
one-off	costs	being	the	main	drivers.	spain	
was adversely impacted by limited availability 
of government support schemes. france was 
impacted by lower activity in the automotive and 
aviation segments. germany was, similarly to 
france,	suffering	from	declining	activities	within	
automotive, but the main impact came from 
the contract with deutsche telekom. due to the 
delayed it migration and operational challenges, 
we reassessed the value of capitalised transition 
costs and recognised a write-down. in addition, 
we provided for other contract-related risks 
and claims. finally, margins in switzerland and 
austria were negatively impacted by the expiry 
of the novartis contract.

regional performance
the market
iss holds a market-leading position across the 
region where markets are generally mature, 
developed, competitive and with a relatively 
high outsourcing rate. the largest country in the 
region is the uk contributing to around 40% of 
revenue. key customer segments are business 
services & it, healthcare and public adminis-
tration and the region is characterised by the 
group’s highest key account share of 74%. 
financial update
revenue decreased to dkk 22,642 million in 
2020 (2019: 25,037 million). organic growth 
was	(8)%	and	the	impact	from	currency	effects	
reduced revenue by 2%. 
covid-19 lockdowns across the region contribut-
ed	significantly	to	the	negative	organic	growth	in	
all	countries,	most	significantly	in	norway	where	
the business has a relatively high exposure to 
customers in segments like hotels and aviation, 
which were severely impacted by lockdowns. 
likewise,	the	uk	was	significantly	impacted	by	
customers in these segments and lockdowns in 
general across the private sector as well as by 
reductions in retail sales in hospitals.
organic growth in the region was (1)% in q1 
and (10)% in the 9 month-period from april to 
december 2020. the region has a relatively 
large share of revenue from food services 
(14% of revenue in 2020) and other portfolio 
services, which were particularly impacted 
by lower occupancy levels during lockdowns. 
as a result, portfolio revenue declined in all 
countries in the region while weaker demand 
for projects and above-base work in denmark, 
norway	and	sweden	was	more	than	offset	by	
additional demand for projects and above-base

the general bidding environment slowed down 
materially as a result of covid-19, resulting in 
a low level of new wins but nevertheless we 
managed to secure a number of extensions and 
expansions across the region. our key account 
retention rate remained high at 94% (2019: 95%).
operating profit before other items was 
dkk (1,200) million (2019: dkk 1,119 million), 
resulting in an operating margin of (5.3)% (2019: 
4.5%).	the	operating	profit	before	other	items	
was adversely impacted by restructuring costs 
as we adjusted our organisations across the 
region	and	by	one-off	costs,	mainly	related	to	
the uk and denmark. adjusted for restructuring 
and	one-off	costs	of	dkk	1.1	billion,	operating	
profit	before	other	items	was	dkk	(102)	million,	
for an adjusted operating margin of (0.5)%.
in the uk, we performed a detailed review of the 
business platform in 2020 on the back of the risks 
identified	in	2019.	the	review	led	to	changes	in	the	
management	structure	and	one-off	costs.	further,	
we	recognised	significant	one-off	costs	in	den-
mark, including in relation to the danish defence 
contract following a reassessment of the expected 
future	profitability	of	the	contract.	dialogue	is	
ongoing, including about a possible exit.
all countries contributed to the margin decline, 
though	most	significantly	the	uk	and	denmark,	
which were both severely impacted by covid-19-re-
lated revenue reductions, e.g. within food services. 
margin	in	denmark	was	also	affected	by	the

the market
the region comprises a mix of large and

kong and singapore, as well as several develop-
ing outsourcing markets, such as china, india 
and indonesia. iss has a strong presence in the 
region and holds a market-leading position in a 
number of countries. key customer segments are 
business services & it, industry & manufacturing, 
healthcare and public administration.
financial update
revenue decreased to dkk 12,385 million in 
2020 (2019: 13,235 million). organic growth was 
(3)%, divestments and acquisitions, net and the 
impact	from	currency	effects	reduced	revenue	by	
1% and 2%, respectively.
covid-19 lockdowns across the region contribut-
ed	significantly	to	the	negative	organic	growth in 
most countries. organic growth in the region was 
3% in q1 and (5)% in the 9 month-period from 
april to december 2020. india had the highest 
impact from lockdowns while also hong kong, 
indonesia and singapore recorded negative 
organic growth in 2020. growth in indonesia 
and australia was adversely impacted by high 
exposure to the aviation industry. in australia 
and china, negative organic portfolio growth was 
more	than	offset	by	strong	demand	for	projects	
and above-base work, including deep-cleaning 
and disinfection due to covid-19. across the 
region, projects and above-base work increased 
around 26% organically.

in 2020, the key account retention rate was 
94% (2019: 93%) as we managed to extend two 
large key account contracts in the region, one in 
australia and one in hong kong.
operating profit before other items de-
creased to dkk 646 million, for an operating

restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	operating	profit	
before other items was dkk 853 million, for an 
operating margin of 6.9%.
china, hong kong and singapore increased 
their operating margins in 2020 as a result of 
governments	offering	support	schemes	to	busi-
nesses as well as stronger demand for higher 
margin projects and above-base work. in hong 
kong,	the	margin	increase	was	partly	offset	by	
an increase in the provision for a loss-making 
contract due to the customer exercising an 
extension option. other countries in the region 
were adversely impacted on margins, most 
significantly	india	and	indonesia	following	
complete covid-19 related lockdowns in large 
periods of 2020.

the market
americas	consists	of	two	different	markets	–	a	
mature north american market and a developing 
market in mexico. north america is the world’s 
largest fm market, accounting for approximately 
27% of the global outsourced fm market. given 
iss’s historically limited presence in north 
america, our market share remains limited but 
with the acquisition of guckenheimer in 2017, 
we have enhanced the platform to build on our 
global key account strategy. as a consequence, 
food services in americas accounts for a sig-
nificantly	higher	share	of	revenue	than	in	other	
regions. key customer segments are business 
services & it, transportation & infrastructure, 
pharmaceuticals, and industry & manufacturing.
financial update
revenue decreased to dkk 6,635 million in 
2020 (2019: dkk 8,459 million). organic growth 
was	(19)%	and	the	impact	from	currency	effects	
decreased revenue additionally by 3%.
due to high exposure to food services and the avi-
ation segment, the americas region reported the 
largest revenue decline in the group as covid-19 
restrictions were imposed in the usa. food 
services represented almost 30% (2019: 40%) of 
revenue compared to 11% for the group. organic 
growth in the region was 2% in q1 and (26)% in 
the 9 month-period from april to december 2020.
key account customers with ifs contracts had 
significantly	more	robust	demand	and	conse-
quently less negative organic growth in 2020. 
the	revenue	drop	was	partly	offset	by	demand	
from key accounts for projects and above-base 
work, mainly within technical services, deep 
cleaning and disinfections. 
americas
mexico recorded organic growth of 3% in 2020 
due to strong demand from key accounts for 
projects and above-base work.
in 2020, we secured commercial momentum 
with	the	win	of	a	significant	contract	with	a	large	
international manufacturing customer across 
the americas, with gradual start-up from q1 
2021. the expected revenue from the contract is 
11% of total revenue in the americas region and 
1% of group revenue. the key account retention 
rate in americas was 94% (2019: 96%). 
operating profit before other items was 
dkk 237 million (2019: dkk 448 million) for an 
operating margin of 3.6% (2019: 5.3%). adjusted 
for	restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	operating	
profit	before	other	items	was	dkk	247	million,	
for an operating margin of 3.7%.
despite	the	significant	revenue	decline,	the	
region generated a positive operating margin 
based on fast renegotiation of contracts and trim-
ming of the portfolio. the turnaround initiatives 
implemented over 2018-2019, focused on exiting 
small specialised services contracts, continued to 
improve underlying margins and was a healthy 
platform to ensure relatively robust operating 
margins during a very challenging year. 
the	margin	in	mexico	was	6.1%	as	one-off	income	
from	projects	and	above-base	work	partly	offset	
the negative impact from covid-19 and restruc-
turing costs.

pure space, an iss product developed in 
response to covid-19, focuses on maximising 
hygiene and removing sources of cross-infec-
tion. while standard cleaning products em-
phasise visible cleanliness and task frequency, 
pure	space	analyses	traffic	and	touchpoints,	
identifies	high-touch	surfaces	and	tailors	
the hygiene plan to the environment. this 
approach is based on years of experience 
from our high-precision work in, for example, 
cleanrooms in pharmaceutical production 
and clinical standards at hospitals.
from “it looks clean” to  
“i know it is clean”
pure space measures the concentration of 
atp (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule 
found only in and around living cells to 
provide	visible,	scientific	proof	of	cleanliness.	
“with this technology, we are moving from 
a subjective to an objective assessment of 
cleaning,	using	a	proven	scientific	measure-
ment,” joseph nazareth, head of iss group 
health, safety, and quality explains.
along with publishing the atp score, there are 
other visible signs that help restore employees’ 
confidence	in	the	safety	of	their	workspace,	
namely that pure space happens during the 
day to allow people to witness the cleaning – 
seeing the work being done reinforces how 
seriously hygiene is taken in the work culture.
putting pure space to the test
pure space has been designed for anything 
from	office	environments	to	large-scale	
event spaces. for example, along with our 
customer	messe	düsseldorf,	one	of	the	
world’s top trade fair organisers, we were 
able to keep visitors safe and secure during 
a large-scale event amid the pandemic, with 
no infections attributed to the event.
nora wernick, head of sales service de-
partment / director sales and distribution, 
messe	düsseldorf,	says:	“the	hygiene	stew-
ards and the mobile cleaning team made 
it possible to maintain the strict hygiene 
standards during the event and thus made 
a valuable contribution to the success of the 
event under corona conditions.”
more than a  
pandemic solution
outside of the pandemic, pure space will 
be relevant for years to come as compa-
nies continue to prioritise healthier work 
environments. “we have the opportunity 
to improve people’s wellbeing in a broader 
sense, not just because they are healthier, 
but also because they have a greater peace 
of mind,” says joseph nazareth.
creating a safer workplace 
with pure space
“we tend to judge the output of a legacy 
cleaning service with our eyes. with pure 
space, we use science and technology to 
test and validate cleanliness.”

cleaning:
our strategy
in december 2020, we launched 
our refreshed strategy, oneiss. 
the strategy will reshape 
the business to make iss 
stronger, simpler and closer – 
strengthening our leadership 
in cleaning and integrated 
facilities services, driving 
excellence across the business, 
and bringing us closer within 
functions and countries through 
a new operating model.
introducing oneiss  
– stronger, simpler, closer
in	december	2020,	we	announced	the	findings	
of an extensive strategy review. this review 
confirmed	the	long-term	attraction	of	key	
accounts and integrated facility services (ifs) 
but acknowledged that execution in recent years 
had proven unsatisfactory.
having performed the review in the midst of 
the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted some 
trends in the market; we see a likely reduction in 
office	space	(cost	savings)	going	forward	with	a	
structural increase in work-from-home. on the 
other hand, we expect that the importance of 
the workplace as a vehicle to enhance corporate 
culture, employee collaboration and innovation 
will become even more apparent. furthermore, 
focus on hygiene and cleaning has increased to 
a new level.
in response, we launched oneiss – a strategy 
with a clear ambition to become the most 
respected global leader in ifs and strengthen 
our position as number one in cleaning, globally. 
oneiss embraces a sharper focus around 
prioritised customers and segments and a new, 
globally aligned operating model. oneiss will 
allow us to achieve our purpose – connecting 
people and places to make the world work 
better.
oneiss determines the choices we must 
take – the customers we choose to work with, 
the	services	we	offer,	our	delivery	model	and	
our geographic footprint. we have been on a 
journey for some time, simplifying our business, 
sharpening our focus and reallocating capital 
and resource to support our core. oneiss will 
see us complete this journey.
why iss?
customers choose to partner with iss for a 
multitude	of	reasons,	but	our	key	differentiation	
can be summarised as follows.
first and foremost are our people. we care 
about our people. in turn, they care about 
the places they maintain, the people they 
serve and the planet they seek to protect. 
we invest in our people through extensive 
training and development through work 
experience. we give them opportunity to 
better their lives so they can come closer to 
their career and life aspirations. we do that 
because we know that they make a differ-
ence. that is why we are passionate about 
our self-delivery credentials, taking respon-
sibility and ownership for the outcomes our 
customers demand.
second is the high standards we commit to in 
all aspects of delivery. this commitment is part 
of our dna. it is cemented in our heritage. we 
exist	to	make	a	difference.	we	go	the	extra	mile	
to ensure expectations are exceeded.
third is our ability to deliver intelligent 
solutions. our people, our experience and our 
insights allow us to add value to customers’ op-
erational, tactical and strategic issues, including 
supporting customers in bringing down costs. 
importantly, it is our ownership of all these 
issues	that	makes	a	difference.	we	gain	unique	
operational insights from our own people, day in, 
day out. combined with growing use of tech-
nology and data, this allows us to make smarter 
strategic recommendations, which we can then 
bring to life, back on the ground, via our own 
committed, trained and empowered workforce.

our business
our business
people make places  
and places make people
our delivery can be matched against a spectrum 
of customer needs. in its most extreme form, 
the world of work is a functional place – a place 
that simply needs to operate. places need to 
be clean and the lights kept on. users need to 
be safe and secure and allowed to go about 
their business. however, the boundary between 
work and life is blurring. customers want more 
than functional. they want experience. taking a 
more emotive perspective requires us to create 
places that think. places that are more personal. 
services that are more tailored to individuals 
to create experiences they can enjoy. if we 
go further still, customers require places that 
give. these are the places where people are at 
the core. these are places that must enhance 
lives because there is no discernible boundary 
between work and life. iss helps create places 
that work, think and give.
our strategic choices
our customers
we have chosen to be a key account focused 
organisation, believing it is with these customers 
that our purpose will be brought to life, allowing 
us to deliver compelling value for all stakehold-
ers. it is with key account customers that our 
value proposition resonates most strongly.
key account customers also provide better 
opportunities for our people. full-time work 
with better training, development and career 
progression. key accounts allow us to create 
more value for our shareholders in the form of 
stronger growth, higher margins and greater 
free	cash	flow	generation.	finally,	key	accounts	
also place a high importance on cr (corporate 
responsibility) and this allows us to create more 
value for society through our impact on people, 
places and planet. 
we create greatest value for our stakeholders 
when we are able to secure long-term relation-
ships with these key accounts, through multiple 
extensions of the original contract term. key 
account customers are more likely to bundle 
service solutions, providing attractive long-term 
growth for iss via increasing share of wallet, 
through	our	ifs	offering.	making	the	right	
customer choices at the outset and delivering 
excellence	–	quality,	efficiency	and	compliance	–	
are fundamental to the successful execution of 
our strategy.
our core services
 
cleaning
 technical
 food
 
 workplace  
(including	office-	based	support	services)
these services are key to the consistent delivery 
of our value proposition. they balance the needs 
and wishes of our key account customers with 
our ability to deliver excellence, largely with 
our own people and through our self-delivery 
focus. we will also take responsibility for the 
successful delivery of additional services, subject 
to	specific	customers’	needs.	however,	outside	
of our core services, we are more likely to work 
with specialist partners who are better able to 
perform these tasks under our stewardship.
delivery to our key account customers can be 
via single-service, multi-service or ifs solutions. 
our ambition is to secure wallet share gains via 
ifs whenever possible.
outside of key accounts, our prime focus is 
on cleaning. cleaning is our heritage and our 
ambition is nothing less than being recognised 
as the global leader. it is here that we can build 
scale	and	synergy	benefits	outside	of	our	key	
account focus, but in a manner that compli-
ments or actually supports execution for key 
accounts.
our global footprint
over time, we have chosen to exit a number of 
countries. this is because our choice of geo-
graphic footprint must support our strategy – 
markets that have an attractive local key account 
opportunity or are important in supporting our 
global customers. the countries we choose to 
operate in should also be sizable enough so that 
they create meaningful value to our enterprise. 
finally, the in-country risks we face must be 
acceptable.
in december 2020, as part of our conclusions 
from the strategy review process, we chose to 
sharpen our focus even further by exiting three 
countries – portugal, russia and taiwan –  
together with a number of business units that are 
viewed as non-core. total annual revenue from 
these planned exits amounts to approximately 
dkk 4 billion. they are in addition to the exits and 
divestments of 15 countries and several non-core 
business units announced in 2018.
currently, we have divested seven of the 15 
countries and two business units during this 
two-year period.

our business
our operating model
iss is a country-centric organisation and rightly 
so. the vast majority of our business is originat-
ed locally. all business is executed locally, and all 
of our people are hired locally. 
the	strategy	review	process	highlighted	five	key	
pain points that had undermined execution in 
prior years.
oneiss will deliver a new, globally aligned 
operating	model	that	will	prove	more	effective	
at supporting countries and unleashing the full 
potential of iss’s global scale. oneiss will yield a 
stronger, simpler, closer organisation and specif-
ically	address	the	key	pain	points	identified.
oneiss represents a new approach – explicit in 
its ambition to capture the best of what we do 
and enabling us to make it happen. where we 
all work in support of each other, delivering ex-
cellence with our group functions and countries 
driving change together.
oneiss will ensure we can live up to our 
purpose, to connect people and places to make 
the world work better.
unleashed potential
our response
leveraging  
global scale
we are aligning our business more strong-
ly around our key account customers and 
prioritised industry segments. we are 
investing in a new corporate hub in war-
saw to drive global tools and processes for 
the	benefits	of	the	entire	organisation.	as	
such, we will leverage best practice across 
the organisation, strengthening the quality 
of what we deliver for customers and the 
efficiency	and	compliance	of	how	we	do	it.
commercial 
discipline
we are revamping our commercial func-
tion, strengthening our expertise around 
prioritised industry segments. we are 
optimising the allocation of our commer-
cial resource whilst investing in innova-
tion and the creation of standardised 
products that will strengthen our value 
propositions for key account customers. 
we are also introducing tighter pro-
cesses – with strong support from other 
functions – to ensure we can deliver on 
our future customer promises.
operational 
excellence
we are creating a brand new, operations 
performance	function	with	significantly	
strengthened central resource devel-
oping improved groupwide standards 
and best practice. we are standardising 
kpis and benchmarking and will ensure 
a dynamic allocation of resource across 
the enterprise to deliver the strongest 
business outcomes.
technology
we are introducing a new technology 
operating model to create enhanced 
scale	and	efficiency	across	iss	under	the	
leadership of a newly appointed chief 
information	and	digital	officer.	we	have	
taken steps in the right direction, including 
building a facility management system 
(fms@iss) and starting to embrace iot 
and sensor technology. however, to make 
technology a real source of competitive 
advantage in the future, we need to invest 
significantly.	we	will	increase	our	central	it	
resources by 50% by 2022 and implement 
systems to enable operational perfor-
mance benchmarking of our key accounts, 
including roll-out of end-user digital 
applications in our so-called iss suite. this 
entails	that	our	customers	benefit	from	
our access to unique data and insights in 
addition to a robust and secure platform.
culture
we are driving far greater levels of 
cross-company collaboration, openness 
and	transparency.	we	will	clearly	define	ac-
countabilities and incentivise and reward 
those actions and behaviours that support 
execution of our strategy.

our business
our people
we have a proud heritage of fairness, equality 
and inclusion, providing opportunity through 
developing and engaging our nearly 400,000 
colleagues across the globe. this is central to 
our customer value proposition. we provide a 
skilled, empowered and motivated workforce 
who seek to deliver high standards at our 
customers’ premises. we believe that people 
make places and places make people. 
with the launch of oneiss, we aim to build a 
stronger culture of trust and collaboration to 
support the journey that we have embarked on. 
the	role	of	people	&	culture	is	to	drive	profitable	
growth by ensuring iss has the leadership, 
talent, capabilities, and culture required for 
excellent execution of our strategy.
we deploy our leadership model and develop 
global processes and common standards to 
ensure	efficiency	and	compliance	for	our	custom-
ers. at the same time, we help the organisation 
get closer to our customers by driving and 
developing the capabilities needed to successful-
ly deliver our value proposition to customers.
looking into 2021, our people-related strategic 
priorities are to:
• drive talent development and leadership 
capabilities throughout the organisation
• support development of key account 
capabilities
• support key capability building within strate-
gic focus areas
• ensure	compliance	and	efficiency	through	stan-
dardised people processes, systems and tools
• drive	efficiency	and	transparency	in	workforce	
planning through data-driven analysis 
• drive a purpose-led service culture that is 
diverse, inclusive and collaborative through 
our focus on diversity and inclusion, social 
mobility and dignity.
whilst our belief in people is an important part 
of our culture, bringing this story to life does not 
happen by chance. we ensure a rigorous pro-
cess of people management from recruitment 
and selection through to onboarding and train-
ing. we have created numerous programmes 
which are deployed across our organisation to 
support this process. above all, great leadership 
is the ingredient most essential for successful 
implementation of our strategy. our leaders 
are key to the subsequent development and 
engagement of all our people, no matter where 
they sit in our organisation, and the consistent 
delivery of our customer value proposition.
leadership, development  
and engagement
we develop our leaders through group-wide iss 
programmes that are focused on driving:
1
leadership development
2
business excellence
3
service culture
4
effective	on-boarding
we have an intensive 12-month course de-
signed for our future leaders called leadership 
mastery, which provides them with the platform 
to step into senior leadership positions as the 
business develops and grows. our leading the 
iss way programme, targeted more broadly 
at senior leaders and key account managers, 
facilitates clear and structured feedback, 
which allows leaders to gain insights into 
their personal leadership style, strengths and 
development areas. 
in	2020	we	invested	our	efforts	in	providing	
our leaders with further knowledge about their 
strengths and development areas in the context 
of the iss leadership competency framework. 
our senior leaders took part in leadership 
strengths assessment which outcomes will be 
the basis of further enhancing their develop-
ment and ensuring right set of competencies 
to drive oneiss strategy and full engagement 
of our people. on the organizational level it 
provided us with capability insights that will 
evolve our people development solutions in the 
years to come.
our strategy is all about key accounts, and their 
continued growth is essential. our key account 
managers hold complex general management 
positions	with	financial	and	customer	account-
ability, and are taken responsibility for leading 
large and diverse teams, often across multiple 
customer sites. they play a vital operational 
role and we place great importance on their 
development via our key account management 
certification	programme.	similarly,	our	site	
managers play an important role in the day-to-
day operation of our key accounts. to support 
their development, we run a site manager 
programme, which equips our leaders manag-
ing sites with business acumen and leadership 
skills that help them manage customers 
effectively	and	build	engaged	teams.	this	suite	
of programmes ensures a standardised and 
comprehensive approach to managing our 
customers experience.
our service with a human touch programme, 
which focuses on our frontline employees is our 
service culture programme, which communi-
cates our purpose and translates customer value 
propositions into concrete service behaviours 
people are at the very heart 
of iss’s strategy and business 
model. from the company’s 
origins in 1901, iss has been a 
people organisation, working 
with a strong belief that great 
people can and do make a 
difference.

for thousands of service professionals. the pro-
gramme has been deployed across the iss world 
in 47 countries, with more than 200,000 employ-
ees taking an active part in developing their own 
service	behaviours	and	finding	their	purpose.	we	
reinforce this service culture through the apple 
award programme – our reward and recognition 
programme celebrating employees, who go the 
extra mile, creating memorable service moments 
that	truly	make	a	difference	for	our	customers.	
each iss country celebrates an apple of the year, 
and from this a global apple of the year winner 
is selected and recognised at a global event.
we continue to develop our global learning 
management system – at iss called mylearning. 
it is a multi-function platform, which supports 
the deployment and tracking of over 1,700 global 
and	country-specific	e-learning	modules	along	
with almost 800 training videos available in 27 
languages. it is accessible to all iss employees – 
from country leaders and executives to frontline 
staff	in	all	service	lines.	since	its	formal	launch	in	
2015, mylearning’s use across the organisation 
has continued to grow. in 2017, approximately 
100,000 e-learning modules were completed; this 
figure	now	stands	at	over	4.5	million	to	date,	with	
over 1.7 million completions in 2020 alone.
process standardisation
we have focused on standardising our onboard-
ing approach and engaging with our new joiners 
in	a	more	powerful,	motivational	and	effective	
way. we take great pride in how we introduce 
new people to the iss world, ensuring that they 
are empowered to make the world work better. 
our onboarding framework supports every new 
colleague that joins us and it is a holistic journey 
which takes place over three months, right from 
the moment that the individual is hired.
to capitalise on the power of one enterprise in 
2020, we embarked on the journey of implement-
ing people@iss - human experience management 
system in partnership with sap success factors. 
thanks to this initiative, we are introducing 
our people to new digital ways of performance 
management, development and career planning.
diversity and inclusion
as a global company and one of the world’s 
largest private employers, we strive to create 
a truly inclusive culture where everyone feels 
valued, engaged and respected, and where 
everyone is treated fairly and equally. yet, our 
diversity and inclusion aspiration goes beyond 
the boundaries of iss.
iss is a catalyst for social integration – we pro-
vide	many	people	with	their	first	job,	help	them	
settle in a new country, support their lifelong 
learning and ambitions. we are passionate 
about providing people the dignity and respect 
to contribute to the society in which they live, 
to support their families and dependents and 
to help them navigate their life journey. we 
understand that we have a unique opportunity 
to change the lives of our employees for the 
better, during their years at iss.
we believe that education is the enabler of 
that	change,	which	is	why	we	strive	to	offer	
industry-leading training to our nearly 400,000 
employees. by educating our employees and 
suggesting concrete ways in which they can 
act,	we	create	a	positive	ripple	effect,	not	just	
within iss, but also to the people that they touch 
and their families. before 2025, all employees 
will	be	offered	training	to	upgrade	their	skills	in	
languages, internet and computer skills, arming 
them with the tools to begin their journey.
in 2020, we strengthened our diversity & 
inclusion (d&i) requirements in our global 
people standards to ensure we take con-
crete actions for a balanced mix of diversity, 
for the development and advancement of 
ethnic minority employees and for mentoring 
programmes.
we also increased our focus on diversity 
and inclusion including awareness training, 
best practices sharing, global alignment and 
implementation. additionally, a global d&i target 
has	been	defined	concerning	achieving	at	least	
40% of gender balance within all leadership 
roles by 2025 – a goal approved by the executive 
group management and the board of directors. 
whilst gender will, initially, be our primary focus, 
our ambitions go beyond gender and we will 
implement various initiatives emphasising the 
three dimensions: 
• fairness & equality at work
• diversity of thought
• places that foster inclusiveness 
retention
we operate in a marketplace where levels of 
employee churn are inherently high. this is 
unlikely to change. however, we are targeting 
a structural improvement in our employee 
retention rates. 
in the last few years, we have focused on 
reducing the turnover and this showed with the 
improvement in our turnover rate in 2019. some 
of the initiatives included placing employees 
closer to their residences so they did not need 
to travel long distances, and increased opportu-
nity for training so they could have the opportu-
nity to seek other jobs within iss. 
during 2020, our turnover was impacted by 
covid-19; however, we continue to target a 
structural improvement in our employee reten-
tion	rate	and	see	the	benefits	for	our	customers	
as two-fold. higher employee retention:
• underpins a more consistent, higher quality of 
service; and
• reduces the costs associated with attracting, 
recruiting and onboarding new colleagues.
we believe that the initiatives detailed above 
provide a return on our investment and serve as 
a	strong	differentiator	for	iss.
we are pleased that our global employee 
turnover continued to improve in 2020 to 33% 
and	reflecting	among	others,	our	persistent	
push for retention initiatives in countries, e.g. 
improved labour conditions relative to the 
market in certain countries. the positive trend is 
also driven by our key account focus, including 
discontinuation of high-churn non-key account 
customer contracts.

caring for people,  
places and the planet
from the company’s origins in 1901, iss has 
been a people organisation, working with a 
strong belief that great people can and do make 
a	difference.	we	believe	in	our	responsibility	–	to	
the planet, our people and the communities we 
serve. we know that when we get things right, it 
enhances lives and makes the world work better 
– and that is what drives us.
our promise – a sustainable 
business model that support 
the world we live in
as a global company with nearly 400,000 employ-
ees, we have an important role to play in solving 
some of the world’s most pressing sustainability 
challenges. we contribute to sustainable devel-
opment around three thematic areas:
 people: promoting safe working 
conditions, health & well-being, and 
human rights, while cultivating a culture 
of diversity and inclusion
 planet: reducing our environmental 
impact, while helping our customers 
create sustainable workplaces through 
strategic advice and services
 
 profit:	positively	influencing	the	global	
business environment by complying with 
sound business standards and compliance 
with our business integrity framework
corporate 
responsibility
our approach
we are deeply committed to the transforma-
tion to a more resilient and just international 
community. our target is to lead our industry by 
example,	always	aiming	to	positively	influence	
the market wherever we operate. with our 
focus on how we can take an ethical approach 
to	people,	planet	and	profit,	we	invest	particular	
effort	in	supporting	these	un	sustainable	devel-
opment goals (sdgs). it is our belief that iss can 
contribute	significantly	to	five	of	these.	
diversity & inclusion
we embrace and encourage diversity and inclu-
sion in their broadest terms, including ethnicity, 
race, age, gender, gender identity, disability, 
sexual orientation, religious beliefs, language, 
cultural and educational background. our diverse 
workforce is recognised as a key competitive 
advantage and a vital asset in our long-term 
sustainable business success. our inclusive 
culture empowers our people, and make us more 
creative, productive, and attractive as a workplace.
covid-19
in 2020, covid-19 unfortunately disrupted lives, 
impacted livelihoods and businesses all over 
the world. iss took various steps to manage the 
outbreak from our people perspective to the 
handling of customers.
even	with	all	the	efforts,	especially	from	health	
care professionals around the world, in 2020 we 
unfortunately lost 50 colleagues to covid-19. iss 
continues to issue health alerts, provide guidance 
and training and communicate the latest policies 
and protocols through our health, safety and 
environment (hse) app. we are also coordinating 
with our customers at the site level to ensure our 
covid-19 measures and procedures are aligned.

risks
our purpose is about 
connecting people and places to 
make the world work better. we 
rely on our people to support 
the core business purpose of 
our customers by applying 
strong processes to ensure 
quality standards and effective 
risk management. we protect 
and maintain places – buildings 
and the assets inside them.
two significant risk events 
in 2020 seriously tested our 
ability to continuously perform 
uninterrupted services in rapidly 
changing circumstances. our 
response to covid-19 and an it 
security incident in the form of a 
malware attack was a testimony 
to our business model and risk 
management approach.
risk management
2020	saw	significant	risk	events	materialising	
and it will be a year to remember and take di-
rection from. while combatting risk events such 
as covid-19 and a malware attack, our focus on 
strengthening the risk management foundation 
continued. we further aligned our risk frame-
work across the organisation to manage our 
own internal risks as well as the risks which our 
customers trust us to manage, as we deliver on 
our value proposition.
with our new operating model, we have taken 
decisive steps towards enhancing our ability to 
make decisions on a stronger foundation bal-
ancing risk and opportunity appropriately. our 
commercial process was further strengthened 
by the implementation of stronger reviews and 
governance procedures. our ability to prevent 
and contain operational and commercial risks 
and challenges has been upgraded.
covid-19
the threat from covid-19 materialised in decem-
ber 2019 and as a global organisation we were 
alerted by our operations in china. as the reality 
of a global pandemic became clear we mobilised 
our global and country-based emergency re-
sponse organisations to oversee and coordinate 
local and global responses to the pandemic. with 
the well-being of employees and end-users being 
of key concern we provided advice, guidance and 
training on best practice hygiene and precaution-
ary standards directly to frontline employees. we 
have continuously coordinated with our custom-
ers at account and site level to ensure availability 
of personal protective equipment, alignment of 
response programmes, and that we leverage 
global knowledge around measures taken for the 
benefit	and	safety	of	our	customers.	
it security incident
on 17 february 2020, we were hit by a 
ransomware	attack.	it	affected	many	of	iss	core	
it systems and as a precaution all iss systems 
were	turned	off.	on	20	march	2020,	control	
of critical business applications was regained 
and a major exercise started to clean up and 
harden the it infrastructure leading to full 
recovery of all systems by end november 2020 
with no indication of customer data having 
been compromised. the security posture has 
been strengthened and a programme launched 
in september 2020, is set out to further 
strengthen it security and build a robust, 
centrally managed it infrastructure to further 
mitigate risk of future attacks. we never made 
any attempt to contact the attackers; we do not 
know who they were, and we did not pay any 
ransom money.
group key risks
as part of the strategy refresh process we 
reviewed	and	refined	the	identified	group	key	
risks	to	reflect	the	main	exposures	and	risks	in	
achieving our strategic objectives. the key risks 
and mitigation measures are described on the 
following pages.
while the majority of key risks are of an 
inherent nature to the business, industry and 
our strategic choices, we believe that our 
transformation journey, including transfor-
mation of our operating model, divestment of 
non-strategic	businesses	and	our	significant	it	
agenda, drive execution risk that must be kept 
front and center. we have therefore invested 
in strong project management resources and 
have established a pmo to drive and monitor 
successful execution.

revitalising the 
corporate workplace
workplace:
the coronavirus pandemic has transformed 
how we work, with a hybrid model emerging 
that	embraces	both	the	corporate	office	and	
the home. in a recent survey of customers, 
up to 65% of participants responded they 
expect to follow a partially hybrid remote 
model post-pandemic. as a result, compa-
nies	will	need	to	redefine	their	real	estate	
strategies. but they will also need to think 
beyond the traditional real estate portfolio 
to consider the employees’ entire work-life 
experience and how work can be about 
culture as much as place. 
company culture at risk
for working from home to be both produc-
tive and engaging for employees, compa-
nies will need to address its inadequacies. 
in our survey of customers, we found that 
remote	work	came	with	a	number	of	signifi-
cant challenges for employees, in particular 
socialising, wellbeing, collaboration, access 
to leadership and a sense of belonging.
“as work has shifted to the personal home, 
the loss of the corporate home risks eroding 
company cultures over time,” says ulla riber, 
head of group workplace management at 
iss.	“that	will	have	a	significantly	negative	
impact on employee turnover and produc-
tivity – and could prove to be an achilles’ 
heel for many businesses.”
how people have responded to the shift to 
remote work during covid-19 has much to do 
with their role and their facilities. insights from 
leesman indicate that workers who had a 
well-equipped	home	office	were	more	likely	to	
have a good experience with remote work; if 
their physical workplace design was sub-op-
timal, it would further contribute to the percep-
tion that work was better at home. employers 
would therefore be wise to consider that 
their employees are measuring their home 
experience	against	their	office	experience.	
the impact of the  
corporate home
while	working	from	home	provides	flexibility,	
less commuting time and great support for 
focused	work,	the	office	offers	something	
different.	the	corporate	workplace	serves	
as the company’s cultural temple – where 
employees feel at home and know what to 
expect. but it will also increasingly adopt a 
broader purpose, creating value through 
community and collective experiences. the 
impact on businesses will be tangible: data 
shows that investing in creating a healthy, 
productive corporate culture can increase 
profit	per	employee,	reduce	absenteeism	
and sick leave, and attract and retain talent 
for the long term.
“the corporate workplace is a 
crucial professional home for 
employees. it provides a marketplace 
for collaboration, innovation and 
communication, and all of that 
comes together to create a sense 
of belonging and, ultimately, 
engagement and loyalty.”
ulla riber
head of group workplace management at iss

corporate 
governance
transparency, constructive 
stakeholder dialogue, sound 
decision-making processes 
and controls are key aspects 
of our corporate governance 
for the benefit of iss and our 
stakeholders.
framework
the board of directors (board) regularly reviews 
the group’s corporate governance framework 
and policies in relation to the group’s activities, 
business environment, corporate governance 
recommendations and statutory requirements; 
and continuously assesses the need for 
adjustments.
the board reviews the group’s capital structure 
on an ongoing basis. the board believes the 
present capital and share structure serves the 
best interests of both the shareholders and iss 
as	it	gives	iss	the	flexibility	to	pursue	strategic	
goals, thus supporting long-term shareholder 
value combined with short-term shareholder 
value by way of iss’s dividend policy.
governance structure
the shareholders of iss a/s exercise their rights 
at the general meeting, which is the supreme 
governing body of iss.
management powers are distributed between 
our board and our executive group manage-
ment board (egmb). no person serves as a 
member of both of these corporate bodies. our 
egmb carries out the day-to-day management, 
while our board supervises the work of our 
egmb and is responsible for the overall manage-
ment and strategic direction.
the primary responsibilities of the board 
and committees established by the board are 
outlined in our governance structure on p. 38.
in 2020, the board performed an internal 
evaluation of the board’s performance led by the 
chair of the board, which included the perfor-
mance of individual board members and an 
evaluation of the performance of the egmb and 
of the cooperation between the board and the 
egmb. for further details, please see response 
to recommendation 3.5.1 of the 2020 statutory 
report on corporate governance.
board members elected by the general meeting 
stand for election each year. the current chair 
of the board lord allen of kensington will not 
seek re-election at the 2021 annual general 
meeting. niels smedegaard is nominated as new 
chair. claire chiang has also decided not to seek 
re-election at the 2021 annual general meeting. 
the remaining members are seeking re-election.
three employee representatives serve on the 
board. they are elected on the basis of a volun-
tary arrangement regarding group representa-
tion for employees of iss world services a/s as 
further described in the articles of association. 
employee representatives serve for terms of 
four years. the current employee representa-
tives joined the board after the annual general 
meeting held in april 2019.
the members of the executive group man-
agement board (egmb) are the group ceo, 
the group cfo and the ceo europe. together, 
they form the management registered with 
the danish business authority. the group has 
a wider executive group management (egm), 
whose members are seven corporate senior 
officers	in	addition	to	the	egmb.	the	primary	
responsibilities of the egm are outlined in our 
governance structure on p. 38.
the egm has a number of committees including 
a sustainability committee addressing esg-re-
lated matters which are reported and reviewed 
by the egm and the board as required.
  board biographies, pp. 39–40
   egm biographies, p. 41
the rules on the governance of iss a/s,
including share capital, general meetings,
shareholder decisions, election of
members to the board, etc., is described
in the articles of association which are
available here.
corporate governance reporting
the 2020 statutory report on corporate 
governance, prepared pursuant to section 
107b of the danish financial statements act, 
includes a description of our governance 
structure and the main elements of our in-
ternal	controls	related	to	financial	reporting	
as well as an overview of our position on the 
danish corporate governance recommen-
dations (recommendations). 
at the end of 2020, we complied with all of 
the recommendations except 1.1.3 regard-
ing the publication of quarterly reports. 
we	publish	full-year	and	half-year	financial	
results and trading updates in q1 and q3 
in line with international industry practice. 
this reporting format is selected to balance 
focus between short-term performance and 
long-term value creation. investor presen-
tations continue to be held quarterly via live 
webcast/telephone conference.
the report is available here.
the 2020 remuneration report prepared 
pursuant to the shareholder rights direc-
tive includes a description of our remuner-
ation policy and remuneration of the board 
and the egmb in accordance with 4.2.3 of 
the recommendations. 
the report is available here.
remuneration of the board and the egm 
is disclosed in note 5.1 to the consolidated 
financial	statements.

key matters transacted  
by the board
competencies and diversity
the board and the egm recognise the impor-
tance of promoting diversity at management 
levels and have implemented policies regarding 
competencies and diversity in respect of board 
and egmb nominations according to which we 
are committed to selecting the best candidate 
while aspiring to have diversity in gender as well 
as in broader terms. emphasis is placed on:
• experience and expertise (such as industry, 
strategy and value creation, leadership of 
large international companies, transforma-
tional change, people development and 
succession, sales and marketing, it and 
technology,	finance,	risk	management,	and	
corporate responsibility);
• diversity (incl. age, gender, new talent and 
international experience) and diversity of 
perspectives; and
• personal characteristics matching iss’s values 
and leadership principles.
the board’s gender diversity target of having 
at least 40% women elected by the general 
meeting on the board by 2020 was met with 
43% of these board members being women and 
including employee representatives, 50% of our 
board is women.
to improve the gender balance in management 
positions	at	iss’s	global	head	office,	we	continue	
leveraging	our	diversity	policy,	which	defines	a	
number of initiatives, including our recruitment 
policy, requiring us to short-list at least one 
female candidate in all searches for vacant 
positions. we also continuously develop our 
succession planning aiming at identifying female 
successors and tabling the matter of women in 
leadership at iss for discussion at least once a 
year at egm level. furthermore, it is our policy to 
ensure strong representation of women in var-
ious iss leadership development and graduate 
programmes across the group and at the global 
head	office	in	copenhagen,	and	in	the	future,	
also in our hub in warsaw, poland. this principle 
is also applied in our two main talent initiatives: 
in the global management trainee programme 
we have ensured a 50/50 gender split in every 
yearly cohort since its launch in 2014. and in 
our talent development programme for senior 
executives – the leadership mastery pro-
gramme – where we currently have 35% female 
participation.
 
the representation of women at management 
level	at	the	global	head	office	is	currently	at	28%	
and have increased slightly in 2020 compared 
to 2019. at our egm, the female representation 
has increased from 10% last year to currently 
20%. gender diversity at all leadership layers 
remains a focus area in 2021.
assurance
the	group’s	external	financial	reporting	is	
audited by the independent auditors.
 
group internal audit (gia) is responsible 
for providing an objective and independent 
assessment	of	the	effectiveness	and	quality	
of the internal controls in accordance with the 
internal audit plan approved by the audit and 
risk committee (arc). gia operates under a 
charter approved by the board.
although the activities of gia were impacted 
by covid-19, audit programmes were adjusted 
to accommodate remote testing allowing for 
gia to continue to provide assurance over the 
operating	effectiveness	of	internal	controls.

in 2020, focus has been on:
• continued implementation of a structured 
and formalised internal control framework 
for financial reporting (icofr). the status of 
selected controls and on the implementation of 
key processes and systems is reported separate-
ly for each country as part of a group initiative 
on top 10 control areas; and
• period-end close & controls project – rolled out to 
selected countries according to a plan for 2020 – 
2021. the project sets the rules and procedures in 
support of icofr to ensure a global, standardised 
approach to period-end close management and 
account reconciliations.
speak up (whistleblower) 
the group’s speak up policy is implemented through 
a reporting tool operated by gotethics, which is 
available in 21 languages via iss’s website and local 
iss country websites enabling employees of iss, 
business partners and other stakeholders to report 
serious and sensitive concerns anonymously. all busi-
ness	integrity	and	ethics	issues	identified	through	
speak up or other sources are handled by the 
business integrity committee (bic) that is composed 
of the group cfo, the group general counsel, the 
group	people	and	culture	officer	and	the	head	of	
group internal audit. the bic reports to the arc on 
all matters that have been subject to investigation.

in	its	first	full	year	providing	facility	man-
agement services to deutsche telekom 
(dtag), iss achieved something that the 
customer has never experienced before: 
0% unplanned downtime. one of the 
world’s leading integrated telecommuni-
cations companies, dtag provides mobile 
and internet infrastructure to the entire 
german population. almost every person 
and company in the country, as well as the 
emergency services and armed forces, rely 
on this infrastructure to stay connected – 
24/7, 365 days a year.
managing a hugely  
complex system
“for dtag, reliability is essential to its 
business,” explains michael herbergs, iss’s 
tfm director in germany. across germany, 
dtag operates 140,000 technical devices 
and 8,500 sites, including data centres, 
signal towers and routers. to monitor this 
complex system, iss set up two disturbance 
management centres – known in germany 
as smcs. if anything goes wrong within the 
dtag system, a disturbance manager is 
alerted. the alert could be anything from 
a door left open at a data centre to storm 
damage on a signal tower. in all, our smcs 
received 12 million alerts in 2020, leading 
to 60,000 service team site visits during the 
year with an average deployment time of 
just 30 minutes. 
a team dedicated to 
constant optimisation 
the teams behind this achievement are 
highly skilled, with many years of experience 
in	the	field.	operating	in	three	shifts,	they	
ensure there is always a trained team ready 
to	quickly	tackle	a	task,	whether	it	is	fixing	
a broken chiller at a data centre or scaling 
a	300-metre-tall	signal	tower	to	fix	a	loose	
part.	this	requires	dedicated	staff	and	
an organisation that runs like clockwork, 
especially	during	storms,	floods,	heat	waves	
or other incidents that can wreak havoc on 
even the most robust it system. 
“dtag will continue to improve and expand 
its infrastructure to support its customers’ 
growing communications needs,” says 
michael herbergs about iss’s high standards 
for ongoing improvements. “we must con-
tinue	to	grow	and	refine	our	organisation	as	
well, to ensure we can keep dtag’s system 
functioning day and night, 365 days a year.”

case
impact of covid-19, the it security incident  
and our key operational challenges
2020	was	significantly	impacted	by	two	external	events:
1. 
the covid-19 pandemic; and
2. 
the it security incident on 17 february 2020.
covid-19	had	a	significant	adverse	impact	on	our	business,	
including	the	group’s	operating	performance	and	cash	flows	
in	2020	as	well	as	our	financial	position	at	31	december	2020.	
furthermore,	the	general	level	of	uncertainty	has	significant-
ly increased, particularly in relation to prospects for future 
business recovery and the expected timing, as also described 
in outlook 2021 on pp. 10-11.
in addition, our four key operational challenges (as illustrated 
on	p. 16)	as	well	as	actions	initiated	in	the	late	part	of	2020	led	
to	significant	restructuring	and	one-off	costs.

financial statements
operating profit  
and tax
our	financial	performance	in	2020	was	severely	
impacted by external events in the form of the 
global covid-19 pandemic and the it security 
incident, but also by our four key operational 
challenges and the actions initiated to position 
us for recovery in the future. these resulted in 
restructuring	and	one-off	costs	of	dkk	3.5	billion.
revenue was dkk 69,823 million and organic 
growth was (6.5)%, negatively impacted by 
lockdowns and other measures to contain the 
covid-19 pandemic from mid-march 2020. our 
key accounts showed some resilience with or-
ganic growth of (4.3)%. project and above-base 
work grew organically by 9.9%, driven by strong 
demand for deep-cleaning and disinfection. 
operating profit before other items was 
dkk (3,226) million for an operating margin of 
(4.6)%	(2019:	4.2%).	the	significant	decrease	was	
largely	due	to	restructuring	and	one-off	costs	
of dkk 3.5 billion. adjusted for these, operating 
margin was around 0.5%. 
additional details on revenue and operating 
profit	by	region	as	well	as	revenue	by	country	
are provided in 1.1, segment information and 
1.2, revenue as well as in the management’s 
review on pp. 14-24.
other income and expenses, net was an 
expense of dkk 983 million, heavily impacted 
by incremental costs related to the it security 
incident of dkk 887 million, including a non-cash 
write-down of dkk 365 million. a break-down 
including commentary is included in 1.4, other 
income and expenses, net.
the effective tax rate was 0.8% negatively 
impacted	by	significant	valuation	allowances	on	
deferred tax assets mainly in germany, france, 
spain and the netherlands. details on the 
composition	of	the	group’s	effective	tax	rate	and	
deferred tax are provided in 1.5, income taxes 
and 1.6, deferred tax, respectively.

1.1  segment information
iss is a leading, global provider of workplace 
and facility service solutions operating in 60 
countries. operations are generally managed 
based on a geographical structure in which 
countries are grouped into regions. the regions 
have	been	identified	based	on	a	key	principle	of	
grouping countries that share market conditions 
and cultures. countries where we do not have 
a full country support structure, which are 
managed by global operations, are combined in 
a separate segment “other countries”. an over-
view of the grouping of countries into regions is 
presented in 7.5, group companies.

1.2   revenue
performance obligations
revenue is generated from rendering of work-
place and facility service solutions. our services 
are provided to the customer on a daily basis 
continuously over the term of the contract. the 
customer simultaneously receives and consumes 
the	benefits	provided	by	the	group.	thus,	the	
performance	obligations	are	satisfied	over	time.
we group our customers into key accounts, 
large and medium, and small and route-based 
customers,	which	reflects	the	different	needs	
and	requirements	of	the	different	customer	
categories.
disaggregation of revenue
we disaggregate revenue based on customer 
type and geographical region as we believe 
that these best depict how the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash 
flows	are	affected	by	economic	factors.	disag-
gregation of revenue based on geographical 
region is disclosed in 1.1, segment information.
revenue backlog
our revenue base consists of a mix of yearly 
contracts, which are renewed tacitly, and thou-
sands of multi-year contracts, the majority of 
which	have	an	initial	term	of	three	to	five	years.	
depending on the size and complexity of the 
contract, the transition and mobilisation period is

normally between six and twelve months for our 
key accounts. contracts regularly include options 
for the customer to terminate for convenience 
within three to nine months, however, our 
customer retention rate, which is around 91% 
overall, and 93% for our key accounts, supports 
that these options are rarely exercised.
the majority of our revenue (approx. 82%) is port-
folio revenue, i.e. revenue related to services that 
we are obligated to deliver on a recurring basis 
over the term of the contract. the remaining 
part of our revenue is non-recurring in the form 
of above-base work, e.g. capital projects. since 
above-base work is not committed as part of the 
main customer contract it is excluded from the 
transaction price to be allocated to the remaining 
performance obligation (revenue backlog). at 
31 december, the revenue backlog (including 
contracts won but not yet started) was as follows:

accounting policy
the accounting policies of the reportable segments 
are the same as the group’s accounting policies 
described throughout the notes. segment revenue, 
costs, assets and liabilities comprise items that can 
be directly referred to the individual segments. 
unallocated items mainly consist of revenue, costs, 
assets and liabilities relating to the group’s corpo-
rate functions (including internal and external loans 
and borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and 
intra-group balances) as well as financial income, 
financial expenses and income tax.
the segment reporting is prepared in a manner
consistent with the group’s internal management 
and reporting structure and excludes discontinued 
operations.
for the purpose of segment reporting, segment 
profit	has	been	identified	as	operating	profit.	
segment assets and segment liabilities have 
been	identified	as	total	assets	and	total	liabilities,	
respectively.
when presenting geographical information, seg-
ment revenue and non-current assets are based 
on the geographical location of the individual sub-
sidiary from which the sales transaction originates.
transactions between reportable segments are 
made on market terms.

in estimating the revenue backlog, the group 
has applied the exemptions of ifrs 15 and does 
not disclose revenue backlog for contracts:
• with an original duration of less than 12 
months; and
• invoiced based on time incurred, i.e. contracts 
where	the	group	invoices	a	fixed	amount	for	
each hour of service provided.
committed savings glidepaths are taken into 
consideration	whereas	future	inflation	is	exclud-
ed from the estimates.
for our key accounts and large and medium 
customers,	a	significant	number	of	contracts	
in terms of value are descoped based on a term 
of less than 12 months (due to termination for 
convenience clauses) and some contracts are 
descoped on the basis that they are invoiced 
based on time incurred.
in terms of our small and route-based 
customers, the vast majority is descoped based 
on either of the two exemptions. the remaining 
customers in scope comprise less than 1% of 
group revenue and due to immateriality revenue 
backlog is therefore not disclosed.
in conclusion, the amounts disclosed in the 
maturity	profile	above	are	significantly	lower	than	
reported	revenue	and	will	likely	not	reflect	the	
degree of certainty in future revenue (and cash 
inflows)	to	the	group	–	both	due	to	the	exemp-
tions and due to non-portfolio revenue not being 
considered part of the revenue backlog. please 
refer to contract maturity, p. 17 for further 
information.
covid-19	in	2020,	the	group’s	revenue	was	signifi-
cantly impacted by covid-19 as authorities imposed 
lockdowns and other restrictions, which caused 
customers across the globe to reduce building 
occupancy and reduce their request for services 
accordingly. the impacts on geographies, customer 
segments and our core services are described in the 
management’s	review	pp. 14-24.
in this unprecedented crisis, we have recalibrated 
service solutions to the needs and interests of 
customers and iss and to support our employees to 
the extent possible. this has resulted in increased 
uncertainty and in management making various 
judgements, estimates and assumptions in relation 
to recognition and measurement of the group’s rev-
enue, that could result in outcomes that require ad-
justments to recognised revenue in future periods.
judgements, estimates and assumptions mainly re-
lated to assessment of the impact on revenue from:
1. customers reducing their demand for services 
(contract	modifications);
2. utilisation of government support schemes;
3. variable consideration, e.g revenue contingent on 
the achievement of certain contractual kpis; and 
4. continuing service delivery to customers despite 
collectibility concerns.
contract	modifications	are	generally	agreed	with	the	
customer in accordance with contractually agreed 
change management procedures and accounted for 
going forward. however, the current situation has 
necessitated	flexibility	from	both	sides	and	required	
continuous assessments by management, among 
others in relation to how quickly iss would be able to 
implement service changes. likewise, when certain 
  accounting policy
revenue from contracts with customers is rec-
ognised when control of the services is transferred 
to	the	customer	at	an	amount	that	reflects	the	
consideration to which the group expects to be enti-
tled in exchange for those services. control is trans-
ferred over time as the customer simultaneously 
receives	and	consumes	the	benefits	provided	by	the	
group. services are invoiced on a monthly basis.
revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties, e.g. vat and duties.
the input method is used to measure progress 
towards complete satisfaction of the service due 
to the direct relationship between labour hours 
and costs incurred, and the transfer of services to 
the customer. the group recognises revenue on 
the basis of the labour hours and costs expended 
relative to the total expected labour hours and 
costs to complete the service.
for key accounts and other large contracts, the 
transaction price may include variable consider-
ation based on achievement of certain key perfor-
mance indicators. management estimates variable 
consideration based on the most likely amount 
to which it expects to be entitled on a contract 
by contract basis. management makes a detailed 
assessment of the amount of revenue expected 
to be received and the probability of success in 
each case. variable consideration is included in 
revenue as services are performed to the extent 
that it is highly probable that the amount will not 
be	subject	to	significant	reversal.
key	account	contracts	are	often	modified	in	
respect of service requirements. generally, 
modifications	are	agreed	with	the	customer	in	
accordance	with	a	specified	change	management	
procedure and accounted for going forward with 
no impact on recognised revenue up to the date 
of	modifications.
   significant accounting judgements
government support schemes have been utilised, 
management has assessed the extent to which such 
support should be passed on to customers and 
reduce revenue accordingly.
finally, for variable consideration, assessments have 
been made as to covid-19 impacting achievement of 
contractual kpis and thus reducing revenue. 
furthermore, the impact from the it security 
incident has been assessed in relation to possibly 
making	fulfilment	of	certain	contractual	kpis	or	
obligations.
gross or net presentation of revenue in some in-
stances, iss does not self-deliver all services under a 
contract, either because the service is outside our se-
lected strategic services or geographies or because 
we do not have the capabilities ourselves. in those 
cases, iss delivers services through selected part-
ners or subcontractors. this requires an assessment 
of whether revenue should be presented gross, i.e. 
based on the gross amount billed to the customer 
(iss is the principal) or based on the net amount 
retained (the amount billed to the customer less the 
amount paid to the subcontractor) because iss has 
only earned a commission fee (iss is the agent).
management considers whether the nature of its 
promise	is	to	provide	the	specified	services,	i.e.	iss	
is the principal, or its role is to arrange for another 
party to provide the services, i.e. iss is acting as an 
agent. this is based on an evaluation of whether 
iss	controls	the	specified	services	before	transfer	
to the customer. control is considered transferred 
if	iss	is	the	primary	responsible	for	fulfilment	and	
acceptability of the services or has discretion in 
setting prices.

revenue by currency
 1.3   translation and  operational 
currency risk
the group’s exposure to currency risk on 
transaction level is low since services are pro-
duced, delivered and invoiced in the same local 
currency as the functional currency of the entity 
delivering the services. the group is, however, 
exposed to risk related to translation into dkk of 
profit	or	loss	and	net	assets	of	foreign	subsid-
iaries, including intercompany items such as 
loans, royalties, management fees and interest 
payments	between	entities	with	different	
functional	currencies,	since	a	significant	portion	
of	the	group’s	revenue	and	operating	profit	is	
generated in foreign entities. the exposure to 
translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries 
is described in 4.7, currency risk.
impact on profit or loss
in 2020, changes in weighted average exchange 
rates resulted in a decrease in group revenue 
of dkk 1,390 million or 1.9% (2019: increase of 
0.8%) and an increase of the group’s operating 
profit	before	other	items	of	dkk	110	million	or	
3.8% (2019: increase of 0.6%).
1.4   other income and 
expenses, net
gain on divestments mainly related to the 
divestment of the pest control business in singa-
pore and an adjustment to prior year divestment, 
i.e. the landscaping business in the uk.
it security incident comprised unavoidable 
incremental costs incurred as a consequence 
of the it security incident, including write-
down of impaired assets, non-chargeable 
costs due to lack of documentation and certain 
customer claims and penalties. of the total 
amount, dkk 365 million related to a non-
cash write-down of impaired assets, see 3.5, 
intangible assets and 2.1, property, plant and 
equipment and leases. furthermore, around 
half of the remaining costs related to claims 
and penalties, including dkk 190 million 
related	to	a	specific	customer	claim	triggered	
by the incident and ongoing failure to meet 
certain contractually determined kpis. the 
remaining costs are mainly related to external 
consultants, hardware, software and licences 
as well as employee-related costs.

unrecognised deferred tax assets
at 31 december 2020, the group had unrec-
ognised deferred tax assets which comprised 
tax losses carried forward and other deductible 
temporary	differences	of	dkk	1,688	million	(2019:	
dkk 582 million) for continuing operations primar-
ily relating to germany, france, the netherlands 
and spain. the increase compared to 2019, was 
mainly due to valuation allowances of recognised 
tax assets following a reassessment of expected 
future taxable income.
at 31 december 2020, dkk 15 million (2019: 
dkk 175 million) of the total unrecognised 
deferred tax assets related to discontinued 
operations.
unrecognised tax losses can be carried forward 
indefinitely	in	the	individual	countries,	except	for	
the netherlands, where tax losses can be carried 
forward for 9 years. deferred tax assets have 
not been recognised in respect of the above tax 
losses as it is not deemed probable that future 
taxable	profit	will	be	available	in	the	foreseeable	
future against which the group can utilise these.

disputes with tax authorities in certain jurisdic-
tions and have been provided for in accordance 
with the accounting policies. management 
believes that the provisions made are adequate. 
however, the actual obligations may deviate as 
they depend on the result of litigations and set-
tlements with the relevant tax authorities. the 
final	outcome	of	some	of	the	ongoing	disputes	
is expected to be determined during 2021.

unrecognised deferred tax assets
   significant accounting estimates and judgements
deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried 
forward are recognised, when management assess-
es	that	these	can	be	offset	against	positive	taxable	
income in the foreseeable future. the assessment 
is made at the reporting date taking into account 
the impact from limitation in interest deductibility 
and local tax restrictions in utilisation of tax losses. 
the assessment of future taxable income is based 
on	financial	budgets	approved	by	management	and	
expectations on the operational development, mainly 
in terms of organic growth and operating margin in 
the	following	five	years	as	well	as	planned	adjust-
ments to capital structure in each country.
covid-19	had	a	significant	adverse	effect	on	the	
group’s	performance	in	2020	and	led	to	a	significant	
increase in uncertainties in general, and in particular 
in relation to future expectations and prospects for re-
covery.	consequently,	management	made	significant	
estimates, judgements and assumptions in relation 
to recognition and measurement of income tax and 
deferred tax, particularly with regards to:
1. tax losses (current year); and
2. tax losses carried forward from prior years 
 (valuation allowances).
management made a reassessment of the probabil-
ity	that	future	taxable	profit	will	be	available	in	the	
foreseeable future (5 years) against which the group 
can utilise tax losses. the assessment is based on the 
cash	flow	projections	made	for	the	purpose	of	the	
group’s impairment tests, see 3.7, impairment tests, 
and represents management’s best estimate, but is 
naturally	associated	with	significant	uncertainty.
uncertain tax positions as part of operating a 
global business, disputes with tax authorities around 
the world may occur. management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect 
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation and considers whether it is 
probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. the possible outcome of uncertain 
tax positions are measured based on management’s 
best estimate of the amount required to settle the 
obligation and recognised in deferred tax or income 
tax depending on the tax position. 
  accounting policy
deferred tax is provided using the liability method 
on	temporary	differences	between	tax	bases	of	
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. 
deferred	tax	is	not	recognised	on	temporary	differ-
ences relating to goodwill which is not deductible 
for tax purposes and other items where temporary 
differences,	apart	from	in	business	combinations,	
arose	at	the	time	of	acquisition	without	affecting	ei-
ther	net	profit	or	taxable	income.	where	alternative	
taxation rules can be applied to determine the tax 
base, deferred tax is measured according to man-
agement’s intended use of the asset or settlement 
of the liability. deferred tax is measured according 
to the taxation rules and tax rates in the respective 
countries applicable at the reporting date when the 
deferred tax becomes current tax.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax 
loss carryforwards, are recognised in non-current 
assets at the expected value of their utilisation: 
either	as	a	set-off	against	tax	on	future	income	or	as	
a	set-off	against	deferred	tax	liabilities	in	the	same	
legal tax entity and jurisdiction.
deferred	tax	assets	and	liabilities	are	offset	if	the	
group	has	a	legal	right	to	offset	these,	intends	to	
settle these on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities, simultaneously.

operating assets, liabilities 
and free cash flow
our ability to manage the capital intensity required 
to operate, grow and improve our business is par-
amount,	and	driving	strong	cash	flow	remained	a	
key priority for iss in 2020, despite  unprecedented 
challenges.
in 2020, our operating assets and liabilities as 
well	as	free	cash	flow	were	significantly	impacted	
first	and	foremost	by	external	events	in	the	
form of the global covid-19 pandemic and the 
it security incident. our four key operational 
challenges and the actions initiated to position 
us for recovery in the future, which led to re-
structuring	and	one-off	costs	of	dkk	3.5	billion,	
also	had	a	material	effect.
we generated nominal free cash flow of dkk 
(1,794)	million	(2019:	dkk	366	million),	significant-
ly impacted by the above, but also supported by 
reduced investment spend due to strict capital 
discipline and strong focus on collections.
in terms of our operating assets, trade 
receivables	were	significantly	reduced	due	to	
covid-19-related revenue reductions and a slight 
increase in loss allowances in response to the 
deterioration in the economic environment as 
well as the strong focus on collections.
other receivables also decreased due to 
covid-19, e.g. resulting in lower rebates, but 
additionally due to write-down of transition 
costs related to certain contracts in germany, 
denmark and the uk.
property, plant and equipment and leases 
decreased mainly due to the reduced invest-
ment spend as a means of mitigating the 
negative	covid-19	impact	on	cash	flows.
in regards, to our operating liabilities, provisions 
increased mainly due to restructurings initiated 
following covid-19, onerous contracts mainly in 
denmark and other contract-related risks and 
claims in germany, denmark and the uk.
trade and other payables and other liabilities 
were reduced mainly as a consequence of 
covid-19 leading to a decrease in activities  
and employees.

leases (right-of-use assets) in 2019, additions 
were reduced by dkk 300 million related to 
reassessment of extension options of certain 
properties as a result of major contract develop-
ments in the year (including major key account 
wins	and	losses)	as	well	as	the	group’s	efficiency	
programme launched in november 2019.
property, plant and equipment in 2019, addi-
tions	were	impacted	by	significant	investments	
related to the start-up of the deutsche telekom 
contract.
  accounting policy
right-of-use assets are recognised at the com-
mencement date of the lease. right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasure-
ment of lease liabilities, including extension options.
cost comprises the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs and dismantling and 
restoration cost incurred and lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received.
right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the 
estimated useful life of the asset.
certain leases have lease terms of 12 months or less 
or are leases of low-value assets, such as smaller 
cleaning	equipment,	it	equipment	and	office	furni-
ture. the “short-term lease” and “lease of low-value 
assets” recognition exemptions are applied for these 
leases, i.e. lease payments are recognised in other 
operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
property, plant and equipment is measured at 
cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
cost comprises the purchase price and costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition until the date when 
the asset is ready for use. the net present value 
of estimated liabilities related to dismantling and 
removing the asset and restoring the site on which 
the asset is located is added to the cost.
estimated useful life
properties
5-10 years
cars
3-5 years

2-5 years
subsequent costs, e.g. for replacing part of an item, 
are recognised in the cost of the asset if it is prob-
able	that	the	future	economic	benefits	embodied	
by	the	item	will	flow	to	the	group.	the	carrying	
amount of the item is derecognised when replaced 
and	transferred	to	profit	or	loss.	all	other	costs	for	
common repairs and maintenance are recognised in 
profit	or	loss	when	incurred.
depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its 
residual value. when parts of an item of property, 
plant	and	equipment	have	different	useful	lives,	they	
are accounted for separately. the estimated useful 
life and residual value are determined at the acquisi-
tion date. if the residual value exceeds the carrying 
amount depreciation is discontinued.
depreciation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reassessed at each reporting date and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
land is not depreciated.
gains and losses arising on the disposal or 
retirement of property, plant and equipment are 
measured	as	the	difference	between	the	selling	
price less direct sales costs and the carrying amount, 
and are recognised in other operating expenses in 
the year of sale, except gains and losses arising on 
disposal of property, which are recognised in other 
income and expenses, net.

in 2020, trade receivables decreased dkk 2,224 
million to dkk 9,861 million (2019: dkk 12,085 
million). covid-19 and following lockdowns leading 
to a decline in revenue was the main driver for the 
decrease as well as strong focus on collections 
to	ensure	tight	control	of	our	cash	flows.	at	31	
december 2020, utilisation of factoring was dkk 
1.0 billion (31 december 2019: dkk 1.4 billion) 
impacted by covid-19-related revenue reductions 
and the expiry of the novartis contract.
exposure to credit risk
generally, we assess the group’s exposure to 
credit	risk	as	low,	mainly	due	to	our	diversified	
customer portfolio, both in terms of geography, 
2.2   trade receivables and credit risk
industry sector, customer size and service types. 
in addition, divestments in recent years, including 
our strategic divestment programme, are aiming 
at	simplification	and	risk	reduction	and	have	
further contributed to the low risk assessment.
the maximum credit risk exposure at the report-
ing date by reportable segments is shown above.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and the 
resulting deterioration in the economic environ-
ment and increased uncertainty, the group has 
considered the impact of covid-19 on credit risk 
in general and the resulting impact on expected 
credit losses on its trade receivables, including 
an assessment of current and forward-looking 
reasonable and supportable information.
based on the assessment, management 
concluded, that the group’s exposure to credit 
risk on trade receivables had increased in 2020. 
as a result, provisions for expected credit losses 
of dkk 244 million (2019: dkk 77 million) were 
recognised	in	profit	or	loss	mainly	related	
to spain, france, indonesia and the usa. in 
addition,	write-off	of	trade	receivables	of	dkk	77	
million (2019: dkk 44 million) was recognised in 
profit	or	loss	mainly	due	to	changed	customer	
agreements and insolvent customers.
generally, the group does not hold collateral as 
security for trade receivables.
  accounting policy
trade receivables comprise invoiced and unbilled 
revenue and are recognised initially corresponding 
to the transaction price and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost. generally, due to the short-term 
nature of trade receivables, amortised cost will 
equal the invoiced amount less loss allowance for 
expected credit losses.
exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and 
expected credit losses are managed locally in the op-
erating entities and credit limits are set as deemed 
appropriate taking into account the customer’s 
financial	position	and	the	current	market	conditions.
an impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date using a provision matrix to measure 
expected credit losses. the provision rates are 
based on days past due for groupings of various 
customer segments with similar loss patterns, i.e. by 
geographical region and customer type and rating. 
the	calculation	reflects	the	probability-weighted	
outcome, the time value of money and reasonable 
and supportable information that is available at the 
reporting date about past events, current conditions 
and forecasts of future economic conditions. 
the provision matrix is initially based on the group’s 
historical observed default rates. at every reporting 
date, the historical observations are updated and 
changes in the forward-looking estimates are ana-
lysed. for instance, if forecast economic conditions 
are expected to deteriorate over the next year, e.g. 
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, this is taken 
into consideration.
generally,	trade	receivables	are	written	off	if	they	are	
past due for more than 180 days or when there is 
no reasonable expectation of recovery. impairment 
losses on trade receivables are presented as net im-
pairment	losses	within	operating	profit	before	other	
items. subsequent recovery of amounts previously 
written	off	are	credited	against	the	same	line	item.

efforts	in	recent	years	to	consolidate	the	num-
ber of suppliers and drive synergies and cost 
savings.	the	most	significant	receivables	were	
in the uk, denmark and finland. the decrease 
in 2020 related mainly to lower activity levels 
following covid-19, which led to lower rebates 
in the uk, germany, france and the usa as well 
as timing of settlement of such rebates and 
bonuses.
sign-on fees comprised upfront discounts to 
certain large customers, incurred in the ordinary 
course	of	business,	most	significantly	in	the	
uk and on certain global key accounts. the 
decrease in 2020 related mainly to ordinary 
annual amortisation.
transition and mobilisation costs comprised 
directly related costs incurred in order for iss 
to	fulfil	the	performance	obligations	under	
certain large contracts. the decrease in 2020, 
was mainly related to germany, the uk and 
denmark. due to operational challenges on 
certain contracts in these countries, we reas-
sessed the value of capitalised transition costs 
and recognised write-downs of approximately 
dkk 600 million.
other comprised refunds from customers,  
vat, accrued interests, other recoverable 
amounts including covid-19-related govern-
ment subsidies.
in 2020, other receivables decreased dkk 1,536 
million to dkk 1,567 million. due to operational 
challenges related to certain contracts in germa-
ny, denmark and the uk, we reassessed the value 
of capitalised transition costs and recognised 
write-downs of approximately dkk 600 million. in 
addition, in the uk, we saw a reduction in certain 
receivables following changed systems. further-
more, lower activity levels following covid-19, led 
to lower rebates and bonuses earned across the 
group.
prepayments to suppliers comprised various
upfront supplier payments related to ongoing
projects and above-base work (where revenue
has not yet been recognised) as well as utilities,
insurance and licenses. the majority related to the 
uk and switzerland. the decrease in 2020, related 
mainly to lower activity levels following covid-19, 
mainly in the uk and turkey as well as a reduction 
following changed systems in the uk.
in 2020, other liabilities decreased dkk 726 mil-
lion primarily due to denmark, the usa, france 
and belgium. the decrease was mainly driven 
by the lower activity level following covid-19 
lockdowns, leading to a decrease in both activity 
and employees with a resulting reduction in tax 
withholdings, vat, accrued wages and related 
social costs.
other comprised customer discounts, accrued
interests, etc.

   significant accounting judgements
capitalisation of transition and mobilisation 
costs involves management’s judgement to 
assess	if	the	criteria	for	capitalisation	are	fulfilled.	
management uses judgement to determine if 
the costs relate directly to the contract and are 
incurred	in	order	for	iss	to	be	able	to	fulfil	the	
contract. in addition, management determines 
if the costs generate resources that will be used 
in satisfying the performance obligation and are 
expected	to	be	recovered,	i.e.	reflected	in	the	
pricing of the contract.
  accounting policy
other receivables are recognised initially at cost 
and subsequently at amortised cost. due to the 
short-term nature of other receivables, amortised 
cost will equal the cost. costs relating to sales 
work and securing contracts are recognised in 
profit	and	loss	as	incurred.
transition and mobilisation costs (costs to 
fulfil	a	contract)	comprise	costs	directly	related	to	
launching certain large contracts such as transfer 
of employees from previous suppliers, site due 
diligence, planning and developing service plans. 
the cost includes internal direct costs and exter-
nal costs e.g. to consultants. 
transition and mobilisation costs as well as 
sign-on fees are capitalised and amortised over 
the initial secured contract term consistent with 
iss’s transfer of the related services to the cus-
tomer. bid-related costs are expensed as incurred.

legal and labour-related cases comprised 
various cases, mainly redundancy-related 
disputes in france and spain.
self-insurance the group carries insurance 
provisions on employers’ liability and/or workers 
compensation in the countries listed below. 
generally, the provisions for self- insurance are 
based on valuations from external actuaries. the 
countries are self-insured up to the following 
limits:
• hong kong – dkk 23.4 million  
(2019: dkk 25.7 million) yearly
• uk – dkk 24.7 million (2019: dkk 26.3 million) 
yearly aggregated limit and dkk 4.1 million 
(2019: dkk 4 million) per claim
• australia – dkk 5.8 million  
(2019: dkk 3.5 million) per claim
• usa – dkk 3.3 million (2019: dkk 3.3 million) 
per claim
furthermore, the provision included liability 
not insured under the global general liability 
insurance with a self-insured level of dkk 7.5 
million (2019: dkk 7.5 million) worldwide, except 
for the usa where the self-insurance level is 
dkk 6.1 million (2019: dkk 6.7 million) per claim. 
obligations and legal costs in relation to various 
insurance cases, if not covered by the insurance, 
were also included in the provision.
restructurings we are continuously reviewing 
our business platform to ensure the right basis 
for execution of our strategy. restructurings 
were initiated in a number of countries to adjust 
our cost structure to the lower activity level fol-
lowing covid-19. the initiatives include contract 
exits, termination of redundant employees and 
various reductions of overhead costs, mainly in 
countries, services and customer segments that 
were heavily impacted by covid-19. in 2020, a 
provision for restructuring costs of dkk 1,174 
million was recognised and related predomi-
nantly to germany, france, spain, and the uk.
onerous contracts in 2020, a provision was 
recognised in relation to the danish defence 
contract in denmark following a reassessment 
of	the	expected	future	profitability	of	the	
contract. in addition, management made a 
reassessment of the underlying assumptions of 
the onerous contract in hong kong due to an 
expected extension by the customer leading to 
an increase in the provision from 2019.
other comprised various obligations such as 
contract-related risks, guarantee reserves, dis-
mantling costs and closure of contracts. in 2020, 
the addition mainly related to contract-related 
risks and claims in germany, denmark and the 
uk. in the uk, a detailed review of the business 
platform was performed in h1 2020 on the back 
of	the	risks	identified	in	2019.	the	review	led	to	
full utilisation of the amount provided in 2019 
and	identification	of	certain	additional	one-off	
costs, some of which had not been provided for 
in prior years.

2.6   changes in working capital
changes in receivables the positive impact 
was driven by strong focus on collections of trade 
receivables and the general reduction in activity 
caused by covid-19. further, other receivables 
decreased, mainly due to write-down of certain 
capitalised transition costs in germany, denmark 
and the uk and a reduction in certain receivables 
following changed systems in the uk.
utilisation of factoring was reduced from dkk 
1.4 billion in 2019 to dkk 1.0 billion in 2020 
due to the covid-19-related revenue reductions 
and the expiry of the novartis contract on 31 
december 2019.
change in payables the negative impact was 
mainly driven by covid-19 leading to a decrease 
in both activities and employees with a resulting 
reduction in trade and other payables as well 
as tax withholdings, vat, accrued wages and 
related social charges.
furthermore, we saw an increase in the share of 
self-delivered services in 2020 leading to reduced 
payables relating to subcontractors. finally, in some 
countries statutory requirements on payment 
terms led to a slight acceleration of payments.

   significant accounting estimates and judgements
onerous contracts our strategy to focus on large 
key accounts will increasingly lead to a customer base 
comprising large, more complex contracts. the size 
and complexity of such contracts will often require us 
to	incur	significant	transition	and	mobilisation	costs	
before	service	delivery	commences	in	order	to	fulfill	
the performance obligations under the contract.
management assesses whether contracts may 
be onerous by estimating the expected future 
profitability.	this	involves	estimating	total	contract	
revenue and the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the performance obligations under the contract, 
including any transition and mobilisation costs in-
curred.	in	estimating	the	expected	future	profitability	
management makes judgements. certain contracts 
are complex facility management partnerships. in 
estimating unavoidable costs in relation to such 
contracts, management applies assumptions as to 
future	realisation	of	costs	driven	by	efficiencies	and	
optimisations to be gained over the contract term 
as	well	as	the	effect	of	performance	improvement	
initiatives. while iss has inherent risk in this respect, 
iss is by nature also dependent on aligning interest 
with the customer within the framework of the 
agreement	for	the	benefit	of	both	parties.	further,	
management makes judgements related to the 
contract term, taking any termination and extension 
options into consideration.
for large and complex contracts, the outcome may 
vary	significantly	should	the	assumptions	and	judge-
ments applied not be realised as expected by man-
agement in their assessment of onerous contracts.
management makes judgements related to other 
provisions for various other matters and obligations, 
including related to which assumptions to apply 
under the relevant scenarios for an expected out-
come. in assessing the likely outcome of lawsuits, tax 
disputes etc., management bases its assessment on 
external legal assistance and established precedents.
  accounting policy
provisions are recognised if the group, as a result 
of a past event, has a present legal or constructive 
obligation,	and	it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	of	
economic	benefits	will	be	required	to	settle	the	
obligation. the costs required to settle the obligation 
are discounted using the entity’s average borrowing 
rate,	if	this	significantly	impacts	the	measurement	of	
the liability.
restructuring costs are recognised in provi-
sions when a detailed, formal restructuring plan is 
announced	to	the	affected	parties	on	or	before	the	
reporting date.
onerous contracts a provision is recognised when 
the	expected	benefits	to	be	derived	by	the	group	
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs 
of meeting the obligations under the contract.
asset retirement obligation if the group has a 
legal obligation to dismantle or remove an asset 
or restore a site or leased facilities when vacated, a 
provision is recognised corresponding to the present 
value of expected future costs. the present value of 
the obligation is included in the cost of the relevant 
tangible or right-of-use asset and depreciated 
accordingly.

strategic divestments 
and acquisitions 
our	divestment	activities	in	2020	were	signifi-
cantly	impacted	by	covid-19,	which	effectively	
put most negotiations on hold in q2. however, 
in the second half of the year, negotiations were 
reinitiated, which led to the divestment of brazil, 
malaysia and thailand. 
in december 2020, we announced our refreshed 
strategy, oneiss, and added three countries and 
several business units to our strategic divest-
ment programme.
as such, by the end of 2020 we had divested 
seven countries out of the total 18 countries 
to be divested. furthermore, in november we 
reached an agreement to divest slovenia with 
expected completion in q1 2021.
in terms of business units, we divested some 
minor non-core activities in 2020 in austria, 
singapore, poland, bulgaria and sri lanka as 
well as the parking management business in 
indonesia,	which	was	classified	as	held	for	sale	at	
31 december 2019.
at 31 december 2020, 14 businesses were classi-
fied	as	held	for	sale	comprising	11	countries	and	
three business units. assets and liabilities held 
for sale amounted to dkk 1,861 million and dkk 
838 million, respectively.
in 2020, our strategic divestment programme 
resulted in a net loss of dkk 89 million being 
recognised	in	the	profit	or	loss	stemming	from	
divestments completed and fair value remea-
surements of discontinued operations and 
businesses	classified	as	held	for	sale.	the	net	
loss was recognised in: 
• other income and expenses, net,  
dkk 71 million (loss)
• goodwill impairment, dkk 32 million (loss)
• net	profit	from	discontinued	operations,	 
dkk 14 million (gain)
in 2020, intangible assets decreased dkk 
2,047 million to dkk 22,518 million, partly as 
a result of our divestment programme, which 
led to fair value remeasurements as mentioned 
above	and	reclassifications	to	assets	held	for	
sale. furthermore, an impairment loss of dkk 
400 million was recognised in france due to 
the reassessment of business plans following 
covid-19. in addition, the it security incident led 
to damage to certain software and a write-down 
of dkk 365 million.

businesses classified as held for sale
at 31 december 2020, 14 businesses (2019: 13 
businesses)	were	classified	as	held	for	sale	com-
prising 11 countries (discontinued operations) 
and three business units in continental europe, 
asia	&	pacific	and	americas,	respectively.
in 2020, we divested three countries (discontin-
ued operations), the activities in bulgaria and 
the parking management business in indonesia. 
furthermore, a business in northern europe 
was	reclassified	as	held	for	use	in	q1	2020.	
additionally, as part of the strategy refresh 
announced in december 2020, three countries 
were	classified	as	held	for	sale	and	discontinued	
operations, see 3.1, discontinued operations, 
as well as two new businesses in continental 
europe and americas. 
profit or loss effect
in 2020, divestments and fair value remea-
surements of discontinued operations and 
businesses	classified	as	held	for	sale	resulted	
in recognition of a net loss of dkk 89 million in 
the	profit	or	loss.	the	net	loss	is	specified	in	the

• other income and expenses, net,  
dkk 71 million (loss)
• goodwill impairment, dkk 32 million (loss)
• net	profit	from	discontinued	operations,	 
dkk 14 million (gain)
recycling of accumulated foreign exchange 
adjustments recognised in equity had a positive 
impact on the net loss of dkk 105 million, mainly 
related to brazil and thailand. 
   significant accounting estimates 
and judgements
non-current assets and disposal groups are clas-
sified	as	held	for	sale	when	management	assess-
es that their carrying amounts will be recovered 
through a sale rather than continuing use within 
one year. management assesses whether the sale 
is highly probable and the asset or disposal group 
is available for immediate sale in its current condi-
tion. actions required to complete the sale should 
indicate	that	it	is	unlikely	that	significant	changes	
to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell 
will be withdrawn.
if a sale has not been concluded within one year, the 
period is extended if management assesses that the 
above	criteria	continue	to	be	fulfilled.	in	2020,	ongo-
ing	sales	processes	have	been	affected	by	covid-19 
as countries around the world have been locked 
down and economic conditions have been unstable. 
these circumstances beyond our control have 
caused a delay in sales processes and negotiations. 
management is committed to the divestments and 
assesses that they continue to be highly probable 
and expected to be concluded in 2021.
on	classification	management	estimates	the	fair	
value	(the	final	sales	price	and	expected	costs	to	
sell). depending on the nature of the non-current 
assets and the disposal group’s activity, assets and 
liabilities, the estimated fair value may be associat-
ed with uncertainty. measurement of the fair value 
is categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy 
as it is not based on observable market data.
management considers intangible assets relating 
to the disposal groups, taking into consideration 
how to separate the net assets (including intan-
gible assets) relating to the disposal group from 
the group’s assets in the continuing business. 
impairment of these intangibles, both on initial 
classification	as	held	for	sale	and	subsequently,	is	
considered. the estimation uncertainty relating 
to impairment of intangibles is described in 3.7, 
impairment tests.
  accounting policy
assets held for sale comprise non-current as-
sets and disposal groups held for sale. liabilities 
held for sale are those directly associated with 
the assets held for sale and disposal groups. 
immediately	before	classification	as	held	for	
sale, they are remeasured in accordance with the 
group’s accounting policies. thereafter, they are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. any impairment 
loss	is	first	allocated	to	goodwill,	and	then	pro	rata	
to remaining assets, except that no loss is allo-
cated	to	inventories,	financial	assets,	deferred	tax	
assets	or	employee	benefit	assets,	which	continue	
to be measured in accordance with the group’s 
accounting	policies.	once	classified	as	held	for	
sale, assets are not amortised or depreciated.

assuming all acquisitions and divestments in 
the year were included/excluded as of 1 january, 
the	effect	on	recognised	revenue	and	operating	
profit	before	other	items	is	estimated	as	follows:
pro	forma	revenue	and	operating	profit	before	
other items include adjustments relating to 
acquisitions and divestments estimated by local 
iss management at the time of acquisition and 
divestment or actual results where available. 
the	estimates	are	based	on	unaudited	financial

  accounting policy
gain or loss on disposal of an operation that is 
part of a cgu, includes a portion of the related 
goodwill allocated to that cgu. goodwill related 
to the disposed operation is measured based on 
the fair value of the disposed operation relative to 
the fair value of the entire cgu.

   significant accounting judgements
the carrying amount of brands is mainly related 
to the iss brand, which is considered to have an 
indefinite	useful	life	since	there	is	no	foreseeable	
limit to the period over which the brand is expected 
to	generate	net	cash	inflows.	factors	that	played	a	
significant	role	in	determining	that	the	iss	brand	has	
an	indefinite	useful	life	are:	 
  accounting policy
goodwill is initially recognised at cost and subse-
quently at cost less accumulated impairment losses, 
see 3.7, impairment tests. goodwill is not amortised. 
goodwill relates mainly to assembled workforce, 
technical expertise and technological knowhow.
acquisition-related brands and customer 
contracts are recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. subsequently, brands with 
indefinite	useful	lives	are	measured	at	cost	less	
accumulated impairment losses. brands with 
finite	useful	lives	and	customer	contracts	are	
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses.
acquired software and other intangible assets 
are measured at cost less accumulated amortisa-
tion and impairment losses. the cost of software 
developed for internal use includes external costs 
to consultants and software as well as internal 
direct and indirect costs related to the develop-
ment. other development costs for which it can-
not be rendered probable that future economic 
benefits	will	flow	to	the	group	are	recognised	in	
profit	or	loss	as	and	when	incurred.
amortisation methods and useful lives are reas-
sessed at the reporting date and adjusted prospec-
tively, if appropriate. from 2020, amortisation of all 
intangible	assets	with	finite	useful	lives	is	calculated	
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives. in prior years, certain software developed for 
customer	specific	use	was	amortised	over	the	pe-
riod of the revenue generating activities based on 
the number of actual users in the period relative to 
the estimated future total number of users.

3.7  impairment tests
cash-generating units (cgus)
impairment tests are generally carried out per 
country as this represents the lowest level of 
cgus to which the carrying amount of intan-
gibles, i.e. goodwill and customer contracts, 
can be allocated and monitored with any 
reasonable certainty. this level of allocation and 
monitoring of intangibles should be seen in light 
of the group’s strategy to integrate acquired 
companies as quickly as possible in order to 
benefit	from	synergies.	management	of	certain	
countries has been combined to take advantage 
of similarities in terms of markets, shared cus-
tomers and cost synergies. in such exceptional 
cases, the countries are regarded as one cgu 
when performing the impairment tests.
measuring recoverable amounts  
(general assumptions)
the recoverable amount of each cgu is 
determined on the basis of its value-in-use, 
calculated using certain key assumptions per 
cgu, i.e. revenue growth, operating margin and 
discount rate.
value-in-use	cash	flow	projections	for	the	
individual	cgus	are	based	on	financial	budgets	
for the following year as approved by man-
agement. assumptions applied in the short to 
medium	term	(forecasting	period	of	five	years)	
generally	reflect	management’s	expectations	
considering all relevant factors, including the 
group’s strategic initiatives, local initiatives, past 
experience and external sources of information, 
where possible and relevant.
in	2020,	management	has	ensured	that	financial	
budgets, forecasts and underlying assumptions 
applied in the impairment tests have been 
updated	to	reflect	the	expected	impact	from	
covid-19, including the increased level of uncer-
tainty in terms of future recovery. furthermore, 
expected impacts from our refreshed strategy, 
oneiss, have been considered, especially 
around sharpened focus on key accounts and 
the divestment programme as well as accelerat-
ed technology investments and changes to the 
global operating model. our four key operational 
challenges (deutsche telekom, danish defence, 
the uk and france) have also been considered 
in	determining	key	assumptions	for	the	specific	
cgus. where relevant, initiated restructurings 
and other actions in response to covid-19 and 
our key operational challenges have been taken 
into consideration when estimating the expected 
future	performance	and	cash	flows.

   significant accounting estimates
in performing the impairment test manage-
ment assesses whether the cgu to which the 
intangibles relate will be able to generate positive 
net	cash	flows	sufficient	to	support	the	value	of	
intangibles and other net assets. this assessment 
is based on estimates of expected future cash 
flows	(value-in-use)	as	described	in	“measuring	
recoverable amounts”.
in 2020, covid-19	led	to	a	significant	increase	
in uncertainties in general, and particularly in 
relation to future expectations and prospects for 
recovery. the impact on the group’s performance 
and	cash	flows	is	described	under	“covid-19	
impact on risk assessment”.
covid-19 impact on risk assessment
in	2020,	covid-19	had	a	significant	adverse	ef-
fect	on	the	group’s	performance	and	cash	flows,	
which	led	to	substantial	deviations	from	financial	
budgets and forecasts in several countries. the 
severity of the impact varied from country to 
country depending on service mix and exposure 
to industry segments. these are also factors 
impacting the prospects for and timing of future 
recovery – in addition to several other factors, 
like the general macroeconomic environment 
and our own initiatives and actions.
during	2020,	covid-19	had	a	significant	impact	
on	market	fluctuations,	including	interest	rates.	
by	the	end	of	the	year,	fluctuations	have	to	
some degree stabilised with interest rates being 
below	the	2019	level	and	thus	largely	offsetting	
the covid-19 premium.
most of our cgus expect a gradual recovery 
during 2021, and for some countries, continuing 
into 2022. however, in general the level of 
uncertainty	is	significantly	increased.	to	account	
for the increased estimation uncertainty, 
management has included a separate risk 
premium in the 2020 impairment test based 
on	the	identified	risks	and	uncertainties	of	the	
individual cgus. the new risk premium is added 
to	the	country	specific	discount	rate.
result of the impairment tests
in 2020, an impairment loss of dkk 400 million 
was recognised in france at 30 june 2020 as 
described below. based on the impairment 
tests performed at 31 december 2020, it is 
managements opinion that excess values are 
fairly resilient to any likely and reasonable 
deteriorations in the key assumptions applied. 
as a result, no further impairment losses were 
recognised in 2020.
france at 30 june 2020, the impairment test for 
france resulted in recognition of an impairment 
loss on goodwill of dkk 400 million. the loss was 
due to a reassessment of the business plans 
following covid-19 leading to lowered margin 
expectations for the terminal period as a result of 
expected long-term reduction of activity levels and 
profitability	of	certain	customers.	additionally,	delay	
of	expected	realisation	of	benefits	from	the	ongoing	
reorganisation had a negative impact. carrying 
amount of goodwill, applied assumptions as well as 
sensitivities are illustrated below. the impairment 
test performed for france at 31 december 2020 did 
not result in further impairment losses.
impairment test of the iss brand
the carrying amount of the iss brand is tested at 
group	level	based	on	group-wide	cash	flows	(ag-
gregate	cash	flows	determined	for	each	cgu)	less	
the total carrying amount of the group’s goodwill 
and other non-current assets. the total value-in-use 
of the group and the market capitalisation of the 
group	both	significantly	exceed	reported	equity.	
accordingly,	no	impairment	loss	has	been	identified.

carrying amount and key assumptions
the carrying amount of intangibles and key 
assumptions 1) for cgus representing more than 
5% of intangibles, or cgus considered to be 
at high risk of impairment or having incurred 
recent impairment losses, are disclosed below.

  accounting policy
intangible	assets	with	an	indefinite	useful	life,	i.e.	
goodwill and the iss brand, are subject to impair-
ment testing annually or when circumstances in-
dicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. 
the carrying amount of other non-current assets is 
tested annually for indications of impairment.
if an indication of impairment exists, the recover-
able amount of the asset is determined, i.e. the 
higher of the fair value of the asset less antici-
pated costs of disposal and its value-in-use. the 
value-in-use is calculated as the present value of 
expected	future	cash	flows	from	the	asset	or	the	
cgu to which the asset belongs.
the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for 
impairment together with the other non-current 
assets in the cgu to which goodwill is allocated. 
management believes that the value of the iss 
brand supports the iss group in its entirety rather 
than any individual cgu. accordingly, the iss 
brand is tested for impairment at group level. the 
impairment	test	is	based	on	group-wide	cash	flows	
adjusted for the group’s total goodwill and other 
non-current assets.
an impairment loss is recognised in the statement 
of	profit	or	loss	in	a	separate	line	if	the	carrying	
amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimat-
ed recoverable amount.
an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not 
reversed. in respect of other assets, impairment 
losses are only reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. an impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.

sensitivity analysis
a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in the 
impairment testing is presented below. 
the allowed change represents the percentage 
points by which the value assigned to the key as-
sumption can change, all other things being equal, 
before the cgu’s recoverable amount equals its 
carrying amount. no sensitivity is shown for the iss 
brand,	as	the	group-wide	cash	flows	adjusted	for	
the group’s total goodwill and other non-current 
assets	significantly	exceed	the	carrying	amount.

capital structure
it is, and remains, our primary capital allocation 
priority to ensure that we maintain a strong and ef-
ficient	balance	sheet	and	that	our	liquidity	position	
supports our operational needs and our continued 
strategy execution even in times of turmoil.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, strong focus 
on our liquidity position was necessary through-
out 2020. total available liquidity at 31 december 
2020 was dkk 14,059 million (2019: dkk 8,405 
million) supported by additional credit facilities of 
eur 700 million maturing 31 march 2022, which 
remained undrawn at 31 december 2020.
we also successfully issued a 5-year emtn bond 
of eur 500 million. the net proceeds were 
used for early repayment of eur 300 million 
emtns maturing in january 2021 and to further 
strengthen the group’s liquidity position.
at 31 december 2020, we had no unaddressed 
material debt maturities until 2024 onwards and 
no	financial	covenants	in	our	capital	structure.	we	
are committed to our financial policy of maintain-
ing	an	investment	grade	financial	profile	with	a	
financial	leverage	below	2.8x	pro	forma	adjusted	
ebitda taking seasonality into account. at 31 
december	2020,	the	financial	leverage	was	(11.5)
x (2019: 3.0x) due to operating losses driven by 
covid-19, our key operational challenges as well 
as	restructuring	and	one-off	costs.	adjusted	for	
restructuring	and	one-off	costs,	financial	leverage	
was 7.3x.
in december 2020, we announced a turnaround 
leverage target of below 3.0x to be achieved 
by	31	december	2022.	we	expect	a	significant	
reduction in 2021 as operating performance 
and	cash	flows	are	expected	to	gradually	
improve. to further support the achievement 
of the turnaround leverage target, no dividend 
payment or share buyback will be made in 2021 
and 2022 as our leverage target is not expected 
to be met until by the end of 2022.

at 31 december 2020, iss’s share capital com-
prised a total of dkk 185,668,226 shares (2019: 
185,668,226) with a nominal value of dkk 1 each. 
all shares were fully paid and freely transferable.
iss has one class of shares, and no shares carry 
special rights. each share gives the holder the 
right to one vote at our general meetings. 
dividend
on 20 march 2020, iss withdrew the proposal to 
pay an ordinary dividend of dkk 7.70 per share 
for	2019	resulting	in	the	net	profit	for	2019	being	
allocated to retained earnings.
the withdrawal of the proposed dividend 
was carried out in light of the extraordinary 
circumstances relating to covid-19, and as a 
precautionary measure to support our liquidity 
position	and	financial	leverage.	based	on	our	
ordinary dividend policy targeting a pay-out 
ratio	of	50%	of	net	profit	(adjusted),	the	board	of	
directors will not propose a dividend for 2020. 
furthermore, no dividend payment or share 
buyback will be made in 2021 and 2022 as our 
leverage target is not expected to be met until 
by the end of 2022.

on full realisation of a foreign entity where control 
is lost the accumulated foreign exchange adjust-
ments	are	transferred	to	profit	or	loss	in	the	same	
line item as the gain or loss.

refinancing
in 2020, iss finance b.v., a 100% owned subsid-
iary of iss global a/s successfully issued emtn 
bonds for a principal amount of eur 500 million 
maturing in 2025. the notes were issued under 
iss global a/s’s eur 3 billion emtn programme. 
the net proceeds were used for early repayment 
in november 2020 of the remaining eur 300 
million emtns maturing in january 2021.
financing fees 
in	2020,	financing	fees	amounting	to	dkk	
33 million (2019: dkk 41 million) have been 
recognised in loans and borrowings while 
financing	fees	of	dkk	22	million	(2019:	dkk	27	
million) have been amortised and recognised 
in	financial	expenses.	accumulated	financing	
fees recognised in loans and borrowings at 31 
december 2020 amounted to dkk 104 million 
(2019: dkk 93 million).
fair value 
the fair value of loans and borrowings was dkk 
19,027 million (2019: dkk 17,928 million). the fair 
value of bonds is based on the quoted market 
price on the luxembourg stock exchange and 
measurement is categorised as level 1 in the 
fair value hierarchy. for the remaining loans and 
borrowings, fair value is equal to the nominal 
value as illustrated in 4.5, interest rate risk. 
  accounting policy
issued bonds and bank loans are recognised 
initially at fair value net of directly attributable 
transaction costs and subsequently at amortised 
cost	using	the	effective	interest	method.	any	
difference	between	the	proceeds	initially	received	
and the nominal value is recognised in financial 
expenses over the term of the loan.
amortisation of financing fees at the date of 
borrowing	financing	fees	are	recognised	as	part	
of	loans	and	borrowings.	subsequently,	financing	
fees are amortised over the term of the loan and 
recognised in financial expenses. 
lease liabilities at the commencement date, the 
group recognises lease liabilities at the present val-
ue of the lease payments to be made over the lease 
term.	lease	payments	include	fixed	payments	less	
any incentive payments, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or rate, e.g. when a mini-
mum indexation is applied, and amounts expected 
to be paid under residual value guarantees. lease 
payments also include the exercise price of a pur-
chase option reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the group and payment of penalties for terminating 
a	lease,	if	the	lease	term	reflects	the	group	exer-
cising the option to terminate. the present value is 
calculated using the group’s incremental borrowing 
rate if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not 
readily determinable.
subsequently the lease liability is measured at 
amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method.	
the	liability	is	increased	to	reflect	the	accretion	of	
interest and reduced for the lease payments made. 
the	liability	is	remeasured	due	to	a	modification,	a	
change in lease term or a change in the assessment 
to purchase the underlying asset. also, the liability 
is remeasured due to a change in future lease 
payments (e.g. a change in an index or rate) or due 
to a change in the group’s estimate of the amount 
expected to be payable under a residual guarantee.

arrangements.	iss	does	not	use	reverse	factoring	or	supply	chain	financing	of	own	payables.
foreign exchange gains mainly related to gain 
on external loans and borrowings denominated in 
eur	partly	offset	by	losses	on	intercompany	loans	
from the parent company. in addition, fair value 
adjustments of currency swaps were included.
interest expenses on loans and borrowings 
were impacted by commitment fees relating to 
the new undrawn eur 700 million revolving cred-
it	facility.	these	additional	costs	were	partly	offset	
by lower interest expenses on bonds leaving the 
interest expense at the same level as 2019.
4.3  financial income and expenses
forward premiums on currency swaps iss 
uses currency swaps to hedge the exposure 
to currency risk on intercompany loans. the 
cost	of	hedging	in	2020	decreased	significantly	
compared to 2019, primarily driven by reduced 
interest rate spreads and a lower amount of 
eur/usd swaps during 2020.
4.4  financial risk management
the	group	is	exposed	to	a	number	of	financial	
risks	arising	from	its	operating	and	financing	
activities, mainly interest rate risk, liquidity risk, 
currency risk and credit risk. 
financial risks are managed centrally by group 
treasury based on the financial policy, which is 
reviewed and approved annually by the board 
of directors. it is considered on an ongoing 
basis	if	the	financial	risk	management	approach	
appropriately adresses the risk exposures. 
it is the group’s policy to mitigate risk exposure 
derived from its business activities. group policy 
does not allow taking speculative positions in 
the	financial	markets.	
the group’s objectives and policies for measur-
ing and managing risk exposure are explained in: 
• 4.5, interest rate risk;
• 4.6, liquidity risk; and
• 4.7, currency risk.
credit risk on trade receivables and currency risk 
(operational) are described in:
• 2.2, trade receivables and credit risk; and
• 1.3, translation and operational currency risk.
at 31 december 2020, the exposure to credit risk 
related to cash and cash equivalents and other 
financial	items	was	dkk	2,841	million	(2019:	dkk	
2,775 million). it is the group’s policy to transact 
only	with	financial	institutions	with	at	least	
a-1/p-1 credit ratings. group treasury monitors 
credit ratings on an ongoing basis and approves 
exceptions to credit rating requirements.

exposure
interest rate risk arises from the possibility 
that	changes	in	interest	rates	will	affect	fu-
ture	cash	flows	or	the	fair	value	of	financial	
instruments. exposure relates to bank loans 
with	floating	interest	rates.
low risk
• 97% of the group’s bank loans and 
bonds	carried	fixed	interest	rates	at	31	
december 2020 (2019: 98%)
• duration	of	gross	debt	(fixed-rate	period)	
of 5.0 years at 31 december 2020 (2019: 
5.5 years)
• exposure primarily related to eur de-
nominated	bank	loans	with	floating	rates
risk management policy
• at least 50% of the group’s bank loans 
and	issued	bonds	must	carry	fixed	inter-
est rates directly or through derivatives
• duration	of	gross	debt	(fixed-rate	period)	
shall be 2-6 years
• currently, the group does not use 
interest rate swaps
mitigation
• the	balance	between	fixed	and	variable	
interest rates and gross debt duration 
(fixed-rate	period)	is	measured	on	a	
monthly basis
4.5  interest rate risk
1) in addition, a utilisation fee applies based on the actual level of utilisation. 
interest rate sensitivity
an increase in relevant interest rates of 1%-point 
would	have	decreased	net	profit	by	dkk	5	
million (2019: decreased by dkk 3 million).
the	estimate	was	based	on	the	group’s	floating	
rate loans and borrowings, i.e. disregarding 
cash and cash equivalents, as the level at 31 
december is typically the highest in the year 
and not a representative level for the purpose of 
this analysis. the analysis assumes that all other 
variables remain constant.
in addition, at 31 december 2020, the net 
forward position of intercompany loan hedges 
(excluding eur/dkk hedges) was dkk 1.9 billion 
(2019: dkk 2.1 billion) of which usd represents 
dkk 1.8 billion (2019: dkk 1.8 billion). an 
increase of 1%-point in relevant interest rates 
versus eur/dkk interest rates would have 
increased the annual cost (forward premium) by 
dkk 19 million (2019: increased dkk 21 million) 
and	consequently	decreased	net	profit	and	
equity with the same amount.

4.6  liquidity risk
exposure
liquidity risk results from the group’s 
potential	inability	or	difficulty	in	meeting	the	
contractual obligations associated with its 
financial	liabilities	due	to	insufficient	liquid-
ity.	the	group	monitors	its	risk	of	insuffi-
cient liquidity centrally in group treasury. 
low risk
• no short-term maturities
• no	financial	covenants
• diversified	funding;	bonds	and	bank	loans
• additional credit lines secured due to 
covid-19
risk management policy
• maintain an appropriate level of short- 
and long-term liquidity reserves (liquid 
funds and committed credit facilities)
• maintain	a	smooth	maturity	profile	in	
terms	of	different	maturities
• maintain	access	to	diversified	funding	
sources
mitigation
• raising capital is managed centrally 
in	group	treasury	to	ensure	efficient	
liquidity management 
• liquidity is transferred to/from iss 
global a/s, which operates as the group’s 
internal bank
• for day-to-day liquidity management 
cash pools have been established in the 
majority of the local entities
furthermore, the group has other local 
credit facilities, which are not part of the senior 
unsecured facilities. at 31 december 2020, 
other local credit facilities amounted to dkk 0.9 
billion of which dkk 0.4 billion was unused (31 
december 2019: dkk 1.0 billion of which dkk 
0.8 billion was unused).
not readily available cash is considered 
readily available if it is available for upstreaming 
to	the	parent	company	(iss	a/s)	within	five	days.	
in a number of countries, it is assessed that 
transfer	to	iss	a/s	would	take	more	than	five	
days due to local administrative processes, and 
liquidity reserves
to	manage	the	effect	of	covid-19	on	liquidity	
risk, management has taken several initiatives to 
ensure	sufficiently	available	liquidity,	including	
withdrawal of the proposed dividend for 2019 
and securing new credit facilities. as a result, 
readily available liquidity at 31 december 2020 
increased	significantly	to	dkk	14,059	million	
(2019: dkk 8,405 million).
cash and cash equivalents at dkk 2,742 
million	reflects	the	strong	liquidity	position	of	
the group. the level is typically highest at 31 
december and not a representative level for the 
rest of the year. 
restricted cash dkk 37 million of the total cash 
and cash equivalents at 31 december 2020 was 
placed on blocked or restricted bank accounts 
due to legal cases and tax-related circumstances.
unused revolving credit facilities the group 
has a eur 1 billion revolving credit facility 
maturing in november 2024. in addition, in 
2020 the group has secured additional credit 
facilities	of	eur	700	million	from	a	club	of	five	
banks that were undrawn at 31 december 
2020. the eur 700 million facility matures on 
31 march 2022.

reflects	the	one-sided	scenario	of	cash	outflows	
only.	trade	payables	and	other	financial	liabilities	
are	mainly	used	to	finance	assets	such	as	trade	
receivables and property, plant and equipment.

4.7  currency risk
exposure
currency	risk	is	the	risk	that	arises	from	changes	in	exchange	rates,	and	affects	the	group’s	
result,	investments	or	value	of	financial	instruments.
low risk
the	group	generally	benefits	from	a	natural	hedge	in	having	costs,	investments	and	income	in	
the same functional currency country by country. currency risk therefore predominantly arises 
from funding and investments in subsidiaries.
• 97.1% of the group’s loans and borrowings (external) were denominated in eur at 31 decem-
ber 2020 (2019: 98.5%)
• including the impact of net investment hedges, 81.0% (2019: 76.4%) of the group’s external 
borrowings were denominated in eur
risk management policy
• it is group policy to pool funding activities centrally and fund investments in subsidiaries 
through a combination of intercompany loans and equity
• currency risk on intercompany loans is as a main policy hedged against dkk or eur when 
exposure exceeds dkk 5 million. some currencies cannot be hedged within a reasonable price 
range in which case correlation to a proxy currency is considered and, if deemed appropriate, 
proxy hedging is applied
• currency risk on net investments is as a main policy hedged against dkk or eur when annual 
ebitda of the relevant functional currency corresponds to 5% or more of group ebitda up to 
an amount of 3-5x ebitda in the relevant functional currency and adjusted as appropriate to 
relevant market entry and exit risk
• exposure	to	eur	is	monitored	but	not	hedged	due	to	the	fixed	rate	exchange	policy	between	
dkk/eur
• our currency hedging exposes us to interest spread risk, see sensitivity analysis in note 4.5, 
interest rate risk
mitigation
• currency swaps are used to hedge the exposure to currency risk on loans and borrowings 
(external) and intercompany balances. as changes in the fair value of both the hedged item 
and	the	currency	swap	are	recognised	in	profit	or	loss,	hedge	accounting	is	not	applied		
• exposure on loans and borrowings, intercompany balances and cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at least on a weekly basis to evaluate the need for hedging currency positions 
• currency swaps (net investment hedges) or debt is used to hedge the currency exposure to 
investments in subsidiaries. as hedge accounting is applied (other than for eur) changes in fair 
value impact equity

net investment hedges  
– foreign currency sensitivity
a 10%-change in currencies, with all other 
variables held constant, would have changed the 
fair value recognised in other comprehensive 
income of gbp with dkk 7 million, of usd with 
dkk 14 million and of chf with dkk 58 million.
the	effect	of	translation	of	net	assets	in	foreign	
subsidiaries	before	the	effect	of	net	investment	
hedges decreased equity by dkk 750 million 
(2019: an increase of dkk 363 million) primarily 
related to the usa, the uk, turkey and singapore. 
the lower level of net investment hedges in 
2020 compared to 2019 is mainly driven by 
the operational challenges, restructuring and 
one-off	costs	in	the	uk	as	described	throughout	
this annual report.
  accounting policy
derivative	financial	intruments	are	initially	
recognised at fair value at the trade date and 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
the	fair	value	of	derivative	financial	instruments	
is calculated on the basis of current market data 
and in accordance with generally accepted valu-
ation methods. measurement is categorised as 
level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as it is not based 
on observable market data.
for	derivative	financial	instruments	used	as	net	
investment	hedges,	changes	in	the	effective	
portion of the fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the 
translation reserve in equity until the hedged 
transaction is realised. gains or losses relating to 
the	ineffective	portion	are	recognised	in	profit	or	
loss	in	financial	income	or	financial	expenses.	on	
disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative 
value of any such gains or losses recognised in 
equity	is	transferred	to	profit	or	loss.
the	fair	value	of	derivative	financial	instruments	
is presented in other receivables or loans and 
borrowings.

remuneration
at iss, remuneration is based on responsibilities, 
competencies and performance and is designed 
to	be	competitive,	affordable	and	in	line	with	
market practice of comparable listed companies.
to	drive	delivery	of	short-	and	long-term	finan-
cial results, retention of leaders and alignment 
to shareholder value creation, the group has im-
plemented two types of share-based incentive 
programmes:
• a long-term incentive programme (ltip)
• a special incentive programme (sip)
under the ltip, which has been in place since 
2014, performance share units (psus) are 
granted annually to plan participants consisting 
of around 120-150 senior leaders. each psu 
entitles the holder to receive one share at no 
cost after three years, subject to achievement 
of certain eps and tsr performance criteria. 
performance criteria of the latest two vested 
programmes, ltip 2017 and ltip 2018, were not 
achieved and they vested at 0%.
in december 2020, our refreshed strategy, 
oneiss, was announced, including introduction 
of	a	new	sip	to	selected	leaders	–	specifically	
introduced to motivate the implementation of 
oneiss and behaviour consistent with the iss 
values and leadership competency framework.
under the sip, restricted share units (rsus) 
are granted to the participants consisting of 
around 30 senior leaders. each rsu entitles 
the holder to receive one share at no cost, 
subject to achievement of individual service 
or performance criteria upon vesting in either 
2022 or 2023.
the group has several pension plans of which 
the	majority	are	defined	contribution	plans	with	
no further payment obligation once the contri-
butions are paid. the group also has a number 
of	defined	benefit	plans	where	the	responsibility	
for the pension obligation towards the employ-
ees,	rests	with	the	group,	most	significantly	in	
switzerland and the uk, which accounted for 
86% of the group’s obligation (gross).

5.2  share-based payments
to	drive	delivery	of	short-	and	long-term	finan-
cial results, retention of leaders and alignment 
to shareholder value creation, the group has 
implemented two types of equity-settled share-
based incentive programmes:
• a long-term incentive programme (ltip); and
• a special incentive programme (sip).
the latter was introduced to selected leaders 
in	december	2020	–	specifically	to	motivate	
the implementation of the oneiss strategy and 
behavior consistent with the iss values and 
leadership competency framework.
long-term incentive programme
members of the egm (egmb and corporate 
senior	officers	of	the	group),	and	other	senior	
officers	of	the	group,	are	granted	a	number	of	
performance share units (psus).
upon vesting, each psu entitles the holder 
to receive one share at no cost. participants 
are compensated for any dividend distributed 
between time of grant and time of vesting. 
subject to certain criteria, the psus will vest 
after three years. the vesting criteria are total 
shareholder return (tsr) and earnings per share 
(eps), equally weighted. tsr peers are the nas-
daq copenhagen omx c25 and a peer group of 
comparable international service companies.
the executive group management (egm) com-
prises the executive group management board 
(egmb)	and	corporate	senior	officers	of	the	
group. members of the egm have authority and 
5.1   remuneration to the board of directors 
and the executive group management
responsibility for planning, implementing and 
controlling the group's activities and are together 
with the board of directors (board) considered as 
the group's key management personnel.

  accounting policy
the value of services received in exchange for granted 
performance-based share units (psus) and restricted 
share units (rsus) are measured at fair value at the 
grant	date	and	recognised	in	staff	costs	over	the	vest-
ing period with a corresponding increase in equity.
the fair value of granted psus under the long-term 
incentive programme is measured using a generally 
accepted valuation model taking into consideration 
the terms and conditions upon which the psus were 
granted including market-based vesting conditions 
(tsr condition).
on initial recognition, an estimate is made of the num-
ber of psus and rsus expected to vest. the estimated 
number is subsequently revised for changes in the 
number of psus and rsus expected to vest due to 
non-market based vesting conditions.

special incentive programmes
the	new	scheme	entails	three	different	incentive	
plans with duration between two and three 
years. restricted share units (rsus) granted 
under the programmes in 2020 will vest in 
either 2022 or 2023, subject to achievement of 
individual service or performance criteria. upon 
vesting, each rsu entitles the holder to receive 
one share at no cost.
in addition, the group had an accelerated 
growth award (aga 2019) that vested in march 
2020. based on the annual performance criteria, 
0% of the granted psus vested. after this 
vesting, no further psus are outstanding and 
the programme has lapsed.

5.3   pensions and similar 
obligations
defined contribution plans
the majority of the group’s pension schemes are 
defined	contribution	plans	where	contributions	
are paid to publicly or privately administered 
pension plans. the group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
in 2020, contributions amounted to dkk 1,203 
million (2019: dkk 1,511 million), corresponding to 
84% of the group’s pension costs (2019: 92%). the 
lower	percentage	of	defined	contribution	costs	to	
the total pension costs is mainly due to changed 
actuarial assumptions in switzerland in 2019 with 
a	positive	impact	on	the	defined	benefit	costs.
defined benefit plans
the	group	has	a	number	of	defined	benefit	
plans where the responsibility for the pension 
obligation towards the employees rests with the 
group. the largest plans are in switzerland and 
the uk accounting for 86% (2019: 85%) of the 
group’s obligation (gross) and 97% (2019: 96%) 
of its plan assets. 
the plans are primarily based on years of service, 
and	benefits	are	generally	determined	on	the	
basis of salary and rank. the group assumes the 
risk associated with future developments in salary, 
interest	rates,	inflation,	mortality	and	disability	etc.	
the majority of the obligations are funded with 
assets placed in independent pension funds. 
in some countries, primarily sweden, france 
and hong kong, the obligation is unfunded. for 
these	unfunded	plans	the	retirement	benefit	
obligations amounted to dkk 843 million or 
10% of the present value of the gross obligation 
(2019: dkk 892 million or 11%).
switzerland participants are insured against the 
financial	consequences	of	retirement,	disability	and	
death. the pension plans guarantee a minimum 
interest	credit	and	fixed	conversion	rates	at	retire-
ment. contributions are paid by both the employee 
and the employer. the plans must be fully funded. 
in case of underfunding, recovery measures must 
be	taken,	such	as	additional	financing	from	the	
employer or from the employer and employees, 
reduction	of	benefits	or	a	combination	of	both.	
the pension plans include a risk-sharing element 
between iss and the plan participants.
the uk participants are insured against the 
financial	consequences	of	retirement	and	
death. the schemes do not provide any insured 
disability	benefits.	the	pension	plans	are	plans	
guaranteeing	defined	benefit	pension	at	retire-
ment	on	a	final	salary	basis.	the	majority	of	the	
pension plans does not include a risk-sharing 
element between iss and the plan participants. 
contribution to defined benefit plans 
the group expects to contribute dkk 250 
million in 2021 (2020: dkk 243 million).
actuarial assumptions 
actuarial calculations and valuations are 
performed annually for all major plans. the actu-
arial assumptions vary from country to country 
due to local conditions. discount rates at 31 
december are based on the market yield of high 
quality corporate bonds or government bonds 
with a maturity approximating to the terms of 
the obligations.
sensitivity analysis
the table below illustrates the sensitivity related 
to	significant	actuarial	assumptions	used	in	the	
calculation	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	
recognised at the reporting date. the analysis 
is based on changes in assumptions that the 
group considered to be reasonably possible 
at the reporting date. it is estimated that the 
relevant changes in assumptions would have 
increased/(decreased)	the	defined	benefit	
obligation by the amounts shown below:
1) the impact from deferred vested on total estimated weighted 
average duration is minor due to the fact that deferred vested 
make up less than 2% of the participants, and do not exist in many 
of the shorter duration plans. 
the estimated weighted average duration of the 
defined	benefit	obligation	was	13	years	(2019:	
13 years) and is split into:
   significant accounting estimates
the	present	value	of	defined	benefit	obligations	
is determined on the basis of assumptions about 
the future development in variables such as salary 
levels,	interest	rates,	inflation	and	mortality.	all	
assumptions are assessed at the reporting date. 
changes	in	these	assumptions	may	significantly	
affect	the	liabilities	and	pension	costs	under	
defined	benefit	plans.	the	range	and	weighted	av-
erage of these assumptions as well as sensitivities 
on key assumptions are disclosed in this note.
the discount rates used for calculating the present 
value	of	expected	future	cash	flows	are	based	on	
the market yield of high quality corporate bonds 
or government bonds with a maturity approximat-
ing	to	the	terms	of	the	defined	benefit	obligations.
iss participates in multi-employer pension 
schemes	that	by	nature	are	defined	benefit	plans.	
some funds are not able to provide the necessary 
information in order for the group to account for 
the	schemes	as	defined	benefit	plans	and	these	
schemes	are	therefore	accounted	for	as	defined	
contribution plans. there is a risk that the plans are 
not	sufficiently	funded.	however,	information	on	
surplus	or	deficit	in	the	schemes	is	not	available.

past service costs mainly related to a plan 
amendment caused by a court decision in 
germany for employees transferred in connec-
tion with a large contract win in prior years. a 
substantial part of the increased obligation was 
offset	by	new	plan	assets	received	from	the	
previous pension fund. in 2019, the negative 
costs	mainly	related	to	a	decrease	of	benefits	in	
switzerland due to a plan amendment. this was 
partly	offset	by	a	change	in	assessment	of	the	
number of employees covered by a pension plan 
in thailand.
actuarial gains and losses actuarial calcu-
lations were prepared at 31 december 2020 
resulting in actuarial loss for the year (including 
impact from asset ceiling) of dkk 148 million 
(2019: gain of dkk 35 million). the loss was 
mainly due to lower return on plan assets, and to 
a lesser extent due to changed discount rates.
in	2020,	covid-19	had	a	significant	impact	on	
market	fluctuations	mainly	regarding	asset	values	
and interest rates, which led to recognition of 
an actuarial loss of dkk 257 million at 30 june 
2020.	market	fluctuations	have	to	some	degree	
stabilised by the end of the year resulting in the 
total actuarial loss for the year being reduced at 
31 december 2020.

  accounting policy
contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised	in	staff	costs	when	the	related	service	
is provided. any contributions outstanding are 
recognised in other liabilities.
defined benefit plans the group’s net obliga-
tion	is	calculated	annually	by	a	qualified	actuary	
using the projected unit credit method, separately 
for each plan by estimating the amount of future 
benefits	that	employees	have	earned	in	return	for	
their service in the current and prior periods. the 
present value less the fair value of any plan assets 
is recognised in pensions and similar obligations.
when the calculation results in a potential asset, rec-
ognition is limited to the present value of economic 
benefits	available	in	the	form	of	future	refunds	from	
or reductions in future contributions to the plan. to 
calculate the present value, consideration is given to 
applicable minimum funding requirements. 
pension costs are calculated based on actuarial 
estimates	and	financial	expectations	at	the	be-
ginning of the year. service costs are recognised 
in	staff	costs	and	net	interest	is	recognised	in	
financial	expenses.	differences	between	the	
expected development in pension assets and lia-
bilities and the realised amounts at the reporting 
date are designated actuarial gains or losses and 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
when	the	benefits	are	changed	or	a	plan	is	cur-
tailed,	the	resulting	change	in	benefits	that	relates	
to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment 
is	recognised	in	staff	costs.	gains	and	losses	on	
settlement is recognised upon the settlement.. 
other long-term employee benefits are rec-
ognised	as	defined	pension	plans,	except	that	actu-
arial	gains	and	losses	are	recognised	in	staff	costs.	
other	long-term	employee	benefits	comprise	jubilee	
benefits,	long-service	or	sabbatical	leave	etc.

financial statements
other required disclosures
6.1  contingent liabilities
6.2  government grants
the group received government grants in the 
form of wage subventions, which have been 
recognised	as	a	reduction	of	staff	costs.	the	
grants	compensate	the	group	for	staff	costs	
primarily related to social security and wage 
increases as well as hiring certain categories of 
employees such as trainees, disabled persons, 
long-term unemployed and employees in certain 
age groups.
covid-19 related grants and assistance
employee related grants governments in sev-
eral	countries,	most	significantly	singapore,	the	
uk, australia, hong kong, switzerland, france, 
austria	and	denmark	have	offered	support	
schemes in the form of wage compensation. 
the schemes are temporary, subject to certain 
conditions, and compensate costs related to e.g. 
employees on furlough, social security contribu-
tion and sick pay compensation.
in 2020, the group was entitled to receive dkk 
1,348 million in employee-related grants, which 
is	specified	to	the	right.	as	the	grants	compen-
sate costs already incurred they are recognised 
in	profit	or	loss	as	a	reduction	of	staff	costs.	
depending	on	the	specific	commercial	model,	
customers were appropriately and accordingly 
compensated.
postponements of vat, social contribution 
etc. governments in several countries have 
offered	support	schemes	in	the	form	of	tempo-
rary prolongation of payment terms for certain 
payments, e.g. vat, withholding tax and social 
contribution. some countries within the group 
have utilised these schemes. at 30 june 2020, 
such postponements amounted to approxi-
mately dkk 1.7 billion. however, at 31 december 
2020, we had fully repaid such support.

the group has issued performance guarantee bonds for service contracts 
of dkk 3,305 million (2019: dkk 3,372 million) of which dkk 1,454 million 
(2019: dkk 1,463 million) were bank-guaranteed. such performance bonds 
are	issued	in	the	ordinary	course	of	business	to	guarantee	towards	specific	
customers satisfactory completion of work according to contracts.
divestments
the group makes provisions for claims from purchasers or other parties in 
connection with divestments and representations and warranties given in 
relation to such divestments. management believes that provisions made 
at 31 december 2020 are adequate. however, there can be no assurance
that major claims will not arise out of the group’s divestments and 
	adversely	affect	the	group’s	profit	or	loss	and	financial	position.
legal 
proceedings
the group is party to certain legal proceedings. management believes that 
these proceedings (many of which are disputes with customers and la-
bour-related cases incidental to the business) will not have a material impact 
on	the	group’s	financial	position	beyond	the	assets	and	liabilities	already	
recognised	in	the	statement	of	financial	position	at	31	december	2020.
restructuring 
projects
restructuring projects are being undertaken on an ongoing basis across 
different	geographies	and	service	areas,	currently	mainly	in	germany,	france,	
spain and the uk. labour laws especially in europe include restrictions on 
dismissals and procedural rules to be followed. the procedures applied by iss 
could be challenged in certain jurisdictions resulting in liabilities. management 
believes	that	this	would	not	have	a	material	impact	on	the	group’s	financial	
position beyond the assets and liabilities already recognised in the statement 
of	financial	position	at	31	december	2020.

6.3  related parties
parent and ultimate controlling party
the group’s parent iss a/s is the ultimate con-
trolling party. at 31 december 2020, iss had no 
related parties with either control of the group 
or	significant	influence	in	the	group.
key management personnel
the board of directors (board) and the executive 
group management (egm) are considered the 
group’s	key	management	personnel	as	defined	
in 5.1, remuneration to the board of directors 
and the executive group management.
apart from remuneration, including share-based 
incentive	programmes,	there	were	no	significant	
transactions with members of the board and the 
egm in 2020.
6.4   average number of 
employees
at 31 december 2020, total number of employ-
ees was 378,946 (31 december 2019: 471,056) 
with an average number of employees in 2020 
of 434,896 (2019: 483,539). number of employ-
ees includes both the continuing and discontin-
ued operations.
the decrease in 2020 was mainly the result of 
divestments completed in 2020. customers 
reducing their demand for services as a result of 
covid-19 contributed further to the reduction.
the number of employees will gradually reduce 
further as our strategic divestment programme 
progresses. once the programme is fully com-
pleted, the number of employees is expected to 
be around 350,000.
6.5  fees to auditors
other assurance services comprised work 
related	to	the	interim	financial	statements	and	
other assurance services. 
tax and vat advisory services mainly related 
to tax compliance services. 
other services comprised among other things 
work related to acquisitions and divestments, 
such	as	financial	and	tax	due	diligence.
6.6  subsequent events
other than set out elsewhere in these consoli-
dated	financial	statements,	we	are	not	aware	of	
events subsequent to 31 december 2020, which 
are expected to have a material impact on the 
group’s	financial	position.

basis of preparation
7.1   significant accounting 
estimates and judgements
in	preparing	these	consolidated	financial	state-
ments, management made various judgements, 
estimates and assumptions concerning future 
events	that	affected	the	application	of	the	group’s	
accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, the 
accompanying disclosures, including contingent 
liabilities. uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes that 
require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities in future periods. 
as explained throughout this annual report, 
covid-19	had	a	significant	adverse	impact	on	
our business, including the group’s operating 
performance	and	cash	flows	in	2020	and	
our	financial	position	at	31	december	2020.	
furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic has had 
a	significant	impact	on	the	global	economy	
and thus the general level of uncertainty has 
significantly	increased.	in	addition,	our	four	key	
operational challenges (as illustrated on p. 16) 
as well as actions initiated in the late part of 
2020	led	to	significant	restructuring	and	one-off	
costs. conse quently, certain items were – in 
addition to estimates and judgements in the 
normal course of business – impacted by further 
estimates and judgements due to the increased 
uncertainty.
items	being	subject	to	significant	estimates	
and judgements are listed below. items being 
subject to increased uncertainty due to the spe-
cial circumstances, i.e. covid-19, the it security 
incident, our four key operational challenges 
and actions initiated in the late part of 2020, are 
listed separately:
given the evolving nature of covid-19 and the 
limited recent experience of the economic and 
financial	impacts	of	such	a	pandemic,	changes	
to estimates in the measurement of the group’s 
assets and liabilities may arise in the future.
estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis and have been prepared taking 
macroeconomic developments into consid-
eration,	but	still	ensuring	that	one-off	effects	
which are not expected to exist in the long term 
do	not	affect	estimation	and	determination	of	
these key factors, including discount rates and 
expectations for the future.
7.2   change in accounting policies
except for the changes below, the accounting 
policies have been applied consistently in respect 
of	the	financial	year	and	comparative	figures.
from 1 january 2020, the group has adopted 
the below standards and interpretations with no 
significant	impact	on	recognition	and	measure-
ment:
• amendments to ifrs 7, ifrs 9 and ias 39 
financial instruments: interest rate bench-
mark reform; and
• amendments to ias 1 presentation of finan-
cial statements and ias 8 accounting policies, 
changes in accounting estimates and errors: 
definition	of	material.
7.3  general accounting policies
the	consolidated	financial	statements	of	iss	a/s	
for the year ended 31 december 2020 comprise 
iss a/s and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 
group).	significant	subsidiaries	are	listed	in	7.5,	
group companies.
the annual report for iss a/s for 2020 was 
discussed and approved by the executive group 
management board (egmb) and the board of di-
rectors (board) on 25 february 2021 and issued 
for approval at the subsequent annual general 
meeting on 13 april 2021.
basis of preparation
the	consolidated	financial	statements	have	been	
prepared in accordance with ifrs as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act. in addition, the 
consolidated	financial	statements	have	been	
prepared in compliance with the ifrss issued by 
the iasb.
the	group’s	significant	accounting	policies	and	
accounting policies related to ias 1 minimum 
presentation items are described in the relevant 
notes	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements	
or otherwise stated below. a list of the notes is

going concern
the board and the egmb have during the 
preparation	of	the	consolidated	financial	state-
ments of the group assessed the going concern 
assumption. the board and the egmb believe 
that no events or conditions give rise to doubt 
about the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern (within the next reporting period).
in reaching this conclusion, the board and 
the	egmb	have	specifically	considered	the	
consequences of covid-19, which has negative-
ly	affected	the	group’s	operating	performance	
and	cash	flows	in	2020	as	well	as	the	financial	
position at 31 december 2020. the currently 
known negative impacts are described in the 
management’s review.
in making the assessment, the board and 
the egmb have considered all available 
information, including existing and anticipated 
impacts of covid-19 and other relevant events 
and conditions, up until the date on which the 
consolidated	financial	statements	are	issued.
the conclusion is made based on knowledge of 
the group, the estimated economic outlook and 
identified	risks	and	uncertainties	in	relation	here-
to. further, the conclusion is based on review 
of budgets, including expected development 
in available liquidity and capital, current credit 
facilities and their contractual and expected 
maturities. consequently, it has been concluded 
that it is reasonable to apply the going concern 
concept as underlying assumption for the 
consolidated	financial	statements	of	the	group.
defining materiality
the	consolidated	financial	statements	sep-
arately present items that are considered 
individually	significant,	or	are	required	under	
the minimum presentation requirements of ias 
1. in addition, information that is considered 
material, either individually or in combination 
with other information, is disclosed.
in determining whether an item is individu-
ally	significant	or	information	is	material,	iss	
considers both quantitative and qualitative 
factors. if the presentation or disclosure could 
reasonably	be	expected	to	influence	economic	
decisions made by primary users, the informa-
tion is considered material.
explanatory disclosure notes related to 
the	consolidated	financial	statements	are	
presented	for	individually	significant	items.	
where separate presentation of a line item is 
made solely due to the minimum presentation 
requirements in ias 1, no further disclosures 
are provided in respect of that line item.
change in presentation of the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss
in the past, iss has built its business platform, 
and grown its business, through a large num-
ber of acquisitions, including the acquisition of 
iss world services a/s in 2005, which added 
a substantial amount of intangibles to the 
consolidated	statement	of	financial	position.	
consequently, large amounts of non-cash 
amortisation/impairment of intangibles have 
been recognised in our consolidated statement 
of	profit	or	loss	every	year.
in previous years, it was important for us to 
clearly separate these items to enable com-
parison with our peers and enable readers to 
understand the impact of our growth strategy. 
for those reasons, our consolidated statement 
of	profit	or	loss	was	presented	in	a	three-col-
umn format, where acquisition-related items 
were presented separately.
by the end of 2019, the carrying amount of 
customer contracts relating to the acquisition 
of iss world services a/s were fully amortised 
and thus, separating these acquisition-related 
items	in	profit	or	loss	are	no	longer	material	
to the understanding of our business. conse-
quently, we have changed the presentation of 
our	consolidated	statement	of	profit	or	loss	to	
a one-column format.
basis of consolidation
the	consolidated	financial	statements	com-
prise iss a/s and entities controlled by iss 
a/s. control is achieved when the group is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability	to	affect	those	returns	through	its	power	
over	the	investee.	the	financial	statements	of	
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial	statements	from	the	date	on	which	
control commences until the date on which 
control ceases. 
on consolidation intra-group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated. 
unrealised gains arising from transactions 
with equity-accounted investees are eliminated 
against the investment to the extent of the 
group’s interest in the investment. unrealised 
losses are eliminated in the same way as unre-
alised gains, but only to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment.
the non-controlling interest’s share of net 
profit	and	equity	of	subsidiaries,	which	are	not	
wholly-owned, are included in the group’s net 
profit	and	equity,	respectively,	but	disclosed	
separately. by virtue of agreement certain 
non-controlling shareholders are only eligible 
of	receiving	benefits	from	their	non-controlling	
interest when iss as controlling shareholder 
has received their initial investment and com-
pound interest on such. in such instances the 
subsidiaries’ result and equity are fully allocated 
to iss until the point in time where iss has rec-
ognised amounts exceeding their investment 
including compound interest on such.
a change in ownership interest of a subsidiary, 
without loss of control, is accounted for as an 
equity transaction.
if the group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the related assets (including 
goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and 
other components of equity, while any resultant 
gain or loss is recognised in other income 
and expenses, net. any investment retained is 
recognised at fair value on initial recognition.
foreign currency
the	consolidated	financial	statements	are	
presented in danish kroner (dkk), which is 
iss a/s’s functional currency. transactions in 
currencies other than the functional currency of 
the respective group companies are considered 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
on initial recognition, these are translated 
to the respective functional currencies of 
the group companies at the exchange rates 
at the transaction date. foreign exchange 
adjustments arising between the exchange 
rates at the transaction date and at the date of 
payment are recognised in financial income or 
financial expenses.
86
financial statements
receivables, payables and other monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates at the reporting 
date.	the	difference	between	the	exchange	
rates at the reporting date and at the date of 
transaction or the exchange rate in the latest 
financial	statements	is	recognised	in	financial	
income or financial expenses.
on	recognition	in	the	consolidated	financial	
statements of group companies with a 
functional currency other than dkk, the 
statements	of	profit	or	loss	and	statements	of	
cash	flows	are	translated	at	the	exchange	rates	
at the transaction date and the statements of 
financial	position	are	translated	at	the	ex-
change rates at the reporting date. an average 
exchange rate for the month is used as the 
exchange rate at the transaction date to the 
extent	that	this	does	not	significantly	deviate	
from the exchange rate at the transaction 
date. foreign exchange adjustments arising 
on translation of the opening balance of equity 
of foreign entities at the exchange rates at 
the reporting date and on translation of the 
profit	or	loss	statements	from	the	exchange	
rates at the transaction date to the exchange 
rates at the reporting date are recognised in 
other comprehensive income and presented 
in equity under a separate translation reserve. 
however, if the foreign entity is a non-wholly 
owned subsidiary, the relevant proportion of 
the	translation	difference	is	allocated	to	the	
non-controlling interest.
foreign exchange adjustments of balances with 
foreign entities which are considered part of the 
investment in the entity are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in equity 
under a separate translation reserve.
7.4   new standards and 
interpretations not yet 
implemented
iasb has published certain new standards, 
amendments to existing standards and interpre-
tations that are not yet mandatory for the prepa-
ration	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements	
of the group at 31 december 2020:
• amendments to ias 1 presentation of finan-
cial	statements:	classification	of	liabilities	as	
current or non-current;
• amendments to ifrs 7, ifrs 9 and ias 39 
(financial instruments) and ifrs 16 (leases): 
interest rate benchmark reform – phase 2;
• amendments to ias 37 provisions, contingent 
liabilities and contingent assets: onerous 
contracts	–	costs	of	fulfilling	a	contract;	and
• annual improvements to ifrss 2018-2020 
cycle: fees in the 10 per cent test for 
derecognition	of	financial	liabilities.
none of these new standards, amendments 
to existing standards and interpretations are 
adopted by the eu at 31 december 2020.
the group expects to adopt the new standards 
and interpretations when they become manda-
tory. the standards and interpretations that are 
approved	with	different	effective	dates	in	the	eu	
than	the	corresponding	effective	dates	under	
iasb will be early adopted so that the implemen-
tation	follows	the	effective	dates	under	iasb.
based on the current business setup and level of 
activities, none of these standards and interpre-
tations are expected to have a material impact 
on the recognition and measurement in the 
consolidated	financial	statements.

management statement
copenhagen, 25 february 2021
the board of directors and the executive group 
management board have today discussed and 
approved the annual report of iss a/s for the 
financial	year	2020.
the annual report has been prepared in 
accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial 
statements act.
it	is	our	opinion	that	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	and	the	parent	company	financial	
statements give a true and fair view of the

management statement
independent auditors’ report
to the shareholders of iss a/s
opinion
we	have	audited	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	and	the	parent	company	financial	
statements	of	iss	a/s	for	the	financial	year	1	
january – 31 december 2020, pp. 43–88 and 
pp.	97–102,	which	comprise	statement	of	profit	
or loss, statement of comprehensive income, 
statement	of	cash	flows,	statement	of	financial	
position, statement of changes in equity and 
notes, including accounting policies for the 
group and the parent company. the consol-
idated	financial	statements	and	the	parent	
company	financial	statements	are	prepared	
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards as adopted by the eu and 
additional requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. 
in	our	opinion,	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	and	the	parent	company	financial	
statements give a true and fair view of the 
financial	position	of	the	group	and	the	parent	
company at 31 december 2020 and of the 
results of the group’s and the parent company’s 
operations	and	cash	flows	for	the	financial	year	
1 january – 31 december 2020 in accordance 
with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and additional require-
ments of the danish financial statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our long-form 
audit report to the audit and risk committee 
and the board of directors.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. 
our responsibilities under those standards 
and requirements are further described in the 
“auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated	financial	statements	and	the	parent	
company	financial	statements”	(hereinafter	col-
lectively	referred	to	as	“the	financial	statements”)	
section of our report. we believe that the audit 
evidence	we	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the international ethics standards board 
for accountants’ code of ethics for professional 
accountants (iesba code) and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we 
have	fulfilled	our	other	ethical	responsibilities	in	
accordance with these rules and requirements.
to the best of our knowledge, we have not provid-
ed any prohibited non-audit services as described 
in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no. 537/2014.
appointment of auditor
subsequent to iss a/s being listed on nasdaq 
copenhagen, we were initially appointed as 
auditor of iss a/s on 15 april 2015 for the 
financial	year	2015.	we	have	been	reappointed	
annually by resolution of the general meeting 
for a total consecutive period of six years up 
until	the	financial	year	2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional	judgement,	were	of	most	signifi-
cance	in	our	audit	of	the	financial	statements	
for	the	financial	year	2020.	these	matters	were	
addressed	during	our	audit	of	the	financial	
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon. we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. for each matter be-
low, our description of how our audit addressed 
the matter is provided in that context.
we	have	fulfilled	our	responsibilities	described	
in the “auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the	financial	statements”	section	of	our	report,	
including in relation to the key audit matters. 
accordingly, our audit included the design and 
performance of procedures to respond to our as-
sessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the	financial	statements.	the	results	of	our	audit	
procedures, including the procedures performed 
to address the matters below, provide the basis 
for	our	audit	opinion	on	the	financial	statements.
revenue from contracts with customers, 
including cut-off and accrual of revenue  
and onerous contracts
revenue from contracts is recognised as the 
services are rendered to the customers. some 
contracts	require	the	group	to	incur	significant	
transition and mobilisation costs at contract 
inception which are capitalised and amortised 
over a multi-annual contract term. accordingly, 
appropriate	cut-off	and	accrual	of	revenue	and	
capitalisation and amortisation of transition 
and mobilisation costs is critical and involve 
management judgement, especially in relation to 
the more integrated and complex facility service 
contracts. further, the assessment of whether 
a contract may be considered onerous involves 
management judgement in making accounting 
estimates	about	future	contract	profitability,	
including the determination of the total contract 
revenue, contract period and the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract.
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the 
cut	off	and	accrual	of	revenue,	the	assessment	
of whether transition and mobilisation costs 
meet the criteria to be capitalised and the deter-
mination of the contract period and the future 
contract	profitability,	including	the	uncertainty	
relating to estimating the impact from covid-19, 
we considered the accounting for revenue from 
contracts	with	customers,	including	cut-off	and	
accrual of revenue and onerous contracts, to be 
a key audit matter.
for details on revenue from contracts with 
customers, transition and mobilisation costs 
and provisions for onerous contracts, reference 
is made to notes 1.2, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5 in the 
consolidated	financial	statements.
in	response	to	the	identified	risks,	our	audit	
procedures included, among others:
• test on a sample basis of accrued revenue (un-
billed receivables) to supporting documenta-
tion, including procedures such as: inspection 
of proof of work done, review of contracts with 
customers, comparison of amounts accrued to 
subsequent invoices and cash receipts.
• test on a sample basis of capitalised transition 
and mobilisation costs, including procedures 
such as: inspection of proof of costs incurred, 
review of contracts with customers, evalua-
tion of management’s assessment of costs 
meeting the criteria to be recognised.
90
independent auditors’ report
• evaluation of management’s process to identify 
and quantify onerous contracts. our evaluation 
included inquiries to local management respon-
sible	for	carrying	out	the	identification	process	
at country level, review of documentation of 
management’s analysis as well as our own 
analytical procedures over contract margins. 
• test on a sample of provisions for onerous 
contracts, including procedures such as: review 
of the relevant contract and management’s 
estimate of the future contract revenue and 
unavoidable cost, assessment of the assump-
tions applied by management to estimate the 
future contract revenue, including the expected 
covid-19 impact, contract term including termi-
nation and extension options and unavoidable 
cost, comparison of the revenue assumptions 
used	to	the	services	and	fees	specified	in	the	
contract, comparison of unavoidable cost as-
sumptions used to underlying cost projections 
and actual costs incurred historically as well as 
testing the completeness and accuracy of the 
underlying cost projections.
valuation of intangible assets
the carrying amounts of goodwill and customer 
contracts related to prior years’ acquisitions 
comprise	a	significant	part	of	the	consolidated	
statement	of	financial	position.	the	cash-gen-
erating units in which goodwill and customer 
contracts are included are impairment tested 
by management on an annual basis. the 
impairment tests are based on management’s 
estimates	of	among	others	future	profitability,	
long-term growth and discount rate. due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in determining the 
net	present	value	of	future	cash	flows,	including	
the uncertainty relating to estimating the impact 
from covid-19, we considered these impairment 
tests to be a key audit matter. 
for details on the impairment tests performed 
by management reference is made to notes 
3.5,	3.6	and	3.7	in	the	consolidated	financial	
statements. 
in	response	to	the	identified	risks,	our	audit	
procedures included, among others, testing the 
mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash 
flow	model	and	comparing	forecasted	profitabil-
ity to board approved budgets. we evaluated 
the assumptions and methodologies used in the 
discounted	cash	flow	model,	in	particular	those	
relating to the forecasted revenue growth and 
operating margin, including comparing with 
historical growth rates and assessed impact of 
covid-19. we compared the assumptions applied 
to externally derived data as well as our own 
assessments in relation to key inputs such as 
projected economic growth and discount rates. 
further, we evaluated the sensitivity analysis on 
the key assumptions applied. our audit proce-
dures primarily focused on cash generating units 
where likely changes in key assumptions could 
result in impairment. we further evaluated the 
adequacy of disclosures provided by manage-
ment	in	the	financial	statements	compared	to	
applicable accounting standards.
assets and liabilities held for sale  
and discontinued operations
when classifying businesses as held for sale and 
as discontinued operations in the consolidated 
financial	statements,	management	makes	
judgments and estimates, including assessment 
of impairment of the net assets. due to the 
materiality of management’s disposal plans and 
inherent uncertainty involved in classifying and 
assessing assets and liabilities held for sale and 
discontinued operations, we considered these 
judgments and estimates as a key audit matter.
for details on the assets and liabilities held for 
sale and discontinued operations reference is 
made to note 3.1 and note 3.2 in the consolidat-
ed	financial	statements.	
in	response	to	the	identified	risks,	our	audit	
procedures included, among others, agreeing 
the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities 
held for sale to underlying accounting records, 
considered	management’s	criteria	for	classifica-
tion of businesses as held for sale and discon-
tinued operations and reading draft agreements 
where relevant, including reviewing minutes 
and other relevant documentation of the sales 
processes and board decisions. we considered 
the impairment assessment made by manage-
ment, including assessment of key assumptions 
applied and evaluation of the explanations pro-
vided by comparing key assumptions to market 
data, where available. we further evaluated the 
adequacy of disclosures provided by manage-
ment	in	the	financial	statements	compared	to	
applicable accounting standards.
income tax and deferred tax balances
the group’s operations are subject to income 
taxes	in	various	jurisdictions	having	different	
tax legislation. management makes judgments 
and estimates in determining the recognition 
of income taxes and deferred taxes. given the 
inherent uncertainty involved in assessing and 
estimating the income tax and deferred tax bal-
ances, including tax exposures and write-down 
of deferred tax assets and given the uncertainty 
estimating the impact from covid-19 on future 
taxable income, we considered these balances 
as a key audit matter.
for details on the income tax and deferred tax 
balances reference is made to notes 1.5 and 1.6 in 
the	consolidated	financial	statements	and	notes	5	
and	7	in	the	parent	company	financial	statements.	
in	response	to	the	identified	risks,	our	audit	pro-
cedures included review of tax computations in 
order to assess the completeness and accuracy 
of the amounts recognised as income taxes and 
deferred taxes, as well as assessment of corre-
spondence with tax authorities and evaluation of 
tax exposures as well as write-down of deferred 
tax assets. in respect of the deferred tax assets 
recognised	in	the	statement	of	financial	position,	
we assessed management’s assumptions as to 
the probability of recovering the assets through 
taxable income in future years and available tax 
planning strategies. we further evaluated the ad-
equacy of disclosures provided by management 
compared to applicable accounting standards.
statement on the 
management’s review
management is responsible for the manage-
ment’s review, pp. 1-42.
our	opinion	on	the	financial	statements	does	not	
cover the management’s review, and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
in	connection	with	our	audit	of	the	financial	
statements, our responsibility is to read the 
management’s review and, in doing so, consider 
whether the management’s review is materially 
inconsistent	with	the	financial	statements	or	
our knowledge obtained during the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider 
whether the management’s review provides the 
information required under the danish financial 
statements act.
91
independent auditors’ report
based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that the management’s review is in 
accordance	with	the	financial	statements	and	
has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the danish financial statements 
act. we did not identify any material misstate-
ment of the management’s review.
management’s responsibilities 
for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation 
of	consolidated	financial	statements	and	parent	
company	financial	statements	that	give	a	true	
and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act and for such internal 
control as management determines is necessary 
to	enable	the	preparation	of	financial	state-
ments that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
in	preparing	the	financial	statements,	manage-
ment is responsible for assessing the group’s 
and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the	financial	statements	unless	management	
either intends to liquidate the group or the 
parent company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assur-
ance	as	to	whether	the	financial	statements	as	
a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
reasonable assurance is a high level of assur-
ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit con-
ducted in accordance with isas and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence	the	economic	decisions	of	users	taken	
on	the	basis	of	the	financial	statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance 
with isas and additional requirements appli-
cable in denmark, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. we also:
• identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement	of	the	financial	statements,	
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten-
tional omissions, misrepresentations or the 
override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing	an	opinion	on	the	effectiveness	
of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
• conclude on the appropriateness of man-
agement’s use of the going concern basis 
of	accounting	in	preparing	the	financial	
statements and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that 
may	cast	significant	doubt	on	the	group’s	and	
the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. if we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures	in	the	financial	statements	or,	if	
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group and the 
parent company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and	contents	of	the	financial	statements,	in-
cluding the note disclosures, and whether the 
financial	statements	represent	the	underlying	
transactions and events in a manner that 
gives a true and fair view.
• obtain	sufficient	appropriate	audit	evidence	
regarding	the	financial	information	of	the	
entities or business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial	statements.	we	are	responsible	for	
the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit. we remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and	significant	audit	findings,	including	any	
significant	deficiencies	in	internal	control	that	we	
identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with gover-
nance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our indepen-
dence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters	that	were	of	most	significance	in	the	
audit	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements	
and	the	parent	company	financial	statements	
of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be com-
municated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits	of	such	communication.

our key account managers (kams) are 
the go-to contacts for our most important 
customers and are responsible for forging 
strong partnerships. working closely with 
customers and supported by extensive 
training and development (including the key 
account	manager	certification),	our	kams	
anticipate needs and ensure that each site 
runs like a well-oiled machine. among our 
kams is tim chow, key account manager at 
iss, who handles the rolls-royce account 
in singapore. in this interview, he explains 
what it is like to be the go-to facilities 
management partner for one of the world’s 
leading industrial technology companies.
what is involved in being a 
key account manager?
“as a key account manager, i am responsi-
ble for the full range of facility management 
services, which is about more than just 
managing food, cleaning, waste, security, 
space, assets and budgets. it also involves 
project management, strategic planning, 
promoting	sustainability	efforts,	enforcing	
building codes, employing safety measures 
and so much more. it is a 24/7 facility, so my 
responsibility is 24/7 as well.”
what is your favourite  
part of the job?
“it is a great job because it involves making 
our work environment safe, fun and enjoy-
able. my team are the ones who keep the 
office	at	the	perfect	temperature;	make	sure	
the lights come on; and that the water is 
clean and safe to drink. in other words, they 
make sure the environment is always clean 
and safe for people to work and be in. and i 
love being a part of making that happen.”
you are responsible for 
managing a team of 65 
people. how do you approach 
managing such a large team?
my main responsibility is to bring all of 
our smart, passionate people together 
and get them working towards our shared 
goal. singapore is quite diverse. we have 
colleagues	from	a	number	of	different	
cultures and backgrounds, and they have 
different	ways	of	doing	things.	for	me,	the	
three most important things are respect, 
trust and appreciation. those three qualities 
are like dots; when you connect them, you 
have the right culture and atmosphere for 
getting the job done.

iss uses various key figures, 
financial ratios (including 
alternative performance measures 
(apms)) and non-financial ratios, all 
of which provide our stakeholders 
with useful and necessary 
information about the group’s 
financial position, performance, 
cash flows and development 
in a consistent way. in relation 
to managing the business, 
achieving our strategic goals and 
ultimately creating value for our 
shareholders, these measures are

parent company financial statements
1  accounting policies
basis of preparation
the	financial	statements	of	iss	a/s	have	been	
prepared in accordance with ifrs as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act. in addition, 
the	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	
compliance with the ifrss issued by the iasb.
changes in accounting policies
changes in accounting policies are described in 
7.2	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements.
accounting policies
with the exception of the items described below, 
the accounting policies for iss a/s are identical 
to the group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the notes to the consolidated 
financial	statements.
statement of profit or loss
dividends from subsidiary are recognised in 
the	income	statement	in	the	financial	year	in	
which the dividend is declared. if dividends de-
clared exceed the total comprehensive income 
for the year, an impairment test is performed.
statement of financial position
investment in subsidiary is measured at cost, 
which comprises consideration transferred 
measured at fair value and any directly attrib-
utable transaction costs. if there is indication of 
impairment, an impairment test is performed as 
described in the accounting policies in 3.7 to the 
consolidated	financial	statements.	where	the	
recoverable amount is lower than the cost, the 
investment is written down to this lower value. 
an impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent that 
the recoverable amount does not exceed the 
original cost.
tax as required by danish legislation, iss a/s is 
jointly taxed with all danish resident subsidiar-
ies. iss a/s acts as administration company for 
the joint taxation and consequently settles all 
payments of corporation tax with the tax author-
ities. joint taxation contributions to/from jointly 
taxed companies are recognised in the income 
statement in income tax and in the statement of 
financial	position	in	receivables	from	or	debt	to	
companies within the iss group.
companies which utilise tax losses in other 
companies pay joint taxation contribution to iss 
a/s equivalent to the tax base of the tax losses 
utilised. companies whose tax losses are utilised 
by other companies receive joint taxation 
contributions from iss a/s equivalent to the tax 
base of the tax losses utilised (full absorption).
2   significant accounting 
estimates and judgements
significant	accounting	estimates	and	judge-
ments relating to the applied accounting policies 
for iss a/s are the same as for the group to the 
extent of similar accounting items, see 7.1 to the 
consolidated	financial	statements	for	a	descrip-
tion.	the	specific	risks	for	iss	a/s	are	described	
in	the	notes	to	the	financial	statements	of	the	
parent company. 
 
 
 
investment in subsidiary is tested for 
impairment when there is an indication that the 
investment may be impaired. the assessment of 
whether there is an indication of impairment is 
based on both external and internal sources of 
information such as performance of the subsidi-
ary,	significant	decline	in	market	values	etc.

withholding taxes
iss a/s is jointly taxed with all danish resident 
subsidiaries. as administration company iss a/s 
and companies within the joint taxation have a 
joint and unlimited liability of danish corporate 
and withholding taxes related to dividends, in-
terests and royalties. as per 31 december 2020, 
danish corporate tax and danish withholding 
taxes amounted to dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 0 
million). any subsequent adjustments to danish 
withholding taxes may change this joint and 
unlimited liability.
vat
iss a/s and certain danish group companies are 
jointly registered for vat and are jointly liable for 
the payment hereof.
 10  financial risk management
iss	a/s’s	financial	risks	are	managed	centrally	by	
group treasury based on the financial policy ap-
proved by the board of directors. the objectives, 
policies and processes for measuring and manag-
ing	the	exposure	to	financial	risks	is	described	in	
4.4	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements.	the	
risks	specific	to	iss	a/s	are	described	below.
 11  currency risk
currency risk is the risk that arises from changes 
in	exchange	rates	and	affects	iss	a/s’s	result	or	
value	of	financial	instruments.	at	31	december	
2020 and at 31 december 2019, iss a/s was not 
exposed to currency risk as no assets or liabilities 
were denominated in currencies other than dkk.
 12  liquidity risk
liquidity risk results from iss a/s’s potential 
inability	or	difficulty	in	meeting	the	contractual	
obligations	associated	with	its	financial	liabilities	
due	to	insufficient	liquidity.	iss	a/s	is	a	holding	
company and its primary assets consist of 
shares in iss world services a/s and receivables 
from companies within the iss group. iss a/s 
has no revenue generating activities of its own, 
and	therefore	iss	a/s’s	cash	flow	and	ability	to	
service its indebtedness and other obligations, 
will depend primarily on the operating per-
formance	and	financial	condition	of	iss	world	
services a/s and its operating subsidiaries, and 
the receipt by iss a/s of funds from iss world 
services a/s and its subsidiaries in the form of 
dividends or otherwise.
at	31	december	2020,	iss	a/s	carried	no	signifi-
cant	financial	liablities.	thus	the	liquidity	risk	was	
primarily related to iss a/s’s obligations under 
the danish joint taxation where iss a/s acts as 
the administration company.
 13  credit risk
credit	risk	is	the	risk	of	financial	loss	inflicted	on	
iss	a/s	if	a	counterparty	to	a	financial	instru-
ment fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
as iss a/s has no revenue generating activities 
and therefore no trade receivables, credit risk is 
limited	to	an	insignificant	amount	of	cash	and	
cash	equivalents	and	an	insignificant	intercom-
pany receivable with various indirectly owned 
subsidiaries in relation to joint taxation.
 14  related parties
in addition to the description in 6.3 to the con-
solidated	financial	statements	of	related	parties	
and transactions with these, related parties of 
iss a/s comprise iss world services a/s and its 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, see 
7.5	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements.
in 2020, iss a/s had the following transactions 
with other related parties, which were all made 
on market terms:
• iss a/s had a debt against iss global a/s of 
dkk 3,116 million (2019: receivable dkk 2,044 
million).
• iss a/s received interest from iss global a/s, 
see note 4, financial income and expenses.
• iss a/s received/paid joint taxation contribu-
tion equal to 22% of taxable income from/to 
jointly taxed danish resident subsidiaries.
15   new standards and 
interpretations not yet 
implemented
new standards and interpretations not yet 
implemented are described in 7.4 to the consoli-
dated	financial	statements.
