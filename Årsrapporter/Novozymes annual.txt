the covid-19 pandemic.
return on invested capital (roic), including goodwill, was 18.9%, down 
2.2 percentage points from 21.1% in 2019. the decrease was mainly 
driven by lower net profit and higher average invested capital.
the increase of dkk 1.2 billion was 
mainly due to higher cash flows from 
operating activities. driven by higher 
cash conversion from better earnings 
quality, a settlement related to the

the big picture      in brief
novozymes a/s
north america
the severe effects of covid-19 restrictions 
on us ethanol production was the primary 
cause of the 4% organic sales decline in north 
america for the full-year. also, sales in grain 
& tech processing declined during the year, 
whereas the other business areas grew.
latin america
sales in latin america grew 6% organically 
in 2020, driven by increased enzymatic 
penetration in household care, ethanol capacity 
expansion in bioenergy and market penetration 
of solutions for vegetable oil processing in grain 
& tech processing. performance in agriculture, 
animal health & nutrition was weak due 
to lower in-market demand and inventory 
adjustments in animal nutrition.
europe, the middle east & africa 
full-year sales grew 3% organically compared 
to 2019. growth in the region was primarily 
driven by a strong performance in household 
care but with contributions from most of the 
other business areas as well. 
asia pacific
organic sales declined 1% in 2020 primarily 
due to the covid-19 related effects on the 
textile industry, which had a negative effect on 
grain & tech processing. sales in agriculture, 
animal health & nutrition also declined, 
whereas bioenergy and household care both 
grew.

novozymes a/s
2020 performance
household care sales grew 5% 
organically and 3% in reported dkk 
in 2020. 
sales performance was mainly 
driven by the rollout of the 
freshness technology in europe and 
broader enzymatic penetration of 
detergents, especially in emerging 
markets. growth from the freshness 
platform was additionally fueled by 
the introduction of a new liquid and 
pod format. 
increased consumer focus on 
cleanliness and more at-home dish 
washing induced by the covid-19 
pandemic also contributed to sales 
growth.
2021 outlook
organic sales growth is expected to 
be driven by market penetration, 
focusing on emerging markets and 
a continued rollout of the freshness 
technology, with a broad-market 
launch in the second half of the 
year. the broad-market launch is 
an important milestone, that is 
expected to become a significant 
growth contributor in future years. 
the 2021 outlook for household 
care builds on improving the 
underlying performance on top of a 
better than expected performance 
in 2020.

the big picture      in brief
novozymes a/s
2020 performance 
full-year sales in food, beverages 
& human health grew 1% both 
organically and in reported dkk. 
sales benefitted from moderate 
growth in the food-related business 
areas which was to a large extent 
offset by declining sales in 
beverages. the growth in food was 
mainly driven by increased market 
penetration and the success of 
tailored solutions in baking as well 
as higher demand for low-lactose 
solutions, such as saphera®, in dairy. 
covid-19 restrictions resulted 
in more at-home and less out-of-
home consumption of foods and 
beverages. this had a minor positive 
effect on the food business but 
resulted in declining beverage sales 
as especially the global brewing 
industry was adversely affected. 
the human health opportunity 
progressed well during the year 
and contributed positively to sales 
although from a small base. 
2021 outlook
2021 organic sales growth is 
expected to be broad-based. 
innovation and emerging market 
penetration, supported by 
increasing consumer dietary-health-
awareness, are the main drivers of 
growth in the food business. 
beverages is expected to gradually 
recover following a 2020 severely 
affected by covid-19 implications. 
the precisionbiotics group and 
microbiome labs acquisitions are 
both estimated to contribute to 
growth in reported dkk and to grow 
organically by solid double-digits.

the big picture      in brief
novozymes a/s
2020 performance
bioenergy sales declined 9% 
organically and 13% in reported 
dkk in 2020. covid-19 restrictions, 
first implemented in the spring, 
severely disrupted us gasoline and 
ethanol demand and, subsequently, 
ethanol production and bioenergy 
sales. monthly us ethanol 
production rates improved gradually 
from the trough in april/may but 
still ended the year well below 2019 
levels. 
bioenergy's performance in 
north america ended roughly in 
line with the estimated industry 
development. increased market 
penetration with yeast solutions, 
for example, and the continued 
expansion of corn-based ethanol 
production capacity in brazil and 
china contributed positively to full-
year sales.
2021 outlook
organic sales growth in 2021 is 
expected to be driven by a gradual 
recovery in the us ethanol industry, 
following the severe disruption 
caused by the covid-19 pandemic. 
the mid-point of the bioenergy 
organic sales range roughly 
corresponds to mid-single 
digit growth in the us ethanol 
production. the growth contribution 
from regions outside of the us is 
expected to be positive.
product launches in 2020
   fortiva® hemi 
allows ethanol plants to 
express >10% more corn oil 
and accesses more fiber-bound 
starch for ethanol conversion 
key trends
  us ethanol industry is under 
strong pressure due to the 
covid-19 pandemic induced 
drop in gasoline consumption, 
the many small refinery 
exemptions from blending 
mandates and reduced exports 
due to trade barriers 
  climate change is high on 
public agendas, leading to 
growing demand for clean 
energy
  follow-through on increased 
biofuel mandates and capacity 
expansions in key emerging 
markets
 
 
novozymes promotes the development 
and deployment of low-carbon fuels for 
the transport sector.
enzymes and yeasts are critical for 
converting grains and straw into fuel 
ethanol, enabling a saving of 1,100–
2,200 kg of co2 emissions per 1,000 
liters of gasoline.

2020 performance 
sales in grain & tech processing 
declined 1% organically and 4% in 
reported dkk in 2020. solid growth 
in grain did not fully compensate for 
a decline in tech. 
the broad-based growth in grain 
was driven by strong performance 
in grain milling and vegetable oil 
processing. 
covid-19 severely affected 
the global textile industry and 
subsequently also resulted in a 
significant downturn in sales of 
enzymes for textile production, 
which was the main reason for the 
decline in tech. 
2021 outlook
organic sales growth is expected to 
be broad-based, with both grain and 
tech contributing positively. 
the grain business is expected to 
outgrow a roughly flat underlying 
market, driven by innovation and 
increased local presence across key 
regions. 
tech is expected to gradually 
recover after the significant 
disruption of the global textile 
industry in 2020.

agriculture,  
animal health & nutrition 
2020 performance
full-year sales in agriculture, 
animal health & nutrition sales 
grew 1% organically and declined 
2% in reported dkk. organic sales 
increased slightly as solid growth in 
agriculture more than offset a weak 
performance in animal health & 
nutrition. 
growth in agriculture was driven by 
increased demand across solutions. 
agriculture sales also benefitted 
from a dkk ~60 million one-off in 
the second quarter related to the 
former bioag setup. 
the continued rollout of 
balancius™ contributed to the sales 
development in animal health & 
nutrition, but it was not enough to 
compensate for lower in-market 
demand and inventory adjustments 
in animal nutrition.
novozymes did not recognize any 
deferred income as revenue in 2020 
while recognizing dkk 24 million 
in 2019. as the bioag alliance was 
terminated in april of 2019, the 
remaining and related balance of 
the deferred income of dkk 287 
million was recognized as other 
operating income in the second 
quarter of 2019.
2021 outlook
organic sales performance in 2021 
will be driven by the continued 
expansion of the bioag business 
across crops and regions, resulting 
in solid underlying double-digit 
organic sales growth when adjusted 
for the dkk ~60 million one-off in 
the second quarter of 2020. 
the outlook for animal health & 
nutrition includes some uncertainty 
as to stocking levels in the value 
chain, further accentuated by the 
pandemic. a strong innovative 
product portfolio and partnership 
setup coupled with signs of 
improving farmer economics make 
us carefully optimistic about the 
years to come.
product launches in 2020
   taegro® - a microbial foliar 
fungicide launched by syngenta

our bio-based solutions improve yields 
in agriculture by improving plants’ 
access to nutrients in the soil and by 
improving animals’ access to energy, 
proteins and minerals in the feed. this 
saves agricultural land for food and 
feed production and reduces emissions 
to the environment from manure in 
livestock production. enzymes can save 
approximately 130 kg of co2 emissions 
per 1,000 chickens by increasing the 
animals’ access to starch in the feed.

was returned to society. the remaining 10% was reinvested in  novozymes to 
develop the company, build competitive strength and ensure  
future value generation for distribution among key stakeholders. 
economic contribution 
i
n 2020 novozymes returned 12% of the 
value generated to our capital providers. the 
main part of this was our dividend payment 
of dkk 1,483 million. in addition to the 12%, 
novozymes bought back shares worth 1,500 
million in 2020. 
at the end of 2020, the novo nordisk

unlocking  
novozymes’ 
potential
novozymes delivered a resilient 2020 
performance despite the covid-19 
pandemic. we have reorganized the 
company intending to move even 
closer to our customers and solidify 
our position as the leading provider 
of biotech solutions. having laid the 
foundation for future growth, we 
believe novozymes is in a strong 
position going into 2021.

t
here has not been a year like 2020 in 
recent memory. and while we did not see 
the sales growth we wanted, we’re extremely 
proud of the way our employees have handled 
these difficult circumstances. the advances 
we made during the year are a testament to 
novozymes' strong purpose, culture and well-
diversified business model. 
the covid-19 pandemic has proven to affect 
industries differently, and our diversified 
business helped us to withstand at least 
some of the effects of the pandemic. in 2020, 
household care delivered solid growth driven 
by the rollout of the freshness platform, 
growth in emerging markets and covid-19 
induced changes to consumer behavior. in 
food, beverages & human health, food and 
human health grew while beverages declined. 
at the same time, organic sales declined in 
bioenergy and grain & tech processing as 
covid-19 impacts severely affected ethanol 
and textile production.
our organic sales growth came in at 0% for 
the year, and the reported ebit margin was 
a solid 26.1% despite currency headwinds. 
we also achieved very strong cash generation 
with free cash flow at dkk 3.4 billion before 
acquisitions.
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic 
overshadowed many things, but at novozymes 
we did not lose focus on creating the best 
possible foundation for a business that is here 
for the long term.
customer-focused and solutions-driven
we reorganized novozymes in september, 
refocusing the company around our customers 
and geographies. as we continue to build on 
our strategy, better business with biology, 
this new setup leads to reduced complexity, 
increased accountability, faster decision-
making and empowers our employees to a 
greater degree. 
we now organize around two new divisions, 
consumer biosolutions and agriculture & 
industrial biosolutions, headed by anders 
lund and tina sejersgård fanø respectively to 
better align with the very specific drivers and 
challenges influencing customers across the 
wide range of industries we serve. 
for years, novozymes has been associated 
mainly with the production of enzymes, but the 
reality is that we provide a range of solutions 
within the biotech space. what our customers 
need may be an enzyme, a microbe, a yeast 
or even a digital solution. for example, in 
bioenergy, we not only supply customers with 
enzymes or yeast for bioethanol production, 
we also have the digital tools to ensure optimal 
conditions for applying our solutions during 
our customer’s production process. we always 
take a holistic approach to market needs and 
provide our customers with the exact solution 
- or combination of solutions – that will help 
them succeed.
as part of the reorganization, we aligned our 
regional commercial set-up and created new 
roles, especially in emerging markets, to get 
closer to where our customers are. we have 
also ensured a stronger regional voice in 
core decision-making processes. as a global 
company, it is vital that employees in all 
regions are able to accelerate decisions and 
offer tailor-made solutions to customers.
changes to the executive  
leadership team composition
we brought in new members to the executive 
leadership team. claus crone fuglsang, head 
of our research & development organization, 
and graziela chaluppe dos santos malucelli, 
head of operations, supply & quality, were 
both appointed executive vice president and 
joined the executive leadership team this year, 
creating a stronger connection between the 
back and front ends of our company.
we also announced the appointment of amy 
byrick as executive vice president of strategy 
& business transformation and of morten 
enggaard rasmussen as executive vice 
president of people, sustainability & brand. 
they will join novozymes in april 2021, and we 
look forward to seeing them make their mark 
on these very important areas for novozymes’ 
future. they will both succeed thomas 
videbæk, who will be leaving novozymes in 
2021. we are immensely grateful for everything 
thomas has contributed to novozymes during 
his many years with the company and we wish 
him well in the future.
embracing our responsibility
at novozymes, sustainability is at the root of 
our solutions. we use biotechnology to enable 
our customers to deliver more sustainable 
solutions to society. every day, in over 30 
industries and 130 countries, our enzymes and 
microbes help reduce energy, water, chemical 
and raw material consumption, help improve 
performance of customer products and give 
people healthier and more sustainable choices 
for living better lives. by laying the foundation 
for a sound business and future growth we are, 
by default, also ensuring a more sustainable 
future for the world. 
”when i look at novozymes, 
i see a healthy and well-
positioned company with a 
strong technology platform 
and impressive innovation 
capabilities. i also see a 
potential for more, and 
my goal is to fully unleash 
the true potential of the 
company.”

novozymes a/s
in 2020, for example, we launched taegro® 
in europe and latin america in collaboration 
with syngenta, providing farmers with a 
chemical-free fungicide that protects fruit and 
vegetables from disease, thereby reducing 
waste in the food production cycle. we also 
launched protana® prime, a biological solution 
that enhances the umami flavor of plant-
based products, thereby enabling producers 
to accommodate consumer demand for tasty, 
greener alternatives to meat-based foods.
but our responsibility does not stop with 
delivering innovative, sustainable solutions 
to our customers. in our own production, we 
continue to do everything we can to reduce the 
negative impact of our production processes. 
we are proud to have ensured that, in 2020, 
69% of our electricity globally came from 
renewable sources. we also partnered with 
wwf to assess and address water risks at our 
sites by setting up targets for the sustainable 
management of water in our production. 
these achievements are steps on our journey 
towards becoming even more sustainable, 
and we need to keep up a determined pace 
to honor our commitments to our customers, 
consumers and the world.
working together
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic had a 
significant impact on many communities and, 
as a responsible corporate citizen, novozymes 
stepped in where possible. we worked together 
with the novo nordisk foundation to get the 
covid-19 testing capacity up and running in 
denmark. in other parts of the world, we made 
direct donations to ngos, either monetary or 
in the form of essential equipment.
our primary focus during this uncertain year 
has been to keep our employees safe whether 
they were working in production, in labs or 
from home. novozymes’ employees have 
shown so much care for each other, and we 
want to acknowledge what a fantastic job 
they have done. through our inspire program, 
our employees have also managed to reach 
out to their communities and help those 
in need, whether it be collecting funds for 
disadvantaged people or offering their skills to 
educate children virtually.
the promotion of equal opportunities for all 
people has been on novozymes’ agenda for 
many years, but we can still do more. there are 
always new aspects or new groups of people 
and backgrounds to consider when prioritizing 
diversity. it is important to consider diversity 
and inclusion in all aspects of business. 
that also applies in times of change, so to 
strengthen the collective capabilities of our 
dedicated employees, we set diversity criteria 
for everyone involved in the formation of new 
roles and teams during our re-organization 
in september. we also collaborated with 
america’s job exchange to reach a more 
diverse pool of candidates with our job ads, 
and we set up focus groups with employees to 
discuss where we are, where we want to be, 
and how we intend to get there. a truly diverse 
workforce will contribute to driving change and 
building a thriving culture.
thank you
we want to thank all our stakeholders for what 
we were able to achieve together in a year 
unlike any we have ever seen before. in times 
of change, everything is magnified, whether 
it is your weaknesses or your strengths. this 
year has proven to us that novozymes has 
strong partnerships with customers, a resilient 
portfolio and committed employees who are 
able to adapt and be innovative in challenging 
times. that’s a great foundation from which to 
grow. 
we expect that we will return to growth in 2021, 
supported by a more streamlined organization, 
stronger commercial presence, innovation, 
as well as a gradual recovery in those areas 
adversely affected by the pandemic. based on 
this, we have set a sales growth expectation of 
between 2% to 6% in 2021, provided we do not 
see another extended global lockdown.
we look forward to working with our customers 
to find, develop and champion sustainable 
solutions to the challenges we all face.

t novozymes, we produce enzymes and 
microorganisms for a diverse range of 
industries. in fact, our biological solutions can 
be found everywhere, from the products that 
clean your clothes, to the food you eat, and the 
ethanol that powers your car. 
so, it goes without saying that the industries 
we serve have very differing needs. some 
industries are shaped by shifting trends and 
consumer demands, including the need for 
more sustainable solutions, while others 
focus on how to save resources, optimize 
performance and improve sustainability in their 
production processes. 
in order to best meet customer needs and 
bring more customer-generated ideas into 
our innovation process, we created two new 
divisions in september 2020: consumer 
biosolutions and agriculture & industrial 
biosolutions. 
agriculture & industrial biosolutions
in agriculture and industrial biosolutions, we focus 
on improved performance in agriculture and industrial 
processes, including higher yields, less waste and better 
health for plants and animals.
 
we strive to translate our customers’ needs into solutions 
that improve their return on investment and increase 
sustainability benefits. we achieve this with the help 
of an improved understanding of our customers 
and the macro trends that influence their 
businesses. we meet customers’ needs 
through a combination of a world class 
product portfolio, digital solutions and 
a comprehensive service package.
consumer 
biosolutions
consumer biosolutions unites 
consumer-facing industries at the front 
of the value chain such as household 
care, baking, beverages, food and protein, 
with a focus on making consumer products 
better, healthier and higher performing, based on 
clear end-consumer needs. 
we have a strong understanding of our customers and the consumer 
groups they serve. this understanding enables us to guide our 
customers on a journey towards the perfect biological solution for 
them by activating a combination of our existing products, new 
technology, marketing support and know-how that can help them 
differentiate their products, improve their sustainability profile and 
help grow their market share.

the big picture      working with the sdgs
novozymes a/s
sustainability has been integral to novozymes for 
decades. we are proud that our solutions contribute 
to one or more of the sustainable development goals 
(sdgs), directly or indirectly. every day, we strive to do 
our part to deliver on the sdgs, from the core of our 
business and right through our operations.
w
hen 193 un member states created 
the sdgs in 2015, we immediately 
saw the sdgs as a common framework that 
could enable the world to work towards the 
sustainable future we all want. the sdgs have 
inspired our purpose, strategy and targets and, 
by the very nature of our business, we have 
made significant progress in delivering on the 
goals since then.
novozymes produces a wide range of enzymes 
and microorganisms for many applications. 
our solutions enable our customers to produce 
more from less, often reducing the use of 
energy and chemicals as well as co2 emissions. 
we live our purpose when we help our 
customers make their production processes 
and products better for the world, thereby 
contributing to the sdgs as well.  
through our strategy, better business with 
biology, we are committed to developing 
working with 
the sdgs
 
 
 see also “novozymes and the global 
goals” for more details about how we 
contribute to the sdgs
solutions that can contribute to solving 
three global challenges: climate, water 
and production and consumption. we are 
also committed to operating our business 
responsibly and investing to minimize our 
negative environmental footprint. we are 
investing in new strategic opportunity 
areas, including human oral & gut health 
and specialty alternative proteins. these 
are opportunities that are inspired by the 
challenges embodied in the sdgs. they cater 
to a growing desire among consumers to live 
lives that are better for themselves and the 
environment. 
here are some examples of how our business 
and solutions contributed to the sdgs in 2020.

our solutions enable our 
agriculture customers to improve 
performance across the value 
chain from farm to table. 
microbial solutions for agriculture 
help farmers increase the 
efficiency of crop and livestock 
production, reduce environmental 
impacts and improve climate 
resilience. in 2020, we launched 
taegro® - a biocontrol solution 
for fruit and vegetables which 
enables farmers to protect their 
yield while reducing the use of 
fossil-based chemical fertilizers.
fewer chemicals,  
cleaner water
goal 6:  
clean water and sanitation
goal 14: 
life below water
our solutions help our customers 
reduce their consumption 
of water, reduce wastewater 
and reduce aquatic pollution 
by reducing the use of harsh 
chemicals that often end up in 
aquatic environments. 
in 2020, we launched microvia®, 
a bacterial bio-cleaning solution 
for hard surface cleaners which 
reduces the use of chemicals. our 
launches in agriculture and food 
production also reduce the use 
of chemicals and the resulting 
nutrient pollution impact from 
our customers. we also partnered 
with wwf to help us develop 
programs for water management 
influenced by the local water 
challenges and current and future 
conditions of water – at all our 
sites. 
enabling a  
low carbon future
goal 7:  
affordable and clean energy
goal 13:  
climate action
novozymes is committed to help 
the world limit global warming 
through our actions across the 
value chain. we are committed 
to playing our part to limit the 
increase in global warming to 
1.5°c. and to making novozymes 
carbon-neutral by 2050. many of 
our solutions reduce the carbon 
intensity of the processes they are 
applied in.  
our solutions enable the 
development of low-carbon fuels 
for the transport sector, which 
represents a significant share 
of the global energy mix and 
related co2 emissions. in 2020, 
our bioenergy solutions helped 
save 49 million tons of co2. we 
are also a member of the re100, 
a global initiative working with 
companies that have committed 
to 100% renewable electricity.
enabling our 
customers to produce 
more from less
goal 12:  
responsible production  
and consumption
our solutions enable our 
customers to produce more from 
less across many industries. in 
2020, we launched quara boost® 
and lphera® which help food 
processors produce more oils 
and starch from their feedstocks, 
while reducing their use of energy 
and processing chemicals.
we celebrated the 30th 
anniversary of our baking solution 
novamyl® in 2020. over the years, 
it has saved 80 billion loaves of 
bread from being thrown out, 
which - in addition to the reduced 
food waste – has also saved an 
estimated 45 million tons of co2.
partnering  
for impact 
goal 17:  
partnership for the goals
our most significant 
contributions to society are 
driven through collaborations 
with our customers, governments, 
suppliers and academia to learn, 
develop and deliver solutions 
to the most pressing needs of 
society.
in the eu, novozymes has worked 
strategically with the eu green 
deal through various industry 
organizations and supported the 
eu commission's action plan 
to address climate change and 
environmental degradation. in 
2020, we joined the ‘climate 
partnership for life science & 
biotech’ partnership, one of many 
climate partnerships put forward 
by the danish government. 
we also co-drive an open 
innovation platform, hello

strategy
we believe the future is 
shaped by the promise of 
biology, and we work every 
day to make good on this 
promise for the benefit 
of our customers, our 
business and the world.
t
he year 2020 was unlike what anyone 
could have predicted. however, while it 
was a year characterized by uncertainty, at 
novozymes we remain certain of one thing: 
the world needs sustainable solutions and our 
ambition for a more sustainable future remains 
intact. 
our purpose – “together we find biological 
answers for better lives in a growing world 
– let’s rethink tomorrow” – serves as the 
guiding principle for the way we do business. 
by continually expanding the reach of our 
solutions, we can ensure we remain true to 
our purpose and to rethinking the world of 
tomorrow.  
our strategy, better business with biology, 
guides clear priorities as well as growth and 
profitability targets for each of our business 
areas. we strive to maximize value creation 
through the commercialization of our core 
business while investing in a more focused 
r&d pipeline and new strategic opportunity 
areas outside the core. in 2020, we prioritized 
enhancing a value-chain focused and customer-
centric approach. this was the year of aligning 
more with the needs of customers, focusing on 
the most important innovations and advancing 
promising new business areas.
moving 
even 
closer to 
customers
i
n september, our organization was reshaped 
to better address customer needs across the 
full value chain. our two divisions, consumer 
biosolutions and agriculture & industrial 
biosolutions, allow for a more integrated 
approach towards end markets, defined by 
common characteristics and value drivers. 
consumer biosolutions caters to industries 
that supply sustainable solutions with clear 
consumer benefits and agriculture & industrial 
biosolutions cover industries that supply 
sustainable solutions focused on maximizing 
yields and optimizing processes for our 
customers.
in consumer biosolutions, we announced a 
joint launch with firmenich, the world's largest

novozymes a/s
amid the pandemic. we hosted livestreams 
on the alibaba 1688 online platform which 
attracted thousands of unique visitors, and 
we will continue to strengthen the partnership 
between novozymes and alibaba. the launch 
of microvia™, our bacterial bio-cleaning 
solution for hard surface cleaners, addresses 
an increased focus on safe, effective solutions 
for cleaning at home and at work during 
the pandemic and is a showcase for our 
capabilities in the relatively new space of 
probiotic cleaners.
several of our bioethanol customers saw 
the demand for ethanol rise as the need for 
hand sanitizers and disinfectants increased 
dramatically during the pandemic. we 
supported customers who donated ethanol 
for the production of hand sanitizers and 
disinfectants by offering them free input 
products for the ethanol production.
although 2020 was a unique year, there have 
been learnings we take with us to stay agile, 
efficient and responsive to customers. 
s
ince 2019, we have been investing in what 
we call strategic opportunity areas – or 
soas. finding biological solutions for improved 
human oral and gut health is one such soa 
and has been a key focus in 2020.

global consumer trend. we also entered into 
a research partnership with givaudan, the 
world’s largest flavor and fragrance developer, 
to work on the research and development of 
innovative sustainable solutions in food & 
beverages and household care.
in agriculture & industrial biosolutions, 
we launched our fiberex® platform, a new 
platform for enzymes and yeast strains that 
can convert corn fiber into ethanol. with 
fiberex®, customers are able to expand the 
boundaries of corn-based ethanol by extracting 
more corn oil from kernels and converting 
the fiber into simple sugars that are easily 
converted into ethanol, unlocking new profit 
streams for ethanol producers.
we also forged a stronger connection 
between the back and front ends of our 
company by having the heads of our research 
& development organization as well as 
operations, supply & quality join the executive 
leadership team.
in the new divisional structure, we allocate 
more resources to our regions. stronger 
geographical representation in our core 
decision processes will improve decision-
making and bring more tailor-made solutions 
to our customers.
t
he covid-19 pandemic has accelerated 
the need for digital communication in 
order to overcome lockdowns and travel 
restrictions, and this is a development we 
embrace. by enhancing and expanding the 
use of digital tools, we were able to improve 
collaboration within the organization, 
strengthen customer relationships and drive 
new leads without notable interruption. 
our webinar platform – a tool to help our 
employees conduct webinars for existing and 
potential customers – has proven effective in 
gaining leads that would previously have been 
hard to reach. the data and insights collected 
from webinars have been used to nurture new 
and existing customers along the customer 
decision journey.
in brewing, we strived to reach out to more, 
smaller breweries using digital tools. on the 
website brewing with enzymes, we share the 
benefits of introducing enzymes into the craft 
brewing process and potential customers can 
enter a live chat with experts.
covid-19 is also on the minds of many of 
our customers, and we reached out to the 
american laundry market with articles and 
webinars about cleaning and buying habits 
and trends shaped by the pandemic. in 
china, we embraced new and effective ways

biofresh® 4+ was launched in december under 
the novozymes onehealth brand. novozymes 
established the novozymes onehealth brand 
to market solutions within human health

at the heart of product development. studies 
show that up to 50% of consumers have been 
concerned about bad breath at some point in 
their life*. biofresh® 4+ is a tablet for oral use 
which helps reduce bad breath and is effective 
for up to 4 hours. the only enzymatic solution 
of its kind on the market, it addresses a 
growing gap between consumers’ expectations 
of oral care products and the current offerings 
available on the market.
in june, novozymes acquired precisionbiotics 
group limited. based in cork, ireland, 
precisionbiotics group holds a leading position 
within probiotics for human gut health and is 
well positioned with several clinically backed 
products already on the market.  
in january 2021, we acquired microbiome

our business      risk management
novozymes a/s
risk management
novozymes is a global company operating in a range of industries and, as 
such, we face a diverse set of risks. we continuously strengthen our work 
on risk management to secure novozymes’ operations, stakeholders and 
our ability to generate value in the short, medium and long term. 
n
ovozymes’ risk management process 
is designed to ensure that we identify, 
assess and mitigate key business risks in a 
timely manner. we do this to ensure risks do 
not negatively affect our ability to achieve our 
targets and deliver value to our stakeholders. 
in addition to monitoring and addressing our 
risks, we also monitor longer-term threats 
and trends. the board of directors has the 
overall responsibility for overseeing risks and 
for maintaining a robust risk management and 
internal control system. 
risk management framework 
novozymes operates an enterprise risk 
management (erm) process whereby the 
key risks facing the company are identified, 
assessed and mitigated at different levels of the 
organization. we monitor most risks by means 
of biannual reviews, although some risks may 
materialize within a short period of time and 
require more frequent updates, the covid-19 
pandemic in 2020 being a case in point.
the risk management & controls department is 
responsible for identifying risks in collaboration 
with the organization and for ensuring that 
senior management promotes risk awareness, 
engagement and ownership across the 
organization. risks are assessed based on a 
two-dimensional heat map rating system that 
estimates the potential impact of a given risk on 
financials and reputation, and the likelihood of 
that risk materializing. each key risk is assigned 
a risk owner from the executive leadership 
team and a risk responsible, usually a vice 
president, responsible for mitigating all risks 
relevant to their respective areas.
the most significant risks are reviewed and 
assessed by the executive leadership team 
and the board of directors, who are also 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal control 
processes throughout the year. in 2020, the 
audit committee, on behalf of the board of 
directors, made deep dives into selected risks 
and risk processes. 
although the covid-19 pandemic had a 
significant impact on the world in 2020, a 
risk on ‘worldwide pandemic disease’ is not 
included as a key risk. in general, pandemic 
outbreaks are rare events and so have not 
rated highly on likelihood. the covid-19 
pandemic is currently affecting businesses and 
will continue to do so in 2021. the executive 
leadership team will continue to monitor 
and address potential business risks arising 
from the covid-19 situation, e.g., changed 
consumer behaviors, declining gdp growth, 
while our global and local crisis response 
teams safeguard our people and communities.
our four key 
risks for 2021 
are unchanged 
from 2020: 
competition 
and market 
consolidation; 
volatility of 
agriculture-
related business; 
cyberattacks 
and global 
political and 
economic 
instability.

our business      key enterprise risks for 2021
novozymes a/s
key enterprise risks for 2021
   competition and market consolidation 
novozymes is the market leader in the global enzyme market, which remains highly 
competitive. our position in the market may be challenged by competition from both existing 
and potential new competitors, sometimes formed through consolidation. we continue to see 
a risk of competitors operating under less regulated market conditions. 
potential impact 
we could face increased competition 
from other enzyme manufacturers 
offering new solutions or from new 
players with technology platforms that 
are broader than ours. with increased 
digitalization, competition could also 
relate to how solutions are implemented 
in customer production. although 
consolidation can make the market 
more stable, it could also increase a 
competitor’s financial strength and 
bargaining power. 
mitigating actions
in 2020, we preserved our market-leading position 
by introducing new innovations, strengthening 
our commercial relationships – even during global 
lockdowns – and re-shaping our organization to 
be even more customer-centric and value chain 
focused. as part of our organizational changes 
in september 2020, we increased regional 
empowerment to ensure further agility in markets 
where we see strong potential for our solutions. 
in 2021, we will continue to improve our go-to-
market strategies, accelerate regional innovations 
to strengthen our position in certain markets, 
nurture partnerships and build on our strong 
relationships with key customers.
   volatility of agriculture- related business  
novozymes’ agriculture-related business is affected by numerous elements, such as weather 
conditions, commodity prices, political mandates for ethanol blends, etc. in addition, ongoing 
geopolitical uncertainty adds to the overall volatility of the industry. 
potential impact 
in 2020, our bioenergy business in the 
us experienced a steep decline from 
a sharp drop in gasoline consumption 
due to covid-19 restrictions. if global 
lockdowns, volatility of the agricultural-
related markets, and poor global farm 
economics persist, it could challenge 
our ability to grow in the industry. 
mitigating actions
in 2020, we worked to leverage our industry-
leading enzyme portfolio in combination with 
yeast technologies to strengthen our position 
in the bioethanol industry. in september 2020, 
we launched fiberex®, a platform solution 
specifically aimed at converting a low-value by-
product – corn fiber – into high-value, cellulosic 
low-carbon fuel.
with the move in 2019 to a more flexible 
go-to-market approach in our agriculture 
business we find ourselves in a transition phase 
still. however, we are seeing good traction with 
partners as exemplified by the second quarter 
launch of the biocontrol product taegro® in 
europe and south america, in partnership with 
syngenta.
in 2021, we remain focused on building 
strong relations with our customers in the 
agriculture-related business, while also increasing 
our internal commercial competences, including 
technical sales support.
27
our business      key enterprise risks for 2021
novozymes a/s
   cyberattacks  
as for most major companies, the threat of cyberattacks to our business operations has grown 
significantly in recent years. the rapid digitalization of businesses and lack of regulations 
online drive this trend. across the world, cybercrime can be seen to offer fast gains at low risk. 
preserving business continuity and safeguarding sensitive business data and critical assets 
against this global threat is extremely important to novozymes. 
potential impact 
as a technology-driven company, we 
rely on the integrity and availability 
of computers and networks, and 
the sharing of data. cybercrime and 
hacker attacks may negatively impact 
novozymes’ productivity if systems 
are inaccessible for an extended 
period. furthermore, fast digitalization 
continuously exposes novozymes 
to cybersecurity threats. business 
opportunities with customers could be 
adversely impacted if information about 
novozymes’ unique technologies or 
production strains is stolen.
we actively seek to learn from other 
companies’ experiences and, upon 
reviewing incidents of cyberattacks 
and technology developments, we have 
reassessed and adjusted the potential 
impact of this risk.
mitigating actions
our ability to identify, protect, detect and 
respond to cyberattacks has significantly 
improved in recent years. in 2020, we gained 
more quantitative insights into potential security 
threats and vulnerabilities at novozymes, enabling 
us to prioritize efforts and further raise our level 
of security. key focus areas have been to test and 
improve our it emergency response, implement 
comprehensive and consistent information 
risk management and expand our detection 
capabilities and automation of cyber incident 
handling to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks. 
while cyberattacks can be seen to raise 
the threat of global theft, our more than 6,500 
granted or pending patents remain a strong 
defense of our solutions.
in 2021, we will continue to mitigate the 
risk of cyberattacks through an updated 
security roadmap, specifically identity and 
access management (iam), network & endpoint 
protection and data. 
as our operations become even more 
dependent on digitization and data analytics, 
we will increase the focus on operational 
technologies in our production facilities to ensure 
they stay operational at all times.
   global political and economic instability   
there continues to be significant instability in the global economy and in the political 
landscape. trade conditions are subject to uncertainty and shifts, making it more difficult 
to mitigate risk. adding to this, the covid-19 pandemic has a potential negative impact on 
global economic growth. 
potential impact 
as a global company, polarization 
and trade protectionism can have 
an adverse impact on novozymes’ 
ability to operate. long-term decision-
making is complicated, both for us 
and for our customers, if world leaders 
struggle to agree and to work together 
to strengthen global and regional 
institutions. 
we have yet to see the full global 
economic impact of the covid-19 
pandemic, but we have already felt the 
effects of lower demand in some areas. 
we could ultimately see price sensitivity 
grow among customers and consumers. 
there is also a risk of exchange 
rate fluctuations and of customers, 
partners and suppliers risking or facing 
insolvency. 
mitigating actions
in 2020, novozymes closely monitored political 
and economic developments, such as the 
us–china trade negotiations. we emphasized 
considerations beyond financial analysis, 
e.g., handling bilateral relations and image/
perception. in addition, we focused on customs 
handling to ensure fast response and optimizing 
of customs paid. 
pricing continues to be an area of focus in our 
commercial organization. we have strengthened 
our focus on generating profitable growth – 
which includes increased pricing transparency 
and governance. this effort will be further 
strengthened in 2021 with a cross divisional 
global focus on pricing.
we remain engaged in global forums on 
sustainability, aiming to champion the benefits of 
globalization and shared commitments, and we 
continuously promote the importance of working 
together globally for a sustainable future.
for 2021 and beyond, the global outlook 
remains uncertain, as the full impact of e.g. brexit 
and covid-19 remains unclear at the time of 
writing, and several conflicts need to be settled 
to ensure political stability and free trade. we 
will further seek to improve our data analysis and 
general monitoring for better predictability and 
speed of reaction.
28
our business      emerging risks
novozymes a/s
e
merging risks are mainly assessed through 
our enterprise risk management process 
and integrated sustainability trendspotting 
exercise. we engage with relevant stakeholders 
in a timely manner to develop strategies and 
ensure that we are prepared to take adequate 
action and respond to those risks. 
there is a renewed focus on the risk climate 
change poses to the world. businesses 
face increased scrutiny on climate-related 
disclosures and actions, and this is an area of 
continued focus for novozymes. science has 
long proved that the impact of climate change 
is already being felt across the world, for 
example through wildfires, flooding, drought, 
etc. to tackle climate change, the world needs 
to limit the increase in global warming to 1.5°c. 
at novozymes, we are committed to doing our 
part and to helping the world reach the goals 
of the paris agreement. we have also identified 
climate-related risks specifically relevant to our 
business and we disclose details on this in our 
annual response to the cdp climate change 
questionnaire.
novozymes is also closely monitoring the 
ongoing dialogue on nature and biodiversity 
loss. going forward, we will seek to understand 
the implications of this trend and understand 
the potential impact on our business. 
additionally, the following continue to be our 
key emerging risks: 
concerns regarding new and  
emerging technologies  
there is growing consumer demand for natural 
products, low-carbon solutions and bio-
based innovation. industrial biotechnology 
is a key enabling technology for delivering 
these solutions. at the same time, we also see 
tighter regulatory control in the biotechnology 
and chemical sectors. over the coming years, 
we expect to see more significant biotech 
innovation, including gene editing, and to face 
increasing government and ngo scrutiny, 
which can limit or slow the application of 
biotechnology. 
emerging risks
we closely monitor emerging risks across different 
categories including technology, finance and 
sustainability that have the potential to impact our 
business in the longterm. 
we see tighter regulatory control in the 
biotechnology and chemical sectors in 
the coming years
29
our business      emerging risks
novozymes a/s
novozymes’ research and business are 
based on bio-innovation and through these 
technologies, we find safe and sustainable 
answers to some of the planet’s most pressing 
challenges. we are committed to sharing our 
knowledge about the potential of biology 
and industrial biotechnology with the public, 
as well as other stakeholders outside of 
novozymes. our position statement on 
industrial biotechnology describes how 
industrial biotechnology and gene technology 
can contribute to sustainable development.
we acknowledge the concerns related to the 
use of gene editing, so we apply and promote 
safe and sustainable use of gene editing 
technology. we support a science-based 
regulatory framework for products involving 
gene editing and operate in compliance with 
legislation. novozymes is committed to using 
scientifically-sound tools in a way that is safe 
to humans, animals and the environment. we 
are open about what we do, and we engage in 
dialogue on any concerns raised.  
as we explore the increased use of 
biotechnology, we will continue to engage in 
and push for open dialogue about its benefits, 
while also developing best practices together 
with stakeholders to mitigate the potential 
risks.
water-constrained future 
global freshwater resources have come 
under pressure due to climate change, 
industrialization, urbanization and a growing 
population. according to the world economic 
forum, water crises have for many years been 
among the top five global risks in terms of 
impact. governments are responding with 
stricter regulations and the private sector 
is driving action through various initiatives 
such as the ceo water mandate, world wide 
fund for nature (wwf) and science based 
targets network (sbtn). novozymes recognizes 
that effective water management needs a 
local approach that is informed by science, 
context and collective action from a number of 
stakeholders.
water is material for novozymes across our 
entire value chain. many of the raw materials 
required in our operations are agriculture-
based and thus water-intensive to produce. 
we have conducted site-specific water-risk 
assessments to identify water-stressed sites 
and regions and included analysis of upcoming 
regulation related to water to inform about our 
water stewardship strategy. 
besides the risk that water-related issues pose 
to our operations, increasing demand for clean 
water solutions also serves as an opportunity 
for our business as some of our solutions can 
contribute to solving several water-related 
issues. one such significant opportunity 
is how we enable our customers to reduce 
water consumption and improve wastewater 
quality by replacing chemicals with biological 
solutions.
the covid-19 pandemic validated the 
effectiveness of our risk management and crisis 
responses. though a pandemic risk was not top 
of mind going into 2020, we had considered the 
possibility of such an event. our crisis response 
setup proved robust, with a global task force that 
outlines and coordinates novozymes’ global instructions, 
and local task forces that ensure actions and guidelines 
aligned with local authorities’ and the local situation. this 
enabled us to respond quickly and effectively to protect our 
employees, business, and customers as well as support our 
communities, and to proactively prepare as the pandemic 
grew in intensity.
overall, our production has not been disrupted by the 
pandemic. our production setup is structured to minimize the 
risk of a shutdown and can be shifted to other sites, thereby 
allowing us to honor our commitment to our customers. 
our employees have been working in a safe setting, either 
at home or at our sites, and have been given the flexibility 
to meet the personal and community challenges that have 
arisen due to covid-19 restrictions and concerns. we have 
also emphasized novozymes’ contribution and role as a good 
corporate citizen and supported authorities’ efforts in dealing 
with the pandemic.

our business      targets
novozymes a/s
a
t novozymes, we measure progress 
towards our 2022 targets, which focus on 
the world, our business, our employees and our 
own operations. 
a sound business
to shape a future of better business for us, 
our customers and the world, we need to have 
targets
the success of our strategy is measured using financial 
and nonfinancial targets. these targets reflect our focus 
on a sound business, engaged employees and our ability 
to enable our customers to be more sustainable while at 
the same time reducing our own environmental footprint.
we can have the most significant impact on 
mitigating climate change by enabling low-
carbon fuels for the transport sector, as this 
sector accounts for about 25% of global   
energy-related co2 emissions. 
climate change is also considered in our own 
operations, as industrial production processes 
are energy-intensive. therefore, we have set a 
verified science-based target for reducing our 
absolute co2 emissions in line with the most 
ambitious decarbonization pathway. 
we will work to ensure clean and efficient 
water use by providing solutions that  
replace chemicals, particularly in laundry.
water is also a fundamental resource for  
our production processes. we are committed 
to pioneering a context-based approach 
to water management across all sites and 
have therefore set a target to have all our 
sites manage water in balance with local 
conditions.
we know we will only be able to achieve 
our financial and non-financial targets with 
the help of a healthy, diverse and engaged 
workforce, so we have also set 2022 
employee targets. 
while most of our solutions enable improved 
production efficiency, we are highlighting 
solutions that let us enable sustainable 
food production as part of our production & 
consumption target.
we also aim to drive our business towards 
more circularity. therefore, all our key 
materials and waste will be managed in 
circular systems by 2030.

and nonfinancial targets
a sound, balanced and growing business. 
this will allow us to continue investing in our 
leadership position within biotechnology and 
capture new opportunities in the industries 
we serve.
by 2022, we aim to have an ebit margin of 
28% or higher, and roic including goodwill of 
23% or higher. we strive to generate 5+% sales 
growth per year.
looking ahead into 2021, we expect to grow 
sales by 2% to 6% organically. the guidance 
is wide and based on a gradual recovery from 
the pandemic impact in 2020 but would not 
cover a situation with another extended global 
lockdown. we also expect a solid reported ebit 
margin of 25% to 26% in 2021 (2020: 26.1%), 
which includes a negative year-on-year impact 
from currency and m&a-related effects of close 
to 1 percentage point each.
roic, including goodwill, in 2021 is expected 
at around 19% (2020: 18.9%) which includes 
negative currency and m&a-related effects 
totaling  roughly 2 percentage points.
 
mid-term targets, long-term commitments
achieving our 2022 nonfinancial targets will 
put us on the path to accomplish our 2030 
commitments. our commitments and targets 
are focused on climate, water, production & 
consumption and employees and are guided 
by the sustainable development goals (sdgs).
within each of these areas, we have set 2022 
targets that reflect both the positive impact we 
believe our solutions have on the world, as well 
as the care we know we must show to ensure 
we minimize the environmental impact of our 
production processes and our operations in 
general. 
in addition to the areas highlighted by 
the targets, we are committed to being a 
responsible corporate citizen and engage 
locally as well as globally for a better world 
with biology.
on the following pages, we elaborate on 
the progress towards our 2022 nonfinancial 
targets.

novozymes a/s
t
he scientific community agrees that 
the world is rapidly moving towards an 
unsustainable rise in temperature. to halt this 
development, we must reduce co2 emissions 
in the atmosphere. novozymes’ commitment 
to provide the world with biological solutions 
that can help limit global warming to 1.5°c 
has been validated by the science based 
targets initiative.  
2020 highlights
• 
 we saved 49 million tons of co2 by 
enabling low carbon fuels in the transport 
sector in 2020. the covid-19 pandemic 
caused a slowdown in the use of liquid 
transportation fuels. hence, the demand 
for ethanol and the resulting reduction of 
co2 emissions has declined this year. 
• 
 in 2020, our franklinton site in north 
carolina, usa purchased green-e® 
certified renewable energy certificates 
(recs) from two local solar farms. this 
purchase covers the full annual electricity 
consumption of the site and supported 
renewables on the local grid in north 
carolina. with this, we are now sourcing 
69% of our electricity globally from 
renewables. 
• 
 at our fuglebakken site in denmark, 
a newly installed heat pump will be

w
ater is a scarce resource, and, in 
many regions, people suffer from 
lack of access to clean water. water is also a 
fundamental component of our production 
processes, so we must manage our water use 
responsibly.  
 
2020 highlights
• 
 in 2020, we progressed towards our 
reach target and managed to reach 3.98 
billion people with our laundry solutions. 
this development was mainly driven 
by increased penetration of enzymatic 
detergents in africa and latin america.

s the covid-19 pandemic significantly affected 
societies all over the world in 2020, we focused 
our inspire outreach efforts on the pandemic.
in india, employees participated in a virtual fitness 
challenge to raise money for daily-wage earners. 
observing local rules and guidelines, our employees 
walked almost 2.3 million steps in a day, each step 
sparking a proportional contribution towards a 
donation totaling inr 1.7 million. the sum was 
donated to state funds and organizations in mumbai 
and bangalore engaged in disaster management 
and eradication of hunger.
in brazil, we collaborated with contagious smiles 
(contagiando sorrisos), a project that works with 
local artists to design face masks to bring hope and 
positivity to the local community.
in north america, employees have developed 
teaching materials on stem education, specifically 
for at-home schooling for families enduring 
school closures. in north carolina, novozymes 
partnered with north carolina state university’s 
biomanufacturing training & education center 
(btec) to produce hand sanitizer, helping to keep 
students and faculty at nc state university healthy. 
in denmark, employees were encouraged to partake 
in a national covid-19 antibody test, which could 
be done on novozymes’ premises. we also donated 
lab coats to healthcare assistants as well as 
essential equipment to a new testing facility at ssi, 
the national serum institute.
in china, we donated rmb 1 million via red 
cross to help build hospitals in huoshenshan and 
leishenshan, procure supplies, and provide support 
for frontline workers battling the pandemic.
collaborating with communities during covid-19
at novozymes, we have always been active members of 
our communities - giving back when possible. this has now 
been formalized through our inspire target of pledging 1% 
of our time to local outreach.

builds on improving the underlying 
performance on top of a better than 
expected performance in 2020.
food, beverages & human health 
2021 organic sales growth is expected 
to be broad-based. innovation 
and emerging market penetration, 
supported by increasing consumer 
dietary-health-awareness, are the 
main drivers of growth in the food 
business. beverages is expected to 
gradually recover following a 2020 
severely affected by covid-19 
implications. the precisionbiotics 
group and microbiome labs 
acquisitions are both estimated to 
contribute to growth in reported 
dkk and to grow organically by solid 
double-digits.
bioenergy organic sales growth 
in 2021 is expected to be driven 
by a gradual recovery in the us 
ethanol industry, following the 
severe disruption caused by the 
covid-19 pandemic. the mid-point 
of the bioenergy organic sales range 
roughly corresponds to mid-single 
digit growth in the us ethanol 
production. the growth contribution 
from regions outside of the us is 
expected to be positive. 
grain & tech processing organic 
sales growth is expected to be broad-
based, with both grain and tech 
contributing positively. the grain 
business is expected to outgrow 
a roughly flat underlying market, 
driven by innovation and increased 
local presence across key regions. 
tech is expected to gradually recover 
after the significant disruption of the 
global textile industry in 2020. 
agriculture, animal health & 
nutrition organic sales performance 
in 2021 will be driven by the 
continued expansion of the bioag 
business across crops and regions, 
resulting in solid underlying double-
digit organic sales growth when 
adjusted for the dkk ~60 million one-
off in the second quarter of 2020. the 
outlook for animal health & nutrition 
includes some uncertainty as to 
stocking levels in the value chain, 
further accentuated by the pandemic. 
a strong innovative product portfolio 
and partnership setup coupled with 
signs of improving farmer economics 
make us carefully optimistic about the 
years to come. 
especially in the areas most impacted by the 
pandemic in 2020, would imply a performance 
in the high- respectively low-end of the outlook 
range. however, the outlook range would not 
cover a situation with another extended global 
lockdown. sales in reported dkk are expected 
to be ~1 percentage point less, net of currency 
and m&a-related effects, compared to the 
2-6% organic sales growth outlook. organic 
sales in the first quarter is expected to decline 
by mid-single digits year-on-year following the 
relatively high comparator of the first quarter 
of last year, especially in household care, 
bioenergy and in food, beverages & human 
health.
food, beverages & human health and grain 
& tech processing are both expected to grow 
organically by mid-single-digits while bioenergy 
is expected to grow by mid-to-high single digits 
in 2021. the growth outlook for household 
care is in the low-single-digits following the 
better than expected performance in 2020. 
agriculture, animal health & nutrition is 
expected at flat to low-single-digit growth.

our business      outlook for 2021
novozymes a/s
for 2021, novozymes expects a solid reported 
ebit margin of 25 - 26% (2020: 26.1%), which 
includes a negative year-on-year impact from 
currency and m&a-related effects of around 
1 percentage point each. hence, the implied 
underlying ebit margin for 2021 of 27- 28% 
should be compared with the underlying 2020 
ebit margin of ~27%, and the underlying 
2019 ebit margin of ~26%. supportive 
margin contributions from sales growth and 
productivity improvements are expected to be 
partly offset by slightly higher input costs and 
continued re-investment in the business. 
return on invested capital (roic), including 
goodwill, is expected at around 19% (2020: 
18.9%; underlying ~20%) and includes negative 
currency and m&a-related effects totaling 
roughly 2 percentage points.
free cash flow (fcf) before acquisitions is 
expected to be in the dkk 2.7-3.1 billion range 
(2020: dkk 3.4 billion), supported by higher 
sales and an improved operational cash flow. 
cash flow is expected to be somewhat lower 
than in 2020 as higher net investments and 
the timing of working capital will lower the 
2021 cash generation following a stronger than 
expected performance in 2020.
for modeling purposes, the  
following is provided:
the effective tax rate is expected at around

efficiencies from farm to table already in

b
oard composition and responsibilities 
in accordance with danish legislation, 
novozymes has a two-tier management 
system comprising the board of directors 
and the executive leadership team, with 
no individual being a member of both. the 
division of responsibilities between the board 
of directors and the executive leadership 
team is clearly outlined and described in the 
rules of procedure for the board of directors 
and the rules of procedure for the executive 
leadership team. both of these rule sets are 
available at novozymes.com
the board of directors' main  
responsibilities are to:  
•
 ensure the right management and
organizational structure
•
 oversee financial, social and environmental
performance, and the executive leadership
team’s operational management of
novozymes
•
 supervise the overall management and
strategic development of novozymes
novozymes’ articles of association require the 
board of directors to have from four to eight 
members elected at the annual shareholders’ 
meeting. the board currently has seven 
members elected by the shareholders. 
individuals are elected for terms of one year 
and cannot be elected or re-elected after 
reaching the age of 70. 
nominations are based on an evaluation 
of factors such as competencies, diversity, 
independence and performance. in accordance 
with danish law, the board also has three 
employee-elected members, who serve 
four-year terms. the board of directors is 
accountable to the company’s shareholders 
for the management of the company. the 
composition of the board must therefore be 
such that the combined competencies of the 
board enable it to inspire, guide and oversee 
novozymes’ development, and diligently 
address and resolve the issues and challenges 
facing novozymes at any time.  
the individual competencies of the members 
of the board are shown in the presentation of 
   at least 50% of the shareholder-
elected board members must be 
independent as defined in the 
danish recommendations on 
corporate governance 
   at least 40% of the 
shareholder-elected board 
members must have substantial 
international experience from 
the management of large 
corporations or institutions 
headquartered outside 
denmark 
   at least 33% of the shareholder-
elected board members must 
be female, and at least 33% of 
the shareholder-elected board 
members shall be male 
all three targets were met in 
2020, and the composition of 
the board of directors meets the 
gender diversity requirements set 
out in danish legislation. further, 
reporting on gender diversity at 
other management levels can be 
found in note 8.1 labor practices 
& human rights in the social and 
governance data section. the 
competencies and targets are 
defined in a competency profile 
that specifies the requirements for 
personal characteristics, skills and 
experience.

governance structure 
in accordance with the articles of association 
and the rules of procedure for the board 
of directors, the board has a chairmanship 
consisting of two members – the chair and the 
vice chair – who are responsible for assisting 
the board in matters concerning the executive 
leadership team’s operational management 
and for reporting back to the board. the 
chairmanship is also responsible for planning 
and preparing the meetings of the board. the 
board of directors has three committees: the 
nomination and remuneration committee, 
the audit committee and the innovation 
committee. the nomination and remuneration 
committee assists the board in the nomination 
of candidates for the board of directors, board 
committees and the executive management 
as well as in determining the remuneration of 
board members, board committee members 
and members of the executive management. 
the audit committee assists the board in 
overseeing aspects relating to accounting, 
auditing, risks, internal controls and financial, 
environmental, social and governance data. 
the innovation committee was created in 
2020 and assists the board with the review of 
novozymes’ overall capabilities and strategic 
direction in matters of technology, science and 
innovation. the innovation committee held its 
inaugural meeting in 2020, where focus was on 
the corporate innovation pipeline and on the 
innovation strategy for the onehealth brand. 
further information about the three board 
committees can be found at novozymes.com
charters and recommendations 
when laying down the management principles 
for novozymes, the board of directors 
followed the recommendations on corporate 
governance that form part of the disclosure 
requirements applicable to companies listed on 
nasdaq copenhagen. these recommendations 
are available at corporategovernance.dk. a 
detailed review of novozymes’ position on each 
of the recommendations and a description 
of the internal control and risk management 
system relating to financial reporting can be 
found in the statutory report on corporate 
governance prepared pursuant to section 107b 
of the danish financial statements act at 
https://investors.novozymes.com/investors/
corporate-governance/articles-of-association-
and-reports-on-corporate-governance/
default.aspx. these recommendations require 
companies to explain any deviations. novozymes 
follows 46 of the 47 recommendations, the 
exception being:  
•
 due to the limitations imposed by the novo
nordisk foundation’s articles of association
and novozymes’ ownership structure, the
board of directors reserves the right in
certain circumstances to reject takeover
bids without consulting shareholders.
(recommendation 1.3.1)
furthermore, under the danish financial 
statements act (sections 99a and 99b), it 
is mandatory for large companies to report 
on corporate social responsibility and 
equal opportunities as defined by the act.

other board-related information 
the board of directors held 10 meetings in 
2020, with an overall attendance rate of 99%. 
since march, all meetings have been held 
virtually due to restrictions brought on by the 
covid-19 pandemic. this has worked well, but 
the board looks forward to meeting up again 
when circumstances allow it.
any amendments to the articles of association 
require that shareholders representing at least 
two-thirds of the total number of votes in the 
company are represented at a shareholders’ 
meeting, and that at least two-thirds of the 
votes, as well as two-thirds of the voting 
capital represented at the meeting, are cast in 
favor of the proposal to amend the articles of 
association. 
the annual shareholders’ meeting has 
authorized the board of directors to allow 
the company to acquire treasury stock on an 
ongoing basis, provided the nominal value of 
the company’s total holding of treasury stock 
does not exceed 10% of its share capital at any 
time, cf. section 198 of the danish companies 
act. the purchase price must not deviate 
by more than 10% from the price quoted 
on nasdaq copenhagen a/s at the date of

in 2020, the annual evaluation of the board was conducted by the chair interviewing each 
board member and member of the executive leadership team. the evaluation revealed an 
overall good performance by the board of directors and good collaboration between the board 
of directors and the executive leadership team. the recommendations from the interviews 
included keeping a high focus on sales growth, innovation pipeline and strategy implementation.
evaluation of the board of directors 
capital and share structure of novozymes is 
optimal. the board of directors believes that 
the share structure with a and b common 
stock continues to be the best way in 2020 to 
safeguard novozymes’ long-term strategy and 
development to the benefit of the company’s 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 
regarding capital structure, novozymes will 
continue to favor a rather conservative balance 
sheet, as reflected by a target for net interest-
bearing debt of around 1x ebitda. thus the 
capital structure is in line with the target.
novozymes is party to a number of partnership 
contracts that can be terminated by the other 
party in the event of significant changes to the 
ownership or control of novozymes. a few of 
these contracts contain provisions that restrict 
novozymes’ licenses to use specific forms of 
technology in such situations.

governance      summary of the  remuneration report 
novozymes a/s
summary of the 
 remuneration report 
in 2020, novozymes launched a new remuneration policy 
for the board of directors and the executive management 
and established a new long-term incentive program for the 
management and all other employees. novozymes delivered 
resilient performance in 2020 despite the covid-19 
pandemic, all zymers have worked diligently to handle these 
difficult circumstances, which is also reflected in the payout 
ratio of the short-term cash-based incentive program for the 
executive management.
i
n 2020, novozymes adopted a new policy 
for the remuneration of novozymes’ board 
of directors and executive management. in 
designing the policy, we collected external 
benchmarks and sought independent 
advice from external experts on executive 
remuneration in denmark and europe 
and consulted a representative group of 
shareholders for input. we believe the new 
remuneration policy ensures alignment with 
the best practice expectations of investors, 
creates a strong link between performance 
and remuneration and provides clarity and 
simplicity of the remuneration arrangements. 
general remuneration policy 
novozymes’ remuneration policy for managers 
and other employees is designed to both 
encourage strong individual performance and 
support novozymes’ overall value creation. 
remuneration consists of a base salary, 
pension contributions, a cash bonus and stock-
based incentive programs. these components 
are linked to employees' individual 
performance and to the level of achievement of 
novozymes’ financial, social and environmental 
targets. the remuneration policy aims to 
provide managers and other employees with a 
competitive financial package, which we review 
regularly against external benchmarks.

governance      summary of the  remuneration report 
novozymes a/s
new remuneration report
in 2020, we have prepared the novozymes 
remuneration report 2020, which is disclosed 
as a separate report.  the content of the 
report has been prepared so as to meet the 
requirements of section 139b of the danish 
companies act and holds information and 
details on the remuneration of the board of 
directors and the executive management.
the novozymes remuneration report 2020 
will be presented for an advisory vote at the 
annual general meeting to be held in 2021. 
the following is a summary of the novozymes 
remuneration report 2020.
remuneration of the board of directors 
the remuneration of the board of directors 
comprises a fixed fee and is not incentive-
based. this ensures that the board of directors 
safeguards the company’s long-term interests 
without taking into consideration what this 
may mean in terms of the value of incentive-
based remuneration. the board of directors’ 
fee is set at a market-conformant level that 
reflects the competencies and efforts required 
of the role, given the complexity of the 
novozymes group, the scope of the work, and 
the number of board meetings held.

the fixed base fee was dkk 500,000 in 2020, 
the same as it has been since 2015. the chair 
receives a fee that is three times the base fee 
and the vice chair a fee that is two times the 
base fee. 
for committee work on the audit committee 
and the nomination and remuneration 
committee, the committee chair and other 
committee members receive a further base fee 
and half a base fee respectively. however, the 
chair and the vice chair of the board do not 
receive such additional fee if appointed to the 
nomination and remuneration committee.
in august 2020, the board of directors decided 
to establish an innovation committee. the 
board of directors determined that the 
chair of the innovation committee would 
receive a further base fee (for 2020 pro rata 
adjusted to the relevant part of the year) and 
that members of the innovation committee 
would each receive half a base fee (similarly 
adjusted).
during 2019, patricia malarkey and lars green 
resigned from the board, and at the annual 
general meeting held in february 2020, agnete 
raaschou-nielsen, resigned from the board 
as well. cees de jong, sharon james and 
heine dalsgaard were elected as new board 
members. cees de jong was appointed vice 
chair. 
the number of board members was thereby 
reestablished at seven member elected at the 
annual general meeting which, together with 
the newly established innovation committee, 
resulted in an increase of the total fees paid to 
the board of directors from dkk 7.0 million in 
2019 to dkk 8.2 million in 2020. 
the individual board members' fees and their 
shareholdings can be found in the novozymes 
remuneration report 2020.

as per 31 december 2020, the executive 
management of novozymes a/s consisted of:
• 
 ester baiget, president & chief executive 
officer (ceo)
• 
 lars green, executive vice president & 
chief financial officer (cfo)
•

thomas videbæk will transition his roles 
as executive vice president of people, 
sustainability & brand and strategy & business 
transformation during the second quarter of 
2021, after which he will leave novozymes. 
we are immensely grateful for thomas’ 
contributions to novozymes during his many 
years with the company.
the total remuneration to members of 
executive management comprises: 
• 
 a base salary plus pension, company car 
and certain other benefits 
• 
 a short-term incentive program (cash 
bonus) - stip 
• 
 a long-term incentive program (stock-based 
program) - ltip
in 2020, the members of the executive 
management received a 2.3% increase in their 
base salary. the increase was only given to

to their ordinary remuneration receive 
compensation for lost incentives from their 
previous employers. the compensation is 
48
governance      summary of the  remuneration report 
novozymes a/s
subject to certain conditions. over the period 
2020-2023, ester baiget may receive up to a 
total of dkk 9.6 million in extraordinary sign-
on compensation for lost incentives from her 
previous employer, of which dkk 4.2 million 
was paid out in 2020.  over the period 2020-
2023, lars green may receive up to a total 
of dkk 14.5 million in extraordinary sign-on 
compensation for lost incentives from his 
previous employer, of which dkk 0.7 million 
was paid out in 2020.
thomas videbæk will leave novozymes during 
2021. his severance package, totaling dkk 
35 million, was fully expensed in 2020. the 
severance package consists of salary, pension 
and bonuses during the notice period (12 
months) as well as termination compensation 
(24 months) and compensation for not being 
part of a stock-based program in 2020 and 
2021. severance pay of dkk 9 million was 
paid out in 2020, while the remaining dkk 26 
million will be paid out in 2021. furthermore, 
the remaining value of awarded stock and 
stock options, dkk 2 million, has been 
expensed.
peder holk nielsen left novozymes on january 
31, 2020. the severance payment of dkk 32 
million was made in 2020.
in 2020, executives were eligible for a defined 
contribution pension scheme of 11% of their 
base salary. in 2019, the pension scheme was 
between 25% and 27.6% of the base salary 
and short-term cash-based incentive.
the targets for the short-term incentive 
program (stip) are set by the board of 
directors in connection with the review of the 
business plan for the year. good performance 
will result in target payout (65%) while 
maximum payout is only achieved for delivering 
an extraordinary performance. maximum 
payout equals 9.5 months’ salary.
in 2020 the targets for the stip were split on 
the financial performance of the company at 
60% weight (ebit 45% weight and cash flow 
15% weight) and targets for the individual 
executives at 40% weight. 
in 2020 the financial performance of 
novozymes resulted in the ebit target being 
met, while the cash flow target was exceeded. 
the payout related to these targets was 65% 
and 100%, respectively.
the level of achievement of individual 
performance targets and thus the size of 
remuneration payment to the individual 
executive is determined by the board of 
directors based on recommendations from the 
nomination and remuneration committee.
based on its assessment, the board 
determined that the pay-out based on 
individual targets would be 90% for ester 
baiget, 80% for lars green and 67% for 
thomas videbæk.
the total payout ratio on the stip 2020 is 
shown on the next page.

the difference in the total remuneration to the executive management in the above table compared to note 6.1 – management remuneration is related to long-term incentives. the disclosure in note 6.1 is based 
on ifrs recognition principles where the long-term incentive programs are expensed over the year of grant and the subsequent years of vesting. the long-term incentive included in the above table is the cost of the 
2020 program measured at market value at the grant date.
*  peder holk nielsen and prisca havranec-kosicek’s severance packages were fully expensed in 2019. the severance packages consisted of salary, pension and bonuses during the notice period as well as 
termination compensation and compensation for not being part of the stock-based incentive program in 2020.
49
governance      summary of the  remuneration report 
novozymes a/s
the targets for the long-term incentive program 
covering the period 2017-2019 were partly 
met, and 61% of the program was awarded 
in january 2020. as a result, 38,857 shares 
associated with the program were released to 
the executive management in january 2020.
going forward, the board of directors will 
issue annual long-term incentive program 
(ltip) grants with overlapping three-year 
performance periods. this allows the board of 
directors to re-assess targets for each annual 
grant cycle to ensure they are both sufficiently 
demanding and aligned with the strategy.
 
in 2020, the new ltip for the executive 
management began covering the performance 
period 2020-2022. the ltip consists of 50% 
shares and 50% share options. relative to the 
previous long-term incentive program (2017-
2019), the new ltip reflects an increased 
weight on organic sales growth (weight of 40% 
of ltip), a lower but still prominent weight on 
economic profit generation (weight of 40% of 
ltip), and an explicit weight on sustainability 
(weight of 20% of ltip). the targets are aligned 
with the updated strategy and the measures of 
business success for the period 2020-2022. 
the stock was allocated in march 2020 
and will be released in the beginning of 
2023 in accordance with the level of target 
achievement, while the stock option program 
is a three-year incentive program with annual 
allocations. in 2020, 135,280 stock options 
were granted to the executive management. 
the allocations for 2020-2023 will be adjusted 
in the beginning of 2023 in relation to the level 
of target achievement.
the annual ltip cannot exceed 19 months’ 
base salary. further, the program includes a 
maximum-value clause allowing the board of 
directors to choose to limit the total allocation 
of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value 
exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.
the members of the executive management 
have contracts of employment containing 
standard conditions for executive officers of 
danish listed companies, including the periods 
of notice that both parties are required to give 
and noncompetition clauses. if an executive 
officer’s contract of employment is terminated 
by the company without any misconduct on 
the part of the executive officer, the executive 
officer has a notice period of 12 months. in 
addition to the notice period, the executive 
officer has a right to termination compensation 
of 12 months’ base salary and pension 
contributions. however, as thomas videbæk 
was appointed before 2016 he was entitled to 
termination compensation of two years' base 
salary and pension contributions.
remuneration of senior leadership
the remuneration of novozymes’ senior 
leadership (195 vice presidents and directors) is 
consistent with the general remuneration policy. 
incentive programs for vice presidents and 
directors have been established for the 2020-
2022 period. the programs follow the same 
mechanisms as the program for the executive 
management. further information on the 
incentive programs for these employee groups 
can be found in note 6.2 to the consolidated 
financial statements, which also includes an 
overview of outstanding stock options.

the overall effect from covid-19 on 
novozymes’ sales performance was negative, 
however, with a dampened effect as a result of 
diversified end-market exposure. solutions for 
household care benefitted from an increased 
demand for cleaning solutions, whereas 
solutions for bioenergy and textile production 
declined due to the covid-19 pandemic 
induced drop in gasoline consumption,

cash flow from operating activities
the cash flow from operating activities was 
dkk 4,355 million, up from dkk 3,196 million 
in 2019, an increase of dkk 1,159 million. the 
improvement in operating cash flow was mainly 
due to higher cash conversion from better 
earnings quality, a settlement related to the 
former bioag setup and positive changes and 
timing effects in working capital. the change 
in net working capital was caused by lower 
receivables and lower inventories, partly offset 
by lower other liabilities.
net investments 
net investments excluding acquisitions were 
dkk 936 million, down from dkk 991 million 
in 2019. net investments in property, plant 
and equipment amounted to dkk 790 million, 
compared with dkk 856 million in 2019.
 
free cash flow before acquisitions and 
divestments
the free cash flow before acquisitions and 
divestments amounted to dkk 3,419 million, 
compared with dkk 2,205 million in 2019. the 
increase of 55% was mainly due to higher cash 
flows from operating activities.
 
free cash flow
the free cash flow was dkk 2,831 million in 
2020, compared with dkk 2,635 million in 
2019. free cash flow was negatively impacted 
by the acquisition of precisionbiotics group.
financing activities
the cash flow from financing activities was 
negative at dkk 2,314 million, compared with 
a negative cash flow of dkk 2,644 million in 
2019. the negative cash flow from financing 
activities was mainly due to the 2020 stock 
buyback program (dkk 1,500 million) and 
dividend payments (dkk 1,483 million).
 
cash position
cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 
2020, amounted to dkk 1,181 million, up 
from dkk 711 million at december 31, 2019.

total assets
total assets increased from dkk 20,437 million 
at december 31, 2019, to dkk 20,510 million 
at december 31, 2020. the increase was mainly 
driven by net investments and the acquisition 
of precisionbiotics group, partly offset by 
depreciations and amortizations, changes in 
currency and a decrease in net working capital.
 
invested capital
invested capital decreased from dkk 15,507 
million in 2019 to dkk 15,094 million in 2020. 
this was mainly a result of a decrease in net 
woking capital.
 
roic 
return on invested capital (roic), including 
goodwill, was 18.9%, down 2.2 percentage 
points from 21.1% in 2019. the decrease was 
mainly driven by lower net profit and higher 
average invested capital. 
 
net working capital 
novozymes’ net working capital decreased 
to dkk 2,901 million, down from dkk 3,478 
million in 2019, due to lower trade receivables, 
lower inventories, partly offset by lower other 
payables. 
 
net interest-bearing debt
novozymes had net interest-bearing debt of 
dkk 3,871 million at december 31, 2020, 
compared with dkk 4,049 million at december 
31, 2019. net interest-bearing debt was 
impacted by cash outflows from dividend 
payments of dkk 1,483 million, stock buybacks 
of dkk 1,500 million and the acquisition of 
precisionbiotics group, which was more than 
offset by cash inflows from operating activities.
 
net interest-bearing debt-to-ebitda
net interest-bearing debt-to-ebitda was 0.8x 
at december 31, 2020, on par with december 
31, 2019.

at december 31, 2020, shareholders’ equity 
was dkk 11,244 million, down from dkk

more than offset comprehensive income in 
2020. 
 
equity ratio 
shareholders’ equity accounted for 55% of 
the balance sheet total at december 31, 2020, 
down from 56% at december 31, 2019.
 
return on equity

stock was 5.7 million b shares, equivalent to 
2.0% of the common stock. 
dividend
the board of directors proposes that the 
annual shareholders’ meeting approve 
a dividend of dkk 5.25 per share for the 
2020 financial year, same as in 2019. this

operational ecoefficiency
novozymes strives to decouple environmental 
impact from business growth, and we define 
targets and metrics that measure and drive our 
sustainability performance. 
 
climate change 
novozymes’ total co2 emissions were 268,000 
tons in 2020, a decrease from 365,000 tons in 
2019. 
 
energy 
in 2020, novozymes’ energy consumption was 
4,475,000 gj, a decrease of 2% compared with 
2019. 
 
renewable sources accounted for 43% of the 
energy consumption in 2020, up from 30% 
in 2019. the main contributor is renewable 
electricity which has gone up from 49% in 
2019 to 69% in 2020, as our production site 
in franklinton, usa have started procuring 
renewable electricity in 2020. in addition, all 
electricity in denmark, brazil and tianjin, china 
come from renewable sources e.g. offshore 
windfarms and hydropower. 
 
energy by source 2020 (2019)
• electricity – conventional 18% (29%)
• electricity – renewable 39% (29%)
• steam 22% (21%)
• fuels – conventional 15% (15%)
• heat – conventional 2% (4%)
• fuel and heat – renewable 4% (2%)
water
in 2020, novozymes’ water consumption 
increased by 2% from 7,845,000 m3 in 2019 to 
7,998,000 m3. the increase is partly driven by 
extra cleaning at all sites due to product mix 
changes and a higher cleaning requirement 
related to food safety.
 
the total volume of wastewater generated in 
2020 increased by 5%.
 
waste 
in 2020, 97% of our biomass volume was 
handled in a circular set-up (recycled), on par 
with 2019. 
 
for solid waste, the rate of recycling across 
our global production sites decreased to 48%, 
compared with 52% in 2019. 
 
environmental compliance 
the number of breaches of regulatory limits 
recorded worldwide increased to 20 in 2020 
from 17 in 2019. most of these breaches were 
related to wastewater treatment. novozymes 
is addressing these incidents. in addition, we 
received ten neighbor complaints in 2020, 
compared with seven in 2019, mostly related to 
air pollution and waste management.

in 2020, novozymes had 963 active patent 
families, which comprise the number of 
inventions that have active patent applications 
or active patents. the number of active patent 
families has increased from 951 in 2019. 
 
business ethics
in 2020, novozymes reinforced our 
commitment to business integrity. during the 
year 99% of novozymes’ employees in scope 
completed business integrity training, on par 
with 2019.
 
as in 2019, there were no breaches of 
competition law in 2020.
 
community engagement
in 2020, novozymes contributed to local 
communities responding to local challenges. in 
china, for example, we donated rmb 1 million 
to red cross to build hospitals and in latin 
america we provided 100 pcs with internet 
access to unprivileged students. 
 
customer engagement
novozymes conducts an annual customer 
satisfaction survey and tracks progress on its 
net promoter score (nps), which is assessed 
on a scale from -100 to +100. in 2020, we 
received an nps of +50, which confirms our 
solid relationships with our customers. the 
covid-19 pandemic does not seem to have 
affected customers perceptions of novozymes 
in 2020 compared to previous years.

building the novozymes onehealth brand
on june 25, 2020, novozymes acquired 
precisionbiotics group limited to advance 
novozymes’ activities in the area of 
biological solutions for oral and gut health. 
precisionbiotics group holds a leading position 
within probiotics for human gut health and is 
well positioned with several clinically-backed 
products already on the market. 
on january 7, 2021, novozymes acquired 
microbiome labs adding a broad range of 
proprietary microbiome solutions to its human 
health activities and securing an attractive 
entry point into the north american probiotics 
market. 
both acquisitions are related to human health 
and are key steps in building the onehealth 
brand, which also comprises the 2016 
acquisition of organobalance gmbh along with 
research and development activities based on 
novozymes’ existing technology. 
reference is made to note 3.5 for a description 
of the two acquisitions and their impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
new organization
on february 1, 2020, ester baiget was 
appointed new president and ceo of 
novozymes.
on september 1, 2020, novozymes announced 
a new organizational structure directing the 
organization to a more value-chain focused 
and customer-centric approach to support and 
deliver on our better business with biology 
strategy. this new structure allows for a 
stronger differentiation between sustainable 
solutions with clear consumer benefits, and 
sustainable solutions focusing on maximizing 
yields and optimizing processes for our 
customers. 
as a part of the new organizational structure, 
changes were made to the executive 
leadership team; see note 6.1. the sales 
reporting has been updated to reflect the new 
organization; see note 2.2.
covid-19 pandemic 
novozymes delivered a resilient 2020 
performance despite the covid-19 pandemic. 
see the section on sales and earnings for more 
details on covid-19 impacts on 2020 sales.
novozymes has only made use of unavoidable 
financial governmental relief packages, 
resulting in an negligible impact. all major 
postponed tax payments etc. were settled 
before the end of the year. the covid-19 
pandemic was not a triggering event for 
impairments in 2020. 
the covid-19 pandemic was a challenge for 
occupational health and safety in 2020. task 
force teams were in place, focused on keeping 
employees safe and labs and production 
running; see note 8.2 for more details.
throughout the year, novozymes maintained 
close communications with customers on 
measures taken within the organization to 
prevent impact on production and delivery. 
novozymes also focused on exercising its 
responsibility as a corporate citizen to support 
authorities in mitigating the effects of the 
pandemic. reference is made to note 8.4 and 
note 8.5.

this section provides an overview of 
novozymes’ principal accounting policies, the 
critical accounting estimates and judgments 
applied, a definition of materiality as well as 
the impact of new or amended ifrs standards 
and interpretations.
the symbols i/s , b/s  and esg show which 
amounts in the notes can be found in the 
income statement, the balance sheet, and in 
environmental data and social and governance 
data respectively. 
the accounting policies described below 
apply to the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole. accounting policies and critical 
accounting estimates and judgments are 
described in the notes to which they relate to 
enhance understanding. the descriptions of 
accounting policies in the notes form part of 
the overall description of accounting policies.
accounting policies
consolidation
the consolidated financial statements 
comprise the financial statements of 
novozymes a/s (the parent company) 
and subsidiaries controlled by novozymes 
a/s, prepared in accordance with group 
accounting policies. the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared by combining 
items of a uniform nature and subsequently 
eliminating intercompany transactions, internal 
stockholdings and balances, and unrealized 
intercompany profits and losses.
consolidation of the environmental, social and 
governance data follows the same principles as 
the financial reporting.
translation of foreign currencies
the consolidated financial statements are 
presented in danish kroner (dkk).
exchange rate differences arising between 
the exchange rate at the transaction date and 
the reporting date are recognized as financial 
income or financial costs.
foreign currency transactions are translated 
into the functional currency defined for 
each company using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the transaction date. monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries 
are translated into dkk at the exchange rates 
prevailing at the reporting date for assets and 
liabilities, and at average exchange rates for 
income statement items.
the following exchange rate differences, 
arising from translation using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the reporting date, are 
recognized in other comprehensive income:
• translation of foreign subsidiaries’ net assets
at the beginning of the year
• translation of foreign subsidiaries’ income
statements from average exchange rates
non-ifrs financial measures
novozymes uses certain financial measures 
that are not defined in ifrs to describe the 
group’s financial performance, financial 
position and cash flows. these financial 
measures may therefore be defined and 
calculated differently from similar measures 
in other companies, and may thus not be 
comparable. 
the non-ifrs financial measures presented in 
the annual report are:
• organic sales growth
• operating costs
• economic profit
• roic
• free cash flow before acquisitions
definitions of non-ifrs financial measures are 
provided in the glossary.
ixbrl reporting
from 2020, novozymes is required to file the 
annual report in the new european single 
electronic format (‘esef’) and the annual 
report in 2020 is therefore prepared in the 
xhtml format that can be displayed in a 
standard browser. the primary statements 
in the consolidated financial statements 
are tagged using inline extensible business 
reporting language (ixbrl). the ixbrl tags 
comply with the esef taxonomy, which is 
included in the esef regulation and developed 
based on the ifrs taxonomy published by the 
ifrs foundation. where a financial statement 
line item is not defined in the esef taxonomy, 
an extension to the taxonomy has been 
created. extensions are anchored to elements 
in the esef taxonomy, except for extensions 
which are subtotals.
the annual report submitted to the danish 
financial supervisory authority consists of 
the xhtml document together with certain 
technical files, all included in a file named 
novozymes-2020-12-31.zip. 
critical accounting estimates and 
judgments
the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements and the environmental, social 
and governance data requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that can 
have a significant effect on the application 
of policies and reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income, expenses and related 
disclosures. the estimates and underlying 
assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors. actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
the estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. changes 
in estimates may be necessary if there are 
changes in the circumstances on which the 
estimate was based, or if more detailed 
information becomes available. such changes 
are recognized in the period in which the 
estimate in question is revised.

accounts and performance     notes

novozymes a/s
the application of the group’s accounting 
policies may require management to make 
judgments that can have a significant effect on 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements. management judgment 
is required in particular when assessing 
the substance of transactions that have a 
complicated structure or legal form.
 
the critical accounting estimates and 
judgments could potentially have a significant 
impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.
 
basis of reporting 
the consolidated financial statements of 
the group have been prepared in accordance 
with international financial reporting 
standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu and 
further requirements in the danish financial 
statements act. the fiscal year for the group is 
january 1 – december 31. 
the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis and 
under the historical cost convention, with the 
exception of derivatives and securities, which 
are measured at fair value. the accounting 
policies are unchanged from last year.
 
the consolidated environmental, social and 
governance data have been prepared in 
accordance with principles that adhere to 
internationally recognized voluntary reporting 
standards and principles such as the un global 
compact (ungc). novozymes is a signatory 
to the ungc, a voluntary policy initiative for 
businesses that are committed to aligning their 
operations and strategies with ten universally 
accepted principles in the areas of human 
rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. 
we also take inspiration from the task force on 
climate related financial disclosures (tcfd) 
framework for climate-related disclosures. 
our reporting and materiality assessments 
have also been inspired by the gri framework. 
 
the principles are unchanged from last year.
defining materiality
novozymes’ annual report is based on the 
concept of materiality, to ensure that the 
content is material and relevant.
 
if items are individually immaterial, they are 
aggregated with other items of a similar nature 
in the statements or in the notes. novozymes 
provides the specific disclosures required by 
ifrs unless the information is considered 
immaterial to the economic decision-making of 
the readers of the annual report. 
 
the disclosures on environmental, social and 
governance (esg) issues include information 
on our management approach, targets, 
initiatives and related progress.
 
various global movements and the covid-19 
pandemic has led to an increased focus on how 
companies manage esg issues, specifically 
on social issues for eg. occupational health & 
safety and labor practices. as a responsible 
corporate citizen, novozymes considers 
these issues to be highly material, and 
we continuously strive to strengthen our 
governance and management of these issues.
 
novozymes’ materiality assessment is 
a systematic and rigorous process that 
integrates input from external stakeholders, 
trend analyses and internal engagement 
with relevant departments including investor 
relations, risk management & controls, 
quality and sustainability and leadership from 
our commercial divisions. this process results 
in a materiality matrix of financial and esg 
issues and reflects the importance of those 
issues to our key stakeholders versus their 
impact on novozymes. we use our materiality 
matrix to guide our strategy and reporting. 
during our assessment in 2020, no new issues 
were added to or deleted from our matrix. for 
more information, refer to www.novozymes.
com/en/about-us/sustainability/materiality.
 
in the following table, we highlight some 
of the material issues, for which, we have 
external targets/flagship initiatives and make a 
contribution to relevant sdg(s).

the environmental data cover those activities 
that could have a significant impact on the 
environment. sites with activities considered 
not to have a significant environmental 
impact are not included. such sites comprise 
sales offices, r&d labs, and sites with limited 
blending and storage of products. however, 
measures are taken to ensure that at least 
97% of the total novozymes quantity of the 
measured environmental parameter is included 
in the reported numbers.
 
impact of new accounting standards
novozymes has adopted the following new or 
amended standards and interpretations from 
january 1, 2020: 
 
• amendments to ifrs 3 – business 
combinations, clarifies the definition of a 
business.
 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 – definition 
of material, clarifies the definition of 
material.
 
• amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39, and ifrs 
7 – interest rate benchmark reform (ibor), 
which modify specific hedge accounting 
requirements to provide relief from potential 
effects of the uncertainty caused by the 
ibor reform, and requires additional 
information to be provided about hedging 
relationships which are directly affected by 
these uncertainties.
 
the adoption of the new and amended 
standards and interpretations has not had a 
significant impact on recognition, measurement 
or disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements for 2020 and is not anticipated to 
have a significant impact on future periods.
 
new standards and interpretations not yet 
adopted
iasb has issued new or amended accounting 
standards and interpretations that have not 
yet become effective and have consequently 
not been implemented in the consolidated 
financial statements for 2020. novozymes 
expects to adopt the accounting standards and 
interpretations when they become mandatory. 
none of the new or amended standards 
or interpretations are expected to have a 
significant impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.

2.1 segment
segment reporting
the internal reporting framework used for 
reporting on revenue and expenses to the 
executive leadership team and the board of 
directors has been established to reflect and 
report on the global functional responsibility 
setup at novozymes. this setup consolidates 
functions by type, and management reviews 
the results of the group as a whole to assess 
performance. thus, there is only one operating 
segment.
worldwide operations
the group operates in four geographical 
regions: europe, middle east & africa (including 
denmark), north america, asia pacific and 
latin america. from a revenue perspective, 
the us is the largest single market, contributing 
~29% of the group’s revenue (2019: ~31%).
 
the geographical distribution of revenue is 
based on the country in which the goods are 
delivered. for a number of customers, central 
deliveries are made to specified locations and 
the final destination is unknown. the stated 
geographical distribution of revenue may 
therefore vary from year to year if the delivery 
destination for these customers changes.  
 
most of the group’s intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment are located in 
denmark, the us and china at ~48%, ~27% 
and ~13% respectively (2019: ~50%, ~30% and 
~13%).

novozymes a/s
the majority of novozymes’ revenue is 
derived from the sale of goods to customers, 
where revenue is recognized when goods are 
delivered. less than 1% of novozymes’ total 
revenue arises from royalties.
 
in 2020, changes were made to the bioag 
setup and the partnerships novozymes has 
entered into within bioag are no longer based 
on profit-split arrangements.
 
at january 1, 2020, contract liabilities 
amounted to dkk 74 million (2019: dkk 374 
million), of which dkk 5 million was recognized 
as revenue in 2020 (2019: dkk 26 million).

accounts and performance     notes
novozymes has entered into partnerships 
where novozymes manufactures and sells 
products to a partner, who undertakes the 
sales to end customers, and where the 
profit on products sold to end customers is 
shared between the partner and novozymes 
based on predetermined profit-sharing 
mechanisms. revenue related to this type 
of partnership comprises approximately 9% 
of novozymes’ total annual revenue (2019: 
approximately 11%).
 
a minor part of the revenue, related to the 
expected profit-share on products sold to 
the partner, requires significant judgment 
and estimates by management. this involves 
estimating future selling prices to end 
customers, along with their impact on rebate 
schemes, and estimating product returns 
from end customers.

2.2 revenue (continued)
net operating profit after tax
accounts and performance     notes
novozymes produces a wide range of 
industrial enzymes and microorganisms. 
revenue includes the sale of goods and 
related services and royalties, and is 
recognized at an amount that reflects 
the consideration to which novozymes 
expects to be entitled. revenue from the 
straightforward sale of goods to customers 
is recognized when control of the goods is 
transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods 
are delivered. variable considerations are 
included in revenue to the extent that they 
are not subject to significant uncertainty.
 
the performance obligations in the contracts 
are to deliver enzymes and microorganisms 
to customers, and each batch delivered 
is considered a separate performance 
obligation, as each batch is distinct.
 
discounts
enzymes and microorganisms are sometimes 
sold at a rebate. a rebate agreement can 
be set up in various ways, but common to 
all agreements is that revenue is recognized 
based on the price specified in the contract, 
net of the estimated rebate. the rebates are 
estimated based on experience, as well as 
information related to expected orders 3-12 
months in advance. the estimated rebates 
are reassessed at the end of each reporting 
period.
returns
a few of novozymes’ partnerships are 
granted a right of return. no revenue is 
recognized for the goods expected to be 
returned, as a refund liability is recognized. 
estimates of the expected level of returns 
are based on analysis of historical returns 
and knowledge of the relevant markets/
products. these estimates are updated at 
the end of each reporting period. as the 
goods returned are usually scrapped, no 
inventory asset is recognized.
profit split
novozymes has entered into partnerships 
where novozymes manufactures and sells 
products to a partner, who undertakes 
the sales to end customers. the profit on 
products sold to end customers is shared 
between the partner and novozymes 
based on predetermined profit-sharing 
mechanisms. 
 
revenue from these arrangements consists 
of sales of products to the partner and 
the shared profit, and is recognized in 
full when the goods are delivered to the 
other contracting party. this is done by 
calculating the expected profit based 
on insights, experience and other input 
factors. the calculated profit is recognized 
as a contract asset or contract liability until 
an invoice is issued. the realized profit is 
settled periodically.
 
commission
novozymes has entered into commission 
agreements where agents undertake sales 
to third parties in return for a commission 
on realized sales. revenue from such 
agreements is recognized when the 
goods are delivered, as the nature of the 
performance obligation is to provide the 
specified goods.
 
 
other
revenue collected on behalf of third parties 
is not recognized as revenue.
 
novozymes’ obligation to provide a refund 
for products that are not of the agreed 
quality or according to agreed specifications 
under the standard warranty terms is 
recognized as contract liabilities.
 
a trade receivable is recognized when the 
customer obtains control of the goods and 
an invoice is issued, as this is the point 
in time when the consideration becomes 
unconditional and only the passage of time 
is required before payment is due. typical 
payment terms are around 60 days. 
 
contract liabilities consist of advance 
payments, deferred revenue and liabilities 
for refund goods. the contract liabilities are 
recognized as revenue as the performance 
obligations under the contracts are fulfilled.

2.5 other operating income, net
in 2020, other operating income was impacted 
by dkk 42 million from the contingent 
consideration relating to the divestment 
of the pharma-related royalty. contingent 
consideration has been recognized, where 
entitlement has been obtained due to 
completion of patent registrations.
 
in 2019, a net gain of dkk 194 million related 
to the divestment of the pharma-related royalty 
was recognized. the net gain comprised the 
selling price less contingent consideration, 
transaction costs and the disposed goodwill.
furthermore, other operating income was 
significantly impacted by the termination of 
the bioag alliance at a net gain of dkk 300 
million. the net gain mainly comprised the 
release of the remaining deferred revenue 
of dkk 287 million originating from the 
formation of the alliance. furthermore, the net 
gain comprised the income related to assets 
recognized at fair value offset by impairment 
losses and transaction costs.

accounting policies
tax risks
novozymes operates in many markets via sales 
companies and distributors, while production 
is located in a few countries. this leads to 
transactions between group companies. 
novozymes follows the oecd principles 
in setting internal transfer prices for these 
transactions. this is a complicated area and 
entails a tax risk, because the transactions are 
subject to judgment in each country. the tax 
controversy risk for novozymes is significantly 
reduced through the use of bilateral advance 
pricing agreements (apas).
 
bilateral apas
as stated in our tax policy, novozymes 
proactively engages in bilateral apas 
negotiated at competent authority level to 
increase predictability and to mitigate transfer 
pricing risks. most of the intercompany 
transaction value within the novozymes group 
is covered by bilateral apas. 
 
an apa is an agreement between a taxpayer 
and a tax authority determining the transfer 
pricing methodology for pricing the taxpayer’s 
international transactions for future years. 
the methodology is applied for a certain period 
based on the fulfilment of certain terms and 
conditions (called critical assumptions). an 
apa can be unilateral or bilateral. novozymes 
only enters into bilateral apas, meaning that 
they are negotiated between the competent tax 
authorities of the two countries involved in the 
transaction. an apa provides assurance with 
respect to the tax outcome of our international 
transactions, by agreeing in advance the arm’s 
length pricing and pricing methodology to be 
applied to the international transactions. 
 
novozymes has entered into bilateral apas 
with the tax authorities in the countries 
where internal transactions are most 
significant. among apa covered transactions 
are group internal transactions between 
denmark and the us, china and india, 
respectively.
 
joint taxation
novozymes a/s and its danish subsidiaries 
are jointly taxed with the danish companies of 
the novo holdings a/s group. joint taxation 
also covers withholding taxes in the form of 
dividend tax, royalty tax and interest tax. the 
danish companies are jointly and individually 
liable for the joint taxation liability. any 
subsequent adjustments to income taxes and 
withholding taxes may increase the liability. tax 
for the individual companies is allocated in full 
on the basis of the expected taxable income.
 
tax in the income statement
transfer of intellectual property from 
switzerland to denmark had a positive impact 
on the effective tax rate of 2.9% in 2020 (2019: 
2.9%). this is recognized in difference in 
foreign tax rates.
 
in 2019, novozymes had a positive impact 
from uncertain tax positions related to apas, 
recognized in other adjustments.

accounts and performance     notes
as the group operates across many 
different countries, the calculation of the 
group’s total tax charge in the income 
statement inherently involves estimation. 
tax and transfer-pricing disputes with 
authorities in various countries may occur, 
and management’s assessment is applied 
to assess the possible outcome of such 
disputes.
 
payments in respect of tax liabilities for an 
accounting period result from payments on 
account and on the final resolution of open 
items. as a result, there may be substantial 
differences between the tax charge in the 
consolidated income statement and actual 
tax payments.

corporation tax, comprising the current 
tax liability, change in deferred tax for the 
year and possible adjustments relating to 
prior years, is recognized in the income 
statement, unless it relates to items 
recognized either in other comprehensive 
income or directly in shareholders’ equity. 
uncertain tax positions are assessed 
individually and recognized if it is probable 
that an amount will be paid or received. 
deferred tax is measured using the balance 
sheet liability method and comprises all 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amount and the tax base of assets and 
liabilities. no deferred tax is recognized for 
goodwill, unless amortization of goodwill 
for tax purposes is allowed. the tax value 
of tax loss carry-forwards is included in the 
calculation of deferred tax to the extent that 
the tax losses can be expected to be utilized 
in the future.
 
deferred tax is measured according to 
current tax rules and at the tax rate 
expected to be in force on elimination 
of temporary differences. changes in 
deferred tax due to tax rate changes are 
recognized in the income statement, unless 
they relate to items recognized either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
shareholders’ equity.

in 2020, an impairment loss of dkk 32 million

asset was part of a project that has been

written off. 
 
impairment test of goodwill
novozymes has one cash-generating unit 
(cgu). since 2016, management had identified 
two cgus: novozymes’ main activities and the 
biopharma cgu. with the divestment of 
the pharma-related royalty, and thereby the 
remaining activity within the biopharma cgu 
in april 2019, only one cgu remained.
 
as the market value of novozymes is 
significantly higher than its equity, no further 
key assumptions are used to determine 
whether impairment of goodwill exists (2019: 
no impairment).
83
novozymes a/s
3.1 intangible assets and impairment test of goodwill
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
management assesses the risk of 
impairment of the group’s intangible assets. 
this requires judgment in relation to the 
identification of cash-generating units 
(cgus) and the underlying assumptions in 
the group’s impairment model. 
 
if there is any indication of impairment, 
value in use is estimated and compared 
with the carrying amount. the calculation 
of value in use is based on the discounted 
cash flow method using estimates of future 
cash flows from the continuing use. the 
key parameters are the expected revenue 
streams and the rate used to discount the 
cash flows.
 
as a consequence of the termination of the 
bioag alliance in 2019, intellectual property 
from the bioag alliance was recognized at 
fair value. measuring the fair value of these 
assets required management’s assessment 
of business plans for the individual assets. 
the key parameters were expected cash 
flows and the wacc used to discount the 
cash flows.

3.1 intangible assets and impairment test of goodwill (continued)
due to the termination of the bioag alliance, 
intellectual property from the bioag alliance 
has been transferred to novozymes free of 
charge. these assets have been recognized at 
fair value amounting to dkk 95 million and the 
corresponding income is recognized in other 
operating income.
 
the goodwill disposal is related to the 
divestment of the pharma-related royalty.
 
impairment
in 2019, impairment losses of dkk 71 million 
were recognized on two specific assets. as 
these are related to the termination of
the bioag alliance, the impairment losses are 
recognized and included in other operating 
income.
 
the impairment losses were the result of 
impairment tests performed on assets where 
the termination of the bioag alliance has 
resulted in reduced sales projections for the 
assets in question. the cash flow used to test 
one of the assets for impairment was based 
on business plans for the period 2019-2025, 
and the terminal value used was based on 
the expected lifetime and cash flow over that 
period. for the other impaired asset, the cash 
flow ceased in 2019 with the termination of 
the bioag alliance.
 
a pre-tax wacc of 7% was used to calculate 
the discounted cash flows.

3.1 intangible assets and impairment test of goodwill (continued)
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
intangible assets other than goodwill 
are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortization and impairment losses. 
goodwill and it development projects in 
progress are not subject to amortization.
 
costs associated with large it projects for 
the development of software for internal 
use are capitalized if incurred with a view to 
developing new and improved systems.
 
amortization is based on the straight-line
method over the expected useful lives of the 
finite-lived assets, as follows:
 
• completed it development projects 
are amortized over their useful lives. it 
development assets are amortized over a 
period of 3-5 years
• acquired patents, trademarks, licenses 
and know-how are amortized over their 
useful lives. the useful lives of patents 
and trademarks are normally identical to 
the patent period. licenses are amortized 
over the agreement period. recognized 
patents, trademarks, licenses and know-
how are amortized over a period of 7-15 
years
expected useful lives are reassessed 
regularly.
 
the group regularly reviews the carrying 
amounts of its finite-lived intangible assets 
to determine whether there is an indication 
of an impairment loss. an impairment loss 
is recognized to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its estimated 
recoverable amount. impairment losses are 
reversed only to the extent of changes in the 
assumptions and estimates underlying the 
impairment calculation. 
 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
or whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.

capitalized interest and pledges
interest of dkk 1 million (2019: dkk 2 million) 
was capitalized under additions during the

0.53% (2019: 0.9%).
 
land and buildings with a carrying amount of 
dkk 1,516 million (2019: dkk 1,526 million) 
were pledged as security to credit institutions. 
the mortgage loans expire in 2029 and 2039.

the implementation of ifrs 16 as of january 
1, 2019, resulted in an increase in property, 
plant and equipment of dkk 616 million. refer 
to note 3.3 for additional disclosures relating 
to leases. 
 
depreciation relating to leases in 2019 
amounted to dkk 124 million. 
 
impairment
an ongoing production-related construction 
project was abandoned in 2019. this led to 
an expense of dkk 33 million, which was 
recognized in cost of goods sold.
 
buildings expected to be sold within 12 months 
were written down to the expected selling price 
less transaction costs before being transferred 
to assets held for sale. buildings amounting to 
dkk 62 million were transferred to assets held 
for sale. an impairment loss of dkk 15 million 
was recognized in sales and distribution costs 
and administrative costs at dkk 4 million and 
dkk 11 million respectively.
3.2 property, plant and equipment (continued)
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
property, plant and equipment is measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. borrowing costs in 
respect of construction of major assets are 
capitalized.
 
depreciation is based on the straight-line 
method over the expected useful lives of the 
assets, as follows:
 
• buildings: 12-50 years
• plant and machinery: 5-25 years
• other equipment: 3-18 years
 
the residual values and useful lives of the 
assets are reviewed on an annual basis and 
adjusted if necessary at each reporting date.
 
the group regularly reviews the carrying 
amounts of its property, plant and 
equipment to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment in those 
assets. if any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent 
of any impairment loss. if the recoverable 
amount of an asset is estimated to be 
lower than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount is reduced to the recoverable 
amount. impairment losses are reversed 
only to the extent of changes in the 
assumptions and estimates underlying the 
impairment calculation.

3.3 leases
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
lease assets
lease assets are ‘right-of-use assets’ from 
lease agreements. if, at inception, it is 
assessed that a contract contains a lease, 
a lease asset is recognized. lease assets 
are initially measured at the present value 
of future lease payments, plus the cost of 
obligations to refurbish the asset. payments 
include fixed payments, variable lease 
payments depending on an index or a rate 
and the exercise price of purchase options 
that are reasonably certain to be excercised. 
 
the lease assets are depreciated using the 
straight-line method over the shorter of the 
expected lease term and the useful life of 
the underlying asset. the lease assets are 
tested for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the assets may be impaired.
 
lease assets are depreciated as follows:
• buildings: 1-12 years
• land: 10-90 years
• plant and machinery: 1-10 years
• equipment and company cars: 1-10 years
 
short-term leases and leases of low value 
are recognized as expenses in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 
 
novozymes’ portfolio of leases covers leases 
of land, buildings and other equipment such 
as cars and transportation containers. 
 
lease liabilities
lease liabilities are initially recognized at 
the present value of future lease payments 
including payments from extension or 
purchase options that are considered 
reasonably certain to be exercised. 
 
the lease liability is measured using the 
implicit borrowing rate in the contracts or, 
where this is not available, the marginal 
borrowing rate in the countries in which 
novozymes operates. novozymes applies a 
single discount rate to portfolios of leases in 
the countries in which novozymes operates 
based on contract currency and loan 
periods. 
 
if a lease contract is modified, the lease 
liability is remeasured. for building leases, 
lease terms are estimated taking the size 
of the building and its strategic importance 
into consideration. novozymes has entered 
into several open-ended building leases 
and building leases with extension options. 
lease terms of such agreements are 
estimated based on the strategic importance 
of the buildings and the estimated time 
frame necessary to vacate the premises.  
the estimated lease term is reassessed at 
each reporting date. the estimated lease 
terms for such contracts do not exceed 12 
years.

dismantling and restoration
dismantling and restoration relates to 
estimated future costs of environmental 
restoration. novozymes aims for its production 
sites not to have a negative environmental 
impact. these liabilities relate to established 
circumstances, and the costs are expected to 
be incurred either when concrete measures 
are implemented or when a site is vacated. 
the expected costs and timing are inherently  
uncertain.
 
legal and other obligations
novozymes is involved in a number of ongoing 
legal disputes, and provisions are made for the 
estimated costs of these based on a current 
evaluation of the outcomes. the ongoing cases 
are expected to be finalized in 2021-2022. 
in management’s opinion, the outcomes of 
these cases are not expected to give rise to 
any significant losses beyond the amounts 
provided for at december 31, 2020. 
 
in 2019, novozymes settled a long-standing 
patent dispute, and as a result novozymes paid 
dkk 65 million to the counterpart, of which 
dkk 31 million was provided for in previous 
years.
 
other obligations include other long-term 
employee benefits and other contractual 
obligations. 
 
other obligations mainly relates to the 
divestment of the pharma-related royalty, for 
which part of the selling price received must 
be repaid if certain patent registrations are not 
obtained by 2021. a number of registrations 
were obtained in 2020. the amount potentially 
to be repaid has been reduced by dkk 42 
million. 
 
 
 
 
other long-term employee benefits account 
for only a minor amount, as the majority of 
novozymes’ pension plans are defined 
contribution plans, covering approximately 
99% of employees. these obligations are 
mainly expected to be incurred over a relatively 
long period of time. 
 
in 2019, dkk 40 million in other obligations 
was utilized as a consequence of the 
termination of the bioag alliance.

that it will lead to an outflow of financial 
resources. provisions are measured at the 
present value of the expected expenditure 
required to settle the obligation.

3.5 business acquisitions
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
on acquisition of companies, the 
identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
are recognized at their fair values at 
the acquisition date. the consideration 
transferred includes the fair value at 
the acquisition date of any contingent 
consideration arrangement.
 
goodwill may subsequently be adjusted 
for changes in the fair value of the 
consideration transferred and/or changes 
in the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired until 12 months after 
the acquisition date, to the extent such 
changes relate to facts and circumstances 
present at the acquisition date. acquired 
companies are consolidated from the date 
of acquisition. acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
accounting policies
on june 25, 2020, novozymes acquired 
all voting shares in precisionbiotics group 
limited. 
 
precisionbiotics group holds a leading 
position within probiotics for human gut 
health and is well positioned with several 
clinically-backed products already on the 
market. precisionbiotics group has strong 
expertise within clinical development, 
upscaling and commercialization and is well 
situated in cork, ireland, home to a leading 
academic society within human gut health.
 
the acquisition of precisionbiotics group 
will advance novozymes’ activities in the 
area of biological solutions for human oral 
and gut health - one of the growth pillars in 
the strategy; better business with biology.
 
goodwill of dkk 158 million is attributable 
to expected synergies with novozymes’ 
existing business operations and 
technologies within probiotics and enzymes 
for human health. the goodwill is not tax 
deductible. 
 
the purchase agreement includes a 
contingent consideration of up to dkk 298 
million. the consideration is contingent 
on the achievement of sales and ebitda 
estimates for 2023 and is recognized at the 
anticipated fair value of dkk 146 million at 
the acquisition date. fair value is assessed 
by using the earn-out from the most 
probable sales and ebitda estimates in 
2023 discounted at a 7% discount rate. 
 
net revenue and profit contributed from 
precisionbiotics group to the consolidated 
income statement are immaterial for the 
reporting period. this would also have 
been the case if the acquisition had been 
completed on january 1, 2020.
 
the transaction costs amounted to dkk 
20 million and are included in sales and 
distribution costs.

3.5 business acquisitions (continued)
invested capital
accounts and performance     notes
fair value measurement of the acquired 
assets and liabilities as well as a contingent 
consideration requires management to 
make estimates and use assumptions, as 
observable market prices are not available. 
the determined fair values are associated 
with uncertainty and may be subject to 
subsequent adjustments. 
critical accounting estimates 
and judgments
on january 7, 2021, novozymes acquired 
all voting shares in microbiome labs. 
microbiome labs offers a comprehensive 
suite of proprietary probiotic and 
microbiome solutions targeting 
gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic 
and cognitive health. the solutions are 
marketed under both the company’s own 
supplement brands and in private label 
products. the branded products are sold 
exclusively through the company’s access 
to an extensive network of healthcare 
practitioners predominately consisting 
of medical doctors, nutritionists and 
naturopaths.
 
by acquiring microbiome labs, novozymes 
adds a broad range of proprietary 
microbiome solutions to its human health 
activities. the acquisition also creates 
an attractive entry point into the north 
american probiotics market accessed 
through the company’s network of 
healthcare practitioners. goodwill of dkk 
369 million is attributable to expected 
synergies with novozymes’ existing business 
operations and technologies within 
probiotics and enzymes for human health.
the goodwill is tax deductible. 
 
the purchase agreement includes a 
contingent consideration of up to dkk 825 
million. the consideration is contingent on 
the achievement of sales targets for 2022 
and is recognized at the anticipated fair 
value of dkk 338 million at the acquisition 
date. fair value is assessed by using the 
earn-out from the most probable sales 
estimates in 2022 discounted at a discount 
rate of 8 %.
 
revenue and profit contributed from 
microbiome labs are not included in the 
consolidated income statement for 2020. on 
a pro forma basis, if the acquisition had 
been effective from january 1, 2020 
microbiome labs would have contributed 
dkk ~250 million to revenue and an ebit 
margin slightly lower than novozymes’ ebit 
margin.
 
transaction costs incurred in 2020 
amounted to dkk 29 million and are 
included in sales and distribution costs.

4.1 inventories
net working capital
accounts and performance     notes
inventories are measured at the lower of 
cost determined on a first-in first-out basis 
and net realizable value.
 
the cost of work in progress and finished 
goods comprises direct production costs 
such as raw materials and consumables, 
energy and labor directly attributable to 
production as well as indirect production 
costs such as employee costs, maintenance 
and depreciation of plants, etc.
 
if the expected selling price less any 
completion costs and costs to execute the 
sale (net realizable value) of inventories is 
lower than the carrying amount, inventories 
are written down to net realizable value.
 
novozymes has entered into a few 
agreements where novozymes supplies 
goods to a customer’s premises but retains 
title to the inventory until the goods are 
consumed in the customer’s production. 
such goods are derecognized from 
inventories in the period when they are 
consumed in the customer’s production.
work in progress and finished goods 
are measured at cost, including indirect 
production costs. indirect production costs 
capitalized under inventories amounted 
to dkk 811 million at december 31, 2020 
(2019: dkk 907 million). indirect production 
costs are assessed on an ongoing basis to 
ensure reliable measurement of employee 
costs, capacity utilization, cost drivers and 
other relevant factors. changes in these 
parameters may have an impact on the 
gross margin and the overall valuation of 
work in progress and finished goods.

novozymes has collateral of dkk 5 million 
(2019: dkk 32 million) held as security for 
trade receivables in selected countries.
 
contract assets
contract assets amounted to dkk 6 million at 
december 31, 2020 (2019: dkk 243 million), 
and mainly related to the estimated profit split 
arising from partnerships that novozymes has 
entered into. 
 
in 2020, changes were made to the bioag 
setup and the partnerships novozymes has 
entered into within bioag are no longer based 
on profit-split agreements. contract assets 
related to bioag at december 31, 2019 was 
dkk 209 million.
 
the contract assets are initially recognized as 
revenue when goods are delivered to the other 
contracting party. when the realized profit split 
is invoiced, the contract assets are reclassified 
to trade receivables.
 
no allowance for expected credit losses had 
been made for contract assets at december 31, 
2020 (2019: no allowance).

4.2 trade receivables and contract assets
net working capital
accounts and performance     notes
trade receivables and contract assets are 
measured at amortized cost less allowance 
for lifetime expected credit losses.
to measure the expected credit losses, 
trade receivables have been grouped based 
on shared credit risk characteristics and 
days past due. furthermore, an allowance 
for lifetime expected credit losses for 
trade receivables is recognized on initial 
recognition.
as the contract assets relate to the 
partnerships, the credit risk is based on an 
individual assessment.
trade receivables and contract assets are 
written off when all possible options have 
been exhausted and there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery. 
 
the cost of allowances for expected credit 
losses and write-offs for trade receivables 
and contract assets are recognized in sales 
and distribution costs.
the allowance for expected credit losses 
for trade receivables and contract assets is 
based on historical credit loss experience 
combined with forward-looking information 
on macroeconomic factors affecting the 
credit risk. the expected loss rates are 
updated at each reporting date.

novozymes a/s
due to the international nature of novozymes’ 
operations, our earnings and financial 
position are exposed to a number of financial 
risk factors. financial risks are managed 
centrally for the entire group. the treasury 
policy is approved by the board of directors, 
and sets the limits for the various financial 
risks and the derivatives used to hedge risk. 
the treasury policy is adjusted on an ongoing 
basis to adapt to the market situation, and 
contains rules on which derivatives can be 
used for hedging, which counterparties can be 
used, and the risk profile that is to be applied.
 
currency risk
currency risk arises due to imbalances 
between income and costs in each individual 
currency and because novozymes has more 
assets than liabilities in foreign currencies in 
connection with global operations.
hedging of currency risk is carried out in the 
currencies in which novozymes has the largest 
exposure. hedging is managed by entering into 
derivatives such as forward contracts, currency 
options and swaps. loans and deposits in 
foreign currencies are also utilized for hedging 
purposes. hedge effectiveness is assessed on 
a regular basis by comparing changes in the 
timing and value of the expected exposure in 
the relevant currencies with the timing and 
value changes for the designated cash flow 
hedging transaction. 
 
where deemed appropriate, currency 
risk related to net investments in foreign 
subsidiaries is hedged by taking out loans 
and entering into swaps. currently, there are 
no open transactions used to hedge equity 
investments.
 
foreign exchange sensitivity – 2020
the sensitivity analysis below shows the impact 
on net profit and other comprehensive income 
of a 5% change in dkk versus the key
currencies to which novozymes was exposed at 
december 31, 2020. for other comprehensive 
income, the analysis shows the impact on 
currency translation of net investments 
and does not include the impact of cash flow 
hedges, as these relate to future commercial 
transactions. 
 
the sensitivity analysis reflects the transaction 
and translation risk, and assumes that the 
exchange rates change on december 31, 2020, 
while all other variables remain constant. 
the table shows the effect of an increase in 
exchange rates. a decrease in the exchange 
rates would have the opposite effect.
 
foreign exchange sensitivity – 2021 estimate 
operating profit (ebit) is exposed to exchange 
rate developments, as the effect of hedges 
is included in financial income/costs. ebit is 
mainly exposed to usd and eur. a movement 
of 5% in the usd/dkk exchange rate would 
result in a change in the expected ebit for 
2021 of around dkk 130-160 million (2020: 
dkk 130-160 million). a 5% movement in the 
eur/dkk exchange rate would result in a 
change in expected ebit for 2021 of around 
dkk 200 million (2020: dkk 200 million). 
 
of the expected usd cash flows for 2021, 
88% have been hedged by forward contracts 
at an average rate of dkk 6.41 at the end of 
2020. as a result, the impact on net profit from 
changes in the usd/dkk exchange rate has 
been reduced significantly compared with the 
impact on ebit.

5.1 financial risk factors and risk management
accounts and performance     notes
99
novozymes a/s
interest rate risk
interest rate risk arises in relation to interest-
bearing assets and liabilities. in accordance 
with novozymes’ treasury policy, a minimum 
of 30% of loans must be at fixed interest rates. 
hedging of the interest rate risk is managed by 
entering into fixed-rate loans and interest rate 
swaps.
 
with the current hedging of interest rate 
risk, an increase of one percentage point 
in the average interest rate on novozymes’ 
net interest-bearing debt would have a 
negative effect on net profit of dkk 2 million 
(2019: negative effect of dkk 10 million). at 
december 31, 2020, 69% (2019: 59%) of the 
loan portfolio carried fixed interest rates.
 
no loans, credit facilities or other financial 
instruments held by novozymes are impacted 
by the ibor reform.
credit risk
credit risk arises especially for cash and cash 
equivalents, derivatives, trade receivables 
and contract assets. the credit risk on trade 
receivables and contract assets is countered by 
thorough, regular analysis based on customer 
type, country and specific conditions. the 
credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as 
well as on derivatives is mitigated by the 
treasury policy, which limits exposure solely to 
counterparties that have an investment-grade 
credit rating. credit risk is calculated on the 
basis of net market values and is governed by 
the treasury policy. novozymes has entered 
into netting agreements (isda or similar) with 
all the banks used for trading in financial 
instruments, which means that novozymes’ 
credit risk is limited to net assets.
at december 31, 2020, the group considered 
its maximum credit risk to be dkk 4,021 million 
(2019: dkk 4,051 million), which is the total 
of the group’s financial assets. at december 
31, 2020, the maximum credit risk related to a 
single counterparty was dkk 399 million (2019: 
dkk 279 million).
 
liquidity risk
in connection with the group’s ongoing 
financing of operations, including refinancing, 
efforts are made to ensure adequate and 
flexible liquidity. this is guaranteed by using 
committed credit facilities and placing free 
funds in deposits, government bonds or ultra-
liquid mortgage bonds in accordance with the 
treasury policy.
 
at december 31, 2020, novozymes’ financial 
resources amounted to dkk 6,522 million 
(2019: dkk 4,174 million), consisting of net 
cash and cash equivalents, overdraft facilities 
and undrawn committed credit facilities of dkk 
5,344 million, which expire in 2021-2025.
with the exception of debt to credit 
institutions, the maturity dates are primarily 
within 12 months.
 
capital structure
novozymes favors a conservative balance 
which is reflected by a target for net interest-
bearing debt of around 1x ebitda. at 
december 31, 2020, the ratio was 0.8x and 
thus the capital structure is in line with the 
target. the capital structure is mainly managed 
using two instruments: 1) dividend payments 
where novozymes aims for a payout ratio of 
around 50%. for 2020, the payout ratio is 
expected to be 51.9% which is in line with 
the communicated target. 2) stock buybacks, 
where a program of dkk 1,500 million was 
executed in 2020. a new program of up to dkk 
1,500 million is planned for 2021.

measurement and fair value hierarchy
all financial assets and liabilities, except 
for derivatives and other financial assets, 
are measured at amortized cost. the 
carrying amounts for these approximate 
fair value. derivatives are measured at fair 
value based on observable data (level 2 
input) according to the fair value hierarchy. 
the derivatives are not traded on an 
active market based on quoted prices, but 
are individual contracts. the fair value of 
these assets is determined using valuation 
techniques that utilize market-based data 
such as exchange rates, interest rates, 
credit risk and volatilities. other financial 
assets and contingent considerations are 
measured at fair value based on non-
observable data (level 3 input). there are no 
financial instruments measured at fair value 
on the basis of quoted prices (level 1 input).

programs (long-term incentive programs) 
and other benefits (car, telephone, etc.). 
the variable components of the total 
remuneration (cash bonus and stock-based 
incentive programs) are relatively high 
compared with the base salary and is subject 
to the achievement of individual targets and 
novozymes’ targets for financial, social and 
environmental performance. the annual cash 
bonus cannot exceed 9.5 months’ fixed base 
salary, of which 65% is expected to be payable 
at target performance. the stock-based 
incentive programs are described in note 6.2.
 
members of the executive leadership team 
have contracts of employment containing 
standard conditions for executive officers 
of danish listed companies, including the 
periods of notice that both parties are required 
to give and noncompetition clauses. if an 
executive officer’s contract of employment 
is terminated by the company without any 
misconduct on the part of the executive officer, 
the executive officer has a notice period of 12 
months. in addition to the notice period, the 
executive officer has a right to termination 
compensation of 12 months’ base salary and 
pension contributions. however, executive 
officers appointed before 2016 had a right to 
compensation of up to two years’ base salary 
and pension contributions.
 
board of directors
the remuneration of the board of directors 
comprises a fixed fee and is not based on 
incentives.

novozymes a/s
novozymes has established stock-based 
incentive programs for the executive 
leadership team, vice presidents, directors, 
and other employees. the purpose of these 
programs is to ensure an alignment of 
interests of the management, employees and 
shareholders. allocation of programs has been, 
and remains, dependent on profit, value-
creation and, in some cases, sustainability 
targets being achieved. the exercise price and 
the share price of a stock option are identical 
at the date of grant.
 
a new incentive program for the executive 
leadership team was established in 2020, 
covering the performance period 2020-2022. 
the program is a combination of stock options 
and stock, with half of the incentive program 
allocated in stock options and half in stock. 
the total number of stock options and stock 
achievable is divided into two categories: 
‘target stock options and target stock’ and 
‘extra stock options and extra stock’. the target 
stock options, and target stock correspond 
to 65% of the maximum stock options and 
stock, and extra stock options and extra stock 
correspond to 35% of the maximum stock 
options and stock. compared to previous 
programs the targets reflect an increased 
weight on organic sales growth (40%), an 
explicit and increased weight on sustainability 
targets (20%) and a reduced but still prominent 
weight on economic profit (40%). the targets 
are aligned with the updated strategy and the 
business measures for the period 2020-2022.
• if novozymes reaches the mid-term targets 
for 2020-2022 for sales growth and economic 
profit and on all four measures for the 
sustainability targets, then the target stock 
options and the target stock will be granted. 
extra stock options and extra stocks will not 
be granted. 
• if novozymes manages to outperform 
compared to the mid-term targets, some or 
all of the extra stock options and extra stock 
may be granted. 
• if novozymes does not meet the mid-term 
targets for 2020-2022, then none or only 
part of the target stock options and target 
stock will be granted.
 
the program contains a maximum-value clause, 
allowing the board of directors to choose 
to limit the total allocation of stock options 
and stock if the intrinsic value of the program 
exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.
 
the total target-level fair value of the program 
at the date of grant was approximately dkk 40 
million. the value of the stock will be expensed 
over the three-year qualifying period (2020-
2022) and will be released in 2023. the stock 
options have a vesting period of four years, 
followed by an exercise period of five years. 
the fair value of the stock options will be 
expensed over the four-year vesting period.
 
furthermore, a new program was established 
in 2020 for vice presidents and directors 
covering the performance period 2020-2022 
(195 vice presidents and directors). the total 
target level fair value at grant date was dkk 55 
million and based on the same requirements 
and targets as for the executive leadership 
team. the program is a combination of stock 
options and stock, with half of the incentive 
program allocated in stock and half in stock 
options. the stock options have a four-year 
vesting period, while the stock will be released 
in 2023.
 
the program contains a maximum-value clause, 
allowing the executive leadership team to 
choose to limit the total allocation of stock 
and stock options if the intrinsic value of the 
program exceeds twice the annual conditional 
grant.
 
for other employees, a new stock option-based 
incentive program was established in 2020 
covering the performance period 2020-2022. 
the employee program follows the same 
requirements and targets as the program 
for the executive leadership team and the 
program for vice presidents and directors. 
 
the executive leadership team and other 
senior management, who are already included 
in an existing incentive program, are excluded 
from this new program. in total, approximately 
5,700 employees will be covered by the 
program. the awarded stock options have a 
vesting period of four years, after which there 
is an exercise period of five years. the target 
level value of the program is approximately 
dkk 40 million.
 
in previous years, stock option programs 
were established for all or selected groups of 
employees, conferring the right to purchase 
one share per stock option. allocations were 
made based on each individual employee’s 
base salary and the achievement of a series 
of business targets – both financial and 
nonfinancial – set by the board of directors 
for each year. the stock options have a vesting 
period of three to four years, followed by 
an exercise period of five years. in order to 
exercise the options, the employee must still 
be employed at the exercise date. this does 
not apply to persons who have retired, taken 
voluntary early retirement or been given notice.

6.2 stock-based payment (continued)
during 2020, dkk 54 million arising from 
stock-based payment was recognized in the 
income statement (2019: dkk 46 million), dkk 
53 million of which was from equity-settled 
programs (2019: dkk 45 million) and dkk 1 
million was from cash-settled programs (2019: 
dkk 1 million).
most programs are equity settled, and no 
liability is recognized for these. if allocations 
under the programs are made in countries 
where ownership of foreign stock is not 
permitted, the value of stock options is 
settled in cash instead, and a liability of dkk 
15 million was recognized for this in 2020 
(2019: dkk 16 million). the intrinsic value of 
exercisable cash-settled programs in 2020 was 
dkk 13 million (2019: dkk 14 million). 
 
the fair value of employee services received 
is measured with reference to the fair value 
of the equity instruments granted. fair value 
at grant date is measured in accordance with 
the black–scholes model, using the average 
exercise price, the option term and the 
following significant assumptions:

other financial notes
accounts and performance     notes
furthermore, the options are assumed to be 
exercised two years after the vesting period, 
on average, or at the option’s expiry date if this 
is within one year. volatility is estimated using 
the historical volatility over the last three years. 
the risk-free interest rate is based on danish 
government bonds with a maturity equivalent 
to the option’s term to maturity.
stock awards
the stock allocated under the three-year 
programs is stock awards. the majority of 
the stocks was allocated in 2017. in 2020, 
108,242 stock awards with a fair value of dkk 
38 million were granted to new employees 
enrolled in the programs (2019: dkk 3 million).
the total number of outstanding stock awards 
at december 31, 2020 was 108,242 (2019: 
307,262). the fair value of these at december 
31, 2020 was dkk 38 million (2019: dkk 100 
million), which will be expensed over the three-
year period (2020-2022).
the group has established stock-based 
incentive programs comprising equity-
settled and cash-settled programs.
 
the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of stock 
options and stock awards is measured 
with reference to the fair value of the stock 
options and stock awards granted. the fair 
value is measured using the black–scholes 
option-pricing model.
 
the fair value of stock-based payment 
at the grant date is recognized as an 
employee cost over the period in which the 
stock options vest. in measuring the fair 
value, account is taken of the number of 
employees expected to gain entitlement 
to the options as well as the number of 
options the employees are expected to gain. 
this estimate is adjusted at the end of each 
reporting period such that only the number 
of options to which employees are entitled 
or expected to be entitled is recognized.
 
the value of equity-settled programs is 
recognized in shareholders’ equity. the 
value of cash-settled programs, which are 
recognized as other liabilities, is adjusted 
to fair value at the end of each reporting 
period, and the subsequent adjustment is 
recognized in the income statement under 
financial income or financial costs.

6.3 commitments and contingencies
pending litigation and arbitration
novozymes is engaged in certain legal cases. 
the board of directors and management 
believe that settlement or continuation of 
these cases will not have a significant effect 
on the group’s financial position. a liability is 
recognized under provisions where the risk of 
a loss on a legal case is considered more likely 
than not. 
contract conditions 
several of the partnership contracts to which 
novozymes is a party may be terminated by 
the other party in the event of significant 
changes in ownership or control of novozymes. 
furthermore, a few contracts contain 
provisions that restrict novozymes’ licenses 
from using specific forms of technology in such 
situations.
 
novozymes is committed to increasing 
production capacity in latin america if a 
specific customer reaches certain milestones. 
the amount required to meet this commitment 
cannot be estimated reliably at the moment.

6.5 fees to statutory auditors
audit fee policy
it is novozymes’ policy that the annual fee for 
nonaudit services provided by the statutory 
auditors should not exceed the annual fee 
for statutory audit services measured at 
group level. the group audit fee ratio may 
only exceed 1 with the approval of the audit 
committee.
 
no such approvals were given in 2020 or 2019.
 
implementation of the eu audit reform has 
led to restrictions on the nonaudit services 
that the auditors elected at the annual 
shareholders’ meeting may perform. the fee 
for nonaudit services performed for novozymes 
by pricewaterhousecoopers statsautoriseret 
revisionspartnerselskab is dkk 3 million 
(2019: dkk 2 million) and does not exceed 
the 70% cap. the services comprise audit 
of project accounts, tax advisory services 
concerning transfer pricing, m&a support 
and other general financial reporting and 
tax consultancy. an insignificant service 
were performed in relation to local reporting 
assistance in a subsidiary.

novozymes’ solutions enable our customers 
and end users to reduce their co2 emissions 
through the application of our products, 
and climate action is an integral part of our 
business strategy. climate change also impacts 
novozymes’ supply chain as well as operations, 
and it is important we address related risks 
through appropriate measures.
 
our approach
novozymes has established an ambitious 
climate strategy that drives our approach to 
addressing climate-change-related impacts 
across our value chain. the operations, 
supply & quality function and the global 
sustainability department are responsible for 
driving the climate change action agenda both 
within and outside novozymes.
 
climate change poses multiple risks, 
transitional as well as physical, to our business 
and we have set up an internal process to 
manage key climate-related risks. 
 
in addition to our full disclosure to cdp 
climate change, we strongly support the 
recommendations of the task force on climate 
related financial disclosures (tcfd) and are in 
the process of its implementation.
 
novozymes’ approach to making its operations 
less carbon intensive is based on two levers: 
implementing various energy efficiency 
projects and increasing the share of renewable 
energy consumption. our efforts to reduce 
operational co2 emissions are driven by our 
science-based targets. we have committed to 
reduce our absolute scope 1 & 2 co2 emissions 
by 50% by 2030 (relative to 2018) on our way 
to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. we have 
also committed to reduce absolute scope 3 
co2 emissions from the purchased goods and 
services category by 15% by 2030 (relative 
to 2018). to drive performance towards 
these commitments, we have set mid-term 
targets (2020-2022) for reducing absolute co2 
emissions from operations by 40% by 2022 
(relative to 2018). we have also defined annual 
internal targets to guide implementation.
 
many novozymes solutions enable our 
customers to reduce co2 emissions from their 
products. novozymes has committed to help 
the world limit global warming increase to 1.5o 
c by saving 60 million tons of co2 by enabling 
low-carbon fuels in the transport sector in 
2022.
 
 
novozymes conducts peer-reviewed cradle-
to-grave life cycle assessment (lca) studies 
to document the environmental impact of our 
solutions. these studies are used to keep our 
stakeholders informed and to demonstrate 
to our customers ways to reduce their co2 
emissions and leverage the positive impact on 
climate change made possible by novozymes’ 
solutions. to learn more, please find our 
approach to lca at novozymes.com.
 
also, novozymes continues to support global 
climate action, including through responsible 
public advocacy and partnerships. in many 
geographies, novozymes actively supports 
policies to promote the use of sustainable, low-
carbon fuels.

environmental data
7.1 climate change
accounts and performance     notes
reported co2 emissions comprise scope 
1, scope 2 and emissions from outbound 
transport of products.
 
co2 from internally generated energy (scope 
1) is calculated based on the amount of fuel 
consumed, using local emission factors.
 
co2 from externally generated energy (scope 
2) is reported in accordance with both 
the market-based and the location-based 
methods, as defined by the greenhouse gas 
(ghg) protocol. the location-based method 
assumes zero co2 emissions from sourced 
renewable energy and uses co2 factors 
from international energy agency (iea) for 
non-renewable energy. the market-based 
method uses co2 factors from iea.
 
transport-related co2 emissions (scope 3) 
are calculated based on principles described 
in the ghg protocol. reported quantities 
comprise co2 emissions related to transport 
from all primary enzyme production sites to 
customers where novozymes pays for the 
freight. transport between production sites 
is also included. transport of raw materials 
to a production site is not included. co2
emissions generated at external warehouses 
are not included. emissions data are 
calculated based on distance and emission 
factors from the ghg protocol.
 
the environmental impact potentials 
for global warming and ozone layer 
depletion are calculated on the basis of 
data published by the us environmental 
protection agency (epa) and the montreal 
protocol published by the united nations 
environment programme (unep).

2020 highlights
in 2020, co2 emissions (scope 1 + 2 only) 
from our operations decreased by 29% to 
234,000 tons from 330,000 tons in 2019. 
we also achieved a 46% reduction of our 
absolute emissions (scope 1 + 2) compared to 
our 2018 baseline, allowing us to achieve our 
2022 target well in advance. apart from the 
transition to renewable electricity and green 
steam at some of our sites, this reduction was 
also influenced by lower capacity utilization 
of our high impact sites in china and north 
america, as a result of the covid-19 
pandemic. we have decided not to revise our 
2022 target yet as we expect production levels 
to normalize.
 
a breakdown of the operational emissions is 
provided in the table.
 
we began to implement our scope 3 target 
to reduce our absolute co2 emissions from 
purchased goods and services. we are 
exploring multiple levers to achieve our target 
such as substitution to less co2 intensive 
materials, and engaging with our suppliers 
to drive emission reduction. in 2020, we 
developed an accounting methodology for our 
scope 3 target, and have also begun to engage 
with key suppliers on this.
 
novozymes solutions in bioenergy helped the 
transport sector save 49 million tons of co2 in 
2020 by enabling the production of low carbon 
fuels.
 
going forward, we will continue to explore 
renewable energy opportunities for our larger 
sites in north america and china. we will 
also work on our scope 3 target by driving 
supplier engagement and developing emission 
reduction plans. finally, we will continue to 
invest in energy efficiency and waste-to-energy 
opportunities.

novozymes a/s
energy is material to novozymes across 
the value chain, as our operations depend 
on steam and electricity, while many of our 
biosolutions enable downstream users to save 
energy in certain applications (e.g. in laundry 
and dishwashing detergents and textile 
applications) compared with conventional 
methods. 
 
furthermore, our bioenergy solutions enable 
the development of low-carbon fuels for 
transportation, which represents a significant 
share of the global energy mix.
 
our approach
we manage energy in our operations through 
a two-pronged approach: reducing energy use 
in production by implementing optimization 
or energy-saving projects and increasing the 
sourcing of renewable energy. relevant targets 
drive our performance in these areas.
 
novozymes’ supply operations and sourcing 
departments manage and monitor all energy 
efficiency and renewable energy-sourcing 
efforts, and through the re100 initiative 
have committed to source 100% renewable 
electricity by 2030. 
we also have internal annual targets that guide 
our progress towards our 2030 target.
 
2020 highlights
in 2020, projects driving process optimization 
and energy efficiency undertaken at our sites 
throughout the year resulted in energy savings 
of 33,000 gj. the savings originated from 
many projects, including the replacement of 
pumps, optimization of ventilation, improved 
monitoring enabling optimization of energy 
consumption, etc.
 
on top of the internal energy savings, 
novozymes also has a strategy to produce 
energy from waste to local communities. 
 
in 2020, we installed a large heat pump at 
our fuglebakken site in denmark that will 
generate 80,000 gj annually from excess heat 
from our production and to be distributed as 
district heating to the city of copenhagen. this 
corresponds to the annual consumption of 
more than 2,000 danish households.

novozymes a/s
this year, we sourced 69% of our electricity 
from renewable sources, making progress 
towards our 2030 goal. we recognize that in 
order to meet our 2050 ambition of becoming 
carbon neutral, we will need to also explore 
renewable options for energy sources other 
than electricity.
 
in 2020, the share of renewables in our energy 
mix increased to 43% from 30% in 2019. this 
was possible because we started procuring 
renewable electricity at our site in franklinton 
as well as district heat from renewable sources 
at our site in kalundborg.
 
going forward, novozymes will continue to 
seek renewable energy opportunities for 
all sites in order to reduce its operational 
co2 footprint and deliver on the 100% 
renewable electricity commitment. novozymes 
will also continue to explore energy saving 
opportunities at all sites and has allocated 
specific budgets for energy efficiency and 
waste-to-energy initiatives.

environmental data
7.2 energy (continued)
accounts and performance     notes
energy consumption includes quantities 
consumed both in the production process 
and in other areas.
 
internally-generated energy is measured 
as fuel consumption converted to energy 
based on the lower combustion value and 
weight by volume, except in the us, where 
legal requirements for reporting of co2 state 
that the higher combustion value is to be 
applied. fuel consumption comprises all 
types of fuel used to produce electricity, 
heat and steam on site and converted to 
energy using factors supplied by utility 
providers or local authorities. fuel for 
transportation is not included.
 
externally generated energy is the input 
to novozymes of externally generated 
electricity, heat and steam.
 
energy produced from waste or wastewater 
is renewable and corresponds to the total 
energy (heat, electricity or steam) produced 
by an internal or external utility provider. an 
example is energy produced from biomass 
waste or biogas.
 
reported quantities are based on meter 
readings, with the exception of steam, which 
may be subject to calculation.
 
the renewable energy percentage is 
calculated by dividing renewable energy 
consumed by total energy consumption. 
renewable energy used at novozymes sites 
comprises energy generated from natural 
processes and continuously replenished. 
sources include solar, wind and hydropower-
based electricity and energy from biogas 
and biomass.
 
district heat - renewable is based on 
biomass.

novozymes a/s
the production of novozymes’ solutions are 
based on the use of freshwater, at dilution 
and recovery stages, for example, and 
results in wastewater generation. many of 
the raw materials required in our operations 
are agriculture-based and need water for 
production. at the same time, some of 
novozymes’ existing solutions, specifically 
in textile and laundry, enable our customers 
to reduce water consumption compared 
with conventional methods, and improve 
wastewater quality by replacing chemicals. 
further, our solutions improve processes in 
the wastewater treatment industry. therefore, 
water remains one of our priority focus areas 
as it presents both risks and opportunities 
across our value chain. 
 
our approach
novozymes is committed to ensure water 
use that is clean, efficient and respects the 
capacity of the planet thereby contributing 
to long-term water security for all. our 2030 
ambition on water is to manage water in 
balance with local conditions. we have a 
short-term target to develop contextual water 
management programs for all our key sites by 
2022, which will help us focus our efforts in the 
regions where it is needed the most and where 
we can make the maximum impact. we also 
recognize that internal water-related risks are 
often a result of water challenges that exist in 
the local water basin and it requires collective 
action and efforts beyond our own boundary 
to address them effectively. read more about 
our water stewardship approach in our position 
paper on water.
 
in our operations, we focus on improving 
water efficiency and ensuring compliance with 
wastewater discharge regulations at all our 
sites to reduce our freshwater consumption 
and improve the quality of water that leaves 
our boundary. 
 
the wastewater and biomass treatment at our 
production sites are given high priority and our 
wastewater is treated internally or externally 
in biological wastewater treatment systems 
before being discharged to a final destination 
point or used in agriculture for irrigation. all 
water efficiency and wastewater management 
efforts are managed by novozymes’ 
operations, supply and quality function.

2020 highlights
in 2020, we established strong internal and 
external engagement to secure successful 
results from our long-term water strategy. 
we became a proud signatory to the un 
global compact’s ceo water mandate and 
established a partnership with the world wide 
fund for nature (wwf). wwf will help us to 
develop contextual water programs for our key 
sites that will ensure our efforts are focused on 
addressing the priority operational and basin 
water challenges. this year, we developed 
contextual water management programs for 
two of our sites in china and have identified 
water targets that will help us address water 
challenges in and around these sites. 
 
novozymes has also joined the science based 
targets network’s (sbtn) freshwater hub 
working group driving the development of 
methodology for science-based targets for 
water.
 
the table provides a breakdown of total 
wastewater generated in 2020.
 
within our operations, we achieved water-
savings of 45,000 m3 for the year through water 
reduction and re-use projects. this year, we 
also initiated a large water savings project at 
our tianjin site in china which when completed 
will contribute to estimated water savings of 
around 150,000 m3 annually through the re-use 
of water for cooling towers and our internal 
processes, among other things. 
 
to further expand our water stewardship 
efforts in india, novozymes initiated work 
on the ambitious water project ‘nowo – 
novozymes water opulence’ to address 
water-scarcity situation in the neighboring 
villages near our production site in patalganga 
near mumbai. the project, which is being 
implemented in close collaboration with, 
anarde, a local ngo that aims to raise 
the underground water table in the area, 
empowers villagers to be self-reliant for 
water, and educates them on its efficient and 
appropriate use. 
 
going forward, we will focus on completing the 
development of contextual water management 
programs for all our key sites and further 
expand our water stewardship efforts. at 
the same time, we will continue our efforts 
to increase water efficiency and wastewater 
recycling internally to reduce our dependence 
on freshwater.

7.4 waste
novozymes supports the transition to a circular 
economy through biological solutions which 
enable our customers to adopt sustainable 
production and consumption practices. at 
the same time, we are committed to driving 
our own business towards more circularity by 
focusing on the reduction, reuse and recycling 
of the planet’s limited natural resources. 
circular waste management is a key enabler for 
a sustainable future and we are committed to 
doing our part. 
our approach
waste management at novozymes is managed 
through the ‘production and consumption’ 
pillar of our strategy, which includes ambitions 
and targets on circular waste management. 
we aim to have all key materials and waste 
managed in circular systems by 2030.
 
novozymes has 17 major sites. as waste 
management is a complex issue subject to a 
diverse set of local regulations and involving 
several external service providers, we have 
adopted a site-specific management approach.
 
2020 highlights
novozymes generated 480,000 tons of total 
waste in 2020, of which 465,000 tons was 
biomass, compared with 526,000 tons of 
total waste in 2019, of which 513,000 tons 
was biomass. the majority of the waste was 
recovered, and only 5% was sent to landfill.
 
waste and by -products 2020 (2019)
• recovered biomass 93.4% (94.5%)
• recovered (recycled) non-biomass waste 1.5% (1.3%)
• biomass sent for landfill 3.4% (3.0%)
• non-biomass waste sent for landfill/incineration 1.7% (1.2%)
 
 
 
biomass
the biomass generated during production 
makes up 97% of novozymes’ total waste. the 
biomass is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, 
and the energy can be recovered in biogas 
facilities. as part of our strategy, we have a 
target of achieving 100% circular management 
of our biomass by 2022.
 
in 2020, 97% of our biomass volume was 
handled in a circular set-up with nutrients, 
such as nitrogen and phosphorus, being used 
in agriculture. the biomass is distributed to 
local farmers or used as a raw material for 
fertilizer production. a part of the biomass is 
also sent through biogas plants to produce 
biogas on its organic content prior to being 
used in agriculture. in 2020, we secured a new 
contract to increase the amount of biomass 
to be recovered by local farmers for land 
applications.

biomass is measured or calculated based 
on volume or weight produced. at each site, 
biomass is produced with different dry-
matter-to-water ratio. the consolidated dry 
matter figure is calculated by measuring of 
dry matter content in biomass from each 
site multiplied by volume produced at the 
same site. biomass is distributed to local 
farmers, biogas plants or supplied as raw 
material for fertilizer production by third 
parties.
 
non-biomass waste is the registered volume 
of waste broken down into hazardous 
and nonhazardous waste, and by disposal 
method. the amount recycled is the 
quantity recycled internally or sent to an 
external service provider for recycling. 
biomass is not included in the reported 
amounts of solid waste.

125
novozymes a/s
non-biomass waste
our non-biomass waste accounts for 3% 
of novozymes’ total waste and it is further 
classified into nonhazardous and hazardous 
waste. in 2020, the recycling rate of non-
biomass waste was 48% compared with 52% 
in 2019. the remaining 52% of the waste was 
sent for landfill or incineration.
 
a breakdown of the total waste generated is 
provided in the table.
 
to pave the way for our long-term circular 
ambition, we have a target that, by 2022, all 
sites should have programs to reach zero waste 
by 2030. to develop local solutions, we are 
working actively with local experts and service 
providers to explore site-specific opportunities. 
 
in 2020, we developed zero waste programs for 
three of our major sites, located in denmark.
 
specifically on hazardous waste, in 2020, we 
introduced several measures to reduce both 
its generation and environmental impact. they 
include expansion of our internal recycling 
capability, local process improvements and 
engagement with local organizations to safely 
reuse or recycle specific types of hazardous 
waste. 
 
in 2020, we increased our hazardous waste 
recycling capacity at two of our major sites. 
due to the planned expansion, we safely 
diverted some of the hazardous waste from 
incineration in 2019 and we recycled it in 2020 
– this explains the increase in the reported 
hazardous waste for 2020. 
 
circular packaging
we are committed to minimizing the impact 
of the waste generated by our packaging. 
therefore, by 2022 we will have circular 
plans for all our key packaging materials in 
key markets. we are working to minimize our 
packaging footprint by making our packaging 
recyclable, reusable or compostable.

novozymes’ position paper on industrial 
biotechnology describes how industrial 
biotechnology and gene technology can 
contribute to sustainable development. 
novozymes is committed to sharing its 
knowledge about the potential of biology and 
industrial biotechnology with the public and 
other stakeholders outside of novozymes.
 
novozymes supports a science-based 
regulatory framework for products involving 
gene editing, operating in compliance with 
legislation and following any guidance and 
requirements from regulatory authorities 
on biotech innovation classification. we are 
committed to using scientifically-sound tools in 
a way that is safe to humans, animals and the 
environment. 
when we take biological samples in nature, it 
is important that we always follow the local 
laws of the countries where we operate as 
well as complying with globally recognized 
principles on the utilization of genetic 
resources. we continuously discover new 
microbes that are valuable solutions for more 
environmentally-friendly industrial processes. 
novozymes’ position paper on biodiversity 
articulates how we endorse, acknowledge and 
respect the principles of the united nations 
convention on biological diversity and the 
complementary nagoya protocol on access 
and benefits sharing. internal procedures in 
our management system ensure that we live up 
to our commitments. as an example, we have 
established a nagoya protocol steering group 
which ensures compliance with the protocol 
and that internal guidelines are maintained. 
we also continuously monitor the global 
dialogue and development on biodiversity.
compliance with environmental norms and 
regulations is a high priority for novozymes 
so as to maintain business continuity and the 
day-to-day running of operations. novozymes is 
committed to complying with all environmental 
regulations at all our sites and maintaining 
high standards of environmental management 
on various aspects, including pollution 
prevention, resource conservation and waste 
reduction.
 
our approach
our commitment to environmental compliance 
is outlined in novozymes’ sustainability 
policy. all activities to ensure environmental 
compliance are anchored in the quality, 
environment & safety function. our 
environmental management system is based 
on iso 14001 certification, and we strive to 
minimize instances of non-compliance and 
neighbor complaints.
 
2020 highlights
in 2020, 20 environmental incidents were 
registered across our facilities, compared 
with 17 in 2019. most of these were related 
to wastewater treatment. plans for preventive 
action for these incidents have been agreed 
with the relevant authorities. 
novozymes received ten neighbor complaints 
in 2020 compared to seven complaints in 2019.

not to be in conformity with environmental 
permits or requirements under 
environmental law. 
 
breaches related to annual control 
measurements of spills reported in previous 
years are not included, as they are not 
indicative of performance during the 
reporting year. 
 
neighbor complaints refers to the number 
of registered environmental complaints, 
primarily odor and noise related.

novozymes a/s
novozymes is committed to ensuring product 
safety and stewardship in our operations and 
across our value chain. many of our biological 
solutions serve as ingredients in consumer 
goods (e.g. in laundry detergents) or are used 
for manufacturing consumer products such as 
food, textile and paper.
 
novozymes’ ambition is to continue supplying 
safe products and substitute hazardous 
substances in its operations using safer 
and more sustainable alternatives wherever 
possible. novozymes strives to reduce the risk 
of enzyme allergies among employees and 
downstream users by promoting adherence to 
enzyme safety standards.
 
our approach
product stewardship is an integral part of 
novozymes’ quality management system, and 
our approach is outlined in the quality and 
product safety policy. novozymes constantly 
strives to reduce the risk of potential harm 
to both human health and the environment 
during the manufacture, handling and use of 
its products. this approach is implemented by 
means of many cross-functional teams, and 
the primary responsibility rests with regulatory 
affairs & product safety functions. procedures 
ensuring product stewardship are enforced 
globally and audited by the independent 
external body bureau veritas. 
novozymes measures performance in product 
stewardship, through internal targets that 
guide our progress, particularly in the areas 
of product safety and hazardous substance 
management. we have also developed a 
position on and approach to related topics 
such as product information and labeling, 
traceability, industrial biotechnology, animal 
testing, reach (registration, evaluation, 
authorization and restriction of chemicals) 
and fiap (food improvement agents package).
our position papers on animal testing and 
industrial biotechnology are available at 
novozymes.com.
 
novozymes chairs the enzyme safety working 
group, which plays a coordinating role 
within the association of manufacturers and 
formulators of enzyme products (amfep) in 
the eu. in addition, novozymes is a co-chair 
of the safety and sustainability committee 
in enzyme trade association (eta) in the us. 
through both of these groups, novozymes 
has developed advanced safety standards for 
enzyme use.
 
an annual cross-functional process has 
recently been established to explore the 
potential phase-out and substitution of 
hazardous substances and materials. every 
year, new and existing chemicals are screened 
for environmental, health and safety impacts, 
followed by risk and feasibility assessments to 
determine candidates for potential phase-out.
 
2020 highlights
novozymes remains firmly committed to 
maintaining high-quality dossiers that 
document product safety and transparency 
under relevant regulatory schemes such as 
reach and fiap. with its extensive experience 
in responding to increasing global regulatory 
requirements, novozymes worked in 2020 on 
developing compliance with new reach-like 
regulations in south korea, turkey, uk, india 
and other countries. novozymes also strongly 
supports and complies with regulation on the 
reduction of chemicals of concern such as 
microplastics and 1.4-dioxane. 
 
in 2020, novozymes established an 
internal governance committee to guide 
implementation and decisions in the phase-out 
of hazardous substances. within our annual 
process cycle, we also identified top candidates 
to explore potential phase-outs in 2021.  
 
in 2020, through the amfep, novozymes 
published an industry guideline on the ‘safe 
handling of enzymes in pulp and paper 
manufacturing’ in collaboration with the 
confederation of european paper industries. 
 
furthermore, as a member of the american 
cleaning institute (aci), novozymes took 
part in the update of the guideline for ‘risk 
assessment of enzyme-containing consumer 
products’.
 
in 2021, we will continue to prioritize product 
stewardship practices at novozymes. one 
example is, we will focus on establishing 
a systematic follow up on the identified 
hazardous substance candidates to explore the 
feasibility of phasing them out and developing 
appropriate substitution strategies. another 
example of a new initiative in 2021 will be 
the development of safety guidelines for the 
feed industry in collaboration with the eu 
association of specialty feed ingredients and 
their mixtures (fefana).

novozymes a/s
employees are vital for novozymes’ growth 
and the successful execution of our strategies. 
therefore, it is important for novozymes to 
focus on employee development and diversity 
in all operations. novozymes is responsible 
for ensuring that human rights are respected 
throughout its value chain.
 
our approach
we have adopted a common management 
approach and reporting structure for labor 
practices and human rights. our people and 
organization (p&o) function, together with 
leaders across novozymes are responsible for 
ensuring equal rights for all employees and 
for promoting diversity. we are committed to 
ensuring equal opportunities and avoiding 
discrimination based on race, religion, gender 
or age in our global organization. 
 
in novozymes, we have a policy for diversity 
and equal opportunities, which covers the 
entire workforce. accordingly, the monitoring 
and the measures implemented to improve 
diversity in novozymes cover all layers of 
management. one of novozymes’ primary 
priorities on the diversity agenda has been 
to increase the number of women in senior 
management.
 
novozymes is committed to providing a work 
environment where all individuals can work 
together comfortably and productively, free 
of any kind of harassment and discrimination. 
novozymes recognizes and respects the right 
to form and join associations and to bargain 
collectively. our p&o function works together 
with local leadership to facilitate the fulfillment 
of these fundamental rights in countries with 
limited labor legislation.
 
novozymes respects human rights as defined 
by the un guiding principles on business and 
human rights and has implemented them 
in our operational policies and procedures. 
we respect the international bill of human 
rights, the international labor organization’s 
declaration on fundamental principles and 
rights at work, and, since 2001, we have 
been a signatory to the united nations global 
compact. novozymes is also a signatory to the 
women’s empowerment principles.
 
we publish an annual statement under the uk 
modern slavery act.
 
in 2019, we defined targets for 2020-2022 
focused on building a culture where our 
employees can thrive, grow and perform 
to bring out their best. novozymes aims to 
nurture diversity, and to achieve a score of 86 
on our diversity index by 2022. the diversity 
index is calculated based on gender and 
national representation at management and 
other job levels. by 2022, we aim to achieve 
an 80-point rating on enable learning in our 
employee survey. for the zymer spirit index, 
our target is to achieve a score of 81 by 2022.
2020 highlights
labor practices 
the enable learning target and excite zymers 
target are based on our annual employee 
survey. in 2020, in our employee survey, we 
achieved a score of 78 points on enable 
learning, and a score of 81 on our zymer spirit 
index. the employee survey is an important 
tool that enables us to not only track the 
organizational mood but also to make room for 
better and more relevant team talks focusing 
on how we work together at novozymes. 
these tools are critical to ensuring our success 
as a business and for sustaining our reputation 
as a great place to work.
 
we also believe in promoting diversity at work 
and this year, for our nurture diversity target, 
we achieved 83 on our diversity index, which is 
based on gender and nationality. 
 
we are on track to achieving our 2022 targets.

8.1 labor practices & human rights (continued)
in 2020, we converted our policy for diversity 
and equal opportunities into action by 
ensuring that diversity became a design 
criterion in our 2020 reorganization. to 
increase diversity following our reorganization, 
we have initiatives targeting the recruitment 
process where we held bias training for 
recruiters and developed relevant material 
for hiring managers. further, our local offices 
partner with organizations to support diverse 
long lists of candidates. novozymes engages 
in forums to learn about and promote 
gender equality and this year we focused 
on the challenges caused by covid-19. for 
example, we are active in the ‘un women’ and 
‘advancing women in agriculture conference’. 
novozymes’ president and ceo ester baiget 
was invited to ring the bell for gender equality 
together with ungc denmark, nasdaq 
copenhagen, un women and other leaders. 
we are continuously tracking the impact of our 
initiatives, for example, gender diversity of new 
hires and internal transfers, and overall, we 
have made progress to ensure gender diversity 
in management levels. in 2020, 33% of our 
senior management were female.
 
novozymes believes that respectful, 
professional conduct furthers novozymes’ 
mission and is fundamental to a good 
workplace. this year, we launched a global 
non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy 
and company-wide global training for all 
employees on these topics.
 
in 2020, the enrollment of leaders in our 
leadership development program ‘‘lead the 
way’ increased to ~70% from ~57% in 2019. 
the program was impacted by covid-19 
as trainings were cancelled, postponed or 
changed to virtual sessions, which did not suit 
all participants. the rate of employee turnover 
decreased to 8.7% from 12.7% in 2019. we 
recorded a 1.9% rate of absence, which is in 
line with last year. the rate of absence has 
been broken down into grouped job categories, 
based on whether the work carried out is 
primarily office-based.
 
human rights 
we conduct regionally focused human rights 
impact assessments to identify and assess 
human rights risks and impacts in our business 
and supplier base. as human rights risks vary 
from region to region, this approach enables us 
to gain a more comprehensive understanding 
of human rights risks, our positioning and the 
associated gaps within the respective regions. 
 
in 2020, we conducted the human rights 
impact assessment for the americas. in 
the past two years, we have completed 
assessments for europe, middle east and 
africa (emea) region and india. through these 
assessments, we identified the most salient 
human rights, and are taking appropriate 
measures to mitigate the identified risks and 
gaps. our aim is to complete the assessment 
for china in 2021.
accounts and performance     notes
social and governance data
absence is defined as time lost due to an 
employee’s illness, including sick leave, and 
occupational injuries and diseases. the rate 
of absence is calculated as the number of 
registered days of absence as a percentage 
of the total number of normal working 
days in one year, less vacation and public 
holidays.
 
the rate of employee turnover is calculated 
as employee turnover divided by the average 
number of permanent employees. employee 
turnover is measured as the number of 
permanent employees leaving the group 
during the preceding year (excluding 
employees at divested entities transferred to 
the acquiring company).
 
average age and seniority are calculated as 
the sum of employees’ total age/seniority in 
whole years at the reporting date, divided by 
the number of employees.
 
expatriation refers to novozymes employees 
temporarily reassigned within novozymes 
from the country of original employment for 
periods of more than six months.
 
training costs express the cost of external 
training courses and seminars, translated 
into danish kroner at average exchange 
rates. training costs are also shown as a 
percentage of total employee costs.
 
women in senior management measures the 
percentage of women in director positions 
or higher (i.e. director, vice president or 
executive vice president).
 
nurture diversity index measures the ratio 
of women and international employees at 
both senior management and management 
level. if women and international employees 
are represented at the same ratio in all 
management layers as in the academic 
population in novozymes as such, the index 
would be 100.
 
the zymer spirit and enable learning are 
derived from specific questions in the 
annual employee survey questionnaire. the 
resulting score is a value between 0 and 100.
 
the ‘lead the way’ program indicates the 
number of leaders globally who have been 
registered for the leadership development 
program ‘lead the way’. it is shown as a 
percentage of total number of leaders in 
novozymes.

8.2 occupational health & safety
the health and safety of all our employees is 
of paramount importance to novozymes, and 
therefore forms a fundamental part of our 
business strategy. the aim is to ensure that 
robust safety processes, equipment, standards, 
tools and training are fully integrated into the 
way we work. we take appropriate measures 
to ensure focus on occupational health and 
safety across the organization, by means of 
initiatives owned and driven locally under a 
global framework.
 
our approach
novozymes’ quality, environment and safety 
function is responsible for supporting the 
organization in ensuring a safe and healthy 
work environment. to reinforce our safety 
culture, we have a global health and safety 
policy, along with internal standards and 
procedures. we monitor our performance 
and ensure continuous improvement through 
benchmarking of both internal and external 
key performance indicators.
we define annual targets to ensure we 
continue to improve our performance on health 
and safety. 
 
in 2019, as part of our strategy update, we 
increased our focus on health and wellbeing 
and defined new ambitions and programs on 
these topics. our main target is to drive down 
the three-year rolling average of lost-time injury 
frequency rate to 1.5 per million working hours 
by 2022 relative to a 2017-19 baseline of 1.6 
per million working hours.
 
2020 highlights
as for most companies, the covid-19 
pandemic posed a huge challenge to 
novozymes in 2020 and our regional 
leadership teams and ohs professionals 
were instrumental in handling the situation 
and keeping employees safe and production 
running. we are successfully addressing the 
different challenges across the world through 
our regional task force teams that are led by 
our regional senior leadership. 
 
in 2020, we met our target to drive down the 
three-year rolling average of lost-time injury 
frequency rate to 1.5.
 
the performance this year was recorded at 1.3 
compared with 0.9 in 2019. 
 
this year, in occupational health and safety, we 
followed a risk and data-based strategy when 
defining clear category themes such as traffic 
in outdoor areas, exposure to chemicals, struck 
by object (e.g. falling items) and maintenance 
hazards.
 
social and governance data
accounts and performance     notes
occupational injuries are defined as the 
reported number of occurrences arising out 
of or in the course of work that result in 
fatal or nonfatal injury with at least one day 
of absence from work other than the day of 
injury.
 
occupational diseases are defined as the 
number of diseases contracted as a result 
of exposure to risk factors arising from 
work activity and notified as work related in 
accordance with local legislation.
 
the consequences of occupational injuries 
with absence and occupational diseases are 
measured by recording the work situation 
once the situation resulting from an incident 
has stabilized, for example whether the 
employees have returned to their original 
jobs, and the total number of calendar days 
of absence.
 
frequencies of occupational injuries with 
absence are stated per million working 
hours.
 
the injury severity rate is calculated by 
dividing total days of absence related to 
injuries registered in the same year by the 
number of occupational injuries.

injury prevention is key to our safety 
strategy. our global incident handling 
system capture has since 2018 enabled 
us to implement targeted, data and theme-
based safety initiatives. in 2020, we took 
capture a step further by introducing 
a medical application which allows eu 
gdpr (general data protection regulation) 
compliant management of all medical cases.
 
enzyme & biological safety is a top 
priority for novozymes. in january 2020, 
we published a scientific study, which 
concluded that our preventive program 
for enzyme safety works effectively. our 
learnings enable us to further improve 
the enzyme safety program zeal (zero 
enzyme allergy) and gives inspiration for 
our biological safety program zebra (zero 
biological reactions) for the benefit of both 
employees and customers. we continuously 
promote a culture of product safety across 
the novozymes organization through our 
corporate safety culture and awareness 
activities that promote safe behavior. 
 
focus on mental wellbeing is an ongoing 
activity that aims to help and inspire our 
leaders and employees. one example is our 
global initiative called brainspace. 
 
moving forward, we will focus on further 
implementing our strategy, aiming to 
improve safety in relation to our workplace 
and products and assure the continued 
wellbeing of all our employees.

8.3 business ethics
novozymes is committed to conducting 
business in a responsible, ethical, and 
transparent manner, and to meeting 
stakeholders’ expectations of high business 
integrity standards across our operations.
 
our approach
novozymes’ approach to business integrity is 
embedded in our corporate values, policies and 
procedures.
 
novozymes has adopted seven business 
integrity principles that lay the ground rules 
for engaging with third parties and apply to 
all employees across the world. the business 
integrity principles underline novozymes’ 
zero tolerance approach to bribery and define 
clear rules for gifts and donations. they act 
as novozymes’ code of conduct in business 
integrity matters and form the basis of our 
efforts to eliminate all forms of corruption. 
see our position paper on business integrity at 
novozymes.com.
 
a dedicated legal compliance function, headed 
by the chief legal compliance officer, handles 
business integrity-related matters and training 
of our employees. all employees have access 
to relevant guidance on our intranet and 
are encouraged to raise any concerns about 
business integrity to the designated business 
integrity contacts or through other relevant 
grievance channels. novozymes also has a 
whistleblower system which allows employees 
and others to report their concerns relating to 
 
business integrity and corruption, fraud and 
other serious matters.
 
we offer mandatory business integrity training 
annually for our employees in scope. this 
training is designed and rolled out by the 
chief legal compliance officer, based on input 
from regional lines of business and questions 
raised during the year to ensure relevance 
and applicability. this training includes real-
life case studies and reinforces employee 
commitment to business integrity principles.
 
novozymes’ recurring antitrust training 
provides general guidance on competition law 
and is completed by relevant employees in 
commercial roles across all regions.  
 
novozymes works proactively to prevent, 
detect and respond to fraud, corruption and 
other violations of our business integrity 
principles, and we continuously promote 
internal awareness and develop relevant 
programs or initiatives as required. an internal 
control system enables identification of 
potential violations and addresses concerns 
raised, e.g. through our whistleblower system. 
all whistleblower reports and all cases on 
fraud and corruption are reported to the 
audit committee on a quarterly basis. all 
allegations of fraud, corruption and other 
business integrity violations are appropriately 
investigated in accordance with internal 
policies and procedures. substantiated 
violations will lead to proportionate 
disciplinary sanctions for the parties involved. 
accounts and performance     notes
social and governance data 
completion of business integrity training 
refers to the percentage of employees 
in scope who have undergone business 
integrity training in the latest training 
period. new entities are included within six 
months of acquisition. business integrity 
training is conducted for employees who can 
potentially influence third-party interactions 
or decisions as part of their job role. this 
comprises employees in professional, 
managerial or administrative positions.
 
the reporting criteria for competition 
law violations are whether it has been 
established by an authority member of the 
international competition network or by a 
competent court anywhere in the world that 
a company in the novozymes group has 
violated applicable anti-trust regulations.
novozymes defines fraud and corruption 
as deliberate misconduct with the intent to 
gain a direct or indirect personal advantage 
while exposing novozymes to a financial or 
reputational loss.

general concerns and violations of our 
business integrity principles are reported to 
novozymes’ corporate business integrity 
committee, which oversees business integrity 
matters across the company and our business 
partners. 
 
novozymes’ responsibility for ensuring ethical 
business practices also extends to our business 
partners. our third-party due diligence 
processes include monitoring and ensuring 
that our commercial partners conduct business 
with integrity and share our values regarding 
legal compliance. 
 
novozymes’ whistleblower system allows 
employees and others to report their concerns 
relating to fraud, corruption and other 
violations of novozymes’ business integrity 
principles as well as other serious violations 
of law. concerns reported are handled by 
the chief legal compliance officer and all 
concerns from the system are reported to the 
audit committee.
 
2020 highlights
in 2020, the business integrity training was 
completed by 99% of our employees in scope 
and focused on risks relating to conflicts of 
interest. the competition law compliance 
training this year provided a general reminder 
on competition law restrictions.
 
during the year, we released a new conflict of 
interest policy that provides better guidance 
to employees on identification and proper 
management of potential conflicts of interests 
and related risks with respect to business 
integrity.
 
in 2020, a new dedicated fraud detection 
e-learning was rolled out to select functions.
 
consistent with previous years, there were 
no violations of competition law in 2020. the 
number of potential fraud and corruption cases 
investigated increased in 2020 due to extended 
use of data mining in internal controls and 
proactive detection. the nominal number 
of substantiated cases increased slightly 
compared to 2019. the substantiated cases 
had no material business or financial impact.
 
the charts below provide further details of the 
reporting channels and consequences for fraud 
and corruption cases.

8.4 customer engagement
as part of our strategy better business with 
biology, we want to give the voice of the 
customer a stronger presence at novozymes 
and convert customer needs and demands 
into biological solutions. we believe that our 
customers’ feedback on our solutions and 
services is of great importance to determining 
the success and performance of our business. 
therefore, customer engagement and value 
of our partnership is measured across our 
commercial divisions and across regions. 
 
our approach
each year, we conduct a customer satisfaction 
survey. this is to monitor customer perceptions 
of our solutions and services and learn where 
we can improve.
 
we use the survey as a dialogue tool with our 
customers. overall customer perceptions are 
measured via four key performance indicators: 
net promoter score (nps), loyalty index, value 
of partnership, and customer satisfaction 
score.
 
responsibility for measuring, analyzing 
and addressing customer satisfaction and 
performance is anchored with our commercial

in 2020, novozymes invited 1,063 customers 
across 100 countries to participate in the 
survey with a response rate of 58%. we 
achieved an nps of 50.
 
the results confirm our strong relationships 
with our customers both large and small, new 
and old and across emerging and developed 
markets.
the covid-19 pandemic does not seem 
to have affected customer perceptions of 
novozymes in 2020 compared to previous 
years.
 
responding customers pointed out that it is 
essential that we continue to deliver innovation 
to help them become more competitive and 
within their detailed responses are a number of 
insights that relate to how we can improve our 
performance within certain industries and with 
certain accounts.
 
going forward, we will strive to maintain 
close relationships with our customers and 
proactively work on the areas where we can 
improve.

the net promoter score (nps) is derived 
from an annual questionnaire measuring on 
a scale from 1-10 how likely the customer 
is to recommend novozymes to others. 
the nps is calculated as the share of 
promoters (rating us 9 or 10) less the share 
of detractors (rating us 1-6). the resulting 
score is a value between -100 and +100. 
accounting policies

novozymes a/s
we believe that businesses have an obligation 
to engage with the communities in which they 
operate and to invest strategically in programs 
that create value for society. we are passionate 
about delivering on our promise of better lives 
in a growing world, both inside and outside the 
workplace.
 
our approach
novozymes has committed to contribute to 
our local communities and inspire people 
about the potential of biology. as part of this 
commitment, novozymes has set a target 
to “pledge 1% of our time to local outreach 
activities by 2022”.
 
our community engagement initiatives are 
driven through our inspire-related initiatives. 
the inspire program is governed by strong 
guardrails to guide implementation and 
determine eligibility, and is led by a cross-
functional team. the inspire initiatives are 
regionally owned and driven by grassroot 
employee-led initiatives. the executive 
leadership encourages all employees to spend 
up to 1% of work time in local outreach and 
workplace sustainability initiatives.
 
2020 highlights
inspire is about helping our communities 
respond to local challenges. in 2020, the 
biggest crisis we all faced was the covid-19 
pandemic. our employees in all regions 
stepped up, contributing with their resources, 
time, and creativity to help their communities 
respond to the pandemic and other pressing 
local issues.
 
in china, we donated rmb 1 million via 
the red cross to help build hospitals in 
huoshenshan and leishenshan, procure 
supplies, and provide support for frontline 
workers.
 
in denmark, one of our employees, a trained 
nurse, spent a number of working days 
to help with covid-19 testing at holbæk 
hospital. another employee, an operator 
from kalundborg, was seconded to his former 
employer who started a large production of 
hand sanitizer and needed his expertise to 
keep up with the high demand.
 
in india, around 140 zymers participated in 
a virtual fitness challenge to raise money for 
daily-wage earners, whose lives had come to 
a standstill due to covid-19. observing local 
rules and guidelines, our employees walked 
an estimated 2.3 million steps in a day raising 
inr 1.7 million. the sum was donated towards 
state funds, and organizations involved with 
disaster management and eradication of 
hunger.
 
in kenya, novozymes was awarded by the 
marketing society of kenya (msk) for driving 
biology amongst the disadvantaged and future 
generations for funding the upgrade of the 
starehe boys bio-lab. starehe boy’s centre & 
school is a charitable institution that runs a 
high school and a technical training institution 
for exceptionally talented students with 
financial constraints. 
 
in latin america, to promote digital inclusion 
especially among underprivileged students, we 
provided 100 computers with internet access 
for students of marista escola social ecológica.  
 
in north america, our employees helped 
educators create meaningful content for 
students learning from home due to covid-19 
restrictions. we worked with local schools 
to organize virtual chats to discuss career 
opportunities in the sciences and hosted virtual 
tours of our site for teachers’ professional 
development. our north american sites have 
also supported covid-19 response of local 
non-profit organizations. through in-kind 
and financial charitable donations, we have 
helped local food banks, provided protective 
equipment and sanitizers to local hospitals, 
and given internet access to students in remote 
areas so that they can learn online.

novozymes a/s
novozymes always strives for responsible 
sourcing and we focus on environment, social 
and governance (esg) issues across our value 
chain. agricultural raw materials are a major 
component of our production processes and a 
secure supply of sustainable raw materials is 
crucial to novozymes’ production. 
 
our approach
novozymes’ sourcing department drives our 
supplier management and responsible sourcing 
program and is anchored within novozymes 
operations, supply and quality function. our 
approach to responsible sourcing is defined 
by our responsible purchasing standards 
(rps) and managed through our supplier 
performance management (spm) process 
and sedex platform. through the spm 
process, novozymes screens suppliers and 
classifies their risk based on spend, country 
and category. in case a supplier does not 
meet our assessment criteria, either an action 
plan is established, or an alternate supplier 
is identified. furthermore, we aim to use 
sedex to enhance the sustainability aspects 
of our spm evaluation going forward. we have 
started onboarding our key suppliers, with 
due consideration for risk and spend, to the 
platform to increase the level of transparency 
in our supply chain.
 
novozymes requires all contracted suppliers 
to comply with our rps, as well as, when 
requested, to complete questionnaires 
and to accept visits and audits relevant for 
confirmation of compliance with the standards. 
these standards cover various esg criteria 
including respect for human and labor 
rights, business ethics, employee health and 
safety and environmental stewardship. all 
our suppliers of directly sourced agricultural 
raw materials are required to adhere to our 
deforestation requirements by not contributing 
to further deforestation and to have zero 
tolerance for land grabbing.
 
to know more, see our position paper on 
responsible purchasing, and our annual 
statement on modern slavery at novozymes.
com.
 
we will continue to focus on our long-term 
commitment of securing 100% renewable 
electricity, reducing scope 3 co2 emissions 
from key raw materials and developing plans 
to manage 100% key materials and waste in 
circular systems.
 
2020 highlights
novozymes continued to expand the use of 
the sedex platform, a sustainability platform, 
to enhance the transparency of our supply 
chain. after onboarding high-risk suppliers in 
2019, this year our focus has been to onboard 
high-spend suppliers across novozymes onto 
sedex, a process which will continue over 
time.
 
as part of novozymes’ journey towards 
becoming carbon neutral, we are taking 
various steps to reduce emissions. during 
2020, novozymes initiated additional means 
to increase the level of renewable electricity 
sourced. 
 
in 2020, the entire electricity consumption at 
novozymes’ franklinton site was covered by 
renewable electricity through the purchase of 
renewable energy certificates (rec), deriving 
from a nearby solar energy plant.
 
novozymes and novo nordisk have jointly 
engaged in a power purchasing agreement 
with swedish energy provider vattenfall ab, 
to supply the two danish companies with 
renewable electricity for the coming decade. 
as part of our climate target we have also set 
a science-based scope 3 target focused on 
purchased goods and services. for 2020, the 
target internally has been to identify relevant 
key suppliers with whom to engage with and to 
establish supplier engagement plans. for more 
details, read note 7.1 climate change.
 
during 2020, a sustainability hotspot analysis 
was conducted for all categories of direct 
sourcing of raw materials across different 
regions. the results of this exercise will be used 
to identify key sustainability issues and will 
serve as input to future sustainable sourcing 
strategies. 
 
as a member of the roundtable on sustainable 
palm oil (rspo), 100% of the palm oil we 
sourced in 2020 was rspo-certified.
novozymes has further increased its focus 
on sustainability when sourcing products and 
services other than raw materials, by including 
sustainability criteria in the tender supplier 
evaluations and implementing initiatives to 
improve sustainability performance within 
categories prioritized in risk assessments, e.g. 
waste and internal logistics.
 
furthermore, we also completed a human 
rights & impact assessment of our operations 
and supplier base in north america and latin 
america. read more about these assessments 
in note 8.1 labor practices & human rights.

basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with 
international standards on auditing (isas) 
and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements and the 
environmental, social and governance data 
section of our report.  
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in 
accordance with the international ethics 
standards board for accountants’ code of 
ethics for professional accountants (iesba 
code) and the additional requirements 
applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the iesba code.  
to the best of our knowledge and belief, 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in 
article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 537/2014 
were not provided, except for an insignificant 
breach that was reported to the audit 
committee and which did not affect our 
independence. 
appointment
we were appointed as auditors of novozymes 
a/s for the first time after the initial public 
offering on march 21, 2001. we have been 
reappointed annually by shareholder resolution 
for a total period of uninterrupted engagement 
of 20 years, including the financial year 2020.

key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
collaboration agreements 
novozymes has entered into collaboration agreements. 
some of these collaboration agreements include complex mechanisms for sharing profit and 
expenses. due to the complexity of the agreements, there are uncertainties in relation to the 
interpretation of the agreements.
in 2020, the most significant of these collaboration agreements, the bioag collaboration 
agreement, was amended to a supply agreement. the amendment of the agreement 
included uncertainties and assessments of income and accruals.
we focused on this area because the agreements and the related accounting treatment 
of profit-sharing and expenses are complex and because the amendment of the bioag 
collaboration agreement required significant judgment and estimation by management. 
refer to note 2.2 and 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.
we tested relevant controls including applicable information systems and monitoring 
controls implemented to ensure that profit-sharing and expenses from the collaboration 
agreements are recognized and measured appropriately on an ongoing basis.
we assessed the accounting treatment applied by management of the amendment of the 
bioag collaboration agreement, including settlement of income and cost associated with the 
change to the supply agreement.
we also assessed the accounting treatment applied by management of the amendment of 
the bioag collaboration agreement in relation to impairment of intangible assets.
we read the amended bioag collaboration agreement and assessed management’s 
interpretation of the amended agreement and the financial impact.
we tested management’s subjective estimation of profit-sharing and related accruals etc. 
under the applicable remaining collaboration agreements, as well as reconciled data inputs 
and significant assumptions – to both internal and external sources – and we assessed the 
accuracy of the accruals in previous periods.
we assessed whether the disclosures in relation to revenue and intangible assets are 
appropriate and meet the requirements of accounting standards.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, 
in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial 
statements for 2020. these matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in 
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s 
review, pages 3-51.
our opinion on the financial statements and 
on the environmental, social and governance 
data does not cover management’s review, 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
management’s review and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review is 
materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
moreover, we considered whether management’s 
review includes the disclosures required by the 
danish financial statements act. 
based on the work we have performed, 
in our view, management’s review is in 
accordance with the consolidated financial 
statements, the parent company financial 
statements, and the environmental, social 
and governance data, and has been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
danish financial statements act. we did 
not identify any material misstatement in 
management’s review.
141
accounts and performane      statements
novozymes a/s
management’s responsibilities for 
the financial statements and the 
environmental, social and  
governance data
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and further requirements 
in the danish financial statements act 
and for the preparation of parent company 
financial statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
furthermore, management is responsible 
for preparing the environmental, social 
and governance data in accordance 
with the accounting policies stated in the 
environmental, social and governance data, 
and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of environmental, social and 
governance data that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements and the 
environmental, social and governance 
data
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements and the environmental, social 
and governance data as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark will 
always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements and the 
environmental, social and governance data.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgment 
and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. we also: 
• 
 identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements 
and the environmental, social and 
governance data, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
• 
 obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the group’s and the parent 
company’s internal control.
• 
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
• 
 conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group or the 
parent company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
• 
 evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether 
the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
• 
 obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial, 
environmental, social and governance 
information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements and the environmental, social 
and governance data. we are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
142
accounts and performane      statements
novozymes a/s
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with  
the esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial 
statements we performed procedures to 
express an opinion on whether the annual 
report of novozymes a/s for the financial 
year january 1 to december 31, 2020 with 
the filename novozymes-2020-12-31.
zip is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the commission delegated 
regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the european 
single electronic format (esef regulation) 
which includes requirements related to the 
preparation of the annual report in xhtml 
format and ixbrl tagging of the consolidated 
financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing an 
annual report that complies with the esef 
regulation. this responsibility includes:
• 
 the preparing of the annual report in 
xhtml format;
• 
 the selection and application of 
appropriate ixbrl tags, including 
extensions to the esef taxonomy and 
the anchoring thereof to elements in the 
taxonomy, for all financial information 
required to be tagged using judgement 
where necessary;
• 
 ensuring consistency between ixbrl 
tagged data and the consolidated financial 
statements presented in human-readable 
format; and
• 
 for such internal control as management 
determines necessary to enable the 
preparation of an annual report that is 
compliant with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable 
assurance on whether the annual report 
is prepared, in all material respects, in 
compliance with the esef regulation based on 
the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a 
report that includes our opinion. the nature, 
timing and extent of procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material 
departures from the requirements set out in 
the esef regulation, whether due to fraud or 
error. the procedures include:
• 
 testing whether the annual report is 
prepared in xhtml format;
• 
 obtaining an understanding of the 
company’s ixbrl tagging process and of 
internal control over the tagging process;
• 
 evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements;
• 
 evaluating the appropriateness of the 
company’s use of ixbrl elements selected 
from the esef taxonomy and the creation 
of extension elements where no suitable 
element in the esef taxonomy has been 
identified;
• 
 evaluating the use of anchoring of 
extension elements to elements in the 
esef taxonomy; and
• 
 reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with 
the audited consolidated financial 
statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of 
novozymes a/s for the financial year january 
1 to december 31, 2020 with the file name 
novozymes-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all 
material respects, in compliance with the esef 
regulation.

novozymes a/s
the financial statements of novozymes a/s 
have been prepared in accordance with the 
danish financial statements act (accounting 
class d).  
 
the accounting policies are unchanged from 
2019.
 
the accounting policies are consistent with 
those applied for the consolidated financial 
statements except as described below. for a 
description of the group’s accounting policies, 
please refer to the consolidated financial 
statements.
 
no separate statement of cash flows has been 
prepared for novozymes a/s; please refer to 
the consolidated statement of cash flows.
recognition and measurement in general
income is recognized in the income statement 
as earned.
 
all costs incurred in generating the year’s 
revenue are also recognized in the income 
statement, including depreciation, amortization 
and impairment losses. 
 
value adjustments of financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value or amortized 
cost are also recognized in the income 
statement. 
assets are recognized in the balance sheet 
when it is considered probable that future 
economic benefits will flow to the company and 
the value of the asset can be measured reliably. 
liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet 
when they are considered probable and can be 
measured reliably. at initial recognition, assets 
and liabilities are measured at cost. assets 
and liabilities are subsequently measured as 
described below for each item.
 
the recognition and measurement principles 
take due account of predictable losses and 
risks occurring prior to the presentation of 
financial statements that confirm or refute the 
conditions prevailing at the reporting date.
intangible assets
the accounting policies for intangible fixed 
assets follow those of the group with the 
exception of goodwill, which is amortized over 
a period of 10 years using the straight-line 
method.
 
an amount equal to the total capitalized 
development costs after tax is recognized 
under shareholders’ equity in reserve for 
development costs.
 
financial assets
investments in subsidiaries and investments 
in associates are recognized initially at cost 
and subsequently measured using the equity 
method. the company’s share of the equity 
of subsidiaries, based on the fair value of 
the identifiable net assets at the acquisition 
date, less or plus unrealized intercompany 
profits or losses, with the addition of any 
residual value of goodwill, is recognized under 
investments in subsidiaries and investments 
in associates respectively in the balance sheet. 
if the shareholders’ equity of subsidiaries or 
associates is negative and novozymes a/s 
has a legal or constructive obligation to cover 
the company’s negative equity, a provision is 
recognized.
 
net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries 
and associates is recognized under 
shareholders’ equity in the revaluation reserve 
according to the equity method. the reserve 
is reduced by payments of dividends to the 
parent company and adjusted to reflect other 
changes in the equity of subsidiaries.
 
the proportionate share of the net profits 
of subsidiaries less goodwill amortization is 
recognized under income from investments in 
subsidiaries in the income statement. goodwill 
in subsidiaries is amortized over a period of 10 
years using the straight-line method.
 
dividend
the dividend proposed for the financial year is 
shown as a separate item under shareholders’ 
equity.

forward-looking statements 
this annual report contains forward-looking 
statements, including statements about future 
events, future financial performance, plans, 
strategies and expectations. forward-looking 
statements are associated with words such 
as, but not limited to, “believe,” “anticipate,” 
“expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” 
“could,” “may,” “might” and other words with a 
similar meaning.
forward-looking statements are by their very 
nature associated with risks and uncertainties 
that may cause actual results to differ 
materially from expectations, both positively 
and negatively. these risks and uncertainties 
may include unexpected developments in i) the 
ability to develop and market new products; ii) 
the demand for novozymes’ products, market-
driven price decreases, industry consolidation, 
and launches of competing products or 
disruptive technologies in novozymes’ core 
areas; iii) the ability to protect and enforce 
the company’s intellectual property rights; iv) 
significant litigation or breaches of contract; 
v) the materialization of the company’s 
growth platforms, notably the opportunity for 
marketing biomass conversion technologies 
or the development of microbial solutions 
for broad-acre crops; vi) political conditions, 
such as acceptance of enzymes produced by 
genetically modified organisms; vii) global 
economic and capital market conditions, 
including, but not limited to, currency exchange 
rates (usd/dkk and eur/dkk in particular, 
but not exclusively), interest rates and inflation; 
and viii) significant price decreases for inputs 
and materials that compete with novozymes’ 
biological solutions. the company undertakes 
no duty to update any forward-looking 
statements as a result of future developments 
or new information.
