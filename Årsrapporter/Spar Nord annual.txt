introduction 
why invest in spar nord? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strong financial performance 
based on a strategy focused on serving retail cus-
tomers and small and medium-sized enterprises in 
denmark, spar nord has successfully generated 
strong results in a challenging market. throughout 
the current business cycle, the bank has achieved 
a satisfactory financial performance, and in recent 
years it has recorded one of the best returns on 
equity among the large banks in denmark. 
 
ten years of growth 
spar nord has experienced ten years of growth in 
both the retail and the business customer market. 
customer volumes grew from 269,000 in 2010 to 
384,000 in 2020, while credits arranged rose from 
dkk 78 billion to dkk 137 billion, and the total busi-
ness volume from dkk 145 billion to dkk 291 billion. 
as a result, spar nord currently holds a market 
share of around 4% of the total danish market for 
bank, leasing and mortgage loans. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high customer satisfaction 
spar nord enjoys a strong reputation and high 
customer satisfaction across customer segments. 
in the retail segment, spar nord regularly monitors 
customer satisfaction levels via ongoing evaluation 
of customer meetings. customer satisfaction im-
proved in 2020 and is at a high level. in the busi-
ness customer segment, spar nord has – for the 
fourth consecutive year – been named the bank 
among the six largest banks in denmark with the 
most satisfied business customers. 
 
strong credit quality 
spar nord’s business model is based on decentral-
ised decision-making powers and local ownership. 
in the credit area, however, the bank retains strong 
centralised management, and coupled with strate-
gic decisions on matters such as exposure size and 
customer segments, this has given the bank a well-
diversified loan portfolio and a persistently strong 
credit quality throughout the business cycle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strong capital position – preparing for irb 
in recent years, spar nord has strengthened its 
capital position considerably. our common equity 
tier 1 capital ratio has increased from 9.5% in 2010 
to 17.2% in 2020 – primarily because the bank’s eq-
uity has grown from dkk 4.4 billion to dkk 9.6 billion. 
in order to ensure more optimum capital applica-
tion, spar nord has launched a strategic project, 
which, over the course of the coming years, is to 
facilitate a transition from the standard method to 
internal ratings-based models (irb). 
 
investing in digitalisation 
over the past few years, spar nord has invested 
substantial resources in new digital solutions – 
both in the form of direct customer-centric solu-
tions, new tools for employees and systems to 
streamline production and compliance procedures. 
most recently, spar nord has implemented 
salesforce as its new cem system and established 
a dedicated development unit to strengthen it 
support for advisers in their everyday work.

key results in 2020 
 
core income 
spar nord generated core income of dkk 3,326 million in 
2020, which was dkk 12 million lower than in 2019. net inter-
est income and net fee income both rose by 1%, while market 
value adjustments were up by 14%. lastly, other income was 
reduced by 56%, primarily because of extraordinary income 
from spar nord’s ownership interest in danske andelskassers 
bank in 2019. 
 
 
costs and expenses 
spar nord’s total costs and expenses amounted to dkk 
2,099 million, against dkk 2,014 million in 2019. in 2020, costs 
and expenses were affected by one-off costs for redundan-
cies, and it costs (data processing centre) were higher. 
 
loan impairment 
loan impairment charges amounted to dkk 309 million, 
against dkk 22 million in 2019. the increase was to a large 
extent attributable to the recognition of a management es-
timate of dkk 320 million due to covid-19. 
 
 
profit/loss after tax 
spar nord’s profit before tax amounted to dkk 918 million in 
2020 compared with dkk 1,302 million in 2019. profit after tax 
was dkk 737 million in 2020. 
 
business volume 
the total business volume grew 7% in 2020 to dkk 291.3 bil-
lion at the end of the year. the facilitation of mortgage 
loans rose 7% to dkk 94.5 billion, while bank and leasing 
loans fell 2% to dkk 42.5 billion. 
 
 
 
return on equity 
return on equity after tax stood at 7.4% in 2020, down from 
11.7% in 2019. 
 
dividend 
for the 2020 financial year, the danish fsa generally recom-
mends limited dividend payments by danish banks. 
the board of directors will therefore recommend to the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting that a dividend 
of dkk 1.5 per share be distributed for 2020. 
spar nord did not disburse the planned dkk 3.5 per share 
from 2019 because the danish fsa recommended the sus-
pension of dividend payments. 
 
 
market capitalisation 
spar nord’s market capitalisation fell 8% in 2020 to dkk 7.4 
billion at the end of the year.

decentralised ownership and strong central 
support 
the core of spar nord’s business model is local 
commitment combined with strong central support. 
spar nord consists of local entities with extensive 
decision-making powers in areas such as customer 
service, market canvassing and employee condi-
tions. 
the philosophy underlying the business model is 
that the work undertaken by the centralised sup-
port and development functions should be deter-
mined by customer requirements for the decentral-
ised customer-facing entities. in the credit area, 
the bank applies centralised management and 
monitoring.

introduction 
spar nord annual report 2020 
dear shareholders 
 
2020 was a historically turbulent year for spar nord 
and for the whole world. in spite of the covid-19 
pandemic, spar nord made it through 2020 with a 
satisfactory performance, as a result of which our 
board of directors proposes a dividend of dkk 1.50 
per share. 
reporting a net profit of dkk 737 million and a re-
turn on equity of 7.4% for 2020, spar nord ranks 
among the top-performing large danish banks. 
in the retail customer area, we experienced a sur-
prisingly high level of activity in 2020, especially in 
the housing area with remortgaging and house 
sales. in a volatile year, we managed to create 
solid growth in the facilitation of mortgage loans, 
which rose by 7%, and we also recorded an in-
crease in loans to retail customers during a period 
in which total sector lending to retail customers fell 
by 4%. this illustrates that we continue to increase 
our market share in the retail customer segment in 
denmark. 
close to customers during covid-19 pandemic 
a few years from now, 2020 will undoubtedly be re-
membered for covid-19, which has had an un-
precedented – in modern times – impact on peo-
ple’s lives, both at home, financially and in terms of 
the human cost. 
watching developments in china at the beginning 
of 2020, few had imagined the danish government 
would be announcing an almost complete lock-
down of society at a press conference on 11 march. 
restrictions during the rest of the year waxed and 
waned, but generally meant we had to find new 
ways of living and working. 
at spar nord, the consequences included distance 
working for many of our employees through much 
of the year – and here, our employees have shown 
a high degree of flexibility and ability to advise 
customers at a difficult time. 
this was not least the case in our business cus-
tomer segment, where, fortunately, we have been 
able to accommodate 95% of our business custom-
ers’ wishes and requirements resulting from covid-
19. the gratitude of our business customers is re-
flected in the most recent survey conducted by 
aalund. the survey names spar nord – for the 
fourth consecutive year – as the bank among the 
six largest banks in denmark with the most satisfied 
business customers, and whose customers are 
most satisfied with the bank’s covid-19 support. 
despite this support, lending to business customers 
fell by dkk 1.9 billion, in part because of the danish 
government’s relief packages, which include defer-
ring payment of vat and income tax. 
in 2020, our retail customers once again demon-
strated strong credit quality and robust finances, 
and they only experienced slight problems caused 
by the corona crisis. despite a reduced level of ac-
tivity in society as a whole, business carried on in 
the housing market, in securities trading and in the 
asset management area. 
however, a high level of uncertainty still attaches to 
the longer-term societal effects and consequences 
of the crisis, and especially the implications for spar 
nord’s business customers. 
because of a macroeconomic slowdown and focus 
on internal efficiency, we adjusted our employee 
headcount on two occasions in 2020, partly 
through a voluntary severance programme in mid-
2020, and partly through redundancies at the end 
of 2020. it is always regrettable and sad to say 
goodbye to skilled colleagues, but in the current 
situation we found it the responsible thing to do. 
low interest rates moving even lower 
while the year started with expectations of low in-
terest rates for a long time, government and cen-
tral bank intervention in response to the corona cri-
sis prompted most people to prepare for even 
lower interest rates for an even longer period. 
in the current, extreme interest rate environment, 
negative deposit rates are the new normal for both 
retail and business customers. prompted by current 
expectations of low interest rates as far as the eye 
can see, we found it necessary to implement a 
number of changes and initiatives on the deposit 
side in an attempt to fix the imbalance created by 
negative market rates. 
the decision to further increase the negative inter-
est rate towards business customers means a 
moderately positive interest rate margin on depos-
its has again been established. at the same time, 
the threshold for calculating a negative rate on re-
tail customers’ cash deposits was lowered to dkk 
100,000. 
with respect to negative deposit rates, it is gener-
ally important to look at the flipside too. customers 
have long been able to take out a 30-year mort-
gage loan at a fixed rate of interest of 0.5%. in 
other words, customers have the benefit of borrow-
ing money at historically low interest rates. 
negative return to shareholders 
our shareholders also had a turbulent 2020. from 
an end-of-year price of dkk 65 in 2019, the covid-
19 crisis in march caused the spar nord share to 
briefly trade around a price of 36. in line with other 
financial stocks, the spar nord share appreciated 
over the remainder of the year, closing 2020 at a 
price of 60.

letter to our shareholders

spar nord annual report 2020 
as no dividends were distributed in 2020, the total 
return was therefore minus 8%, equal to the fall in 
the share price for the year (y/y). 
in response to the covid-19 crisis, the danish fsa 
recommended the suspension of dividend pay-
ments in 2020 for the 2019 financial year, and spar 
nord followed this recommendation.  
for the 2020 financial year, the danish fsa gener-
ally recommends limited dividend payments by 
danish banks. the board of directors has therefore 
resolved to recommend to the shareholders at the 
annual general meeting that a dividend of dkk 1.50 
per share be distributed, equal to a payout ratio of 
25%, which is slightly below the bank's dividend pol-
icy target of 30-50%. 
acquisition of banknordik’s danish business 
the bank’s last news item of the year also turned 
out to be the most important one. on 22 december 
2020, spar nord announced that the bank had en-
tered into a conditional agreement to acquire 
banknordik’s danish business. overall, the agree-
ment entails that some 60,000 customers with a 
total business volume of around dkk 25 billion will 
become a part of spar nord from 1 february 2021. 
the acquisition of banknordik’s danish business 
significantly strengthens spar nord’s presence and 
market position in the retail customer segment in 
the greater copenhagen area and in the cities of 
aarhus, odense, kolding and haderslev. after the 
acquisition, spar nord will have the same number 
of local branches on zealand as in northern jut-
land, which is a good illustration of our transfor-
mation from a regional to a nationwide bank over 
the past 20 years. 
the agreement will again make spar nord the larg-
est distributor of totalkredit mortgage loans and 
the largest distributor of investment products from 
bankinvest. 
because of costs associated with the acquisition 
and the integration, the acquired business is ex-
pected to make just a modest contribution to the 
bank’s earnings in 2021. from 2022, we expect the 
acquired portfolio to contribute core earnings be-
fore impairment of around dkk 110 million. 
closing of the transaction was subject to the ap-
proval of the danish fsa and the danish competi-
tion and consumer authority. as spar nord re-
ceived both regulatory approvals before the end of 
january 2021, the acquisition was finalised at 1 
february 2021. 
corporate social responsibility and sustainability 
in 2019, we defined a number of initiatives and ef-
forts under the corporate social responsibility des-
ignation. in 2020, spar nord therefore became a 
signatory to the un global compact (corporate re-
sponsibility), the un principles for responsible in-
vestment (un pri) and the un principles for re-
sponsible banking (un prb).

introduction 
spar nord annual report 2020 
in 2019, we also defined a goal of spar nord being 
carbon neutral by 2025. in 2020, we reduced our 
own climate footprint by, among other things, es-
tablishing additional solar cell panels at our head 
office and by converting the bank’s power con-
sumption to 100% danish wind turbine-generated 
power. furthermore, a number of ongoing activities 
to promote sustainability have been accelerated 
after the covid-19 pandemic struck. for example, 
we have travelled far less in 2020 and correspond-
ingly increased the number of online meetings with 
customers and colleagues many times over. 
as a result of developments during the past year, 
we expect spar nord to become carbon neutral as 
early as 2021. 
strategy and outlook 
in 2019, we teamed up with our employees to de-
fine a plan for 2020-22 that builds on the bank’s vi-
sion of being denmark’s most personal bank. we 
remain confident that competent and personal 
advisory services and good overall service will con-
tinue to be key to high customer satisfaction and, 
by extension, growing business volumes – also in 
the years ahead. 
at end-2020, we decided to prioritise selected initi-
atives of the strategy, focusing on simplification 
and creating increased business volume. 
this strategic focus requires an upgrade of the 
bank’s digital strengths. as a result, we are in the 
process of recruiting it resources dedicated to cre-
ating more efficient processes and business proce-
dures for the bank’s customer-centric employees.
at the same time, we have resolved to reduce the 
number of in-house metrics and work to reduce the 
time spent on administrative tasks in order to free 
up more time for customers and business. 
we believe that the bank’s business model of being 
strongly anchored close to our customers will pro-
vide the foundation for future growth. that is also 
the reason why we bucked the trend in 2020 by 
announcing the opening of three new local 
branches in herlev, solrød strand and korsør. 
having fine-tuned the bank’s strategy, we expect 
to be able to create an even more profitable and 
business-oriented bank. our overall financial goal is 
still to generate a return on equity of 7-9% after tax 
and thus to rank among the top-performing large 
danish banks.

financial review 
spar nord annual report 2020 
spar nord achieved a net profit of dkk 737 million in 
2020, which corresponds to an annualised return 
on equity of 7.4%. the profit is dkk 322 million, or 
30%, lower than in 2019 but is considered satisfac-
tory given the covid-19 situation. 
income 
core income for the year amounted to dkk 3,326 mil-
lion, which was on a level with 2019. net interest in-
come was dkk 1,584 million in 2020, against dkk 1,573 
million in 2019.  
compared with 2019, interest income from loans to 
customers was dkk 100 million lower, while interest ex-
penses from deposits improved by dkk 94 million. in-
terest income from bonds etc. was dkk 38 million 
higher than in 2019, while interest expenses for issuing 
bonds and subordinated debt were dkk 24 million 
higher. 
 
 
net interest income was thus positively influenced by 
improved interest expenses driven by active initiatives 
in using negative interest on deposits and interest in-
come from the placement of the bank’s excess liquid-
ity. detracting from net interest income was a dkk 0.7 
billion drop in loans and advances, equal to 2%, and 
continued pressure on interest margins. from the end 
of 2019 to the end of 2020, the overall interest margin 
was thus reduced by 15 basis points, covering a fall in 
the lending margin of 28 basis points, which was 
partly offset by a fall in the deposit margin of 13 basis 
points. the pressure on lending margins was driven by 
a combination of product mix effects (stronger growth 
in lower-margin products, mortgage loans to retail 
customers and leasing loans) and generally mounting 
competition.

net fee income was dkk 1,238 million in 2020, 
against dkk 1,225 million in 2019. net fee income 
thus accounted for 44% of total net interest and 
fee income in 2020 (2019: 44%). 
 
 
the highly satisfactory trend in net fee income was 
mainly attributable to the persistently rising level of 
activity in securities trading and asset manage-
ment and to a generally high level of activity in the 
housing market. the lower remortgaging activity 
compared with 2019 resulted in a fall in transaction 
fees, while fee income from payment services, in-
surance etc. was higher than in 2019.

kets with a turbulent end to the first quarter being

other income amounted to dkk 71 million, against 
dkk 160 million in 2019. 
2019 was extraordinarily impacted by spar nord’s 
stake in danske andelskassers bank, including its 
share of the gain danske andelskassers bank 
achieved from the sale of sparinvest. 
 
 
 
costs and expenses 
the group’s total costs and expenses amounted to 
dkk 2,099 million, against dkk 2,014 million in 2019. 
wages and salaries accounted for dkk 1,293 million 
of total costs and expenses, which means that re-
alised payroll costs were dkk 75 million higher than 
in 2019. the increase was generally due to pay rises 
under collective agreements and a higher number 
of employees over the course of the year as well as 
the completion of the severance programme in 
june and redundancies at the head office in no-
vember. the two latter initiatives resulted in one-off 
costs in 2020 totalling dkk 34 million. 
 
 
at 31 december 2020, spar nord employed 1,545 
people (fte), of whom 47 retired at 1 january 2021. 
at the beginning of 2021, spar nord thus had 51 
fewer employees than at end-2019. 
other operating expenses came to dkk 806 million, 
which is dkk 9 million higher than in 2019. operating 
expenses were adversely affected by rising it costs 
(data processing centre), while cost reductions 
were realised on most other cost items, notably 
travel and marketing expenses. 
the realised core income and costs correspond to 
a cost/income ratio of 0.63, which is slightly better 
than spar nord’s strategic target. 
 
loan impairment 
loan impairment etc. was an expense of dkk 309 
million, against an expense of dkk 22 million in 2019. 
the covid-19 pandemic was the dominant theme 
of 2020, and one which had a strong impact on im-
pairment charges for the year. in 2020, spar nord 
made a model-supported management estimate 
relating to covid-19 of dkk 320 million. because of 
the financial relief packages, the covid-19 crisis in 
2020 has still only caused moderate losses on indi-
vidual exposures. however, a high level of uncer-
tainty still attaches to the longer-term societal ef-
fects and consequences of the crisis, and espe-
cially the implications for spar nord’s business cus-
tomers.

the profit for the year before tax amounted to dkk 
918 million compared with dkk 1,302 million in 2019. 
the group’s effective tax rate was 20%, bringing 
the net profit to dkk 737 million, against dkk 1,059 
million in 2019. 
q4 2020 relative to q3 2020 
spar nord recorded a net profit of dkk 230 mil-
lion in q4 2020, against dkk 252 million in q3 
2020. 
net interest income amounted to dkk 398 million 
in q4, against dkk 391 million in q3. develop-
ments reflected a dkk 4 million improvement in 
interest expenses for deposits, while interest in-
come from loans and advances were un-
changed. lastly, income from the placement of 
the bank’s excess liquidity contributed to the 
positive performance. 
net fee income amounted to dkk 319 million, 
which was dkk 19 million higher than in the pre-
ceding quarter. the increase was primarily 
driven by rising fee income from securities trad-
ing and asset management and from the pay-
ment area. 
market value adjustments and dividends 
amounted to dkk 133 million, down from dkk 137 
million in q3. the decline was attributable to 
lower market value adjustments of the bank’s 
bond portfolio, while income from currency trad-
ing and exchange rate gains were higher in q4 
than in q3. 
total costs and expenses amounted to dkk 568 
million, which was dkk 89 million higher than in 
the preceding quarter. payroll costs were dkk 
344 million, against dkk 289 million in q3, at-
tributable in particular to accrual of holiday pay 
obligations and expenses for layoffs. operating 
expenses amounted to dkk 224 million, against 
dkk 190 million in q3. the increase was attribut-
able in part to higher it costs (data processing 
centre) and in part to consulting fees regarding 
the irb project and legal assistance in connec-
tion with the acquisition of banknordik’s danish 
business. 
loan impairment etc. in q4 was an expense of

in 2020, the bank recorded a decline in bank and 
leasing loans of dkk 0.7 billion, or 2%, to dkk 42.5 
billion. of the decline, dkk 1.9 billion was attributa-
ble to business customers, for which covid-19 relief 
packages have reduced the need to draw on 
credit facilities. conversely, leasing loans grew dkk 
0.7 billion, and loans to retail customers increased 
by dkk 0.7 billion, while loans to public-sector cus-
tomers fell by dkk 0.2 billion. 
based on the volume of bank and leasing loans, 
spar nord has a market share in denmark of about 
5%.  
during 2020, the volume of facilitated mortgage 
loans grew by dkk 5.9 billion to dkk 94.5 billion, 
equal to 7%. in total, the volume of facilitated mort-
gage loans amounted to dkk 83.0 billion from to-
talkredit and dkk 11.5 billion from dlr kredit. 
 
in 2020, deposits, banking activities increased by 
dkk 4.8 billion to dkk 58.1 billion, equal to 9%. of the 
increase, retail customers accounted for dkk 1.2 
billion and business customers for dkk 3.6 billion. 
total deposits of dkk 58.1 billion at the end of 2020  
 
 
gave spar nord a market share in denmark of 
about 4%. 
deposits in pooled schemes rose by dkk 3.1 billion, 
or 18%, to dkk 20.5 billion, while customers’ custodi-
anship accounts rose by dkk 4.5 billion, or 8%, to 
dkk 57.3 billion. 
 
 
as a result of developments in deposit and lending 
volumes, the loan-to-deposit ratio at end-2020 
stood at 73. 
capital position 
since being designated a sifi institution, spar nord 
has pursued a goal on the capital side of having a 
common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio of 13.5% and an 
own funds ratio of 17.5%.

at 31 december 2020, the common equity tier 1 
(cet1) ratio was 17.2%, while the own funds ratio was 
21.0%. this should be viewed relative to the individ-
ual solvency need calculated by spar nord at 9.9% 
plus the 3.5% combined buffer requirement, bring-
ing the total capital requirement to 13.4%. thus, at 
end-2020 spar nord has an excess capital cover-
age of 7.6 percentage points, equal to dkk 4.2 bil-
lion. 
spar nord must comply with the same require-
ments regarding eligible liabilities (mrel require-
ments) as other sifis. for spar nord, the require-
ment will be phased in during the period until mid-
2022. when the mrel requirement has been fully 
phased in, spar nord must have total capital of 
about 27% of the total risk exposure amount (rea). 
over the coming years, the phasing in of the new 
requirements is expected to lead to a total need 
for issuing mrel capital to the tune of dkk 6 billion, 
of which around dkk 2 billion is expected to be is-
sued in 2021. in 2019, spar nord issued dkk 2.6 bil-
lion with an expected term to maturity of 3 and 5 
years, respectively. as a result of the covid-19 cri-
sis, the danish fsa decided in 2020 to postpone 
the phasing-in of the mrel requirement by six

at the end of 2020, spar nord’s strategic liquidity 
amounted to dkk 30.0 billion, up dkk 6.6 billion on 
end-2019. the increase was primarily attributable 
to a strong increase in deposits because of the 
covid-19 crisis. 
spar nord’s lcr ratio at 31 december 2020 was 
241. 
rating 
throughout 2020, spar nord's rating from rating 
agency moody’s was unchanged. spar nord has an 
adjusted baseline credit assessment of baa1 and a 
banking deposit rating of a1 with a stable outlook. 
spar nord’s senior non-preferred issues have been 
assigned a rating of a3 by moody’s. 
acquisition of banknordik’s danish business  
on 22 december 2020, spar nord bank and bank-
nordik signed a conditional agreement for the ac-
quisition of banknordik’s danish business with a to-
tal business volume of approximately dkk 25 billion, 
distributed on some 60,000 customers. the pur-
chase price was agreed at the carrying amount 
with the addition of goodwill of dkk 255 million. 
overall, the acquisition is expected to reduce the 
bank’s capital ratios by around 1.5 percentage 
point. 
the agreement enables spar nord to strengthen its 
market position in the retail customer segment in 
the greater copenhagen area and in the cities of 
aarhus, odense, kolding and haderslev. the total 
business volume of approximately dkk 25 billion 
breaks down as follows: loans, advances and 
guarantees approx. dkk 3.7 billion, deposits ap-
prox. dkk 5.8 billion. mortgage loans arranged 
through totalkredit approx. dkk 11.1 billion and cus-
tomers’ guardianship accounts approx. 4.8 billion. 
the agreement will make spar nord the largest dis-
tributor of totalkredit mortgage loans and the 
largest distributor of investment products from 
bankinvest. 
the acquired business is expected to contribute 
moderately to the bank’s core earnings before im-
pairment in 2021, as one-off costs associated with 
the transaction are expected to amount to around 
dkk 60 million. from 2022, the acquired portfolio is 
expected to contribute core earnings before im-
pairment of around dkk 110 million. 
closing of the transaction was subject to the ap-
proval of the danish fsa and the danish competi-
tion and consumer authority. as spar nord re-
ceived both regulatory approvals before the end of 
january 2021, the acquisition was finalised at 1 
february 2021.

the supervisory diamond 
some years ago, the danish fsa launched a model, 
the supervisory diamond, which lists a number of 
quantitative reference points, stipulating what can 
be considered a financial institution with an in-
creased risk profile.  
failure to comply with the reference points in the 
supervisory diamond will trigger a reaction from 
the danish fsa. 
in 2020, spar nord was comfortably within all the 
reference points, achieving the values shown be-

outlook for 2021 
spar nord expects two opposing trends in the 
danish economy in the first and second halves of 
2021. while the first half of 2021 is still expected to 
be strongly impacted by the covid-19 crisis with 
limited investment and consumption propensity, 
the second half is expected to see an uptick in ac-
tivity and optimism as vaccinations are rolled out. 
combining its existing market position with the 
opening of three new branches (herlev, solrød 
strand and korsør), spar nord expects to generate 
growth in lending and its overall business volume. 
on top of this comes the effect of the acquisition of 
banknordik’s danish business at 1 february 2021. 
on the basis of expected organic growth in lending 
volumes combined with an expectedly reduced 
pressure on the overall interest margin, including 
the full effect of deposit initiatives already 
completed, spar nord expects to generate an 
improvement in net interest income. the additional 
impact from the acquisition of banknordik’s danish 
business is expected to be around dkk 80 million. 
 
with respect to fee income, spar nord expects to 
be able to extend the levels of 2020, given expec-
tations of persistently high housing market activity, 
both in terms of remortgaging and house sales, 
and continuing growth in demand for asset man-
agement products. to this should be added net 
fee income resulting from the acquisition of bank-
nordik’s danish business, which is expected to 
amount to around dkk 120 million. 
market value adjustments are expected to be sub-
stantially lower than in 2020, primarily because the 
high market value adjustments on the bank’s bond 
portfolio are not expected to be repeated in a year 
of consistently low interest rates. moreover, equity 
market performances are expected to be some-
what less positive than in 2020. on the other hand, 
the acquisition of banknordik’s danish business is 
expected to add around dkk 10 million. 
payroll costs are generally expected to fall be-
cause of a lower number of group employees. fur-
thermore, the bank incurred one-off costs in 2020 
of dkk 34 million in connection with a severance 
programme and redundancies at spar nord’s 
headquarters. 
operating expenses will be marked by mounting it 
costs. in a number of other areas, such as staff 
costs and marketing expenses, spar nord expects 
a small decline relative to 2020.  
on the cost side, the impact of the acquisition of 
banknordik’s danish business is expected to be 
around dkk 130 million, on top of which come one-
off expenses to the tune of dkk 60 million. 
uncertainty with respect to the long-term socio-
economic effects and consequences of the 
covid-19 crisis is expected to persist at least until 
the end of h1 2021. going into 2021, the bank is 
confident about its existing management estimate 
relating to covid-19 , and loan impairment 
charges for 2021 are therefore expected to be nor-
malised at a slightly lower level than in 2020. 
overall, the above factors lead the bank to project 
core earnings before impairment in the dkk 1,100-
1,300 million range, and profit after is expected to 
be in the dkk 650-850 million range.

strategy 
spar nord annual report 2020 
strategy plan 2020-22 
since 2017, spar nord’s vision has been to develop 
denmark’s most personal bank. our vision is 
thus defined because attentiveness and commit-
ment have always been characteristic of spar 
nord’s approach to banking and because spar 
nord believes that personal relations will remain 
pivotal to the ability to attract and retain custom-
ers. 
concurrently with the vision, spar nord defined a 
new strategic direction under the heading the 
personal bank in a digital world. the strate-
gic direction reflects that digitalisation is a basic 
requirement for all banks and that digital technolo-
gies, when used correctly, may help create effi-
ciency improvements and even closer and more 
personal customer relations. 
vision remains intact 
at the end of the strategy period, many of the ef-
forts that were a part of the 2017-19 plan have 
proven to be a success. initiatives like the good 
customer meeting and the good banking experi-
ence have been successfully implemented and 
made a positive contribution to customer satisfac-
tion levels and customer inflows. spar nord has 
achieved decent growth in the business customer 
segment, and for four years in a row we have had 
the most satisfied business customers among the 
large banks (source: aalund research). 
in november 2019, the bank presented a strategy 
plan for the years 2020-22, which is in many ways a 
natural continuation of the 2017-19 plan. the vision 
is still to become denmark’s most personal 
bank, and the business model focusing on exten-
sive decentralised ownership and on operating a 
retail bank with a combination of brick-and-mortar 
branches and digital support remains unchanged.  
 
 
also, a number of the trends in the basic analysis of 
the market and the world around us are un-
changed. 
in order to signal that spar nord with the new plan 
is moving along the course already set, the plan – 
and the strategic direction – has been named the 
personal bank in a digital world 2.0. three 
must win battles have been determined under this 
heading, each comprising three prioritised actions. 
efficiency in the machine room 
these prioritised actions were more clearly defined 
in autumn 2020 such that the bank’s digital focus is 
primarily inward-facing in terms of reducing the 
administrative burden and freeing up time for cus-
tomers. the banking sector has been subject to a 
great many new rules and standards in recent 
years with accompanying administrative tasks. 
spar nord’s ambition to create efficiency in its ma-
chine room should be seen against this back-
ground. 
the goal is to reduce the administrative burden, 
especially for the bank’s customer-facing employ-
ees, and is prompted by an acknowledgement that 
business is created through dialogue with custom-
ers. in its efforts to succeed at this goal, spar nord 
has established a new it unit whose dedicated 
task is to increase administrative efficiency in order 
to free up more time for customer engagement for 
the bank’s advisers. 
in line with the bank’s business model and focus on 
decentralised ownership, we have decided to in-
clude customer-facing competences in our work to 
reduce the administrative burden. the aim is to en-
sure that digital support of administrative tasks has 
the maximum effect on the advisor’s daily work.

strategy 
spar nord annual report 2020 
well prepared for the future 
our financial results were satisfactory during the 
strategy period 2017-19 and in the first year of the 
strategy period 2020-22. hence, spar nord’s 
business growth, return on equity and cost 
efficiency have been excellent compared to similar 
large banks. spar nord has won market share and 
was in 2019 designated a systemically important 
financial institution in denmark. 
 
summing up, management believes that the 
personal bank in a digital world has been a 
success over the past few years and that spar 
nord is well prepared to face coming years’ 
challenges.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
four current themes 
we believe the banking analysis that formed the basis of spar nord’s new strategic di-
rection in 2016 remains relevant. the dilemmas and strategic themes defined back then 
were thus also included in the analysis underlying the new strategy: the personal 
bank in a digital world 2.0: 
 
theme 1 weak growth and low interest rates 
the economic climate is challenged by relatively weak growth, low consumer spending 
and extremely low interest rates. at the same time, there is substantial excess liquidity in 
the market and the danish banking market is extremely competitive. these factors were 
intensified by the covid-19 pandemic and have combined put severe pressure on 
prices of and earnings on the traditional core banking products of deposits and loans. 
 
theme 2 digitalisation 
digitalisation of the danish banking market has not progressed nearly as rapidly as ex-
pected three or four years ago. nevertheless, digitalisation will unavoidably remain a 
basic banking requirement also in the coming years. future generations of banking cus-
tomers will have greater expectations in terms of digital offerings, and well-functioning 
technology is a key prerequisite for running efficient banking operations in the future. 
 
theme 3 legislation and regulation 
in recent years, a deluge of new rules and standards has flooded the banking sector. 
these regulatory measures call for many development and implementation resources, 
thus adding additional pressure on earnings at spar nord and other banks. 
 
theme 4 responsibility and sustainability 
the entire banking sector is currently in a confidence crisis following a number of unfor-
tunate incidents relating to money laundering, tax evasion and dubious investment 
products. adding to that the climate crisis and enhanced focus on corporate responsi-
bility it means the requirements from customers and the general public with respect to 
prudence, responsibility and sustainability are becoming more and more pronounced.

personal advisory services 
and new products 
providing attentive and personal services to our 
customers is a paramount competitive parameter 
for spar nord. in the years ahead, spar nord will 
therefore focus on delivering even better services 
and products to retail and business customers 
alike. 
the most important initiatives are: 
making customer meetings even better  
the good customer meeting is already a spar nord 
stronghold. however, it can be improved even fur-
ther, among other things by improving the meeting 
documents to strengthen their professional content 
and facilitate customer and adviser preparation. 
moreover, we still need to work on the good service 
experience. 
 
 
 
 
new products and services 
spar nord is focused on maintaining up-to-date 
and relevant products and services for the bank’s 
defined principal target groups. during the past 
year, the bank has thus launched new products 
and solutions in areas such as asset management, 
inheritance and wills as well as payment cards and 
payment services. 
expanding business bank 
spar nord still has a huge growth potential as a 
business bank and to achieve this potential, we 
segment our business customers to ensure an even 
better match between the bank’s value offerings 
and expertise and the individual needs of our cus-
tomers. 
 
three must win battles 
based on the vision and the four strategic themes introduced above, spar nord has defined three new must 
win battles, which are considered key to the bank successfully implementing the strategy plan 2020-22. the 
overall plan is illustrated in the model below:

strategy 
spar nord annual report 2020 
 
mwb #2 
an effective and dynamic 
organisation 
the second must win battle is about developing 
expertise, organisation and the tools and pro-
cesses required to ensure that as much time as 
possible is spent on customers and as little time as 
possible on administration and paper work. 
the most important initiatives are: 
automation and improved processes 
dedicated efforts will be made to streamline and 
automate processes, thus reducing the amount of 
administrative resources, freeing up more time for 
advisory services. focus areas will include ensuring 
intuitive assistance from the systems used by the 
employees. 
constantly focusing on improvements 
efforts will regularly be made to identify and realise 
efficiency enhancements in the bank, among other 
things by establishing a new it entity dedicated re-
sources, the purpose of which is to realise efficiency 
enhancements for administrative tasks mainly for 
the bank's customer-centric employees. 
enhanced focus on employee development and 
leadership 
efforts in the field of leadership and employee de-
velopment will be intensified to ensure that spar 
nord remains an attractive bank for its employees 
and that it has the right expertise to meet future 
requirements. at the same time, we will intensify the 
marketing of spar nord as a workplace and 
strengthen the onboarding of new colleagues. 
 
mwb #3 
a reputable bank 
in coming years, spar nord will make strategic and 
systematic efforts to ensure that, in all aspects of 
our business, we meet our corporate responsibilities 
and the expectations which our customers and the 
general public have for the way in which we run our 
business.  
the most important initiatives are: 
a responsible business 
responsible banking is about fulfilling the social 
contract, complying with laws and regulations – 
and also about putting the customers’ interests first 
with respect to advisory services and product inno-
vation. moreover, responsibility is about the bank’s 
global footprint in areas such as climate, the envi-
ronment, working environment and responsible 
supply chain management, which is an area where 
spar nord regularly launches new initiatives. lastly, 
spar nord will maintain its local commitment and in 
that way become even better at creating value to 
our society. 
responsible investment 
when making investments, spar nord will focus on 
meeting the requirements and standards expected 
by our customers. as part of these endeavours, 
spar nord complies with international principles for 
responsible investment and will review its product 
portfolio. also, new products will be launched with 
an enhanced focus on “meaningful investment”, if 
we experience customer demand for such prod-
ucts. 
sustainable finance 
under the “sustainable funding” heading, spar nord 
will regularly launch new products and services 
which, in addition to meeting customers’ funding 
requirements, also address the challenges of our 
planet.

investor 
spar nord annual report 2020 
the overall objective of spar nord’s dialogue with 
investors and analysts is to ensure good and last-
ing relations. it is spar nord’s ambition to maintain 
a high level of information and maximum accessi-
bility, and the bank constantly endeavours to make 
relevant and timely information available at all 
times. 
the bank presents financial reports and other infor-
mation via its ir website, sparnord.com/ir, and also 
provides ongoing information to investors and an-
alysts at frequent meetings, conferences and 
roadshows, among other things after the publica-
tion of the group’s annual and interim reports. 
in 2020, analysts from six investment banks were 
covering the spar nord share (abg sundal collier, 
carnegie, danske bank, handelsbanken, nordea 
and seb). 
spar nord share 
spar nord is listed on the nordic exchange, 
nasdaq copenhagen, and is a component of the 
large cap segment. the share capital amounts to 
dkk 1,230,025,260, divided into shares of dkk 10 
each. 
 
the spar nord share fell from a price of 65 at end-
2019 to 60 at end-2020. as no dividends were dis-
tributed in 2020, the total return was therefore mi-
nus 8%, equal to the fall in the share price for the 
year (y/y). by way of comparison, returns for the 
danish total index kax cap. was 29%, while omx 
copenhagen banks and msci europe banks pro-
duced returns of minus 4% and minus 28%, respec-
tively. at 31 december 2020, the market capitalisa-
tion of spar nord was dkk 7.4 billion, against dkk 
8.0 billion at end-2019. 
in 2020, the average daily trading volume 
amounted to about 119,000 shares compared with 
89,000 in 2019. 
breakdown of shareholders 
at end-2020, spar nord bank had approximately 
93,500 shareholders. the ten largest shareholders 
combined held about 52% of the share capital. 
about 67% of the share capital is held by founda-
tions and institutional investors and other major 
shareholders, while 33% of the capital is held by 
shareholders who each own fewer than 20,000 
shares. geographically speaking, 74% of the share 
capital is owned by danish investors and 26% by 
foreign investors. 
the bank has two shareholders who have an-
nounced that they each hold more than 5% of the 
share capital. the spar nord foundation, aalborg, 
is the largest shareholder, having an interest of 
19.3%. nykredit realkredit a/s, copenhagen, is the 
second largest shareholder, having an interest of 
14.0%. 
dividend policy and expectations 
spar nord pursues the goal of generating a 
competitive return for its shareholders – by way of 
share price performance and dividends. thus, the 
bank’s policy is to distribute dividends to 
shareholders in years when profits permit. 
as from the 2020 financial year, spar nord pursues 
the following dividend policy: 
spar nord pursues the goal of generating a com-
petitive return for its shareholders – by way of 
share price performance and dividends. spar nord 
aims to distribute 30-50% of the net profit for the 
year as ordinary dividends with due consideration 
to meeting the bank’s capital targets. in case the 
bank has extensive excess capital after the distri-
bution of ordinary dividends, the board of directors 
will assess whether such capital can be returned to 
the shareholders in the form of extraordinary divi-
dends or share buybacks. 
for 2021, the danish fsa generally recommends 
limited dividend payments by danish banks re-
garding the financial results for 2020. in connection 
with the distribution of dividends, the danish fsa 
prioritises that the bank is well-capitalised and 
that the dividend distribution is lower than set out 
in the bank’s dividend policy. against this back-
ground, the board of directors recommends to the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting that a 
cash dividend of dkk 1.5 per share be distributed, 
equal to a dividend yield of about 3% and a payout 
ratio of 25%.

responsibility 
spar nord annual report 2020 
 
spar nord is a nationwide bank with approximately 
384,000 customers, 1,545 employees and thou-
sands of small and large suppliers. spar nord is 
also active in danish associations and cultural life, 
acting as sponsor across denmark. as such, spar 
nord plays a role in the life of many people, making 
it crucial for the bank to take joint responsibility 
and play an active part in relations with individuals 
and society at large. 
this section of the report contains an introduction 
to spar nord’s corporate responsibility initiatives. a 
more detailed description of the bank’s policies, 
activities and results in this area is provided in our 
csr report for 2020, which is available on our 
website sparnord.com/csr. 
responsibility a strategic focus area  
responsibility and sustainability play a pivotal role 
in spar nord’s 2020-22 strategy plan. the plan, 
which is presented together with this annual report, 
identifies “a reputable bank” as one of three must 
win battles and describes concrete initiatives in ar-
eas such as responsible investment, sustainable 
funding, climate and environmental issues, respon-
sible supply chain management and local commit-
ment. 
 
signatory to un principles for responsibility and 
sustainability 
since january 2020, spar nord has been a signa-
tory to the un global compact (corporate respon-
sibility), the un principles for responsible invest-
ment (un pri) and the un principles for responsible 
banking (un prb). becoming a signatory is a natu-
ral part of our existing csr initiatives. our progress 
and initiatives will be reported within the framework 
of the un standards.

through responsible investment, responsible financ-
ing and responsible supply chain management. 
responsible banking 
countermeasures against money laundering, ter-
rorist financing and financial crime start with re-
sponsible banking. it is about putting the custom-
ers’ interests first with respect to advisory services 
and product innovation, about complying with ap-
plicable laws and regulations and about ensuring 
that compliance and general conformity with the 
law form an integral part of the bank’s strategy 
and business. responsible banking is paramount 
given that the existence of cross-border financial 
crime and international terrorism is a basic condi-
tion for all banks. the risk of the bank being abused 
for purposes of money laundering and the financ-
ing of terrorism is present every day, and the threat 
level is rising. 
consequently, it is the duty of spar nord to con-
tribute actively to reducing the risk of money laun-
dering and terrorist financing, and, to that end, we 
have defined a money laundering policy and a 
number of preventive measures which are regularly 
adapted to legislation and the current threat sce-
nario. the policy, which, among other things, serves 
to ensure that financial transactions, customer re-
lationships, employee matters and agreements are 
screened when entered into and are monitored on 
an ongoing basis, outlines a low risk exposure in the 
area. consequently, we regularly implement risk-
mitigating measures and initiatives to strengthen 
the bank’s systems and employee capabilities in 
this area. 
 
 
28 
responsibility 
spar nord annual report 2020 
a decent workplace 
spar nord’s most important resource is its employ-
ees. therefore, spar nord continues to take re-
sponsibility for creating a healthy and progressive 
working environment in which all employees can 
unfold their professional and personal potential in 
the best possible way. however, spar nord is re-
sponsible not only for regulating employee condi-
tions in a proper manner, but also for promoting a 
culture in which employees consistently act re-
sponsibly towards customers, colleagues, the bank 
and society in general. at the beginning of 2020, 
spar nord became a signatory to the un global 
compact, and over the course of the year, we im-
plemented an updated responsible working envi-
ronment policy. 
diversity 
we believe diversity is beneficial for developing 
both business relations and collegial relations. spar 
nord therefore aims to strengthen its customer ser-
vices and competitive strength by attracting as 
skilled employees as possible with respect to pro-
fessional and human qualities. it follows from this 
that prejudice based on gender, age, skin colour, 
religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance or 
ethnic origin is a barrier not only to developing our 
business, but also to ensuring a healthy working 
environment and a good reputation. 
currently, the bank has defined a goal that women 
should represent at least 33% of board members. 
at the end of 2020, this goal was not achieved with 
women representing 22% of board members. 
in terms of its general management, spar nord 
works systematically to identify and motivate em-
ployees with leadership potential regardless of 
gender and to improve the retention of managers 
of both genders by offering opportunities and flexi-
bility in relation to work-life balance. 
spar nord has defined a goal that there should be 
at least five qualified applicants for managerial 
positions in the bank, and that at least two of these 
should be women. the long-term objective of the 
bank is to shift the gender breakdown at executive 
and executive mid-level towards a more equal dis-
tribution between men and women – from about 
21.8% women currently in the bank’s executive team 
to 25% women by the end of 2024. as the above-
mentioned goals were not fully achieved in 2020, 
the bank will focus on hr initiatives to support the 
intended developments in 2021. 
environment and climate: carbon-neutral banking 
operations in 2021 
climate and environmental impacts are a major 
challenge to our society, and spar nord takes an 
interest in and co-responsibility for tackling this 
challenge. accordingly, spar nord is a signatory to 
the un’s sustainable development goals (sdgs) 
(un global compact), which forms the foundation 
for our efforts to reduce our negative carbon foot-
print. as a part of spar nord’s strategy plan, oper-
ations should eventually be carbon neutral. our 
goal was originally to achieve carbon neutrality by 
2025, but in 2020 we came a major step closer to 
our goal by purchasing green power and optimis-
ing energy consumption. consequently, we are now 
working to be carbon neutral by the end of 2021. 
the following are examples of our specific results in 
the area of climate and environment in 2020:   
• drop in company car emissions of 41 tco2e 
 
• total drop in air travel emissions of 191 tco2e 
 
• two vehicle charging points installed 
 
• 93% of the bank’s company cars were a-labelled 
in 2020 
 
• emissions from the treatment of waste and spill-
age in 2020 were 3 tco2e. 
 
• emissions from water consumption in 2020 were 6 
tco2e. 
responsible supply chain management 
spar nord buys goods and services from hundreds 
of danish and international suppliers. conse-
quently, spar nord takes joint responsibility for 
maintaining good and transparent supplier rela-
tionships, which underpin the bank’s good reputa-
tion, help attract good suppliers and retain and at-
tract customers. 
we require our suppliers to maintain high environ-
mental standards and that major suppliers support 
the un’s sustainable development goals and the 
ten principles of the un global compact. to ensure 
this, spar nord launched a code of conduct in 2019 
for major suppliers, which, with systematic follow-
up from 2020, became a natural part of the bank’s 
central procurement processes and supply chain 
management. 
local commitment 
spar nord builds on a locally-rooted business 
model, and we are committed to entering into 
healthy and sustainable relations with the local 
communities in which we operate. the locally-
rooted model allows us to build better customer 
relations, and it facilitates the creation of local 
community cohesion through active participation in 
and support for local associations, initiatives and 
institutions. we want to continue and strengthen 
these initiatives as they contribute both financially 
and in terms of human value creation in society 
and in our bank. we believe that our role in society 
is to stimulate healthy and sustainable associations 
at all of our bank locations. 
associations – be they local, regional or national – 
are the centre of attention for the spar nord foun-
dation, which each year makes donations of dkk 
40-50 million for small and large initiatives across 
denmark. the spar nord foundation owns 20% of 
 
29 
responsibility 
spar nord annual report 2020 
spar nord bank, and the dividends from this own-
ership interest are channelled back into society. 
the foundation and the bank remain focused on 
working with many local, small donations and 
sponsorships – partly to reach out to more individ-
uals, and partly to make it easier for dedicated lo-
cals to reach their goals. in 2019, we studied the 
socio-economic impacts of the spar nord founda-
tion’s donations and our sponsorships, and we 
clearly saw that local donations and sponsorships 
are important and very valuable to local communi-
ties. in 2020, the spar nord foundation donated 
dkk 40.7 million to support 681 different projects 
across denmark, while spar nord signed sponsor-
ship agreements for a total amount of dkk 20.6 
million. 
responsible investment and sustainable funding 
spar nord offers proprietary and facilitates third 
party investment products for retail and business 
customers. investment always involves a risk of di-
rect or indirect co-financing of activities which 
have an adverse impact on meeting the un sus-
tainable development goals. we therefore share a 
responsibility for ensuring accountability in proprie-
tary and facilitated investments. we have defined 
responsible investment requirements in our own in-
vestment policies and for investments made by our 
business partners. 
the following are specific examples of results in the 
area of responsible and sustainable investment in 
2020: 
• 100% esg screening of spar nord’s managed 
portfolios 
 
• 100% esg screening of suppliers’ portfolios 
 
• about 13% of our “stjerneinvest” investment con-
cept is placed in the eco-labelled fund bankin-
vest global equities sustainable development. 
 
• implemented stewardship policy relative to dan-
ish equities

corporate governance 
spar nord annual report 2020 
the board of directors and the executive board of 
spar nord consider corporate governance to be a 
fundamental requirement for maintaining a good re-
lationship with internal and external stakeholders and 
for meeting the group’s financial and non-financial 
objectives. 
for that reason, spar nord’s management backs the 
efforts to promote corporate governance and has 
chosen to comply with a vast majority of the 2017 rec-
ommendations from the danish corporate govern-
ance committee. the full wording of spar nord’s posi-
tion on the recommendations and on finance den-
mark’s corporate governance code is available at 
sparnord.com/governance. 
the updated 2020 recommendations from the danish 
corporate governance committee will take effect for 
financial years starting on 1 january 2021. 
general meeting 
the shareholders in general meeting constitute spar 
nord’s supreme governing body. information about 
the notice of general meetings, exercise of voting 
rights etc. is set out in the bank’s articles of associa-
tion, which are available on spanord.com/vedtaegter. 
only the general meeting can amend the articles of 
association. amendments require a two-thirds major-
ity of the votes cast and a two-thirds majority of the 
share capital represented at the general meeting and 
entitled to vote. 
pursuant to the bank’s articles of association, the right 
to vote at general meetings for shareholders holding 
less than 20,000 shares is exercised through dele-
gates (members of spar nord’s regional bank com-
mittees). 
shareholders owning at least 20,000 shares may ex-
ercise their voting rights at the general meeting. 
board of directors and board committees 
spar nord’s board of directors is composed of nine 
members, six of whom are elected by the sharehold-
ers and the remaining three members by the employ-
ees. the bank’s executive board is not part of the 
board of directors but takes part in all of its meetings. 
board members are elected for terms of two years, 
and half of the members elected by the general 
meeting are up for election each year, while members 
elected by the employees pursuant to the danish leg-
islation are elected for terms of four years. 
spar nord’s board of directors has set up three com-
mittees: an audit committee charged with monitoring 
and controlling accounting and auditing matters, a 
risk committee charged with responsibility for pre-
paratory work leading up to the board of directors’ 
decisions regarding risk management and related is-
sues; and a nomination and remuneration commit-
tee charged with undertaking the preparatory work 
concerning the annual board evaluation and nomina-
tion process. 
each year, the spar nord board of directors convenes 
11 ordinary meetings and holds a strategy seminar 
and four meetings with the chairmen of the regional 
bank committees. in 2020, the board of directors held 
a total of 26 physical meetings and telephone confer-
ences. in addition, 6 meetings were held in the audit 
committee, 4 meetings in the risk committee and 5 
meetings in the nomination and remuneration com-
mittee. 
the total board member attendance rate was 98%. 
the attendance by each member of the board of di-
rectors is published on the bank’s website. 
evaluation and nomination process 
the process of nominating members to the board of 
directors is undertaken by the nomination and remu-
neration committee in dialogue with the combined 
members of the board of directors and with the assis-
tance of the chairmen of the local bank councils of 
spar nord’s shareholder regions. on the basis of the 
annual evaluation of the board of directors’ work, 
competencies and composition, any need for recruit-
ing new board members is assessed. if such a need 
exists, the board will prepare a description of the 
competences and qualifications required for the can-
didate. the nomination process generally attaches 
importance to areas such as management experi-
ence, business experience, business acumen, insight 
into finance and risk management and relevant per-
sonal skills. 
election to the board of directors 
at the annual general meeting in april 2021, three of 
the members elected by the shareholders are up for 
election. per nikolaj bukh and kaj christiansen have 
announced that they stand for re-election, and the 
board of directors recommends their re-election, 
while john sørensen, after serving six years on the 
board, has announced that he will not be standing for 
re-election. 
executive board 
the executive board is appointed by the board of di-
rectors and is composed of lasse nyby, ceo, john 
lundsgaard, managing director, lars møller, manag-
ing director, and martin kudsk rasmussen, managing 
director. 
the executive board is the supreme decision-making 
body as concerns the day-to-day affairs of the bank, 
in compliance with the guidelines and directions is-
sued by the board of directors. the more specific dis-
tribution of duties between the board of directors and 
the executive board appears from their rules of pro-
cedure. 
remuneration of the board of directors and the 
executive board 
the remuneration of the board of directors and the 
fees and salaries paid to the executive board are 
shown in the notes to the annual report. board mem-
bers are paid a fixed annual amount and do not par-
ticipate in any bonus or option programmes. 
the board of directors finds that the terms of service 
of executive board members, including severance 
terms, are in line with general practice in the area, and 
they are regularly reviewed. the board of directors 
also finds that the overall remuneration is competitive 
and fair in light of the executive board’s performance 
and having regard to long-term value generation for 
shareholders. 
according to its remuneration policy, spar nord does 
not operate with incentive schemes for the board of 
directors and the executive board.

risks 
spar nord annual report 2020 
risk assumption is a natural component of banking 
operations, placing heavy demands on spar nord’s 
risk management organisation and risk manage-
ment environment. 
the following risks are considered the most im-
portant for spar nord: 
• credit risk 
• market risk 
• liquidity risk 
• operational risk, including it security 
·  
for a more detailed description of risk manage-
ment in the individual risk areas, including a de-
scription of policy, monitoring and reporting, refer-
ence is made to the respective sections. 
risk management organisation 
in accordance with danish legislation, spar nord 
has established a two-tier management structure 
consisting of a board of directors and an executive 
board. moreover, the bank has established segre-
gation of functions between entities entering into 
business transactions with customers or otherwise 
assuming risk on behalf of the bank, and entities in 
charge of risk management. 
the structure of spar nord’s risk management or-
ganisation is shown in the figure on page 38. 
board of directors 
it is the duty of the board of directors to handle the 
overall and strategic management with a view to 
running a healthy and competitive bank, thus se-
curing long-term value for the bank’s stakeholders. 
using the strategic objectives as its point of depar-
ture, the board of directors determines a risk pro-
file, which describes the risk within the bank’s most 
important risk types that the board of directors is 
willing to undertake while meeting the objectives 
set forth in the strategy. 
the objective is to ensure cohesion between spar 
nord’s vision and strategy while ensuring that the 
risk profile is appropriate at all times, having regard 
to the bank’s capital and liquidity situation. 
the board of directors has defined a number of risk 
policies that set out the overall handling and man-
agement of the bank’s risks. these policies are re-
viewed and approved by the board of directors at 
least once a year. 
in order to underpin the management structure, the 
board of directors has drafted written guidelines 
for the executive board, specifying the areas of re-
sponsibility and scope of action. as required and at 
least once a year, the board of directors must as-
sess and update these guidelines. 
 
board committees 
the board of directors has set up a risk commit-
tee, a nomination and remuneration committee 
and an audit committee charged with arranging 
the preparatory work for the board of directors' 
consideration of matters relating to the respective 
topics. 
establishing these board committees helps ensure 
a better utilisation of the specific competences 
held by the board members, thus ensuring in-depth 
dealing with the board material. the sole purpose 
of the committees is to facilitate the transaction of 
business by the board of directors and they have 
no independent decision-making powers. 
the terms of reference of the committees are avail-
able at www. sparnord.com/committees, which 
also provides a presentation of the members and 
their qualifications. 
risk committee 
the principal purpose of the risk committee is to 
handle risk-related matters, including to review and 
assess the adequacy and efficiency of the bank’s 
policies, instructions and systems. the risk commit-
tee also serves to advise the board of directors on 
the bank’s overall current and future risk profile and 
strategy and to ensure the correct implementation 
of the risk strategy in the bank. 
the risk committee consists of three independent 
board members. the committee held four meetings 
in 2020. 
nomination and remuneration committee 
the principal purpose of the nomination and re-
muneration committee is to facilitate the decisions 
to be taken by the board of directors with respect 
to remuneration, including the remuneration policy, 
and other related decisions that may influence risk 
management. the committee also serves to facili-
tate work related to the process of board evalua-
tion, nominating new board candidates, etc. 
the nomination and remuneration committee 
consists of three board members, one of which is 
an independent member and one a member 
elected by the employees. the committee held five 
meetings in 2020. 
audit committee 
the principal purpose of the audit committee is to 
monitor and control accounting and auditing mat-
ters, including informing the board of directors of 
the outcome of the statutory audit. its duties also 
include monitoring the efficiency of the bank’s in-
ternal control system, internal audit and risk man-
agement systems for financial reporting purposes.  
the audit committee consist of three members, 
two of whom are independent. the committee held 
six meetings in 2020.

executive board 
in accordance with the guidelines and risk policies 
issued by the board of directors, the executive 
board is in charge of the day-to-day manage-
ment. 
the executive board must ensure that risk policies 
and guidelines are implemented in the bank’s day-
to-day operations while also ensuring that business 
procedures or work descriptions have been pre-
pared for all important areas. 
the executive board delegates specific guidelines 
and authorisations to selected departments of the 
bank with a view to the practical implementation of 
the guidelines and policies adopted by the board 
of directors. 
executive board committees 
the executive board has set up a number of com-
mittees which in specific areas contribute to spar 
nord’s risk management, preparing issues and 
themes for consideration by the executive board 
and board of directors. 
solvency and risk management committee 
the solvency and risk management committee is 
composed of a member of the executive board, 
trading division, credit rating, finance & accounts 
and risk management. the committee meets every 
quarter and serves to define targets and principles 
for calculating adequate own funds and the indi-
vidual solvency need. the solvency and risk man-
agement committee prepares a recommendation 
for the individual solvency need and passes it on to 
the board of directors for approval. the committee 
handles input from the market risk, it security and 
model risk committees and the credit committee 
to ensure that any capital consequences are dealt 
with by the primary capital and solvency authority. 
market risk committee 
the market risk committee is composed of a 
member of the executive board and members of 
the trading division, finance & accounts and risk 
management. the committee meets every quarter 
to review developments in spar nord’s positions, 
risks as well as the liquidity situation and expecta-
tions regarding market developments and future 
plans. 
it security committee 
the it security committee is composed of a mem-
ber of the executive board, the it department, risk 
management and selected heads of business ar-
eas. the committee serves to advise on and deal 
with any issues that may arise in relation to the in-
formation policy and related rules, procedures and 
contingency plans. 
model risk committee 
the model risk committee is composed of a mem-
ber of the executive board, risk management and 
credit rating. the committee meets once every 
quarter to discuss and monitor the management of 
model risks and to consider recommendations of 
newly developed and revised models prior to ap-
proval and implementation. 
credit committee 
the credit committee is composed of two mem-
bers of the executive board and one member from 
credit rating. the committee deals with credit fa-
cilities that exceed credit rating’s authorisation 
limits or involve a matter of principle. the commit-
tee meets several times a week. frequently, mat-
ters that have been dealt with by the credit com-
mittee will be prepared for subsequent discussion 
among all members of the board of directors. 
1st line of defence 
the business units spar nord's local banks and 
trading division together with the support and 
control functions represent the 1st line of defence. 
the bank’s day-to-day risk management is han-
dled through risk policies, instructions, limits and a 
number of internal controls and is performed in all 
major risk areas, including credit, market, liquidity 
and operational risk. in order to support the busi-
ness units in relation to preventing money-launder-
ing and terrorist financing, an anti-money launder-
ing (aml) function has also been established, which 
is part of the 1st line of defence. 
2nd line of defence 
the 2nd line of defence is composed of the risk 
management function and the compliance func-
tion. the functions have key assignments of moni-
toring, controlling and reporting the bank’s risks 
and control environment. 
risk management function 
the risk management function is responsible for 
providing an overview of the bank and its risk ex-
posure to be able to assess whether such risk ex-
posure is adequately addressed. the risk manage-
ment function’s area of responsibility comprises the 
bank’s risk-prone activities across various risk areas 
and organisational units and risks deriving from 
outsourced functions. the risk management func-
tion also serves as a secretariat to the bank’s risk 
committee and will assist the risk committee in 
providing information about the bank’s risk expo-
sure. 
the risk management function reports to the 
board of directors on a quarterly basis. the activi-
ties of the risk management function are rooted in 
the annual plan adopted by the board of directors. 
the chief risk officer reports directly to the execu-
tive board. dismissal of the chief risk officer is sub-
ject to the prior approval of the board of directors. 
compliance function 
the compliance function is charged with assessing 
and checking spar nord’s compliance with appli-
 
38 
risks 
spar nord annual report 2020 
cable legislation, banking sector standards and in-
ternal guidelines, as well as advising on how to re-
duce compliance risk. 
the compliance function reports to the executive 
board on a quarterly basis and to the board of di-
rectors twice a year. the activities of the compli-
ance function are rooted in the annual plan 
adopted by the board of directors.  
the head of compliance reports directly to the ex-
ecutive board. dismissal of the head of compli-
ance is subject to the prior approval of the board 
of directors. 
3rd line of defence

line of defence and is responsible for planning and 
performing an audit to obtain reasonable assur-
ance as to whether the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
the internal audit department also serves as a 
secretariat to the risk committee. 
the internal audit department bases its activities 
on the annual plan adopted by the board of direc-
tors. these activities include test examinations of 
business procedures and internal control systems in 
key areas subject to risk, including in connection 
with preparing the financial statements. 
it reports directly to the board of directors and 
regularly reports on an ongoing basis to the execu-
tive board and the board of directors. dismissal of 
the head of internal audit is subject to the prior ap-
proval of the board of directors.

annual report 2020 
spar nord annual report 2020 
spar nord’s management believes that the alter-
native performance measures (apms) used in the 
management’s review provide valuable information 
to readers of the financial statements. the apms 
provide a more consistent basis for comparing the 
results of financial periods and for assessing the 
performance of the group. they are also an im-
portant aspect of the way in which spar nord’s 
management defines operating targets and moni-
tors performance. 
throughout the management’s review, perfor-
mance is assessed on the basis of the financial 
highlights and segment reporting, which represent 
the financial information regularly provided to man-
agement. the differences between the financial 
highlights and the ifrs financial statements relate 
only to certain changes in the presentation. as 
there are no adjusting items, net profit is the same 
in the financial highlights and in the ifrs income 
statement. a reconciliation of the correlation be-
tween core income in the management commen-
tary and the ifrs financial statements is shown in 
note 2.1 business segments. 
spar nord uses core earnings as a performance 
measure. there is no difference between “core 
earnings before impairment” in the core earnings 
format and “profit/loss before loan impairments” in 
the ifrs financial statements. 
defined below are the additional key indicators 
shown on pages 11-14 of the management com-
mentary and in the other sections of the manage-
ment commentary.

the board of directors and executive board have 
today reviewed and adopted the 2020 annual re-
port of spar nord bank a/s. 
the consolidated financial statements are pre-
sented in accordance with the international finan-
cial reporting standards as adopted by the eu, 
while the parent company’s financial statements 
are presented in accordance with the danish fi-
nancial business act. in addition, the consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in ac-
cordance with additional danish disclosure re-
quirements for the annual reports of listed financial 
enterprises. 
we consider the accounting policies applied to be 
appropriate, and in our opinion the consolidated fi-
nancial statements and the parent company’s fi-
nancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
group’s and the parent company’s financial posi-
tion at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the 
group’s and the parent company’s operations and 
cash flows for the 2020 financial year.
in addition, we also consider the management’s re-
view to give a fair presentation of the development 
in the group’s and parent company’s activities and

report on the consolidated and parent company

opinion 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial state-
ments and the financial statements of spar nord 
bank a/s give a true and fair view of the group’s 
and the parent company’s assets, liabilities, share-
holders’ equity and financial position at 31 decem-
ber 2020 and of the results of the group’s and the 
parent company’s operations and cash flows for 
the financial year 1 january – 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with the international financial re-
porting standards as adopted by the eu and dan-
ish disclosure requirements for listed financial insti-
tutions in respect of the consolidated financial 
statements and in accordance with the danish fi-
nancial business act in respect of the parent com-
pany’s financial statements. 
furthermore, in our opinion, the parent company’s 
risk management, compliance function, business 
procedures and internal controls in all critical audit 
areas have been organised and are working satis-
factorily.  
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit 
report to the audit committee and the board of 
directors. 
basis for opinion 
we have audited the consolidated financial state-
ments and the financial statements of spar nord 
bank a/s for the financial year 1 january – 31 de-
cember 2020. the consolidated financial state-
ments have been prepared in accordance with the 
international financial reporting standards as 
adopted by the eu and danish disclosure require-
ments for listed financial enterprises. the parent 
company’s financial statements have been pre-
pared in accordance with the danish financial 
business act. 
we conducted our audit on the basis of the danish 
financial supervisory authority’s executive order on 
auditing financial enterprises etc. as well as finan-
cial groups and in accordance with international 
auditing standards on planning and performing the 
audit work. 
we assessed the company’s risk management, 
compliance function, business procedures and in-
ternal controls in all critical audit areas. 
we planned and performed our audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance as to whether the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent com-
pany’s financial statements are free from material 
misstatement. 
 
we participated in auditing all critical audit areas. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have ob-
tained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion. 
statement on the management’s review 
management is responsible for the management’s 
review.  
our opinion on the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company’s company finan-
cial statements does not cover the management’s 
review, and we do not express any form of assur-
ance conclusion thereon. 
in connection with our audit of the consolidated fi-
nancial statements and the parent company fi-
nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
management’s review and, in doing so, consider 
whether the management’s review is materially in-
consistent with the consolidated financial state-
ments or the parent company financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or other-
wise appears to be materially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether 
the management commentary provides the infor-
mation required under the danish financial busi-
ness act. 
based on the work we have performed, we con-
clude that the management’s review is in accord-
ance with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company’s financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance with the re-
quirements of the danish financial statements act. 
we did not identify any material misstatements of 
the management’s review.

opinion 
we have audited the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements of spar 
nord bank a/s for the financial year 1 january 2020 
to 31 december 2020, which comprise the income 
statement, statement of comprehensive income, 
balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and 
notes, including the summary of significant ac-
counting policies, for the group as well as the par-
ent and the consolidated cash flow statement. the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for listed financial 
companies, and the parent financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with the danish finan-
cial business act. 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the group’s fi-
nancial position at 31 december 2020 and of its fi-
nancial performance and cash flows for the finan-
cial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with international financial reporting 
standards as adopted by the eu and additional 
danish disclosure requirements for listed financial 
companies. 
also, in our opinion, the parent financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of 
the parent at 31 december 2020 and of its financial 
performance for the financial year 1 january 2020 
to 31 december 2020 in accordance with the dan-
ish financial business act.  
our opinion is consistent with our audit book com-
ments issued to the audit committee and the 
board of directors. 
 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with inter-
national standards on auditing (isas) and addi-
tional requirements applicable in denmark. our re-
sponsibilities under those standards and require-
ments are further described in the auditor’s respon-
sibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent financial statements 
section of this auditor’s report. we are independent 
of the group in accordance with the iesba code of 
ethics for professional accountants and additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accord-
ance with these requirements. we believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we have 
not provided any prohibited non-audit ser-vices as 
referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 
537/2014. 
we were appointed auditors of spar nord bank 
a/s for the first time on 10 april 2019 for the financial 
year 2019. we have been reappointed annually by 
decision of the general meeting for a total contigu-
ous engagement period of 2 years up to and in-
cluding the financial year 2020.  
key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance 
in our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements for the 
financial year 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020. 
these matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

loan impairment charges and provisions for 
guarantees 
 
how the matter was addressed in our audit   
 
determining expected loan impairment charges 
and provisions for guarantees is subject to signifi-
cant uncertainty and to some degree based on 
management judgement. due to the significance 
of such management judgement and the loan 
and guarantee volumes of the group and the 
parent, auditing loan impairment charges and 
provisions for guarantees is a key audit matter. 
the principles for determining loan impairment 
charges and provisions for guarantees are further 
described in summary of significant accounting 
policies, and management has described the 
management of credit risks and the review for im-
pairment in notes 2.9, 3.2 and 5.1 to the consoli-
dated financial statements. 
the areas of loans and guarantees involving the 
highest level of management judgement, thus re-
quiring greater audit attention, are: 
• identification of credit-impaired exposures. 
 
• parameters and management judgements in 
the calculation model used to determine stage 
1 and stage 2 expected losses. 
 
• valuation of collateral and future cash flows, in-
cluding management judgement involved in 
determining stage 3 expected losses. 
 
• the assessment of the effects of covid-19 and 
other events that were not already considered 
by the models in terms of management judge-
ments incorporated in the models and post-
model adjustments. 
 
 
based on our risk assessment, our audit com-
prised a review of the group’s relevant proce-
dures for loans and guarantees, testing of rele-
vant controls and analysis of the credit quality of 
loans and guarantees, including the amount of 
impairment charges and provisions for guaran-
tees. 
our audit procedures included testing relevant 
controls regarding: 
• current assessment of credit risk. 
 
• assessment and validation of input and as-
sumptions applied in calculating impairment 
charges and provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 
guarantees. 
 
• determining management judgements in addi-
tion to model-based impairment charges. 
 
• determining impairment charges on exposures 
in stage 2 and stage 3, including test of cash 
flows and definition of scenarios . 
our audit procedures also comprised: 
• reviewing, on a sample basis, exposures to en-
sure timely identification of credit-impaired 
loans and guarantees. 
 
• obtaining and evaluating the system auditor’s 
report from the bank’s data centre which in-
cludes an assessment of the mass data import 
used by the bank and of the correct allocation 
of collateral. 
 
• challenging key parameters in the calculation 
model applied with particular focus on objectiv-
ity and the data used. 
 
• challenging management judgements in the 
calculation model used with particular focus on 
management consistency and bias. 
 
• testing, on a sample basis for exposures classi-
fied to be in stage 3, the calculated impairment 
charges for consistency with legal and group 
guidelines to this effect. this included testing 
col-lateral values and definition of scenarios. 
 
• challenging management judgements incorpo-
rated in the models and management’s estab-
lished post-model adjustments in relation to the 
effects of covid-19 and other events that had 
not already been considered by the models. 
 
44 
annual report 2020 
spar nord annual report 2020 
statement on the management’s review 
management is responsible for the management’s 
review. 
our opinion on the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements does 
not cover the management’s review, and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
in connection with our audit of the consolidated fi-
nancial statements and the parent financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read the manage-
ment’s review and, in doing so, consider whether 
the management’s review is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements or our knowledge ob-
tained in the audit or otherwise appears to be ma-
terially misstated. 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether 
the management’s review provides the information 
required under the danish financial business act. 
based on the work we have performed, we con-
clude that the management’s review is in accord-
ance with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the danish financial business act. we did not iden-
tify any material misstatement of the manage-
ment’s review. 
management’s responsibilities for the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial 
statements 
management is responsible for the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements that give a true 
and fair view in accordance with international fi-
nancial reporting standards as adopted by the eu 
and additional requirements under the danish fi-
nancial business act, and for the preparation of 
parent financial statements that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with the danish financial 
business act, and for such internal control as man-
agement determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements 
and parent financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or er-
ror. 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the group’s and the 
parent’s ability to continue as a going concern, for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern, and for using the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent financial 
statements unless management either intends to 
liquidate the group or the parent or to cease oper-
ations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements and the parent 
financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s re-
port that includes our opinion. reason-able assur-
ance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guar-
antee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
isas and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material misstate-
ment when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements and these parent financial 
statements. 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and 
additional requirements applicable in denmark, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain pro-
fessional scepticism throughout the audit. we also:  
• identify and assess the risks of material misstate-
ment of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and per-form audit pro-
cedures responsive to those risks, and obtain au-
dit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not de-
tecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
 
• obtain an understanding of internal control rele-
vant to the audit in order to design audit proce-
dures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the group’s and the par-
ent’s internal control. 
 
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting poli-
cies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by man-
agement. 
 
• conclude on the appropriateness of manage-
ment’s use of the going concern basis of ac-
counting in the preparation of the consolidated fi-
nancial statements and the parent financial 
statements, and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast sig-
nificant doubt on the group’s and the parent’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we con-
clude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated fi-
nancial statements and the parent financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events or 
conditions may cause the group and the entity to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
45 
annual report 2020 
spar nord annual report 2020 
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent financial statements, including the 
disclosures in the notes, and whether the consoli-
dated financial statements and the parent finan-
cial statements represent the underlying transac-
tions and events in a manner that gives a true and 
fair view. 
 
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-
garding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
we are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. we remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.  
we communicate with those charged with govern-
ance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in in-
ternal control that we identify during our audit. 
we also provide those charged with governance 
with a statement that we have complied with rele-
vant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applica-
ble, related safeguards. 
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements and the 
parent financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. we de-
scribe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circum-
stances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.

spar nord annual report 2020 
 accounting policies  
1.1.1 basis of preparation of the annual report 
spar nord bank a/s is a public limited company with its regis-
tered office in denmark. the annual report for the year ended 31 
december 2020 includes both the consolidated financial state-
ments of spar nord and its subsidiary and separate financial 
statements of the parent company. 
the consolidated financial statements are presented in ac-
cordance with the international financial reporting standards 
(ifrs) as adopted by the eu. the parent company's financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with the provi-
sions of the danish financial business act, including the execu-
tive order on financial reports presented by credit institutions 
and investment companies. 
moreover, the annual report is presented in accordance with 
additional danish disclosure requirements for annual reports 
prepared by listed financial institutions; see the danish finan-
cial business act and the danish statutory order on adoption 
of ifrs for financial enterprises issued pursuant to the danish 
financial business act. 
on 11 february 2021, the board of directors and executive board 
reviewed and adopted the 2020 annual report of spar nord. 
the annual report will be submitted for adoption by the share-
holders at the annual general meeting on 7 april 2021. 
figures in the financial statements are presented in millions of 
danish kroner, unless otherwise stated. consequently, rounding 
differences may occur because grand totals are rounded and 
the underlying decimal places are not shown to the reader. 
the policies regarding recognition and measurement in the 
parent company are compatible with ifrs. the difference be-
tween the profit or loss in the group and in the parent company 
is due to the net effect of revaluations and impairment, which 
in the group is recognised in other comprehensive income but 
in the parent company in the income statement via profit in 
subsidiaries. depreciation of domicile properties in the consoli-
dated financial statements is not made in the subsidiary due to 
the investment property classification. 
except for the effect of implementation of new and amended 
accounting standards and interpretations, as described below, 
the accounting policies are consistent with those applied last 
year. comparative figures have been restated to the changed 
accounting policies unless otherwise provided. 
the general accounting policies are described in the following. 
specific accounting policies are incorporated in the relevant 
notes. 
implementation of new accounting standards 
effective 1 january 2020, the spar nord group implemented the 
ifrs standards and interpretations taking effect in the eu for 
2020. the following amendments to ifrs relevant to spar nord 
were implemented effective 1 january 2020: 
• amendments to the ifrs conceptual framework 
• amendments to ifrs 3 regarding definition of a business 
combination 
• amendments to ias 1 and ias 8 regarding definition of mate-
riality 
• amendments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7 regarding ibor re-
form 
the implementation of the adopted amendments and new 
standards did not materially affect recognition and measure-
ment in 2020, thus not impacting earnings per share, diluted 
earnings per share and equity. 
 
recognition and measurement 
assets within spar nord’s control as a result of past events are 
recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future 
economic benefits will flow to spar nord and the value of the 
asset can be reliably measured. obligations arising from past 
events are recognised in the balance sheet where it is probable 
that outflows of future financial resources will be required to 
settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated. 
on initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at fair 
value, and for assets and liabilities subsequently measured at 
amortised cost directly attributable transaction costs will be 
added. subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as 
described for each item. 
recognition and measurement take into consideration any 
gains, losses and risks that arise before the presentation of the 
annual report and that confirm or invalidate matters existing at 
the balance sheet date. 
income is recognised in the income statement as earned. costs 
incurred to generate the year’s earnings are recognised in the 
income statement. value adjustments of financial assets and 
liabilities and derivative financial instruments are recognised in 
the income statement. 
financial instruments are recognised at the settlement date 
and are derecognised when the right to receive or surrender 
cash flows from the financial instrument has expired, or if the 
financial instrument has been transferred and spar nord has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
foreign currency translation 
the consolidated financial statements and the parent com-
pany’s financial statements are presented in danish kroner 
(dkk), rounded to the nearest million dkk, which is the functional 
currency of spar nord bank a/s and the subsidiary aktie-
selskabet skelagervej 15. transactions denominated in foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the 
transaction date. 
exchange differences arising between the exchange rate at 
the transaction date and the exchange rate at the payment 
date are recognised in the income statement as market value 
adjustments. monetary items denominated in foreign currency 
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet 
date. the difference between the exchange rates at the bal-
ance sheet date and at the date when the balance arose is 
recognised in the income statement as market value adjust-
ments. 
offsetting 
receivables and payables are offset when the group has a le-
gally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and 
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the as-
set and settle the liability simultaneously. 
consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements consolidate the parent 
company spar nord bank a/s and the associate in which spar 
nord bank a/s has control over financial and operating policy 
decisions. 
control is said to exist if the group is exposed or has rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with the company and has 
the ability to affect those returns through the power over the 
company. in the assessment of whether the group has control, 
de facto control and potential voting rights that are real and of 
substance at the balance sheet date are taken into account. 
the group enterprise aktieselskabet skelagervej 15 is fully con-
solidated. 
 
54 
section 1 
basis of preparation 
spar nord annual report 2020 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
consolidating the financial statements of spar nord bank a/s 
and the subsidiary using the group’s accounting policies, elim-
inating intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, intra-
group balances as well as realised and unrealised gains and 
losses on intra-group transactions. 
cash flow statement 
the cash flow statement shows the cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities for the year, the year’s 
changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. cash flows 
from operating activities are calculated according to the indi-
rect method as the profit or less for the year adjusted for non-
cash operating items and changes in working capital. 
cash flows from investing activities comprise payments in con-
nection with acquisitions and disposals of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment as well as associates and group 
enterprises, etc. cash flows from financing activities comprise 
dividends paid and movements in the equity, subordinated 
debt, issued bonds, lease liabilities and treasury shares. 
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, demand 
deposits with central banks and amounts due from credit insti-
tutions and central banks with less than three months to ma-
turity. these assets can be readily converted into cash and 
carry only minimal risk of change in value. 
1.1.2 information about standards not yet 
effective 
the international accounting standards board (iasb) has pub-
lished a number of new and amended financial reporting 
standards (ias and ifrs), which spar nord is not required to ob-
serve in preparing the 2020 annual report. these are ifrs 17, 
amendments to ifrs 3 and ifrs 16 and ias 1, ias 16, ias 37 as 
well as the annual improvement project to ifrs standards 2018-
2020 and ibor ii. 
none of the above standards and interpretations have been 
adopted by the eu. 
spar nord does not expect to implement the new standards 
and interpretations until they become mandatorily effective. 
none of the above standards and interpretations are expected 
to materially affect spar nord’s financial reporting, including 
recognition and measurement. 
 significant accounting estimates and 
judgments 
management’s estimates and assumptions of future 
events that will significantly affect the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities underlie the calculation of the carrying 
amount of certain assets and liabilities. 
the estimates and assessments made by the management are 
based on assumptions that the management finds reasonable, 
but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. the as-
sumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unexpected 
future events or circumstances may arise. therefore, estimates 
and judgments are inherently difficult to make and will always 
entail uncertainty when they involve transactions with custom-
ers and other counterparties. it may be necessary to change 
previous estimates as a result of changes to the assumptions 
on which the estimates were based or as a result of new infor-
mation or subsequent events. 
the estimates and assumptions that are deemed critical to the 
consolidated financial statements are as follows: 
accounting item 
estimate assessments 
note 
loan impairment 
  x   
x 
3.2 
fair value of financial instruments 
  
x 
3.3 
 
a specific description of significant accounting estimates and 
judgments is provided in the relevant notes.

 business segments 
accounting policies 
segment information is provided in accordance with spar 
nord’s accounting policies and follows the internal manage-
ment reporting. 
inter-segment transactions are settled on an arm’s length ba-
sis. expenses incurred centrally such as salaries, rent, deprecia-
tion, etc. are allocated to the individual segments based on an 
assessment of the proportionate share of the overall activity 
level. segment assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities 
that are used for maintaining the operating activities of a seg-
ment or have come into existence as a result of such activities 
and that are either directly attributable or may be reasonably 
allocated to a segment. a calculated share of shareholders’ eq-
uity is allocated to each segment. 
other income and expenses are charged to other areas, and 
this item also includes the activities of the subsidiary aktie-
selskabet skelagervej 15. 
description of business segments 
based on the nature of the products and services provided, the 
group is organised in a number of business areas and resource 
and support functions. the reporting segments reflect the 
group’s organisational and management structure as well as 
internal follow-up. 
spar nord’s local banks cater to all types of retail and business 
customers. spar nord’s local banks (the retail bank unit) consti-
tute the largest organisational unit in the spar nord group, con-
sisting of 51 local banks throughout the country. spar nord 
bank’s leasing activities form an integral part of spar nord’s lo-
cal banks. 
the trading division is composed of markets, shares and cor-
porate bonds, interest & forex, asset management and finan-
cial institutions & development. the activities of the trading di-
vision centre on forex and securities, including hedging and 
managing the transactions made by the local banks’ custom-
ers. moreover, the trading division cooperates with a number of 
the bank’s largest business customers and retail customers, as 
well as managing some of the bank’s own positions. financial 
institutions & development offers products and advice associ-
ated with export and import. 
other areas comprise central staff and support functions, other 
income and expenses and eliminations. 
 
principles for intra-group settlement 
an internal interest rate is calculated for all business segments. 
the internal interest rate is used to equalise differences be-
tween assets and liabilities (surplus/deficit of liquidity) among 
the business segments. the internal interest rate is calculated 
on the basis of market rates. 
costs incurred centrally and a few income items are basically 
allocated internally between the individual business segments 
on the basis of cost. an allocation is made from the unit paying 
the costs based on an assessment of each individual unit’s pro-
portionate share of the overall activity level. 
from 2020, the bank has made an additional allocation of key 
costs incurred, which total approximately dkk 400 million per 
year, the vast majority of which is allocated to spar nord’s local 
bank. 
other income and expenses are allocated to the business seg-
ments to whose operation they are directly related or can rea-
sonably be allocated. 
the assets and liabilities of the business segments are the op-
erating assets and operating liabilities that are employed by a 
segment for its operations and that are either directly attribut-
able to the segment or can reasonably be allocated to the seg-
ment. the individual business segment includes allocated cap-
ital equal to 13.5% (2019: 13.5%) of the average total risk exposure 
amount of the business area. in the business segment other ar-
eas, the difference between allocated capital and equity is pre-
sented. 
information about income broken down by products and 
services  
the group’s business areas are organised according to differ-

 fees, charges and commissions 
received 
accounting policies 
fees, charges and commissions relating to services provided 
over a period of time are accrued over the service period, which 
includes guarantee commissions. income generated upon per-
forming a given transaction, including securities and custodian-
ship fees plus payment services fees, is recognised as income 
when the transaction has been performed. 
revenue from contracts with customers 
revenue is recognised with a view to depicting the transfer of 
promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in ex-
change for those services. on the basis of this basic principle, a 
five-step model is applied in a process to ensure systematic as-
sessment of all elements in contracts with customers. 
 
revenue is recognised on completion of the transaction and is 
not a part of the effective rate of interest.  
at contract inception, spar nord determines for each identified 
performance obligation whether the bank satisfies the perfor-
mance obligation over time or at a point in time and whether 
the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether the con-
sideration is susceptible to, for instance, factors outside the 
group’s influence. the consideration is then allocated to the 
identified performance obligation. 
examples of revenue from contracts with customers: 
• portfolio management fees 
• credit card transactions 
• securities trading fees 
• other types of income in the form of, for instance, fee income, 
property management income and rental income

company, and none of them have received remuneration as 
members of the subsidiary’s board of directors. the remunera-
tion of the board of directors is based on intragroup manage-
ment agreements. 
the members of the board of directors receive a fixed fee. in 
addition, a fixed fee is paid to members of the audit committee, 
the risk committee and the nomination and remuneration 
committee. 
 
the board of directors receives no variable pay. the members

in accordance with the danish financial business act, spar 
nord’s remuneration policy defines the group of persons who 
are material risk takers. no variable remuneration components 
over and above the statutorily allowed lower threshold limit 
(dkk 100,000 per year) are paid to material risk takers. 
the remuneration paid to group management (board of direc-
tors and executive board) does not include any variable com-
ponents or discretionary pension benefits. the remuneration 
policy was adopted at the annual general meeting on 17 june 
2020. the remuneration policy is available at sparnord.com/in-
vestor-relations/organisation/governance/. 
according to the remuneration policy, the board of directors 
and the executive board are included in the group of material 
risk takers. the board of directors’ and executive board’s remu-
neration and number of members, etc. are not included in the 
above specification. the specifications of the board of direc-
tors’ and executive board’s remuneration, etc. must be included 
in the total calculation and specification of the bank’s material 
risk takers.

 tax 
accounting policies 
the parent company spar nord bank a/s is jointly taxed with its 
danish subsidiary. the current danish income tax liability is al-
located among the danish companies of the tax pool in propor-
tion to their taxable income. companies utilising tax losses in 
other companies pay joint taxation contributions to the parent 
company equal to the tax value of the utilised losses, while 
companies whose tax losses are utilised by other companies re-
ceive joint taxation contributions from the parent company 
equal to the tax value of the utilised losses (full allocation). the 
jointly taxed danish companies are taxed under the danish on-
account tax scheme. spar nord recognises a deferred tax lia-
bility in respect of recaptured losses related to international 
joint taxation concerning previous activities abroad, where the 
deducted tax loss on foreign activities continues to be subject 
to the ten-year period of commitment for the international tax 
pool. 
 
 
tax for the year, consisting of the year’s current tax and 
changes in deferred tax, is recognised in the income statement 
as regards the amount that can be attributed to the profit or 
loss for the year, in other comprehensive income as regards the 
amount that can be attributed to other comprehensive income 
items and in equity as regards the amount that can be at-
tributed to movements taken directly to equity, except for the 
tax effect concerning interest on the group’s additional tier 1 
(at1) capital, which is recognised in the income statement.

this item comprises loans, advances and receivables, including 
mortgage deeds, finance leases and reverse repo transactions 
where the counterparty is not a credit institution or a central 
bank. 
in reverse repo transactions, that is purchases of securities to 
be repurchased at a later date, the consideration paid is rec-
ognised as loans, advances and other receivables. the differ-
ence between the bid and offered price is recognised as inter-
est in the income statement over the term of the relevant instru-
ment. reverse repo transactions are measured at amortised 
cost.
 
 
 
loans and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
plus transaction costs and less fees and commissions received 
that are directly related to the establishment. subsequently, 
loans, advances and other receivables are measured at amor-
tised cost using the effective interest method less write-downs 
for bad debt losses. 
reference is made to note 5.1.1 for a description of the account-
ing policies concerning loan impairment.
 
significant accounting estimates and judgments, loan 
impairment 
the measurement of impairment pursuant to ifrs 9 across the 
different categories of financial assets requires estimates, par-
ticularly estimates regarding amounts and timing in relation to 
future cash flows and loan values when determining loss allow-
ances and assessments of significant increases in credit risks. 
there estimates are based on a number of factors, and changes 
may result in different levels of loss allowances/provisions. 
 
 
under the bank’s expected credit loss model, a loss allowance 
must be recognised on all credit exposures. the expected credit 
loss model is based on a complex model involving a number of 
underlying assumptions concerning choice of variable input and 
their interdependence. stage 1 and stage 2 impairment charges 
are made on the basis of a model calculation, whereas the cal-
culation in respect of exposures from the weak part of stage 2 
 
 
 
70 
section 3 
balance sheet 
spar nord annual report 2020 
as well as stage 3 is made as a combination of an individual as-
sessment and a modal calculation. the following components 
of the model are considered accounting estimates and judg-
ments: 
• the bank’s internal credit assessment model which allocates 
pd (probability of default) to the individual levels, thus divid-
ing them into stages. 
• the bank’s internal calculation of lgd values (loss given de-
fault) for each segment. 
• the bank’s criteria for assessing whether there has been a 
substantial increase in credit risks since initial recognition, re-
sulting in stage migration. 
• developing a model, including various formulas and selection 
of input. 
• determining macroeconomic scenarios and economic input 
such as unemployment levels and loan values and the impact 
on pd, ead (exposure at default) and lgd (loss given default). 
• selecting forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios. 
spar nord has defined a list of risk events that indicate credit 
impairment. some risks are registered automatically in the sys-
tems, while others are registered manually by customer advisers 
or credit staff members, including credit-quality flagging of 
customers. credit-quality flagging is based on important man-
agement estimates, particularly affected by such factors as 
property prices, unemployment rates and demand for various 
products and services. credit-quality flagging has a direct im-
pact on customer impairment as it affects customer pd values. 
see note 5.1.11 for a description hereof. in accordance with an 
assessment of default, loan exposures of less than dkk 500,000 
are subject to an automated process of credit-quality flagged 
customers based on customer data and characteristics.  
individually assessed impairment should be founded on the 
most likely scenario (base case). in addition, a worst case sce-
nario must be calculated taking a more critical approach to 
customer exposures, including ability to pay and value of col-
lateral, and a best case scenario based on a more positive ap-
proach. a calculation is made for each of the three scenarios, 
which are then weighted based on the probability of each sce-
nario. assessment of changes in payment ability and collateral 
values in and weighting of the three scenarios is based on eval-
uation of individual customer commitments. the model calcula-
tion of the expected losses on impairment in stage 1 and 2 in-
cludes an add-on/deduction calculated on the basis of a 
weighting of the various scenarios with different approaches to 
macroeconomic developments in the coming years. 
at end-2020, the bank increased total impairment charges by 
dkk 267 million relating to management estimates. the increase 
in management estimates primarily relates to covid-19 (dkk 
320 million) and agricultural land values (dkk -22 million). more-
over, the management estimates relate to model uncertainty 
pursuant to the bank’s pd models (dkk -16 million) and lack of 
discounting of collateral in the individual impairment charges 
(dkk -15 million). 
owing to various relief packages to business customers and im-
proved conditions for most of the bank’s retail and agricultural 
customers, calculated impairment charges on customers were 
reversed. due to uncertainty with respect to the economic situ-
ation in 2021, when several relief packages must be repaid, spar 
nord has in 2020 made and increased its management esti-
mate of expected losses relating to covid-19. 
from end-2019 to end-2020, the impairment account rose from 
dkk 1.5 billion to dkk 1.7 billion. 
to reduce the risk attaching to individual exposures, spar nord 
accepts collateral consisting mainly of mortgages and charges 
on physical assets, securities and vehicles, of which mortgages 
on real property are the most common type. the valuation of 
such collateral is based on significant estimates made by man-
agement. 
loans and advances amounted to dkk 52,312 million, corre-
sponding to about 51% of the group’s assets at end-2020. 
 
 
spar nord does not have the categories “financial assets at fair 
value through other comprehensive income” and “loans at fair 
value through profit or loss”.

3.2.1 finance leases as lessee 
accounting policies 
leases in which spar nord is the lessee are classified as finance 
leases when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of an 
asset are transferred to the lessee. 
where spar nord is the lessor, finance lease assets are recog-
nised under loans and advances at the net investment in the 
leases less payments, calculated according to the annuity prin-
ciple over the term of the lease. 
income from lease assets is recognised based on the effective 
interest rate in the lease, and is recognised in the income state-
ment under interest income. gains or losses on the sale of lease 
assets are recognised as other income and operating expenses, 
respectively.

the group’s lease contracts consist mainly of finance leases 
and are recognised in the balance sheet under lending, bank-
ing and leasing activities.  
finance lease assets, with the group as lessor, comprise agri-
cultural equipment, passenger cars and trucks, industrial ma-
chinery, contractor’s equipment, etc. 
the lease contracts are in danish kroner and foreign currency. 
the contracts can be terminated during the lease term. 
leasing loans are always backed by security in the assets 
through ownership.

 securities 
accounting policies 
at initial recognition at the settlement date, bonds and shares, 
etc. are measured at fair value less transaction costs. subse-
quently, bonds and shares, etc. are measured at fair value. re-
alised and unrealised gains and losses as well as dividends are 
recognised in market value adjustments and in dividends on 
shares in the income statement.  
if an active market exists, the fair value of bonds and shares, 
etc. is measured on the basis of quoted market prices for the 
relevant financial instruments. a market is considered active 
when the instrument is traded with sufficient frequency and in 
sufficient volume to provide a valid pricing basis. the fair value 
of such instruments is determined on the basis of the most re-
cently observed closing prices on the balance sheet date (level 
1). in the alternative, generally recognised models and observ-
able market data for corresponding assets are used to measure 
the fair value (level 2). 
securities are removed from the balance sheet on the settle-
ment date. 
strategic shares  
spar nord’s strategic shares that are not included in the group’s 
trading book are measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
strategic shares form part of a portfolio that is managed – and 
on which the returns are measured on the basis of fair value – in 
accordance with a documented risk management and invest-
ment strategy. acquired strategic shares, which are not in-
cluded in the trading portfolio, are measured at fair value on the 
basis of available trading information or accepted valuation 
principles and current market data, including an assessment of 
future earnings and cash flows (level 3). the fair value is also 
affected by co-ownership, trading with the relevant company 
and shareholders’ agreements. 
significant accounting estimates and judgments, fair 
value of financial instruments 
spar nord measures a number of financial instruments at fair 
value, including all derivatives, as well as shares and bonds. 
assessments are made in connection with determining the fair 
value of financial instruments in the following areas: 
• choosing valuation method. 
• determining when available listed prices do not reflect the 
fair value. 
• calculating fair value adjustments to provide for relevant risk 
factors, such as credit, model and liquidity risks. 
• assessing which market parameters are to be monitored for 
unlisted shares, including future cash flows and return re-
quirements. 
in these situations, the decisions are based on judgments in ac-
cordance with spar nord's accounting policies. all such deci-
sions are approved by the relevant group functions. 
as part of its day-to-day operations, spar nord has acquired 
strategic investments in sector supplier companies. 
 
 
strategic investments are measured at fair value based on the 
available information about trading in the relevant company's 
equity investments or, alternatively, by using a valuation model 
based on generally accepted methods and current market 
data, including an assessment of expected future earnings and 
cash flows. the valuation will also be affected by co-ownership, 
trading with the relevant company and shareholders' agree-
ments, etc. if a reliable fair value cannot be determined, the in-
vestment will be valued at cost less any impairment. 
valuations of financial instruments that are only to a limited ex-
tent based on observable market data are subject to estimates. 
this applies for example to unlisted shares and certain bonds 
for which an active market does not exist. 
financial instruments valued on the basis of non-observable in-
put amounted to dkk 1,921 million, equal to 2% of spar nord’s 
assets at year-end 2020.

negative holdings concerning reverse repo transactions and

3.3.4 information on fair value of financial 
instruments 
accounting policies 
financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair 
value or amortised cost. 
at initial recognition, financial assets are assigned to one of the 
following categories: 
• trading book, which are measured at fair value (bonds and 
shares). 
• loans, advances and receivables, measured are measured 
at amortised cost. 
• financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. 
• assets under pooled schemes, which are measured at fair 
value (trading book – bonds and shares). 
at initial recognition, financial liabilities are assigned to one of 
the following categories: 
• trading book, which is measured at fair value. 
• liabilities in pooled schemes at fair value due to accounting 
mismatch. 
• other financial liabilities, which are measured at amortised 
cost. 
fair value measurement of financial instruments 
fair value is the amount at which a financial asset or liability 
may be traded between market participants at the measure-
ment date in the principal market, or, in its absence, the most 
advantageous market to which spar nord has access at such 
time. 
spar nord’s bond trading takes place primarily directly between 
professional counterparties and not trading directly on the 
stock exchange. 
fair value is measured based on the following fair value hierar-
chy, which reflects the parameters included in the measure-
ment: 
• level 1 – quoted market price: 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical as-
sets or liabilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
• level 2 –  observable input: 
valuation techniques based on inputs other than quoted 
prices at level 1, observable either directly (prices) or indi-
rectly (derived from prices). observable input is obtained 
from recognised providers of price information, which is used 
in trading with financial counterparties. spar nord primarily 
uses reuters.  
 
if a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not ac-
tive, the measurement is based on the most recent transac-
tion price. adjustment is made for subsequent changes in 
market conditions, for instance by including transactions in 
similar instruments that are assumed to be motivated by nor-
mal business considerations. 
 
• level 3 –  non-observable input: 
valuation techniques based on inputs for valuing an asset or 
liability based on unobservable market data. for a number of 
financial assets and liabilities, no effective market exists. in 
such situations, an estimated value is used instead, taking 
account of recent transactions in similar instruments, and 
discounted cash flows or other recognised estimation and 
valuation techniques based on the market terms existing at 
the balance sheet date. 
if an instrument is classified differently at the reporting date as 
compared to the beginning of the financial year, it is transferred 
to another category in the valuation hierarchy. any reclassifica-
tion is considered to have been made as of the reporting date. 
bonds and other non-derivative financial liabilities are 
valued according to the following principles: 
• in case of quoted prices, the fair value is fixed as a quoted 
price or a price quotation by a recognised exchange. 
• in case of pricing based on observable inputs, the fair value 
is primarily determined on the basis of published supply and 
demand prices that build on pricing information from reuters 
and secondarily calculated using a market-based yield curve 
plus/minus a credit spread, which is also calculated based 
on market prices. 
• in case of pricing based on non-observable inputs, the cal-
culation includes inputs based on the bank’s own valuations 
of individual components, and also market data in some 
cases. 
at 31 december 2019, spar nord changed its estimate/method 
for calculating fair value of a significant proportion of the bond 
portfolio. previously, spar nord used stock exchange prices for 
a significant proportion of its bond portfolio. as a result of the 
changed estimate/method, a significant proportion of the bond 
portfolio was changed from quoted prices (level 1) to observable 
prices (level 2), because spar nord assessed that the market for 
bond trading mainly consisted of professional counterparties 
where transactions were based on price information from reu-
ters. the changed estimate/method affected the accounting 
items bonds, other non-derivative financial liabilities and bonds 
included in assets linked to pooled schemes. 
at 31 december 2019, the changed estimate/method resulted in 
the following change from level 1 to level 2: dkk 12,680 million 
under bonds, dkk 953 million under other non-derivative finan-
cial liabilities and dkk 4,123 million under assets linked to pooled 
schemes.  
the changed estimate/method had an entirely immaterial 
profit impact in 2019, which was recognised in market value ad-
justments.  
prices available via reuters are real-time prices provided by 
large danish and european banks, which means that end-prices 
take into account interest rate developments since the latest 
transactions. spar nord believes that these prices express the 
 
 
74 
section 3 
balance sheet 
spar nord annual report 2020 
most correct fair value of the bond portfolios, which are mainly 
traded between professional counterparties and other large 
single transactions. 
shares are valued according to the following principles: 
• in case of quoted prices, the fair value is fixed as a price 
quoted by a recognised exchange or an external party. 
• in case of pricing based on observable inputs, the fair value 
is calculated based on available prices for shares that are 
not listed. 
• in case of pricing based on non-observable inputs, the cal-
culation includes shares valued according to generally ac-
cepted valuation principles, e.g., the discounting of expected 
future cash flows, market expectations as to required rate of 
return on equity and comparable transactions. shares that 
are priced on the basis of the prices recommended by lokale 
pengeinstitutter (the association of local banks, savings 
banks and cooperative banks in denmark) are included as 
non-observable inputs. 
 
the fair values are based on shareholders’ agreements for 
the individual companies and share transactions completed. 
the fair value is often based on the companies’ book equity 
(intrinsic value), which is used as a basis for the transaction 
price between shareholders. 
 
the fair value has been reliably measured for all shares, and 
accordingly no shares have been recognised at cost.

derivatives 
derivatives and unsettled spot transactions are recognised at 
fair value on the transaction date. positive fair values are rec-
ognised under other assets. negative fair values are recognised 
under other liabilities. 
at initial recognition, derivatives and unsettled spot transac-
tions are recognised at fair value less transaction costs. on sub-
sequent recognition, derivatives and unsettled spot transac-
tions are recognised at fair value. 
 
realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the 
income statement as market value adjustments. gains or losses 
at initial recognition (“day 1 profit/loss”) are not recognised for 
derivative instruments, but are amortised over the term of the 
relevant instrument. 
the calculation of fair value is based on generally recognised 
models and observable market data (level 2), including yield 
curves, exchange rates and volatility curves, for measuring the 
fair value. the valuation models used comprise swap models, 
credit pricing models as well as option models, such as black & 
scholes models. 
 
day 1 gains (customer margin) 
when valuing unlisted derivative instruments, the initial cus-
tomer margin, etc. is amortised over the remaining term to ma-
turity. at the end of 2020, the customer margin, etc. not yet 
amortised amounted to dkk 63 million (2019: dkk 68 million). 
in day 1 gains, dkk 8 million (2019: dkk 8 million) was offset from 
cva at end-2020, which is the credit value component of de-
rivatives.

financial instruments recognised at amortised cost 
– information on fair value 
 
the vast majority of amounts due to the group, loans and ad-
vances, and deposits may not be assigned without the prior 
consent of customers, and an active market does not exist for 
such financial instruments. consequently, the group bases its 
fair value estimates on data showing changes in market condi-
tions after the initial recognition of the individual instrument that 
affects the price that would have been fixed if the terms had 
been agreed at the balance sheet date. other parties may 
make other estimates. 
the group discloses information about the fair value of financial 
instruments recognised at amortised cost on the basis of the 
following assumptions: 
• for a number of the group’s deposits, loans and advances, 
the interest rate depends on interest developments. 
 
• the fair value of loans and advances and deposits is calcu-
lated on the basis of a qualified estimate, taking into account 
that the bank continuously adapts its loan terms to existing 
market conditions. 
 
• the credit risk for loans and advances is reflected in carrying 
amounts. 
 
• the fair value of fixed-rate deposits is calculated by using the 
interest rate for similar deposits, based on an estimated yield 
curve. 
 
• the fair value of subordinated debt and issued bonds is ad-
justed for listed debt at the most recent transaction price, 
while unlisted debt is recorded at an estimated transaction 
price.

 investments in associates 
accounting policies 
associates are businesses, other than group enterprises, in 
which the group has holdings and significant but not controlling 
influence. significant influence is generally achieved by directly 
or indirectly holding or controlling more than 20%, but less than 
50%, of the voting rights. 
in determining whether the group exercises control or has a sig-
nificant influence, potential votes exercisable at the balance 
sheet date are taken into account. 
investments in associates are recognised and measured at the 
proportionate share of the net asset value (nav) on the balance 
sheet date plus the carrying amount of acquired goodwill.
 
the share of profit/loss for the year after tax is recognised in the 
income statement under other income. 
in connection with the purchase or sale of associates, the results 
of such group enterprises or associates are recognised in the 
income statement from or until the acquisition date, as the case 
may be. any gain or loss upon sale is calculated as the differ-
ence between the selling price and the carrying amount at the 
transfer date, including the carrying amount of goodwill, and is 
recognised under other income/operating expenses. 
 
danske andelskassers bank a/s is assessed individually to be a 
significant associate of spar nord.  
the acquisition of the shares in danske andelskassers bank a/s 
in 2018 and later years is a strategic investment, and spar nord 
intends to merge danske andelskassers bank a/s with spar 
nord. 
income from this investment is recognised in the income state-
ment under other income in note 2.6.

the accounting figures in the 2020 column below are from the 
most recently published annual report for the 2019 financial year 
of danske andelskassers bank a/s. 
investments in associates are measured according to the eq-
uity method, which means that danske andelskassers bank a/s 
is measured at a share of equity less fair value adjustment of 
acquired net assets at the date of acquisition. 
based on the market price, spar nord’s share of the fair value 
of danske andelskassers bank a/s (level 1 in the fair value hier-

3.6.1 goodwill 
accounting policies 
acquired goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated im-
pairment writedowns. 
goodwill is not amortised. 
goodwill on associates is recognised in investments in associ-
ates. 
the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to spar nord’s 
cash-generating units at the date of acquisition. the determi-
nation of cash-generating units is based on the management 
structure and the in-house financial management. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
goodwill is not amortised; instead each cash-generating unit is 
tested for impairment of goodwill at least once a year. goodwill 
is written down to its recoverable amount in the income state-
ment provided that the carrying amount of the net assets of the 
cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the assets’ fair 
value less costs to sell and their value in use, which equals the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived 
from the unit.

accounting policies 
customer relations taken over on the acquisition of undertak-

basis over the expected useful life, which does not exceed ten 
years. the expected useful life depends on customer loyalty. 
useful lives are reassessed annually. any changes in amortisa-
tion as a result of changes in useful life are recognised in future 
reporting periods as a change in accounting estimates. 
customer relations are subjected to an impairment test when 
there is evidence of impairment. when there is evidence of im-
pairment, they are written down to the value in use.

3.6.4 impairment test 
the impairment test compares the carrying amount with the es-
timated present value of the anticipated future cash flows 
(value in use) less the share of equity assigned to the cash-gen-
erating business areas. the special debt structure in financial 
groups means that the calculation basis for the present value of 
future cash flows is based on a simplified equity model. 
the equity model is based on approved strategies and earnings 
estimates for the cash-generating business areas for the next 
five years. 
the share of equity has been fixed at 13.5% (2019: 13.5%) of total 
risk exposure amount.  
the impairment test in 2020 did not give rise to any writedowns 
for impairment of intangible assets. 
goodwill 
the spar nord group’s goodwill with an indefinite useful life is 
tested annually for impairment. the activities are tested on the 
identified cash-generating unit to which the assets have been 
allocated.  
goodwill is included in the cash-generating business area – 
spar nord’s local banks – which is the business area compris-
ing the branch network. for a more detailed description of spar 
nord’s local banks, reference is made to note 2.1. 
principal assumptions 
cash flow during the budget period 
cash flow during the budget period (five years) is impacted by 
expectations of interest rates and the impact on the lending 
and deposit margins at spar nord’s local banks.  
the assumptions used in the impairment test are conservative 
with respect to the future profit impact from the implementa-
tion of spar nord’s strategy.  
growth during the budget period is projected at 1.5% (2019: 1.5%) 
the average annual growth reflects the targets incorporated 
into the bank’s outlook for the future. 
net interest income 
the deposit and lending margins reflect the earnings margin, 
which is calculated as the difference between the interest rate 
towards the customers of spar nord’s local banks and an in-
ternal funding rate based on the bank’s funding costs. 
 
the interest margin is estimated on the basis of current lending 
and borrowing rates and management’s expectations for fu-
ture competition. the pressure on the bank's interest rate mar-
gin is expected to abate, and for the first time in many years 
the interest rate margin is expected to increase from end-2020 
to end-2021, because the negative rate of deposit is expected 
to fall by more than the lending rate. lending activity was 
strongly impacted by the covid-19 crisis in 2020. deferred vat 
payment, holiday allowance disbursement, wage compensa-
tion schemes and the possibility of raising attractive loans from 
the public authorities contributed to a small decline in lending 
in 2020. in 2021, a large part of the covid-19 relief packages 
are expected to be phased out, leading to an increase in lend-
ing. after an increase in 2020, deposits are expected to stabilise 
at the current level. 
net fee income 
the expectations for income from fees, charges and commis-
sions are based on historical data, adjusted to reflect the cur-
rent situation. spar nord expects a small increase in net fee in-
come in 2021. 
market value adjustments 
market value adjustments are expected to be substantially 
lower than in 2020, when there were extraordinarily high market 
value adjustments of both shares and bonds. 
costs and expenses 
expectations as to costs and expenses are based on a projec-
tion of the cost base and anticipated changes in activities as 
well as pay increases according to collective agreements, 
changes in taxes and duties, etc. 
loan impairment 
expectations as to loan impairment are based on the bank’s 
estimate for the next few years. the expectations are based on 
historical data, adjusted to reflect the current situation. loan 
impairment charges are expected to be lower than in 2020. 
cash flow during the terminal period 
cash flow during the terminal period represents earnings in the 
preceding years, growing at a constant rate. growth is pro-
jected at 1.5% (2019: 1.5%) growth has been projected on the 
basis of expectations for macroeconomic growth. 
discount rate 
the discount rate used to calculate the discounted value of fu-
ture cash flows is 9.5% (2019:11.5%) before tax at a tax rate of 
22%.  
after tax, the discount rate is 7.5% (2019: 9.0%)  
the discount rate has been fixed on the basis of a capm model.

sensitivity analysis 
management assesses that probable changes in basic as-
sumptions will not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to ex-
ceed its recoverable amount. 
 
sensitivity analyses show that the goodwill relating to spar 
nord’s local banks is robust to changes in assumptions. 
projections for the budget period mean that 75% of the present 
value of expected cash flows in spar nord’s local banks relates 
to the terminal period (2019: 70%). 
customer relations 
the carrying amount of customer relations recognised in con-
nection with the merger with sparbank amounted to dkk 6 mil-
lion (2019: dkk 9 million).  
the assumptions about fee income etc. and the cost ratio used 
for recognising customer relations have been compared with 
the corresponding realised results. 
the realised results are in line with expectations, for which rea-
son there is no evidence of impairment. 
other intangible assets 
management has not identified factors indicating any need for 
carrying out an impairment test in respect of other intangible 
assets. 
other intangible assets comprise software used by the bank 
and are amortised at the rates stated in the accounting poli-
cies 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
.
 
 property, plant and equipment 
3.7.1 land and buildings 
accounting policies 
properties, with the exception of domicile properties, are rec-
ognised at cost upon acquisition and subsequently measured 
at fair value. borrowing costs from general borrowing or loans 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction 
of qualifying assets (properties) are attributed to the cost of the 
specific individual asset. 
the fair value is calculated on the basis of current market data 
according to an asset return model that includes the property's 
rental income, operating expenses, as well as management and 
maintenance, etc. operating expenses and maintenance costs 
are calculated on the basis of the condition of the individual 
property, construction year, materials used, etc. the fair value 
of the property is determined based on the calculated return on 
its operation and the individually determined rate of return.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the return rate is fixed on the basis of the location of the indi-
vidual property, potential use, the state of maintenance, credit 
quality, etc. the fair value of the individual property is reas-
sessed once a year based on the current market and the inter-
est level. 
an external valuation of all properties has been obtained from 
a real estate agent to support the calculation of fair value, in-
cluding the rental rates and rates of return used.

investment properties 
accounting policies 
investment property is real property, including real property let 
under operating leases and acquired properties, which the 
group owns for the purpose of receiving rent and/or obtaining 
capital gains. 
investment property is not depreciated. 
changes in fair value and rental income are recognised in other 
income.  
 
unrealised fair value adjustment is recognised in the item other 
income in the consolidated financial statements. 
the fair-value method (level 3 in the fair-value hierarchy) has 
been chosen for measuring investment properties. investment 
properties consist mainly of business leases. the periods of non-
terminability for spar nord in the leases do not exceed 20 years.

domicile properties 
accounting policies 
domicile property is real property occupied by spar nord’s ad-
ministrative departments, branches and other service units. 
the carrying amount of domicile property is systematically de-
preciated over the expected useful life of 50 years for buildings. 
special fixtures in buildings are depreciated according to the 
straight-line method over a useful life of 20 years. 
allowance is made for the expected residual value when calcu-
lating depreciation. 
the revaluation of domicile property to fair value is recognised 
in other comprehensive income and allocated to a special re-
serve under equity, revaluation reserves, while depreciation 
and impairment are recognised in the income statement under 
other operating expenses. 
domicile property which, according to a publicly announced 
plan, the group expects to sell within twelve months is recog-
nised as temporary assets.

2020 include domicile property in the amount of dkk 0 million 
(2019: dkk 0 million) regarding a property under construction 
and dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 1 million) regarding refurbishment of 
properties. 
no borrowing costs were recognised in 2020 and 2019. 
the fair value method (level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) has 
been chosen for measuring domicile properties. fair value has 
been determined based on observable prices and other valu-
ation methods. 
the annual review of the bank’s investment and corporate 
properties did not give rise to any significant changes in the re-
quired rates of return. the required rates of return remained 
within the 5.8-9.0% range (2019: 5.8-9.0%) for domicile properties 
and the 5.5-9.0% range (2019: 5.5-9.0%) for investment proper-
ties.

sensitivity analyses 
the most important assumptions when calculating the fair value 
of domicile and investment properties are the required rate of 
return and the rent level. other things being equal, an increase 
of the required rate of return of 0.5 percentage point will reduce 
the fair value by dkk 43 million (2019: dkk 44 million). other 
things being equal, a decrease of the rental level of 5% will re-
duce the fair value by dkk 32 million (2019: dkk 30 million). 
domicile properties, leasing 
accounting policies  
as a lessee, spar nord only has property leases for properties 
used as domicile property from which the bank pursues banking 
activities. the lease activities are presented as part of the 
bank’s land and buildings. 
a lease asset is recognised in the balance sheet when, in ac-
cordance with a lease entered into regarding a specific, identi-
fiable asset, the asset is made available for use by the group 
throughout the lease term and when the group becomes enti-
tled to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the identified asset and entitled to direct the use of the iden-
tified asset. for information on recognition and measurement of 
lease liabilities, please refer to note 3.11.1. 
on initial recognition, the right-of-use asset is measured at 
cost, corresponding to the value of the lease liability, adjusted 
for prepaid lease payments, plus any directly related costs. 
on subsequent recognition, the asset is measured at cost less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment. the lease asset 
is depreciated over the longer of the lease term and the ex-
pected extension option of the lease asset of 4-6 years (see be-
low under lease term). depreciation charges are recognised in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis. 
the lease asset is adjusted for changes in the lease liability as 
described in note 3.11.1. 
the group has decided not to recognise either right-of-use as-
sets of low value or short-term leases in the balance sheet. in-
stead, lease payments are recognised in the income statement 
on a straight-line basis. 
 
 
 
 
 
significant accounting estimates and judgments, 
leasing 
lease term 
the lease term covers the non-cancellable period of the lease 
plus periods comprised by an extension option which spar nord 
reasonably expects to exercise and periods comprised by a ter-
mination option which spar nord reasonably expects not to ex-
ercise. 
a proportion of spar nord’s property leases contain options en-
titling spar nord to extend the lease for another lease term of 
expectedly 4-6 years. on initial recognition of the lease asset, 
spar nord assesses whether it is reasonably probable that it will 
exercise the extension option. this estimate is reassessed upon 
the occurrence of a significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances that is within spar nord’s control.

spar nord annual report 2020 
alternative borrowing rate 
spar nord applies its alternative borrowing rate on discounting 
of the leases to present value. spar nord’s alternative borrow-
ing rate is the cost of raising external financing for a similar as-
set with a financing period equal to the term of the lease in the 
currency in which the lease payments are settled. 
3.7.2 other property, plant and equipment 
accounting policies 
operating equipment in the form of it equipment, vehicles, fur-
niture, fixtures and leasehold improvements are recognised at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. 
the basis of depreciation for property, plant and equipment is 
the difference between cost and residual value at the end of its 
useful life, and the residual value is assessed regularly. 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the 
lease, with a maximum of ten years. 
for other operating equipment, depreciation is made on a 
straight-line basis over the expected useful life of a maximum 
of five years. 
property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if in-
dications of impairment exist. an impaired asset is written down 
to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use. impairment charges are 
recognised in the income statement. 
other property, plant and equipment 
the figures at end-2020 include various fully written-off assets 
used for the spar nord group’s operations. the original pur-
chase price of these assets amounts to dkk 273 million (2019: 
dkk 239 million).

3.7.3 temporary assets 
accounting policies 
temporary assets comprise property, plant and equipment, in-
cluding assets taken over as a result of the liquidation of cus-
tomer exposures, the intention being to sell the assets within 12 
months. assets taken over are recognised at the lower of carry-
ing amount and fair value, less costs to sell. 
assets are not depreciated as from the date they are classified 
as temporary. 
 
 
impairment losses occurring in connection with the initial classi-
fication as “temporary assets”, and gains or losses in relation to 
subsequent measurement at the lower of the carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell are recognised in the income 
statement under the items to which they relate. gains and 
losses are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
assets and related liabilities are recognised separately in the 
balance sheet. 
 
temporary assets comprise properties taken over and leased 
assets in connection with non-performing loans held by spar 
nord. properties expected to be sold within a 12-month period 
according to a published plan are treated as temporary as-
sets. 
leased assets include trucks, agricultural machinery and heavy 
construction machinery. 
properties and leased assets are expected to be disposed of 
within 12 months. 
properties are sold through estate agents, while leased assets 
are sold on the usual marketplace for the individual types of 
assets – primarily by auction or through dealers. 
if, contrary to expectations, the assets are not sold within 12 
months, they are reclassified to investment properties or, as the 
case may be, other property, plant and equipment. 
 
  other assets 
accounting policies 
other assets include capital contributions to bankernes edb 
central a.m.b.a., interest and commissions receivable as well as 
the positive fair value of derivative instruments. 
fair-value measurement of the positive fair value of derivatives 
is described in more detail in the section derivatives in note 
3.3.4. 
other items are measured at amortised cost.

accounting policies 
amounts due to credit institutions and central banks include 
amounts received under repo transactions where the counter-
party is a credit institution or a central bank 
in repo transactions (sale of securities which the group agrees 
to repurchase at a later date), the securities remain in the bal-
ance sheet under securities. the amount received is recognised 
as a liability, and the difference between the offered price and 
the bid price is recognised as interest in the income statement 
over the term of the relevant instrument. the return on the se-
curities are recognised in the income statement. repo transac-
tions are measured at amortised cost. 
 
 
amounts due to credit institutions and central banks are recog-
nised at the raising of a loan at fair value corresponding to the 
consideration received less directly attributable transaction 
costs. amounts due to credit institutions and central banks not 
classified as repo transactions are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. thus, the 
difference between net proceeds and nominal value is recog-
nised in the income statement under interest expenses over the 
loan term.

3.11.1 lease liabilities 
accounting policies 
a lease liability is recognised in the balance sheet when, in ac-
cordance with a lease entered into regarding a specific, identi-
fiable asset, the asset is made available for use by the group 
throughout the lease term and when the group becomes enti-
tled to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the identified asset and entitled to direct the use of the iden-
tified asset.  
for information on recognition and measurement of lease as-
sets, including extension and termination options, please refer 
to note 3.7.1. 
on initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the pre-
sent value of the future lease payments, including extension 
and termination options, discounted using an alternative inter-
est rate for charging an asset that provides similar security. the 
lease liability is calculated on the basis of fixed lease payments.
 
 
the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the ef-
fective interest rate method. the lease liability is remeasured 
when there is a specific change in the underlying contractual 
cash flows. 
the lease liability is presented under other liabilities. 
spar nord has opted to omit recognising short-term leases in 
the balance sheet if the lease term at the date of contract is 12 
months or less or if it is a low-value asset. 
instead, lease payments are recognised in the income state-
ment on a straight-line basis.

 deferred tax 
accounting policies 
current tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recog-
nised in the balance sheet as estimated tax on the taxable in-
come for the year, adjusted for tax on prior years’ taxable in-
come and for tax paid under the on-account tax scheme. 
deferred tax is measured in accordance with the balance sheet 
liability method on all temporary differences between the car-
rying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. how-
ever, no deferred tax is recognised on timing differences re-
garding non-deductible goodwill and other items for which tim-
ing differences have arisen at the acquisition date without af-
fecting the financial results or taxable income. in cases where 
the tax base may be computed according to several sets of tax 
regulations, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the in-
tended use of the asset or settlement of the liability planned by 
management. 
deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet under deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the basis of expected 
tax rates. 
 
 
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-
forwards, are recognised under deferred tax assets at the ex-
pected value of their utilisation, either as a set-off against tax 
on future income or as a set-off against deferred tax liabilities 
within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. 
deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are offset if the enterprise 
has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax liabilities 
and tax assets or intends either to settle current tax liabilities 
and tax assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously. 
adjustment is made to deferred tax relating to eliminations of 
unrealised intra-group profits and losses. deferred tax is meas-
ured on the basis of the tax regulations and rates that, accord-
ing to the rules in force at the balance sheet date, will apply at 
the time the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current 
tax. changes in deferred tax resulting from changes in tax rates 
are recognised in the income statement.

 provisions 
accounting policies 
provisions include mainly guarantee commitments, provisions 
for losses on unutilised credit lines and loan commitments, legal 
actions and any restructuring costs, etc. restructuring costs are 
recognised as liabilities, provided that a detailed, formal re-
structuring plan is available at the reporting date. a provision is 
recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists and 
when it is probable that the obligation will become effective 
and it can be measured reliably.
 
 
 
 
provisions are based on management’s best estimate of the 
amount of the commitments. in the measurement of provisions, 
the costs required to settle the liability are discounted if such 
discounting would have a material effect on the financial state-
ments. 
see note 5.1 for an explanation and specification of provision for 
losses on guarantees and unutilised credit lines.

 capital management 
spar nord’s objectives of capital management are: 
• to comply with the statutory requirements regarding capital 
adequacy; 
• to ensure that spar nord will at all times have adequate cap-
ital to support future activities and growth; and 
• to maintain a relatively high common equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio 
and thus keep the dependency on subordinated debt at a 
moderate level. 
during the year under review, spar nord met all statutory cap-
ital adequacy ratios. 
since early 2019, spar nord has pursued the following capital 
targets: 
• a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 13.5% 
• an own funds ratio of 17.5%  
under its dividend policy, spar nord aims to distribute 30-50% 
of the net profit for the year as dividends 
among other things, the capital targets have been fixed to en-
sure that the bank maintains adequate own funds to be able 
to continue its lending operations during periods of difficult 
market conditions (such as deep economic recession or unex-
pectedly heavy credit losses). 
during the year under review, spar nord’s common equity tier 1 
(cet1) ratio ranged from 15.3-17.2% (2019: 13.8-14.6%) and thus 
exceeded spar nord’s internal target for the period of 13.5%. 
correspondingly, the internal target of an own funds ratio of 
17.5% has been met, as it remained within the 19.0-21.0% band 
during the year (2019: 17.6-18.5%). 
capital management is based on the methods of accounting 
and financial ratios developed by the basel committee, which 
have been incorporated into danish legislation. management 
currently monitors the bank’s capital adequacy. the figures cal-
culated at the end of each quarter for spar nord’s own funds, 
total risk exposure amount and capital adequacy ratios, in-
cluding the calculation of the bank’s solvency need ratio, are 
reported to the danish fsa in accordance with existing rules. 
 
spar nord’s individual solvency need is an expression of its own 
assessment as to how high the total capital ratio should be to 
safeguard depositors against losses. since the end of 2012, 
spar nord has based the calculation of its individual solvency 
need on the so-called 8+ approach. this approach is based on 
the statutory minimum requirement of 8.0% of the total risk ex-
posure amount (pillar i) plus add-ons for risks and matters not 
fully reflected in the calculation of total risk exposure amount. 
thus, it is assumed that ordinary risks are covered by the 8% 
requirement, and that it must therefore be determined which 
additional risks spar nord may have that warrant an add-on to 
the capital requirement (pillar ii); see the guidelines from the 
danish fsa in this respect. 
spar nord’s common equity tier 1 capital consists of its share 
capital, proposed dividends and retained earnings. additional 
tier 1 (at1) capital and tier 2 capital (t2) in the form of subordi-
nated debt are included in the calculation of spar nord’s own 
funds. a number of deductions are made in connection with 
calculating spar nord’s common equity tier 1 capital, consisting 
primarily of proposed dividends, intangible assets and equity 
investments in other credit institutions. 
the total risk exposure is the calculated risk associated with 
spar nord’s business areas. total risk exposure is calculated as 
follows: assets, items subject to a market risk, and exposures in 
the form of guarantees are weighted on the basis of standard 
weights that depend on the type of the individual items and 
counterparty, with due provision being made for any collateral 
provided. to this should be added a supplement to cover spar 
nord’s operational risks. 
note 4.2 provides more details about the capital requirement. 
the maturity profile for spar nord’s subordinated debt is shown 
in note 4.7. 
spar nord continuously assesses the need for adapting the 
capital structure, including its goals, policies and processes.

accounting policies 
revaluation reserves 
revaluation reserves comprise revaluations of spar nord’s 
domicile property after the recognition of deferred tax. the re-
serve is dissolved when properties are impaired, sold or other-
wise disposed of. 
statutory reserves 
statutory reserves comprise value adjustments of investments 
in associates and group enterprises according to the equity 
method. the reserves are reduced by the dividends distributed 
to the parent company and other movements in the equity of 
group enterprises and associates, or if the investments are re-
alised in whole or in part. 
proposed dividend 
proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of 
adoption at the annual general meeting (the declaration date). 
dividend proposed to be distributed for the year is included un-
der equity until adoption of the dividend proposal. in accord-
ance with the bank’s dividend policy, spar nord aims to distrib-
ute 30-50% (2019: 40-50%) of the net profit for the year as ordi-
nary dividends with due consideration to meeting the bank’s 
capital targets. 
 
 
treasury shares and own bonds 
treasury shares and own bonds are not recognised as assets. 
cost and selling prices of treasury shares as well as dividends 
are recognised directly in retained earnings under equity. cap-
ital reduction by cancellation of treasury shares will lower the 
share capital by an amount equal to the nominal value of the 
investments at the time of registration of the capital reduction. 
the acquisition of own bonds is recognised directly in subordi-
nated debt. upon the acquisition of own bonds, any loss or gain 
is recognised in the income statement as the difference be-
tween the acquisition cost and the carrying amount of the lia-
bility.

capital 
spar nord annual report 2020 
 earnings per share for the year 
 
 
 
earnings per share for the year have been calculated as if the 
additional tier 1 (at1) capital were treated as a liability, which 
means that the calculation of the financial ratio has been 
based on the shareholders’ share of profit and equity. the 
shareholders’ share of profit and equity appears from the 
statement of changes in equity. 
 additional tier 1 (at1) capital 
accounting policies 
additional tier 1 (at1) capital issued with a perpetual term and 
without a contractual obligation to make repayments of princi-
pal and pay interest (additional tier 1 capital under crr) does 
not fulfil the conditions for being classified as a financial liability 
according to ias 32. therefore, any such issue of additional tier 
1 (at1) capital is considered equity. 
the net amount at the time of issue is recognised as an increase 
in equity. the payment of interest is treated as dividend and 
recognised directly in equity at the time when the liability arises.
 
 
 
 
 
upon spar nord’ redemption of the bonds, the equity will be re-
duced by the redemption amount at the time of redemption. 
cost and selling prices on the purchase and sale of additional 
tier 1 (at1) capital under crr are recognised directly in equity in 
the same way as the portfolio of treasury shares.

 subordinated debt 
accounting policies 
subordinated debt are liabilities in the form of tier 2 capital and 
other capital contributions which, in the event of the company’s 
voluntary or compulsory winding up, will not be repaid until after 
the claims of ordinary creditors have been met. 
subordinated debt is recognised at the raising of a loan at fair 
value less directly attributable external transaction costs. sub-
sequently, subordinated debt is measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. 
 
for further information on the issuing of additional tier 1 capital 
under crr, see note 4.6. 
 
 
early redemption of subordinated debt is subject to the ap-
proval of the danish fsa. subordinated debt is included in own 
funds, etc. pursuant to the danish financial business act.

 issued bonds at amortised cost 
accounting policies 
issued bonds at amortised cost comprise non-preferred senior 
debt issued to comply with the mrel requirement for sifi insti-
tutions. 
issued bonds are recognised on issuance at fair value less di-
rectly attributable external transaction costs. subsequently, is-
sued bonds are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.

5 risk management 
spar nord is exposed to a number of risks in various categories. 
the most important categories of risks are as follows: 
• credit risk: the risk of losses because counterparties fail to 
meet all or part of their payment obligations. 
• market risk: the risk of loss because the fair value of spar 
nord’s assets and liabilities varies with changes in market 
conditions. 
• liquidity risk: the risk of loss because spar nord cannot meet 
its payment obligations via the ordinary liquidity reserves. 
• operational risk: the risk of financial loss owing to deficient 
or erroneous internal procedures and processes, human or 
system errors, or losses as a result of external events. 
 
the following notes to the annual report contain qualitative 
and quantitative information regarding spar nord’s credit, 
market, liquidity and operational risks. 
for more details, please refer to the unaudited risk report at 
www.sparnord.com/risk. 
 
 
 
 credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of borrowers or other 
counterparties defaulting on their payment obligations, includ-
ing the risks attaching to customers in financial difficulty, risks 
relating to large exposures, concentration risks and risks at-
taching to granted, unutilised credit lines. 
in 2020, spar nord made no major changes in assumptions, ob-
jectives, exposures and calculation methods, etc. as compared 
to the year before.

overall comments on credit risk 
loan impairment etc. was an expense of dkk 309 million, 
against an expense of dkk 22 million in 2019. 
the covid-19 pandemic was the dominant theme of 2020, and 
one which had a strong impact on impairment charges for the 
year. in 2020, spar nord made a model-supported manage-
ment estimate relating to covid-19 of dkk 320 million. because 
of the financial relief packages, the covid-19 crisis alone only 
caused moderate losses in 2020. however, a high level of un-
certainty still attaches to the longer-term societal effects and 
consequences of the crisis, and especially the implications for 
spar nord’s business customers. 
at end-2020, spar nord’s total management estimates 
amounted to dkk 570 million, of which dkk 320 million related 
to covid-19 as the largest single item. of this amount, dkk 130 
million is attributable to retail customers and dkk 190 million to 
business customers. the remaining amount of dkk 250 million 
breaks down into dkk 147 million attributable to land prices in 
the agricultural sector and dkk 103 million relating to model un-
certainty. 
the dkk 309 million impact on profits breaks down into dkk 250 
million attributable to business customers ex. agricultural cus-
tomers, dkk -74 million to agricultural customers, dkk 124 million 
to retail customers and dkk 9 million to customers in the  
sparxpres consumer loan business.

5.1.1 accounting policies, credit policy, 
management, monitoring and reporting 
accounting policies 
 
impairment model 
spar nord recognises a provision for expected credit losses 
pursuant to ifrs 9 for all financial assets recognised at amor-
tised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
lease receivables and certain loan commitments and financial 
guarantees. for financial assets recognised at amortised cost, 
the impairment for expected credit losses is recognised in the 
income statement and set off against the asset in the balance 
sheet. provisions for unutilised credit lines and loan commit-
ments and financial guarantees are stated at expected credit 
losses in the income statement and recognised as a liability. 
the above impairment model implies that provisions must be 
recognised on all spar nord’s financial assets measured at 
amortised cost and certain loan commitments and financial 
guarantees based on statistically expected credit losses  (“ex-
pected loss” model). losses caused by regulation of a financial 
asset will be considered as having been written off. 
under the expected loss model, on initial recognition, a loss al-
lowance will be recognised in an amount equivalent to the 12-
month expected credit losses (stage 1). if, on measurement sub-
sequent to initial recognition, the credit risk increases signifi-
cantly, a loss allowance will be recognised in an amount equiv-
alent to the lifetime expected credit losses of the exposure 
(stage 2). where it is established that the exposure is credit-
impaired (stage 3), a loss allowance will be recognised in an 
amount equivalent to the lifetime expected credit losses of the 
exposure, while revenue will be recognised in the income state-
ment using the effective interest method relative to the recog-
nised impairment loss. 
the classification into stages and the calculation of expected 
credit losses are largely based on spar nord’s rating models. 
the expected credit loss is measured for each facility. impair-
ment models support the calculation of expected credit losses 
based on loss ratios and the concepts of pd (probability-of-
default), lgd (loss-given-default) and ead (exposure-at-de-
fault). 
the calculation of the expected credit losses on exposures in 
stages 1 and 2 is based on a model calculation, whereas the 
calculation in respect of exposures from the weak part of stage 
2 as well as stage 3 exposures is made as a combination of an 
individual assessment and a modal calculation. for customer 
groups with total exposures exceeding dkk 500,000, the bank 
performs an individual assessment of the expected credit 
losses and the pertaining probabilities. for customer groups 
with total exposures below dkk 500,000, model-based calcu-
lations will be used. the model calculation is based on the 
bank’s model, which has been part of the basis for spar nord’s 
credit control for a number of years, supplemented by a mac-
roeconomic module, which adjusts the calculated pd values. a 
smaller, delimited portfolio is classified as being exposed to low 
credit risk. exposures to these customers are maintained in 
stage 1. 
substantial increase in risk 
on transition from stage 1 to stage 2, a substantial increase in 
the credit risk is defined as follows: 
• a 100% increase in the pd for the expected remaining life of 
the exposure and a 0.5% point increase in the 12-month pd 
where the 12-month pd was below 1.0% on initial recognition. 
• a 100% increase in the pd for the expected remaining life of 
the exposure or a 2.0% point increase in the 12-month pd 
where the 12-month pd was 1.0% or higher on initial recogni-
tion. 
• if the exposure has been in arrears for more than 30 days. 
 
 
 
 
exposures with a substantial increase in the credit risk belong-
ing to customers whose ability to pay shows considerable signs 
of weakness will be categorised as the weak part of stage 2. a 
customer’s ability to pay in this category is defined as a 12-
month pd that exceeds 5.0%. 
improvement of credit risk 
if the exposure that has been in arrears for more than 30 days 
ceases to exist or the customers’ pd level is subsequently im-
proved (see above with respect to time of initial recognition), it 
will no longer be considered a significant increase in credit risk, 
and the exposure will be transferred back to stage 1. 
overall monitoring of spar nord’s credit risk exposure is man-
aged by the risk function. risk monitoring oversees changes in 
the credit quality of all exposures and undertakes systematic 
credit quality control of the credit portfolio. a “weak list” for 
high-risk customers is used for credit control purposes. if a cus-
tomer is marked “weak”, the customer’s pd will be adversely af-
fected. similarly, the customer’s pd will be positively affected if 
the “weak” marking is removed again.  
transition to stage 3 (credit impairment) 
if one of the customer's exposures is believed to be credit-im-
paired, all exposures of the customer in question will be trans-
ferred from stage 1 or 2 to stage 3. the criteria for credit impair-
ment are determined on the basis of the bank’s credit manage-
ment and credit policy. generally, the criteria for business cus-
tomers will be significant breach of contract or likely bank-
ruptcy, while for retail customers they will include major nega-
tive events. 
a customer’s exposure is considered to be in default, for exam-
ple if: 
• there are credit-impaired exposures, and the customer is not 
considered to be able to settle its credit liabilities as calcu-
lated in the most likely scenario; 
• for retail customers in case of a negative change in in-
come, insufficient disposable income, listing in the danish 
credit information agency rki, material tax debt or sub-
stantial consumer loans; 
• for business customers in case of negative results and 
negative equity, substantial negative equity or conversion 
of debt to subordinated capital; 
• for agricultural customers in case of a negative change in 
income, substantial negative equity or non-compliance 
with the bank’s requirements for break-even and solvency; 
• the payment obligations have been put on hold, or signifi-
cantly relaxed terms have been granted with respect to in-
terest rate, repayment profile or respite due to the cus-
tomer’s critical financial situation; or 
• the customer’s exposure for a long period of time (at least 90 
days) has been in arrears or overdrawn. 
if none of the customer’s exposures are considered to be in de-
fault any longer, each exposure will again be considered indi-
vidually. subsequently, the exposures will be assessed relative 
to a substantial increase in credit risk and subsequently place 
in stage 1 and  2 using the stage motor in the bank’s impairment 
model.

the criteria for definition of default are determined on the basis 
of the bank’s credit management and credit policy. 
if none of the customer’s exposures are considered to be in de-
fault any longer, each exposure will again be considered indi-
vidually. subsequently, the exposures will be assessed relative 
to a substantial increase in credit risk and subsequently place 
in stage 1 and  2 via using the model’s stage motor. 
prospective information 
the model calculation of the expected loss is structured around 
a number of regression models determining the historical cor-
relation between default and a number of explanatory macro-
economic variables relating to the various segments (retail, cor-
porate and agriculture) in the impairment calculation. 
the following economic indicators are applied: 
• retail customers: house price developments and mortgage 
rates. 
• business customers: sme confidence indicator and industrial 
confidence indicator. 
• agriculture: ratio of milk and pork prices to feed prices and 
price trend for slaughter pigs and milk. 
the model calculation of expected losses is based, among 
other things, on the most likely scenario (base case), and worst 
and best case scenarios are also set up applying a more critical 
and a more positive approach, respectively, to macroeconomic 
developments in the coming years than in the base case sce-
nario. a calculation is made for each of the three scenarios and 
subsequently a total weighted calculation of the expected loss 
based on an assessment of the probability of each scenario. 
the weighting of the various scenarios is calculated on the ba-
sis of the ratio between actual and potential gdp. the current 
scenario weights are 85% in base case, 5% in best case and 10% 
in worst case. 
the assessment of the probability for each scenario is made 
using macroeconomic variables and approved by the credit 
committee in consultation with the relevant specialists. 
scenario sensitivity 
if either best-case or worst-case from the model calculation 
and the individual impairment calculations are exclusively ap-
plied, it would result in the following impairment distribution be-
tween the stages:

the total current impairment amount is used as index 100. best-
case would reduce impairment by dkk 253 million, while worst-
case would increase impairment by dkk 493 million. the calcu-
lation does not take into account any customers wishing to shift 
between model and individual calculations in the best and the 
worst case, respectively.  
as a supplement to the ifrs 9 calculations, spar nord has rec-
ognised an impairment charge in the form of a management 
estimate of dkk 320 million due to the extraordinary covid-19 
situation. the estimate was made on the basis of a macroeco-
nomic impairment model that estimates total expensed impair-
ment based on a historical correlation to selected macroeco-
nomic variables.  
spar nord does not have substantial exposure to individual in-
dustries that are particularly challenged by the covid-19 pan-
demic. 
with respect to the management estimate for land prices, the 
price per hectare used is dkk 15 thousand lower than the danish 
fsa’s recommended land prices. the estimate has been calcu-
lated at dkk 147 million. if the calculation had instead been 
made with a change of dkk 10 thousand per hectare, the esti-
mate would have been dkk 99 million. 
developments in management estimates are shown in note 
5.1.7. 
credit losses 
the lifetime expected credit losses cover the expected remain-
ing lifetime of the facility. for most facilities, the expected life-
time is limited to the remaining contractual maturity, however, 
capped at five years. for facilities comprising both a loan and 
an undrawn loan commitment, spar nord’s exposure to credit 
losses is not limited to the contractual notice period. for such 
facilities, the expected lifetime is assumed to be the period dur-
ing which spar nord expects to be exposed to credit losses. for 
facilities, for which the expected lifetime is longer than the re-
maining contractual maturity, an expected maturity of one year 
has been applied. this includes for example credit cards and 
overdraft facilities. 
write-off policy 
all write-offs are performed by the debt collection department. 
when the exposure is handed over to debt collection, they as-
sess any need for write-off or interim write-off on the unsecured 
part of the exposure. exposures covered by collateral will re-
main on a zero-interest account until the collateral has been 
realised, and the final loss/write-off has been assessed. 
credit policy 
spar nord’s overall credit risk is controlled on the basis of its 
credit policy, which the board of directors determines in con-
junction with the general policies and frameworks for risk as-
sumption. the pivotal objective of spar nord’s credit policy is to 
ensure that earnings and risks are balanced, and that the as-
sumption of risk is always quantified. 
it is spar nord’s policy that credit must always be granted on 
the basis of insight into the customer’s financial position and 
that credit quality – the customer’s ability and intention to meet 
current and future obligations – is a key parameter in all cus-
tomer relations. for purposes of assessing creditworthiness, the 
bank applies statistical rating models which risk-classify its cus-
tomers. 
spar nord aims to develop long-term relationships with cus-
tomers and does not want to use risk tolerance as a competi-
tive parameter. 
spar nord only wants to conclude transactions that conform to 
good banking practice and do not jeopardise the bank’s repu-
tation or professional profile. 
the bank includes climate considerations and sustainability in 
its assessment of business customers in particular. businesses 
with a high climate impact face special market terms and con-
ditions, more stringent regulatory requirements and an in-
creased requirement to invest in climate measures. climate 
challenges may affect the robustness of a business and will po-
tentially impair its earnings capacity and growth opportunities. 
other things being equal, this could limit the creditworthiness of 
a business. companies with an environmentally sustainable 
profile are estimated to have a far better foundation for tack-
ling the challenges imposed by rising climate considerations. 
109 
section 5 
risk management 
spar nord annual report 2020 
the bank considers a satisfactory climate profile a favourable 
component in its credit assessment. 
as a basic rule, spar nord does not grant loans and credit fa-
cilities based on collateral alone. thus, the customer should 
show the intention and have the ability to repay loans without 
spar nord having to realise the collateral. 
in order not to lose its freedom of action towards a customer, 
the bank generally aims not to increase its exposure towards a 
customer to such an extent that the customer would not be 
creditworthy in other banks. 
exposure caps have been determined on the basis of the fol-
lowing rules: 
• exposure is capped at dkk 750 million for exposure groups 
within the same legal entity with more stringent requirements 
for collateral to secure exposure amounts exceeding dkk 
500 million. the unsecured share in the exposure group must 
not exceed dkk 250 million. 
• exposure is capped at dkk 1 billion for exposure groups con-
sisting of customers who, financially, legally and in terms of 
risk, are independent of each other and are only affiliated 
because of a common administrative body. the unsecured 
share in the exposure group must not exceed dkk 250 million, 
and individual exposures in the group must not exceed the 
limits set out above. 
• for unrated customers subject to supervision by the danish 
fsa, exposure is capped at dkk 1 billion. 
in determining the amount of exposure, generally accepted 
credit risk adjustments are made, as appears from the section 
regarding large exposures in the crr regulation. the statutory 
limitations apply to trading partners in the financial sector with 
an external credit rating at investment grade level. for other 
trading partners in the financial sector, an internally-fixed cap 
of dkk 700 million applies. 
on the basis of the breakdown of the bank’s loans and ad-
vances guarantees by industry, targets for the maximum distri-
bution within selected industries are shown below. the maxi-
mum figures stated serve to ensure that the bank maintains a 
strongly diversified customer portfolio and prevents large con-
centration risks in individual industries. 
the bank pursues the policy that business customers’ share of 
total loans and advances guarantees cannot exceed 70% of 
the bank’s total loans, advances and guarantees excl. reverse 
lending. 
this means the bank has set a minimum limit of 30% for retail 
customers’ share of the bank’s total loans and advances guar-
antees. the bank has no upper limit for retail customers’ share 
of total loans, advances and guarantees because a high pro-
portion of loans to retail customers is considered a strength in 
terms of credit.

finally, in its credit policy spar nord has stipulated that it wants 
insight into any commitments that its customers may have to-
wards other financial institutions. 
management, monitoring and reporting 
although spar nord’s business model is characterised by de-
centralised decision-making powers, the credit process is man-
aged centrally. 
as concerns new customers, the facility authorisation right is 
generally half of that for existing customers. the powers of au-
thority in the credit area are governed by two factors: 
• the individual local managers’ ability and requirements with 
respect to customer base. 
• the wish that a certain share of authorisations from the local 
banks is always dealt with by credit rating. 
decentralised facility authorisation rights are maximised at dkk 
10 million for existing customers. 
customer advisers, where relevant in consultation with relation-
ship managers in retail and business banking, handle the day-
to-day management of spar nord’s credit risks. if a credit fa-
cility exceeds the local loan approval limits, it will be passed on 
and dealt with by credit rating, the credit committee or the 
board of directors. credit rating may authorise credit lines up 
to dkk 50 million for existing customers and dkk 25 million for 
new customers. in addition, the credit committee may author-
ise credit lines up to dkk 100 million for existing customers and 
up to dkk 50 million for new customers. exposures exceeding 
dkk 100 million for existing customers and exposures exceeding 
dkk 50 million for new customers are subject to approval by the 
board of directors. however, the credit committee may au-
thorise credit facility extensions of up to dkk 50 million relative 
to the most recent authorisation given by the board of direc-
tors. 
overall monitoring of spar nord’s credit risk exposure is man-
aged by risk management, which oversees changes in the 
credit quality of all exposures and undertakes systematic credit 
quality control of the credit portfolio. 
new retail customer exposures in excess of dkk 100,000 and 
business customer exposures in excess of dkk 300,000 are sys-
tematically screened with a view to being selected for a manual 
credit quality assessment. the selection is made on the basis of 
a combination of risk parameters, which combined, or sepa-
rately, indicate an increased level of risk. new customers with 
weak credit quality are registered on an ongoing basis. 
spar nord has developed it tools for controlling and monitoring 
credit risks. spar nord’s credit analysis system is used for moni-
toring purposes, and key data regarding credit exposures and 
customers’ financial affairs are recorded in the system. this is 
done to detect danger signals at an early stage and also to 
monitor changes in the credit quality of portfolios and organi-
sational units.  
the bank’s rating system regularly calculates a statistically 
based rating of both retail and business customers. this 
monthly updated rating, possibly combined with an “applica-
tion score” for new customers, is included in the decentralised 
credit assessment of the individual loan case, and together with 
other parameters it decides the extent of the decentralised au-
thorisation power. customers in the rating categories accorded 
the least risk exposure are more likely to be given higher credit 
limits or extensions than those with the greatest risk exposure. 
the risk categorisation based on ratings is also used in early 
warning processes, in the bank’s impairment processes (ifrs 9), 
for managing overdrafts and for pricing purposes to help en-
sure a correlation between the risk assumed by the customer 
and the price paid. 
the bank’s rating system risk-classifies all non-defaulting cus-
tomers into “rating categories” according to the probability 
that the individual customer defaults within the next 12 months. 
the probability of default is estimated on the basis of statistical 
models adapted to the individual customer segment. on the 
110 
section 5 
risk management 
spar nord annual report 2020 
basis of this probability, customers are classified into rating 
categories from 1 to 8, with category 8 containing customers 
with the highest risk of default. customers with objective evi-
dence of impairment (oei) but without a need for impairment 
are placed in rating category 9, while oei customers with a 
need for impairment and other customers in default are placed 
in rating category 11. 
the model applied to business customers employs three com-
ponents: an accounting component used to risk-classify the 
customer based on its most recent financial statements. a “be-
havioural component” that classifies the customer based on its 
account behaviour and exposure/credit history. these compo-
nents classify/rank customers according to probability of de-
fault. finally, the risk level is adjusted relative to current/ex-
pected cyclical developments via the third component – the 
“cyclical component”. 
new business customers are classified based on the account-
ing component and the cyclical component during the first sixth 
months, after which time the behavioural component is also 
applied in the overall rating. 
for retail customers, the model is exclusively based on a be-
havioural component and a cyclical component. 
new retail customers are risk-classified according to an appli-
cation scoring model that is based on classical credit perfor-
mance indicators, such as assets, pay, disposable income, etc. 
this model is based on a combination of a statistical and an 
expert model. after six months, when a record of customer be-
haviour towards the bank has been established, customers are 
subjected to behavioural scoring scrutiny. 
in addition to the above-mentioned models, spar nord applies 
a qualitative risk classification, in which the spar nord adviser 
flags the credit quality as weak if a customer shows signs of 
default risk. for retail customers, these signs of default risk may 
for instance be divorce, unemployment, etc., and for business 
customers they could be marketing difficulties, the loss of key 
employees or suppliers, etc. the flagging of weak credit quality 
is assessed and made as soon as it is considered likely that the 
customer will become financially challenged, which is thus often 
before the situation is discernible in data for the statistically 
based models. customers flagged as having a weak credit 
quality are reviewed at least once a year. 
if a retail customer is flagged as having a weak credit quality 
but is not in default, the customer will automatically be down-
graded by one rating category; it should be noted that a cus-
tomer flagged as having a weak credit quality can never qualify 
for rating in the best rating categories (1 and 2). 
business customers are divided into two categories, customers 
flagged as having a weak credit quality and customers not 
flagged, and rated using two different models. while both 
models are based on the same components, the result of the 
rating calculation in the model for customers flagged as having 
a weak credit quality will typically lead to a lower rating. 
if the adviser or another person believes that the rating of a 
major business customer does not reflect their true creditwor-
thiness, for example due to inefficiencies in the data or other-
wise, a process will be identified to evaluate and, where rele-
vant, change the “rating” (rating override). 
risk classification – rating categories 
as a component of spar nord’s credit processing, all non-de-
faulting customers are risk-classified according to the proba-
bility that the individual customer defaults within the next 12 
months. customers are divided into categories 1 to 9, with cat-
egory 9 containing customers subject to the highest risk. the 
probability of default is estimated statistically by means of spar 
nord’s rating systems which are based on various models for 
the different customer segments. 
the model applied to business customers employs three com-
ponents: an accounting component used to risk-classify the 
customer based on its most recent financial statements. a be-
havioural component that classifies the customer based on its 
account behaviour and credit authorisation history. the third 
component is a cyclical component used to adjust the classifi-
cation based on cyclical trends. 
new business customers are classified based on the account-
ing component and the cyclical component until the sixth 
month, after which time the behavioural component is also ap-
plied. 
for retail customers, the model is exclusively based on a be-
havioural component and a cyclical component. 
new retail customers are risk-classified according to an appli-
cation scoring model that is based on classical credit perfor-
mance indicators, such as assets, pay, disposable income, etc. 
this model is based on a combination of a statistical and an 
expert model. after six months, customers are subjected to a 
behavioural scoring scrutiny, and the results obtained using the 
two models are co-weighted in the transitional period until the 
twelfth month, after which the rating is based on the behav-
ioural component exclusively.  
for both retail and business customers, the behavioural score is 
based on information about factors like overdrafts, number of 
increases and leverage. in the accounting-based credit score 
for business customers, inputs include information on return on 
assets, solvency ratio and debt figures.

gross credit exposure relating to loans, advances and guarantees  
excl. reverse repo transactions and sparxpres by geography 
 
 
 
spar nord’s credit portfolio is considered to have an excellent geographical spread.  
at end-2020, the north denmark region accounted for 29.8% of spar nord’s total loans, 
 advances and guarantees, while the balance is spread over the other regions in denmark. 
 
5.1.3 spar nord’s exposure by customer portfolios 
spar nord’s total loans, advances and guarantees before off-
setting impairment were dkk 69.6 billion at end-2020, which is 
dkk 2.0 billion higher than in 2019. 
reverse repo loans increased by dkk 1.7 billion to dkk 9.8 billion 
at end-2020. 
in addition, the bank’s loans and advances fell dkk 0.5 billion to 
dkk 44.1 billion at end-2020, corresponding to lending growth 
of -1.1% in 2020. 
furthermore, guarantees rose by dkk 0.8 billion to stand at dkk 
15.6 billion at 31 december 2020. 
customers are categorised into five groups as part of the on-
going risk monitoring: 1) retail customers – local banks, 2) busi-
ness customers – local banks, 3) public-sector customers, 4) fi-
nancial customers and 5) spar nord leasing.  
the development in these customer groups appears from the 
figure.

retail customers with spar nord's local banks 
the total credit exposure to retail customers at spar nord’s lo-
cal banks amounted to dkk 28.4 billion at end-2020 compared 
with dkk 26.6 billion at end-2019. the credit exposure to retail 
customers amounts to 40.9% of spar nord’s total credit expo-
sure. as appears from the figure below, the average credit 
quality of retail customers has developed favourably over the 
past few years and is currently at a very satisfactory level. 
retail customers’ unauthorised overdrafts and past due expo-
sures were at a low level from 2018-2020, showing a declining 
trend. after the transition to ifrs 9, there is an ever-increasing 
focus on the treatment of unauthorised overdrafts and arrears. 
in the period from 2018 to 2020, there was an improvement in 
retail customer credit quality.

business customers with spar nord's local banks 
the total credit exposure to business customers at spar nord’s 
local banks amounted to dkk 24.3 billion at end-2020 com-
pared with dkk 26.4 billion at end-2019. 
the credit exposure to business customers amounted to 35.0% 
of spar nord’s total credit exposure. 
the bank’s rating model for business customers includes a busi-
ness cycle model, which has shown instability in specific varia-
bles (“consumption expectations”). 
these consumption expectations have to a large extent con-
tributed to a negative development in business customers’ av-
erage credit quality during the past year. 
the bank is monitoring developments and has made a man-
agement estimate to address the uncertainty. 
business customers’ unauthorised overdrafts and past due ex-
posures remained at a stable, low level of below 0.3% in the pe-
riod from 2018 to 2020.

leasing activities 
spar nord’s total credit exposure in the leasing area amounted 
to dkk 5.5 billion at end-2020, which is dkk 0.8 billion, or 15.7%, 
more than at end-2019. credit exposure in the leasing area 
equals 8.0% of spar nord’s total loans, advances and guaran-
tees. 
the volume of repossessed leasing equipment remains at a very 
low level below 0.1% of leasing loans. 
in the context of risks, it is important to note that leasing lending 
is always backed by security in the assets, either through 
charges or ownership.

as appears from the figures, the average credit quality of agri-
cultural customers improved during 2020. the positive develop-
ment was attributable to a decrease in the default rating cat-
egory for agricultural customers. 
the impact on profits from impairment of agricultural loans 
amounted to an income of dkk 74 million in 2020 compared 
with an income of dkk 59 million in 2019. 
earnings in the agricultural sector were generally satisfactory in 
2020. during the past few years, milk prices have been quite 
stable, providing acceptable earnings to dairy farmers. grain 
prices have moved slightly lower to the benefit of feed purchas-
ers but to the detriment of arable farmers, who should expect 
slightly lower sales prices. on the other hands, yields have also 
been slightly better than average. 
while still at acceptable levels, pork prices have fallen from rec-
ord-high levels due to the outbreak of african swine fever in 
germany. at the same time, the covid-19 pandemic has af-
fected all industries, and mink farmers in particular. 
the mink industry was already suffering from low settlement 
prices, and the outbreak of covid-19 in china, which is a very 
larger importer of mink fur, pushed prices even lower. on top of 
this comes the covid-19-related culling of all mink in denmark, 
which will, at least temporarily, close down all mink production. 
after the end of the financial year, the danish government has 
entered into an agreement on compensation for the danish 
mink industry. however, the bank only has limited exposure to 
the industry. 
spar nord’s total impairment of agricultural loans amounted to 
dkk 334 million at end-2020, equal to 11.1% of spar nord’s total 
loans, advances and guarantees to the industry. at 31 decem-
ber 2019, the corresponding figures were dkk 413 billion and 
14.7%. 
 
the figures show spar nord’s agricultural loans and impairment 
related to agricultural exposures, broken down by production 
lines.

spar nord annual report 2020 
mink farmers and a small increase in exposure to arable farm-
ers. 
spar nord pursues the principle that if agricultural customers 
with a weak capital position fail to deliver positive returns at the 
breakeven prices fixed by spar nord of dkk 9.50/kg (without 
supplementary payment) for pork, and dkk 2.20/kg for milk 
(without supplementary payment), this is defined as oei. break-
even prices are calculated based on financing at a 4% average 
interest rate for all the interest-bearing debt except for mort-
gage debt, for which the interest rate is fixed using fixed-rate 
bonds loans with long maturities. if these breakeven prices can-
not be achieved in financial statements and budgets, the ex-
posure will be subjected to an impairment calculation. 
spar nord anticipates that conditions for milk farmers will re-
main unchanged in 2021 compared with 2020. for pig farmers, 
earnings are expected to be slightly lower, but still at accepta-
ble levels. figures for both production lines are subject to un-
certainty due to covid-19 and for pig farmers also the spread 
of african swine fever. 
spar nord’s calculation of collateral values of agricultural prop-
erties is in accordance with the danish fsa’s most recent guide-
lines, which means that the land values in spar nord’s market 
area range between dkk 125,000 and dkk 160,000 per hectare. 
farm buildings are assessed in relation to their age, condition, 
etc. and are measured at fair value.  
other agricultural assets such as livestock, stocks, equipment, 
etc. are recognised at 80% of their carrying amount. 
a 5% haircut is applied to all of the above-mentioned values. 
 
 
5.1.4 collateral 
a key element in the group's management of credit risk is to 
mitigate the risk of individual exposures by requiring collateral 
in the form of charges on physical assets, securities and guar-
antees, etc. the most commonly used collateral is mortgages 
on real property, securities and vehicles. mortgages on property 
are by far the most important collateral type provided to spar 
nord. mortgages on real property consist mainly of mortgages 
on private housing. 
for a description of collateral with reverse repo transactions, 
see note 6.2 and for collateral provided through clearing sys-
tems with central banks and other infrastructure institutions see 
note 6.3. 
the credit quality of the individual exposure categories broken 
down by spar nord’s internal credit rating is shown in notes 5.1.8 
and 5.1.10. 
collateral accepted and type 
spar nord wants to reduce the risk attaching to individual ex-
posures by accepting collateral such as mortgages and 
charges over physical assets, securities and guarantees, etc. 
whenever possible. mortgages on real property are by far the 
most important collateral type provided to spar nord. mort-
gages on real property consist mainly of mortgages on private 
housing. 
in the event that spar nord calls up collateral that cannot easily 
be converted to cash, spar nord pursues the policy of attempt-
ing to dispose of such assets as soon as possible. 
in 2020, the group repossessed equipment and took over 
properties worth dkk 5 million (2019: dkk 11 million). 
the leased assets are valued and depreciated on an ongoing 
basis. thus, in periods of declining prices for leased assets, the 
collateral calculated for the bank’s leasing activities is reduced. 
the property value under mortgages broken down by property 
type is calculated at dkk 30.3 billion, while only dkk 17.2 billion 
is recorded as security on properties in the table above. this is 
because the former amount represents the amount mortgaged 
to spar nord and is recorded as collateral accepted, while the 
latter amount is the share actually used for calculating collat-
eral regarding a specific exposure. some exposures are smaller 
than the collateral value, and collateral has also been provided 
by customers who do not currently have any facilities. spar nord 
monitors the value of collateral provided on an ongoing basis. 
when the risk associated with a counterparty increases, moni-
toring of the collateral provided will be intensified. a haircut of 
5% of the value is made when the property collateral is allo-
cated to the exposures. 
 
the total loan amounts for customers which no impairment 
charge has been recognised as a result of collateral for 2020 is 
dkk 553 million.

spar nord continuously monitors the value of the collateral fur-
nished. if the risk exposure to a counterparty increases, the col-
lateral is subjected to a particularly critical review. the value is 
assessed based on the expected price to be fetched in a com-
pulsory sale of the collateral, less any expenses arising from its 
realisation.

spar nord’s evaluation of mortgages on rental properties is 
based on the capacity of the properties to generate a return. 
various requirements are made with regard to the rate of re-
turn, depending on the use of the property, the condition of the 
buildings and the physical location in denmark. residential 
rental property is valued on the basis of a required rate of return 
in the 4.25 to 10.0% range. 
unsecured shares 
the table below shows that the total unsecured share at end-
2020 was 25.5%. net of reverse loans, the total unsecured share 
at end-2020 amounted to 33.7%. at end-2019, the unsecured 
share without reverse repo transactions was 33.8%. 
compared with previous years, spar nord changed its principle 
for calculating its unsecured shares in 2020, so that rights of 
subrogation in the bank’s issued loss guarantees against facil-
itated mortgage loans are now included as a specific collateral.

5.1.5 forbearance 
a loan facility is defined as being subject to forbearance if the 
conditions regarding interest payments and/or repayments 
have been relaxed on account of the borrower’s financial diffi-
culty or if the loan has been refinanced on more lenient terms. 
in connection with covid-19, forbearance must be flagged if 
the more lenient terms are considered only to apply for a tem-
porary period. 
forbearance must be approved by credit rating. customers 
who have been granted forbearance must be flagged for ob-
jective evidence of credit impairment. 
in addition to decentralised registration, customers flagged as 
having a weak credit quality and oei with an indication of credit 
impairment will be monitored centrally and reported on period-
ically. 
 
stage 3 loans were reduced by a total of dkk 131 million due to 
improvement of customer credit quality, settlement of loans or 
write-offs. overall, npl loans were reduced by dkk 131 million to 
dkk 1,873 million, and the share of non-performing loans (npl 
ratio) was thus 3.4% at end-2020. 
 
an amount of dkk 167 million was written off in 2020, and indi-
vidual impairment charges totalling dkk 137 million were re-
versed. 
 
non-performing 
an exposure is defined as “non-performing” (npl), if: 
• the exposure has been in arrears (i.e. if any amount of inter-
est, fees or instalments remains unpaid) for more than 90 
days; or 
• it is considered unlikely that the debtor will fully meet its pay-
ment obligations without realising collateral. 
in addition, an exposure in ifrs 9 stage 3 is always defined as 
npl even if the above criteria are not met.

the impact on spar nord’s profits from impairment amounted 
to an expense of dkk 309 million in 2020, equal to 0.4% of total 
loans, advances and guarantees. 
the total impact on operations of dkk 309 million compared 
with an impact on operations of dkk 22 million in 2019 should 
primarily be seen in the context of covid-19-related uncer-
tainty. 
retail customers without sparxpres represented an expenses 
of dkk 124 million, while sparxpres resulted in an expense of dkk 
9 million. for business customers, there was an expense of dkk 
250 million, while the impact on operations from agriculture was 
an income of dkk 74 million.  
exposures for which interest accrual has been suspended fell 
from dkk 303 million at end-2019 to dkk 275 million at end-
2020.

individual impairment at end-2020 of dkk 941 million includes 
dkk 7 million in provisions for losses on unutilised credit lines and 
loan commitments. 
in 2020, spar nord recorded a decline in credit exposure to cus-
tomers with individual impairment of dkk 184 million. 
at end-2020, the credit-impaired claims represented 2.9% of 
total credit exposure compared with 3.2% in 2019. 
the total impairment account rose by dkk 214 million in 2020. 
virtually all cases of insolvent liquidation and bankruptcy are 
attributable to business facilities. 
the collateral for individually credit-impaired loans and for 
overdue loans that have not been individually impaired does 
not differ significantly from the bank’s other collateral. 
 
contractually outstanding amounts for financial assets written off during the accounting period and for 
which collection efforts are still pursued 
 
in the financial year 2020, dkk 167 million was written off  
(2019: dkk 546 million), of which dkk 140 million  
(2019: dkk 522 million) is still the object of collection efforts.

the change in impairment charges is related to uncertainty due 
to covid-19. 
the figures concerning impairment re. new exposures and re-
versed impairment re. repaid accounts include administrative 
movements in which the balance is moved between two ac-
counts for the same customer. 
loss without prior impairment expresses spar nord’s recog-
nised loans for which the loss is greater than impairment at the 
beginning of the year.

as part of its trading in and holding of securities, foreign cur-
rency and derivative instruments and its payment services, etc., 
the bank will experience credit risk exposure to financial coun-
terparties. 
spar nord’s management allocates lines for credit risk exposure 
to financial counterparties, based on the specific counter-
party’s risk profile, rating, amount of exposure and solvency. the 
risks and lines of financial instruments are monitored constantly.

overall, management’s assessment is that spar nord’s credit risk exposure to 
financial counterparties remains at a moderate level, as 96.3% (2019: 93.7%) of 
the financial credit risk is attributable to counterparties with a rating of a or 
higher. 
bond portfolio 
the group’s bond portfolio at fair value through profit or loss is the most signifi-
cant source of financial credit risk.

ing or danish banks with which the bank’s trading division has 
a customer relationship.

spar nord annual report 2020 
 market risk 
market risk is an umbrella heading for the risk of loss caused by 
changes in the value of a portfolio of financial instruments due 
to fluctuations in exchange rates or prices in financial markets. 
spar nord deals and takes positions in products that involve a 
number of market-based risks. most of spar nord’s activities re-
garding trading and position-taking comprise relatively simple 
products, of which interest-based products are the most fre-
quently traded. spar nord also deals and takes positions in 
shares and foreign exchange instruments, whereas trading in 
commodity derivatives is very limited. 
in 2020, spar nord made no major changes in assumptions, ob-
jectives, policies, exposures and calculation methods, etc. as 
compared to the year before. 
spar nord’s interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and equity 
risk are described below. 
market risk policy 
the market risk policy determines spar nord’s overall risk profile 
for market risk, as well as the overall organisational delegation 
of responsibilities in the market risk area with a view to profita-
bly supporting spar nord’s business model. 
the policy identifies and sets limits for the various types of mar-
ket risk, setting out specific limits for how much risk the bank is 
pre-pared to assume. market risks are:  
• interest rate risk in the trading book and the banking book. 
• credit spread risk on the bond portfolio. 
• equity risk in the trading book and the banking book. 
• foreign exchange risk. 
• option risk. 
• commodity risk 
management, monitoring and reporting 
for its management of market risks, the bank has established a 
three-tier instruction hierarchy. at the first tier, the board of di-
rectors issues the definition of the limits for spar nord, which are 
delegated to the executive board. at the second tier, the exec-
utive board delegates limits to the other entities of spar nord, 
with the trading division being the distinctly largest entity. at 
the third and last tier, the executives of the trading division are 
granted the limits within which they may operate. 
the finance & accounts department is responsible for estimat-
ing, monitoring, controlling and reporting market risks. market 
risk is calculated for the following purposes:
 
• regular follow-up on individual business units, both intraday 
and end of day. 
• regular reporting to the executive board and the board of 
directors. 
• reporting of regulatory capital. 
market risks are controlled and monitored through an inte-
grated risk management system, with day-to-day follow-up 
action taken with respect to all market risk categories for all 
units subject to instructions, and any failure to comply with in-
structions is reported upstream in the hierarchy. 
the bank has been working to replace the data platform in the 
market risk area for some time. the project started on the ad-
ministrative side, but in 2021 the bank is expected to implement 
the final element of the project and replace the risk system used 
for risk and position management. at the end of 2021, the bank 
is thus expected to use the same system for the management 
of market risk – a so-called front-to-back solution. similarly, the 
bank is working to simplify its systems by phasing out its own 
valuation and risk management models. 
5.2.1 interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk is the risk of loss due to interest rate fluc-
tuations. most of spar nord’s interest rate risks in the banking 
book derives from bank activities like deposits and lending, 
leases, repo and reverse repo transactions, strategic loans and 
possibly hedge operations in relation thereto. interest rate risks 
in the trading book occur in connection with trading and posi-
tion-taking in bonds and fixed-income derivatives like interest 
rate swaps, futures and standard interest rate options. 
the interest rate risk both within the trading book and the 
banking book is calculated on the basis of duration and agreed 
cash flow. for managing its portfolio of callable danish mort-
gage bonds, spar nord uses model-based key risk indicators 
that provide for the embedded option component. 
as concerns interest rate options, the above-mentioned key in-
dicators are supplemented by the most important risk factors 
expressing sensitivity of the option premium on changes in the 
underlying parameters. 
the interest rate risk is assessed on a daily basis, and decisions 
are made in light of expectations for macroeconomic develop-
ments and cyclical trends. spar nord converts the interest rate 
risk in foreign currencies into danish kroner and offsets the neg-
ative interest rate risk against the positive one to calculate the 
net interest rate risk.

shown above is the interest rate risk relative to duration and 
exchange rates. this shows the risk of changes for a given time 
interval on the yield curve. the table shows the interest rate risk 
broken down on the individual time intervals, given a 1 percent-
age point drop in interest rates. 
at end-2020, spar nord is exposed to a fall in dkk interest rates 
and to a minor extent eur interest rates (2019: falling dkk inter-
est rates and rising eur interest rates). the interest rate risk 
amounted to dkk 116 million, which is a dkk 64 million increase 
of the positive net interest rate risk compared with end-2019.

5.2.2 foreign exchange risk 
foreign exchange risk is the risk of loss on positions in foreign 
currency due to exchange rate fluctuations. currency options 
are included in the calculation at the delta-adjusted position. 
the foreign exchange risk is illustrated by the table below. the 
calculation is based on the assumption that all exchange rates 
develop unfavourably for spar nord by 2%. 
 
 
 
the table shows an unchanged foreign exchange risk with mi-
nor shifts between the various currencies. foreign exchange risk 
generally remains at a low level. 
5.2.3 equity risk 
equity risk is the risk of losses caused by changes in equity 
prices. equity positions are the calculated net value of long and 
short equity positions and equity-related instruments.  
 
the calculation of equity positions is broken down by positions 
in the banking book and in the trading book.

a salient feature of shares in the banking book is that they have 
not been acquired for trading purposes. in addition, spar nord 
makes a distinction between shares in strategic partners, in-
cluding sector companies, associates and other shares in the 
banking book. 
spar nord’s most significant equity investment recognised in 
associates at end-2020 was danske andelskassers bank a/s 
(2019: danske andelskassers bank a/s).

shares in strategic partners in the financial sector are shares in 
companies whose purpose is to support financial institutions’ 
business in the fields of mortgage credit, payment services, unit 
trusts, etc. participation in the companies in question is consid-
ered a prerequisite for spar nord’s operations. 
in several of the sector companies, the shares are redistributed 
to the effect that the ownership interest of the respective insti-
tution will reflect its business volume with the sector company. 
the shares are typically redistributed on the basis of the sector 
company’s equity value. in light of this, spar nord adjusts the 
recognised value of these shares when new information is avail-
able that warrants a change of fair value measurement. in other 
sector companies, the shares are not redistributed, but are 
measured based on a fair value corresponding to the net asset 
value or another recognised valuation method (including dis-
counting of cash flows and market expectations with respect 
to equity return requirements). the adjustments of the values of 
the shares in these companies are also recognised in the in-
come statement. 
 
5.2.4 sensitivity analysis

the sensitivity information shows the impact of isolated 
changes in interest rates in the trading book, while the impact 
of changes in exchange rates and the share portfolio is shown 
for positions both in the banking book and the trading book. 
the impact on the operating profit and the impact on equity 
are calculated after tax. 
it appears from the table that the impact of an interest rate 
increase will be a loss equal to 0.9% of shareholders’ equity. fur-
thermore, the effect of a 10% decline in the value of the share 
portfolio both in the banking and the trading book will be a loss 
equal to 2.2% of shareholders’ equity.

spar nord annual report 2020 
 liquidity risk 
in 2020, spar nord made no major changes in calculation 
methods, policies and exposures etc. as compared to the year 
before. 
spar nord bank is generally exposed to liquidity risks when 
lending, investment and funding activities result in a cash flow 
mismatch.  
liquidity risk means that spar nord cannot meet its payment 
obligations while also meeting the statutory liquidity require-
ments. moreover, a liquidity risk exists if the lack of financ-
ing/funding prevents spar nord from adhering to the adopted 
business model, or if spar nord’s costs for procurement of li-
quidity rise disproportionately. 
liquidity policy 
the liquidity policy determines spar nord’s overall risk profile for 
liquidity risks and financing structure, as well as the overall or-
ganisational delegation of responsibilities in the liquidity area 
with a view to profitably supporting spar nord’s business model. 
the aim of the liquidity policy is to ensure that spar nord has a 
liquidity risk that at all times bears a natural relation to spar 
nord’s overall risk profile. in addition, the liquidity policy is in-
tended to ensure that spar nord continuously handles and 
manages its liquidity appropriately and is capable of meeting 
its payment obligations as and when due while complying with 
applicable legislation and supporting future activities and 
growth. lastly, the policy is intended to ensure a financing 
structure that ensures a correlation between risk and price. 
 
spar nord’s objective is for the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) 
to amount to at least 125% in compliance with the regulation on 
lcr. in addition, spar nord aims to stay below the funding ratio 
and liquidity benchmark threshold values in the supervisory di-
amond. 
management, monitoring and reporting 
on the basis of the policies and objectives defined by the board 
of directors, the executive board has defined operational 
frameworks and specific limits for the liquidity function in the 
trading division, which is responsible for managing spar nord’s 
short-term liquidity. funding in the finance & accounts depart-
ment is responsible for managing and monitoring spar nord’s 
long-term liquidity. 
the finance & accounts department is responsible for calcu-
lating, monitoring and checking that spar nord’s liquidity risk 
does not exceed the allocated limits. the department regularly 
reports to the executive board, the board of directors and the 
danish fsa.

5.3.1 short-term liquidity 
spar nord employs fixed models to monitor and manage its 
short-term liquidity, including the daily management of lcr 
and intraday liquidity and ongoing preparation of stress tests. 
at end-2020, lcr was calculated at 241% (2019: 195%), which is 
significantly above spar nord’s target lcr of at least 125% 
(2019: 125%) the excess coverage of 116 percentage points (2019: 
70) corresponds to excess liquidity of dkk 11.5 billion (2019: dkk 
6.8 billion). calculated relative to the statutory requirement of 
100%, the excess liquidity amounted to dkk 14.0 billion. 
the liquidity reserve according to lcr basically consists of cen-
tral bank reserves and government debt (level 1a assets) and 
mortgage bonds offering particularly high liquidity and very 
high credit quality (level 1b assets).

5.3.2 long-term liquidity 
spar nord calculates its strategic liquidity as deposits excl. repo 
transactions, senior loans, issued bonds, subordinated debt 
and equity less lending excl. reverse repo transactions. on the 
other hand, subordinated debt, additional tier 1 capital, senior 
loans and issued bonds due within 12 months are not included 
in the calculation of strategic liquidity. 
at end-2020, spar nord had strategic liquidity of dkk 30.0 bil-
lion. this level reflects strengthened liquidity of dkk 6.6 billion 
relative to end-2019, when strategic liquidity was calculated at 
dkk 23.4 billion. 
compared with 2019, spar nord increased its deposits by dkk 
4.8 billion, while loans and advances fell by dkk 0.6 billion in the 
same period. finally, a positive consolidation for the period also 
contributes to an overall improvement in strategic liquidity.

5.3.3 stress test 
in accordance with the executive order on management and 
control of banks etc., spar nord prepares internal liquidity 
stress tests based on lcr. the stress tests span a 12-month pe-
riod and are calculated using three permanently defined sce-
narios: a business-specific, a market-specific and a mixed sce-
nario. all scenarios are calculated without any management in-
tervention. the stress tests prepared have lived up to spar 
nord’s internal targets throughout the period. 
subsequently, the result of the liquidity projection in a severe 
stress scenario is shown, in which spar nord operates with a 3-
month survival period in its liquidity management. in addition to 
money and capital market funding falling due, the stress sce-
nario includes a massive stress on the deposit base, continued 
lending growth and stress on the bond portfolio. 
at end-2020, the projection shows that spar nord’s liquidity re-

5.3.4 liquidity benchmark 
the liquidity indicator of the danish fsa is based on a projected 
version of lcr using an adjusted calculation of liquidity in the 
numerator, while the time horizon for the denominator is ex-
tended to cover the period up to 3 months inclusive. 
since the liquidity indicator was implemented in the supervisory 
diamond, spar nord has realised a level notably above the 
100% requirement.

5.3.5 funding and maturity structure 
spar nord’s operations are predominantly funded through four 
funding sources: 
• customer deposits 
• loans or repo transactions from other credit institutions and 
danmarks nationalbank (the central bank) 
• issued bonds and senior loans, including senior non-pre-
ferred 
• subordinated debt and equity 
from an overall perspective, the bank’s funding at end-2020 
increased by dkk 5.9 billion to dkk 77.0 billion compared with 
end-2019. the principal change in spar nord’s funding is a dkk 
5.1 billion increase in deposits (incl. repo), which was primarily 
driven by deposits on demand. deposits remain spar nord’s 
largest source of funding, and at end-2020 it represented 75.9% 
of spar nord’s total funding. 
at end-2020 spar nord’s total long-term funding (deposits on 
demand and funding with a term to maturity of more than 12 
months) amounts to 91.8%, which is on a level with year-end 
2019.

5.3.6 contingency liquidity plan 
spar nord has prepared a liquidity contingency plan pursuant 
to the danish executive order on management and control of 
banks. this plan contains a catalogue of possible courses of 
action for strengthening spar nord’s liquidity in a critical situa-
tion. the catalogue contains a more detailed description of the 
expected impact and time span of the individual actions. 
the liquidity contingency plan is applied if spar nord can only 
meet the predetermined liquidity instructions with difficulty and 
with resulting sharply increased funding costs.

5.3.8 contractual term to maturity of financial 
liabilities 
 
the maturity analysis shows the contractual, undiscounted 
cash flows and comprises agreed payments, including principal 
and interest. 
for liabilities with variable cash flow, such as floating-rate fi-
nancial liabilities, the information is based on the conditions ex-
isting at the balance sheet date. 
subordinated debt is deemed to fall due at the time when the 
spar nord group may choose between redeeming the debt or 
paying an increased interest rate/increased redemption price. 
if spar nord instead chooses to extend the loans, interest of 
dkk 33 million (2019: dkk 34 million) falls due for payment within 
1 year, dkk 134 million (2019: dkk 134 million) within 1-5 years, and 
dkk 1,431 million including repayments of dkk 1,344 million (2019: 
dkk 1,445 million including repayments of dkk 1,325 million) after 
5 years. 
issued bonds are deemed to fall due at the time when the spar 
nord group may choose between redeeming the debt or pay-
ing a different interest rate. if spar nord instead chooses to ex-
tend the loans, interest of dkk 23 million (2019: dkk 22 million) 
falls due for payment within 1 year, dkk 2,745 million including 
repayments of dkk 2,675 million (2019: dkk 970 million including 
repayments of dkk 895 million) within 1-5 years, and dkk 0 mil-
lion including repayments of dkk 0 million (2019: dkk 1,760 million 
including repayments of dkk 1,750 million) after 5 years. 
 
 
 
as regards deposits in pension pools, only the customers’ de-
posits in the pension pools are allocated, as future yields for 
pension pool participants depend on the return on pooled as-
sets. the dates when the obligations fall due are correlated to 
the assets in the pension pools. 
payments regarding irrevocable credit commitments and guar-
antees fall due if a number of predetermined conditions have 
been met. such payment obligations have been recognised at 
the time when the agreements expire. 
under the agreements made, customers can usually demand 
repayment of their deposits at short notice. however, in prac-
tice they are considered a stable funding source, as amounts 
disbursed largely equal deposits received. 
the above-mentioned breakdown by term to maturity is based 
on the earliest date when a demand for payment can be made.

section 5 
risk management 
spar nord annual report 2020 
 operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inefficient or de-
ficient internal procedures, from human or systemic errors or 
from external events, including legal risks. 
operational risk also comprises model risk, which is the risk of 
loss resulting from decisions primarily based on results of inter-
nal models. operational risk arises due to errors in the develop-
ment, execution or use of such models. 
operational risk policy 
spar nord’s board of directors defines the group’s operational 
risk policy. this includes determining risk tolerance in the area. 
the purpose of the bank’s operational risk policy is to promote 
an open culture among its employees and thereby increase 
awareness of operational risk. the policy also describes how to 
ensure that the board of directors and the executive board are 
kept informed about significant risk areas. 
operational risks are assessed on the basis of the probability of 
the risk materialising in the form of an operational event, and 
the consequences this might entail. in the policy, operational 
risk tolerance has been determined as being low compared 
with the other types of risk the bank is exposed to. 
addressing operational risks 
all of spar nord’s activities are subject to operational risk, and 
therefore a key task is to limit the operational risk level as much 
as possible, with due consideration to continuing sound bank-
ing operations. 
operational risk is managed across spar nord through a com-
prehensive system of business procedures and control 
measures developed to ensure an adequate control environ-
ment.  
follow-up and reporting with respect to operational risk is an-
chored with the risk management function, while responsibility 
for addressing risks lies with the first line of defence in the unit 
responsible for the relevant business activity. this helps ensure 
a clear segregation of controlling and operational functions.  
in addition to identifying operational risk, all operational events 
resulting in a loss of more than dkk 10,000 are systematically 
recorded, categorised and reported. the bank also registers 
operational events resulting in a gain and events that could 
potentially have resulted in a loss/gain, but did not do so (near-
miss events). to enhance awareness and promote an open cul-
ture in the organisation, awareness activities are regularly un-
dertaken aimed at operational risk management. 
reporting operational risks 
reporting to the board of directors, executive board and risk 
owners is done on a quarterly basis. the risk owners are in-
formed about the loss events during the period under review 
and about changes to the risk patterns of the area. the board 
of directors and executive board receive a summary of signifi-
cant changes to the risk patterns and a statement of total loss 
events.  
loss events exceeding dkk 5 million will be reported separately 
to the executive board and board of directors. 
 
the figures below illustrate the percentage distribution on risk 
types measured by number of events and loss amounts, re-
spectively. 
as shown in the figures, most of the loss events relate to exter-
nal fraud, including payment card abuse and online banking 
fraud. the rest of the loss events relate to traditional banking 
operations.

section 5 
risk management 
spar nord annual report 2020 
5.4.1 it security 
as spar nord is a digital business, data and it systems security 
are paramount to its credibility and existence and involve the 
bank managing a number of business-critical it risks. 
spar nord’s central it security function teams up with the busi-
ness and it to ensure that the threat picture is kept up to date, 
that it risks are identified and analysed and that these risks are 
adequately mitigated through appropriate controls and risk-
mitigating measures. the end-goal of the it security function is 
thus for the current risk level to reflect the risk tolerance for it 
security accepted by the board of directors. 
the it security function is responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the adopted it security risk tolerance, as defined in the it 
security policy, and for spar nord’s it contingency plan. the 
bank's it security efforts also include the preparation of contin-
gency plans and recovery procedures and the periodic testing 
of such measures. the aim is to ensure continued operation of 
the bank at a satisfactory level in the case of extraordinary 
events. the it security function is also charged with ensuring 
compliance with legislative and sector-specific requirements, 
spar nord’s own requirements and customer expectations in 
terms of spar nord’s availability, confidentiality and integrity. 
spar nord’s it security function, executive board and board of 
directors regularly review the bank’s it security. the it risk pat-
terns are regularly addressed in the it security committee which 
has representatives with decision-making powers that enable 
the committee to handle the bank’s it risks. 
in order to protect spar nord against the growing threat in the 
area of cyber security, the it security function has regularly car-
ried out awareness activities for employees. the function has 
also participated in sector-specific collaborative initiatives to 
build internal knowledge about information security. 
5.4.2 compliance risk 
operational risk includes compliance risks identified via the 
compliance function. 
the compliance function is an independent function which 
serves to assess, check and report on the bank’s compliance 
with applicable legislation, practice and market standards. this 
helps mitigate the risk of sanctions being imposed on the bank, 
a risk of loss of reputation or that the bank or its customers suf-
fer material financial losses. 
the compliance function applies a risk-based approach to 
identifying areas to review. in 2020, the function focused on ar-
eas such as compliance with anti-money laundering (aml) 
measures, governance rules, payment services, liquidity, capi-
tal, product approval the market abuse regulation and mifid ii. 
the compliance function is anchored in the legal department 
and reports directly to the executive board and board of direc-
tors. 
5.4.3 money-laundering risk 
the bank retains a strong focus on anti-money-laundering 
(aml) measures, including the risk-mitigating measures that 
must be implemented to prevent the bank from being used for 
money-laundering activities and terrorism financing purposes. 
the aml function is charged with ensuring that the bank com-
plies with the danish act on measures to prevent money laun-
dering and financing of terrorism, eu funds transfer regulation 
and eu anti-terrorism regulations. the aml function supports 
the bank’s business development in connection with ongoing 
implementation of the rules. in addition, the aml function carries 
out regular controls to ensure compliance. 
 
in 2020, the aml function continued to focus on enhancing and 
optimising existing processes and systems. the bank has opted 
to centralise parts of its anti-money laundering procedures, as 
a result of which new staff was onboarded in the aml function. 
the bank continues to record an increase in filings with the 
state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime 
(sØik), which is a trend witnessed in the rest of the danish finan-
cial sector. in 2020, spar nord had 2,048 filings with sØik as 
compared with 1,750 cases in 2019. 
the aml function is anchored in the legal department and re-
ports directly to the executive board and board of directors. 
5.4.4 gdpr 
2020 was characterised by a focus on systems compliance 
along with controls in the data protection area to reduce op-
erational risk. 
as with the rest of the bank’s compliance function, the bank’s 
data protection adviser applies a risk-based approach to 
identify areas for review. 
in 2020, the adviser focused on areas such as compliance with 
security of processing requirements and the actual handling of 
confidential information and material – both on and off the 
bank’s premises. 
the data protection adviser function is anchored in the legal 
department and reports directly to the executive board and 
board of directors. 
5.4.5 risk exposure amount 
in 2020, the operational risk amounted to 10.2% (2019: 9.9% of 
the total risk exposure amount, ending at dkk 5,594 million at 
end-2020 (2019: dkk 5,555 million). 
5.4.6 products and services 
risks associated with the implementation of new products and 
services are identified and assessed according to internal pro-
cedures prior to final approval by the executive board and/or 
board of directors. 
risk analyses and statements by selected consultation part-
ners, including statements from the bank’s finance depart-
ment, legal department and the chief risk officer, help ensure 
comprehensive insight into the risks faced by the bank and its 
customers. as prescribed by law, the chief risk officer may re-
quire that a change to an existing product be treated as a new 
product. 
the approval procedures are described in the bank’s product 
policies for financial products and other bank products, respec-
tively. the policies are reviewed annually by the risk committee, 
which recommends the policies for final approval by the board 
of directors. 
products which have been subjected to the internal approval 
procedures are regularly monitored and revisited at least every 
other year. if it turns out that a previous analysis of the bank’s 
and customers’ risks is no longer accurate, the product will 
again be subjected to the internal approval procedure with a 
view to ensuring an accurate description of the bank’s and the 
customers’ risks. 
as part of the bank’s policy for financial products, a distribution 
strategy has been defined with the overall purpose of ensuring 
that the bank distributes the right products to the right custom-
ers.

spar nord has entered into agreements regarding the sale of 
securities as genuine sale and repo transactions. when it lends 
or sells securities subject to a repurchase agreement, spar nord 
receives cash or other financial assets upon the transfer of the 
securities to the counterparty. the counterparty is entitled to 
sell or repledge the securities lent or sold according to the re-
purchase agreements, but the counterparty is obliged to return 
the securities upon expiry of the contract. if the value of the se-
curities increases or decreases, spar nord may make or receive 
a demand for payment of additional cash collateral in specific 
circumstances. 
spar nord has decided that it will essentially retain all the risks 
and benefits attaching to these securities, and therefore it has 
not ceased recognising them. in addition, spar nord recognises 
a financial liability for the cash received as collateral. 
 
spar nord has not entered into agreements regarding the sale 
of assets where such assets cease to be recognised in the bal-
ance sheet, but where the seller has continued involvement af-
ter the sale. 
 
 collateral accepted 
in connection with reverse repo transactions and agreements  
regarding securities lending, collateral that can be sold or  
repledged pursuant to the terms of the appropriate agreement

assets are treated as encumbered if they have been provided 
as collateral or if they are subject to any agreement to secure, 
act as collateral for or improve the credit quality of any on- or 
off-balance-sheet transaction from which they cannot be 
freely withdrawn. assets that have been provided as collateral 
and are subject to restrictions as concerns withdrawal, e.g. as-
sets for which prior approval is required to withdraw or replace 
them with other assets, are considered to be encumbered. 
assets placed in unutilised facilities and which can be freely 
withdrawn are not considered to be encumbered. securities 
sold as part of sale and repurchase agreements (repo transac-
tions) remain in the balance sheet. the counterparty is entitled 
to sell the securities or deposit them as collateral for other 
loans. assets deposited as collateral for own liabilities towards 
danmarks nationalbank (the central bank), danish and foreign 
clearing centres and banks with which the bank has concluded 
csa agreements are all based on standard agreements cus-
tomarily used by financial market participants

 offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities 
assets and liabilities are offset when spar nord and the coun-
terparty have a legal right to offset, while at the same time hav-
ing agreed to make a net settlement or realise the asset and 
redeem the liability at the same time. positive and negative fair 
values of derivatives with the same counterparty are offset if 
the parties have agreed to make a net settlement of the con-
tractual payments, and if cash payment or provision of collat-
eral for changes in the fair value takes place on a daily basis. 
master netting agreements and corresponding agreements 
provide a further right to offset when a  counterparty is in de-
fault, which additionally reduces the exposure to a counter-
party in default, but this does not meet the criteria for offsetting 
for accounting purposes according to ifrs. 
in the balance sheet, reverse repo transactions are classified as 
due from credit institutions and central banks or as loans, ad-
vances and other receivables at amortised cost. repo trans-
actions are classified as due to credit institutions and central 
banks or as deposits and other payables in the balance sheet. 
repo transactions and reverse repo transactions are recog-
nised in the balance sheet on a gross basis; see notes 6.1 and 
6.2.

spar nord annual report 2020 
 hedge accounting 
accounting policies 
spar nord uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the in-
terest rate risk on fixed-rate assets and liabilities (fair value 
hedge) measured at amortised cost. such hedging derivatives 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
when the hedge accounting criteria are fulfilled, the carrying 
amount of the hedged assets and liabilities is adjusted for 
changes in fair value regarding the hedged risks (fair value 
hedge). if the hedge criteria cease to be met, the accumulated 
value adjustments of the hedged items are amortised over the 
term to maturity.  
 
the bank pursues a strategy of mitigating the interest rate risk 
on its strategic funding either by using the interest rate risk from 
strategic funding to hedge the interest rate risk on fixed-rate 
agreements in other business areas outside the trading division 
or, secondarily, to hedge the interest rate risk on strategic loans 
using derivatives and applying the rules on hedge accounting.  
the bank assesses the potential hedging of interest rate risk in 
connection with each loan, partly to ensure that the bank 
hedges fixed-rate agreements outside the trading division, 
and partly to avoid unnecessary interest rate exposure on its 
strategic funding. 
the bank does not expect the cibor transition to have any ma-
terial impact on this hedging activity. 
financial liabilities meeting the criteria for hedged items are 
regularly monitored. for issued bonds at amortised cost/fair 
value, hedging is made at the time of issuance with an interest 
rate swap with the same yield/maturity profile. 
the effectiveness of such hedging is measured on a continuing 
basis. 
the table below shows the value adjustment of hedged assets 
and hedging derivatives recognised under market value ad-
justments.

 off-balance sheet items 
accounting policies 
contingent assets and liabilities consist of possible assets and 
liabilities arising from past events and whose existence will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
spar nord. 
contingent assets are disclosed when an inflow of economic 
benefits is probable. 
contingent liabilities are disclosed when an outflow of eco-
nomic resources from spar nord is possible but not probable. 
disclosure also includes current liabilities which have not been 
recognised because it is not probable that the liability will entail 
an outflow of economic resources from spar nord or where the 
liability cannot be reliably measured.

financial guarantees largely consist of payment guarantees. 
loss guarantees for mortgage loans have been granted for the 
highest-risk portion of mortgage loans to personal customers 
and on business properties. there is a full right of set-off against 
future income concerning totalkredit and dlr. 
registration and refinancing guarantees are furnished in con-
nection with land registry processing upon the arrangement 
and refinancing of mortgage loans. 
other contingent liabilities relate mainly to performance bonds 
and letters of credit.  
reference is made to note 2.7 regarding the executive board’s 
notice of termination and the associated compensation. 
spar nord is taxed jointly with its danish subsidiary in the spar 
nord group. as management company, spar nord has unlim-
ited, joint and several liability together with the subsidiary for 
the danish corporate income tax payable. due to the payment 
of tax on account, no tax was payable at 31.12.2020 and 
31.12.2019. the corporate income tax receivable within the tax 
pool amounted to dkk 98 million at 31.12.2020 (31.12.2019: dkk 54 
million). any adjustments to the taxable income subject to joint 
taxation might entail an increase in the parent company’s lia-
bility. 
spar nord has made provisions for a deferred tax liability in re-
spect of recaptured losses related to international joint taxa-
tion.

spar nord annual report 2020 
the bank participates in the national restructuring and resolu-
tion scheme, with separate contributions being paid to the 
guarantee fund and the resolution fund. 
the guarantee fund covers depositors’ eligible deposits in the 
bank under eur 100,000 (see section 9(1) of the danish act on a 
depositor and investor guarantee scheme). the bank’s costs 
for the guarantee fund are calculated based on the bank’s 
pro-rata share. the amount of the contribution will be adjusted 
by an individual risk factor. the bank made no contributions to 
the guarantee fund in 2020, as the guarantee fund’s assets 
exceed its target level of 0.8% of the covered deposits in the 
sector. the bank may be required to pay contributions in future 
if the guarantee fund’s assets fall below 0.8% of the covered 
deposits in the sector. 
the resolution fund is to be used pursuant to the act on re-
structuring and resolution of certain financial enterprises for 
the purpose of covering the associated costs. 
the bank’s costs for the resolution fund are calculated based 
on the bank’s pro-rata share of the sector’s total equity and 
liabilities less own funds and covered deposits. this contribution 
will also be adjusted by an individually determined risk factor. 
the bank’s contribution to the resolution fund for 2020 
amounted to dkk 16 million (2019: dkk 7 million). the bank’s con-
tribution has increased because finansiel stabilitet has in-
formed the banks that an error has been identified in the cal-
culation of the above risk factors. the error results in an adjust-
ment of the bank’s contributions for the period 2015-2019 total-
ling dkk 3.4 million, which is recognised at 31.12.2020. 
the amount of the contingent liabilities and the possible due 
dates are subject to uncertainty, for which reason this infor-
mation has not been disclosed.

spar nord annual report 2020 
 business combinations 
on 22 december 2020, spar nord announced an agreement for 
the conditional acquisition of banknordik’s danish business.  
the intention with the acquisition is to strengthen spar nord’s 
market position in the retail customer segment in the greater 
copenhagen area and in the cities of aarhus, odense, kolding 
and haderslev. the agreement will also allow spar nord to 
achieve the potential for efficiency enhancement and improved 
earnings power which arises from the ability to serve a greater 
number of customers using the same production and support 
platform. furthermore, spar nord expects to achieve positive 
synergies from the combination of banknordik’s branches with 
spar nord’s branches in relevant geographical areas.  
closing of the transaction was subject to the approval of the 
danish fsa and the danish competition and consumer author-
ity. as spar nord received both regulatory approvals before the 
end of january 2021, the acquisition was finalised at 1 february 
2021. 
spar nord’s profit, comprehensive income, balance sheet and 
cash flows for 2020 are therefore not affected by the acquisi-
tion of banknordik’s danish business.  
banknordik’s danish business will be recognised in 2021 
the preliminary fair values at the acquisition date are based on 
an estimated purchase price. when the final purchase price 
and fair value adjustments have been calculated, the fair val-
ues of net assets acquired will be adjusted.  
banknordik’s danish business is expected to contribute moder-
ately to spar nord’s profit before impairment in 2021, as one-off 
costs associated with the transaction are expected to amount 
to around dkk 60 million. from 2022, the acquired business is 
expected to contribute to a profit before impairment of around 
dkk 110 million. 
income and profit for 2021 in the period after the acquisition of 
banknordik’s danish business will be disclosed in quarterly re-
ports and in the annual report for 2021.  
income for spar nord for 2021 calculated on a pro forma basis 
as if banknordik’s danish business had been acquired at 1 jan-
uary 2021 will be disclosed in quarterly reports and in the annual 
report for 2021. 
the total purchase consideration is dkk -2,954 million, corre-
sponding to spar nord receiving a net payment for banknordik 
for acquiring net debts at the transaction because customer 
deposits and, by extension, total liabilities exceed the acquired 
loans, advances and total assets including goodwill. concur-
rently with the settlement of the purchase consideration, spar 
nord has granted financing as a part of the agreement. in the 
form of standard senior debt with terms to maturity of up to 18 
months. 
spar nord is not under any obligation to pay any additional 
purchase consideration.  
spar nord does not take over any obligation to pay severance 
amounts to banknordik’s data processing centre.  
spar nord has so far incurred transaction costs relating to the 
acquisition of dkk 2 million for advisers, which amount has been 
recognised in operating expenses in the income statement for 
the 2020 financial year. 
 
in connection with the acquisition, goodwill has been made up 
at dkk 277 million after recognition at fair value of preliminary 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. goodwill 
represents the value of the existing employees and know-how 
as well as expected synergies from the combination with spar 
nord. customer relationships have so far not been separated 
from goodwill, see below.  
the final agreed and paid goodwill of dkk 255 million is amor-
tisable for tax purposes. the difference between this amount 
and goodwill for accounting purposes is explained by differ-
ences between the purchase price and the fair values of net 
assets acquired.

calculation of preliminary fair values of acquired assets 
and liabilities. 
the fair value of loans and advances is based on an assess-
ment of the market value of banknordik’s total lending. the fair 
value of loans and advances of dkk 2,249 million is measured 
at the present value of the cash flows expected to be received. 
the contractual receivable gross amount is tentatively calcu-
lated at dkk 2,387 million, of which dkk 124 million is not ex-
pected to be received. total guarantees acquired amount to 
dkk 1,439 million for which no provisions for losses or fair value 
adjustments have been made. the guarantees are primarily 
mortgage credit guarantees.  
the fair value of unlisted shares is based on the company's eq-
uity (net asset value) for accounting purposes, as the sale of 
such shares is governed by the shareholders’ agreement for the 
company.

spar nord annual report 2020 
in connection with the acquisition, spar nord has still not cal-
culated identifiable intangible assets in the form of customer 
relationships because spar nord does not have adequate data 
to calculate the value hereof. the fair value of customer rela-
tionships will be recognised in 2021, reflecting the value of the 
acquired customer base from banknordik.  
the fair value of customer relationships will be determined using 
recognised methods in which the expected future earnings 
from the acquired customers are assessed. 
the fair value of domicile properties is estimated at the acqui-
sition date using a return model. 
the fair value of other property, plant and equipment is esti-
mated on the basis of depreciated recoverable amount be-
cause they are not traded in an active market. 
the value of deferred tax assets/liabilities comprises the tax 
value of fair value adjustments of, primarily, property plant and 
equipment and intangible assets. no deferred tax or tax losses 
have been acquired from banknordik. 
the fair value of deposits has been calculated as the contrac-
tual debt because the interest rate on deposits tracks the mar-
ket rate and no material fixed-rate deposits are acquired.  
acquired litigation, appeals and complaints are recognised at 
fair value, which is calculated on the basis of weighted proba-
bilities of assessed possible outcomes of such cases. at the 
present time, we are not familiar with any material cases to be 
recognised at the date of acquisition. 
the calculation of the purchase price and the fair value of ac-
quired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition at 1 feb-
ruary 2021 is preliminary, as the final calculation of the purchase 
price with banknordik remains pending, and it will require more 
information and time to ensure a verification of the fair values. 
we expect fair values to be finally calculated at 31 december 
2021.

 accounting policies 
the financial statements of the parent company spar nord 
bank a/s have been prepared in accordance with the provi-
sions of the danish financial business act, including the danish 
fsa’s executive order on financial reports presented by credit 
institutions and investment companies (executive order on the 
presentation of financial statements). 
the parent company’s accounting policies are identical to 
those of the group. 
for a description of accounting policies and changes thereto, 
please see accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
investments in group enterprises are recognised and measured 
at the proportionate share of the net asset value (nav) on the 
balance sheet date plus the carrying amount of acquired good-
will. 
the difference between the equity and profit or loss in the group 
and in the parent company is due to properties being classified 
as investment properties in subsidiaries and as domicile prop-
erties in the group. the difference consists of net depreciation 
and impairment on such properties; see below:

the fair value method (level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) has been chosen 
for measuring domicile properties. fair value has been determined based 
on observable prices and other valuation methods. 
an external valuation of all properties has been obtained from a real es-
tate agent to support the calculation of fair value, including the rental 
rates and rates of return used.

 subordinated debt 
subordinated debt are liabilities in the form of tier 2 capital 
which, in the event of the company’s voluntary or compulsory 
winding up, will not be repaid until after the claims of ordinary 
creditors have been met. early redemption of subordinated 
debt is subject to the approval of the danish fsa. subordi-
nated debt is included in own funds, etc. pursuant to the dan-
ish financial business act. 
 
the issuance of additional tier 1 capital under crr with a per-
petual term and with voluntary payment of interest and re-
payments of principal is treated as equity for accounting pur-
poses. for further details, please see note 4.6 to the consoli-
dated financial statements.

financial guarantees largely consist of payment guarantees. 
loss guarantees for mortgage loans have been granted for the 
highest-risk portion of mortgage loans to personal customers 
and on business properties. there is a full right of set-off against 
future income concerning totalkredit and dlr. 
registration and refinancing guarantees are furnished in con-
nection with land registry processing upon the arrangement 
and refinancing of mortgage loans. 
other contingent liabilities relate mainly to performance bonds 
and letters of credit. 
reference is made to note 2.7 to the consolidated financial 
statements regarding the executive board’s notice of termina-
tion and the associated compensation. 
spar nord is taxed jointly with its danish subsidiary in the spar 
nord group. as management company, spar nord has unlim-
ited, joint and several liability together with the subsidiary for 
the danish corporate income tax payable. due to the payment 
of tax on account, no tax was payable at 31.12.2020 and 
31.12.2019. the corporate income tax receivable within the tax 
pool amounted to dkk 98 million at 31.12.2020 (31.12.2019: dkk 54 
million). any adjustments to the taxable income subject to joint 
taxation might entail an increase in the parent company’s lia-
bility. 
spar nord has made provisions for a deferred tax liability in re-
spect of recaptured losses related to international joint taxa-
tion. 
the bank participates in the national restructuring and resolu-
tion scheme, with separate contributions being paid to the 
guarantee fund and the resolution fund. 
the guarantee fund covers depositors’ eligible deposits in the 
bank under eur 100,000 (see section 9(1) of the danish act on a 
depositor and investor guarantee scheme). the bank made no 
contributions to the guarantee fund in 2020, as the guarantee 
fund’s assets exceed its target level of 0.8% of the covered de-
posits in the sector. the bank may be required to pay contribu-
tions in future if the guarantee fund’s assets fall below 0.8% of 
the covered deposits in the sector. 
the resolution fund covers the costs associated with the pos-
sible winding-up of financial institutions under the auspices of 
finansiel stabilitet (the winding-up company). the bank’s con-
tributions to the resolution fund are calculated based on the 
bank’s pro-rata share of the sector’s total equity and liabilities 
less own funds and the deposits covered by the guarantee 
fund, adjusted by a risk factor. the bank’s contribution to the 
resolution fund for 2020 amounted to dkk 16 million (2019: dkk 
7 million). the bank’s contribution has increased because finan-
siel stabilitet has informed the banks that an error has been 
identified in the calculation of the above risk factors. the error 
172 
section 7 
notes parent company 
spar nord annual report 2020 
results in an adjustment of the bank’s contributions for the pe-
riod 2015-2019 totalling dkk 3.4 million, which is recognised at 
31.12.2020. 
the amount of the contingent liabilities and the possible due 
dates are subject to uncertainty, for which reason this infor-
mation has not been disclosed. 
for accounting policies, see note 6.6 to the consolidated finan-
cial statements. 
 other binding commitments 
other binding commitments of dkk 1,200 million (2019: dkk 515 
million) consist of lease obligations in which spar nord bank is 
lessee, and the liability to pay a withdrawal fee on potential 
withdrawal from bankernes edb central  a.m.b.a. see note 6.6.2 
to the consolidated financial statements for a description 
hereof. 
for accounting policies, see note 6.6 to the consolidated finan-
cial statements. 
 risk management 
spar nord is exposed to a number of risks in various categories, 
the most important one being: 
• credit risk: the risk of losses because counterparties fail to 
meet all or part of their payment obligations. 
• market risk: the risk of loss because the fair value of spar 
nord’s assets and liabilities varies with changes in market 
conditions. 
• liquidity risk: the risk of loss because spar nord cannot meet 
its payment obligations via the ordinary liquidity reserves. 
• operational risk: the risk of financial loss owing to deficient 
or erroneous internal procedures and processes, human or 
system errors, or losses as a result of external events. 
notes 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 to the consolidated financial state-
ments provide a description of the financial risks and policies 
and targets for managing credit, market, liquidity and opera-
tional risks.

the change in portfolio impairment was driven by an increase 
in gross lending and movements between the stages as illus-
trated in the table, which is the result of a change in customers’ 
credit risk. in addition, impairment charges are affected by im-
paired macroeconomic factors.

 hedge accounting 
 
the bank pursues a strategy of mitigating the interest rate risk 
on its strategic funding either by using the interest rate risk from 
strategic funding to hedge the interest rate risk on fixed-rate 
agreements in other business areas outside the trading division 
or, secondarily, to hedge the interest rate risk on strategic loans 
using derivatives and applying the rules on hedge accounting.  
the bank assesses the potential hedging of interest rate risk in 
connection with each loan, partly to ensure that the bank 
hedges fixed-rate agreements outside the trading division, 
and partly to avoid unnecessary interest rate exposure on its 
strategic funding. 
the bank does not expect the cibor transition to have any ma-
terial impact on this hedging activity. 
financial liabilities meeting the criteria for hedged items are 
regularly monitored. for issued bonds at amortised cost/fair 
value, hedging is made at the time of issuance with an interest 
rate swap with the same yield/maturity profile. 
the effectiveness of such hedging is measured on a continuing 
basis. 
the table below shows the value adjustment of hedged assets 
and hedging derivatives recognised under market value ad-
justments.

market rate. 
commitments and transactions with members of the board of 
directors and executive board comprise personal commitments 
of such parties and of their related parties. commitments and 
transactions with retired and new members of the board of di-
rectors and executive board have been recognised up to and 
including the date of retirement and as from the date of ap-
pointment, as the case may be.
