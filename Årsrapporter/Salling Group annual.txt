5-year summary
total revenue & operating margin, 
2016 - 2020
salling group achieved record sales in 2020 
and best-ever underlying operating margin. 
netto sweden was divested in 2019 and  
reported revenue for 2018 - 2019 was restated 
to exclude this activity, whereas 2016 - 2017 
includes revenue from netto sweden. in 2017 
the operating margin was positively impacted 
by divestment of a non-core property. 
 
the underlying sales development and  
profitability has been on a positive trend since 
2016. the 2020 sales level and profitability is 
impacted positively by covid-19.
cash flow from operations
and investments, 2016 - 2020
investments in intangible assets, property, plant 
and equipment and investment property in 2020 
was the highest since 2011. we have increased 
the pace of netto 3.0 conversions in all coun-
tries while also investing significantly in new 
stores in poland, digital and it developments 
and further enhancement of our supply chain 
setup.
equity and net debt/ebitda, 2016 - 2020
since 2017 we have consolidated our equity 
level and report an equity ratio of 20.3 % in 
2020. we have gradually reduced the amount 
of debt in the statement of financial position 
and report a net debt/ebitda level of 1.5 in 
2020 including lease liabilities.

per bank, ceo
with 2020 proving to be a year of unprecedented 
events i am proud to say that salling group rose to 
the challenge. we are, however, mindful that the 
historical results were helped by a significant change 
in customer behavior caused by covid-19 and that we 
are in one of the few industries that benefitted from 
the crisis. 
last year we delivered a record revenue of dkk 60.9 bn 
with an ebit of 2.8 bn and a roic of 14.3 %. 
i would like to start out by extending a sincere thank 
you to our teams out in stores and in warehouses who 
worked through very challenging conditions during 
2020. the real risk of the covid-19 virus was not fully 
known at the beginning of the pandemic and still our 
teams who were most exposed continued to deliver 
first class service to our customers every single day.
this has impressed me greatly and i am happy to 
report that absence rates remained low during 2020 
with only few of our colleagues being infected with 
covid-19.
looking back at 2020 i am particularly pleased with 
the fact that we managed to decide on a number 
of important strategic priorities that will shape the 
group for the future. adding to the company’s strong 
foundation we will seek to further strengthen the 
business on the back of the momentum gained in  
2020 as salling group is well positioned to continue  
to lead in times of uncertainty.
improving everyday life affected  
by the pandemic
little did we know when entering 2020 that many 
aspects of everyday life would be turned upside down 
in a matter of weeks in the beginning of the year. as 
events have shown since business as usual did not 
reoccur in 2020.
as an early precaution, and as part of temporary store 
closures, a total of app. 1,900 employees were sent 
home from stores in the spring due to government 
closure of department stores, restaurants and pure 
nonfood stores. apart from assuming responsibility 
for customers and colleagues we acknowledge that as 
denmark’s largest retailer we have an opportunity and 
an obligation to assist our partners and benefit our 
surroundings where possible.
at a time when we were still not able to foresee the 
impact of covid-19 on our business salling group 
declined the opportunity to apply for public financial 
aid packages as the first private company in denmark. 
however, we felt at that point – as we still do – that  
other sectors would struggle more and that other  
businesses would require a helping hand more so  
than salling group.
i am pleased that we were able to help small suppliers 
through immediate payment of invoices totaling  
dkk 500 million during spring, summer and again in 
december when a new lock down was announced.
our unique ownership structure allows us to make 
decisions that other companies may not have the same 
opportunities to make. we acknowledge that with this 
privilege comes great responsibility.
executing on our strategy
in 2020 we achieved significant progress within all 
three pillars of our overarching corporate strategy as 
we have delivered in accordance with the strategic 
direction we have set for the business.
doubling netto poland
with the announcement in june 2020 of the intended 
acquisition of uk retailer tesco’s polish business we 
reached a landmark in our ambition to become an 
important retailer in the polish market. with the deal 
which was completed on 16 march 2021, salling group 
went a long way to consolidating netto’s presence in 
a growing market as we acquired 301 stores and two 
distribution centers as part of the deal. 
step changing food online
following the lock down and the restrictions in the 
wake of covid-19 consumer behavior has undergone 
rapid change as online food sales reached record levels 
in the market. as a consequence of customers switch-
ing to online food purchases salling group moved 
forward the plans to launch home delivery as we  
announced in august that we would initiate a roll  
out of delivery to customers’ front door in 2021. 
we expect to invest heavily in our online and digital 
activities over the next years as home delivery adds to 
an already increasing online footprint within our food 
sales. in 2020 our food click & collect solution in our  
hypermarkets increased dramatically reaching double  
digit percentages of all food sales in bilka. the launch 
of loyalty apps across our danish formats saw our cus-
tomer program encompass over 1 million customers 
in denmark alone helping us provide customers with 
even more value in their everyday life with personal-
ised offers and enhanced ease of shopping.

leading in a time of crisis
strong foundation as basis for growth
significant effort and investment has gone into 
strengthening the core of the business in 2020. work 
has begun on a dkk 300 million extension and mod-
ernisation of our netto denmark main warehouse. 
by developing and rolling out a proven br concept we 
have succeeded in creating a world class toy universe 
adding four updated toy stores along the way.
simultaneously refurbishments of our store portfolio 
continued across formats and countries among others 
with the netto 3.0 concept extended throughout 
poland, germany and denmark with netto denmark 
having remodeled, rebuilt or renovated 1/3 of its 530 
stores by the end of 2020. in december we opened 
the first netto concept store in horsens denmark, 
with focus on sustainability and improved customer 
experience.
range development is an ongoing process in retail. 
netto denmark added a further 250 products to its 
range in 2020 while a new private label “salling” was 
rolled out across bilka and føtex. substituting a variety 
of previous brands the salling brand will encompass 
more than 6,000 different products when fully imple-
mented across bilka and føtex.
ongoing development on track
the progress on the transformation continues on 
track with a consolidation of the portfolio following the 
divestment of netto sweden in 2019 and subsequent 
acquisition of tesco poland.
2020 has seen a further strengthening of the leader-
ship teams in netto poland and netto germany and 
across the business leadership teams are now in place 
to complement and steer a lean, efficient and robust 
organisation ready to withstand the challenges ahead. 
the polish and german conversion of stores has been 
very well received with a significant improvement in 
our image in germany and a satisfactory gain in market 
share within discount.
the continued development within online channels and 
digital has been accelerated to accommodate customer 
needs advanced by covid-19. 
joining forces to impact our communities
running a financially sustainable and resilient business 
has always been our number one priority as we believe 
that a financially robust business goes hand in hand 
with a sustainable approach to our activities. without 
resources to back our ambitions within food waste, 
climate change, health, and responsible procurement 
they remain intentions that are not propelled forward. 
our way is one of backing our goals financially and de-
livering on our ambitious targets even when it impacts 
the profitability of our business.
no business anywhere in the world is able to solve  
the complex challenges facing our planet by itself.  
this is true of salling group as well as we share the  
responsibility with our stakeholders with whom we 
have succeeded in forging even closer bonds in 2020. 
going forward we will continue to strive to make an 
impact in our local communities and wherever our 
footprint is visible throughout our value chain. we 
will continue to take an active role in overcoming the 
challenges facing the world today. not by ourselves, 
but in close collaboration and partnership with our 
customers, employees, suppliers, and partners.

leading in a time of crisis
continuing to lead in times of uncertainty
as we look onward from 2020 it is safe to say that 
salling group is ready for the next phase. financial 
results from the past year may prove difficult to 
replicate yet we expect to continue to deliver results 
which allows us to reinvest in our business. with the 
great support of our owners, the salling
foundations, we will continue to invest in improving 
everyday life for our customers, to develop our
business, and to continue to play a key part in our 
local communities not least through the salling  
foundations.
while the acquisition of tesco poland and our 
substantial investment in food online may prove to 
be the most significant strategic steps taken in 2020 
what i have been most proud of, however, is the 
way the organisation has risen to the challenge of 
the pandemic. it has required a tremendous effort 
by all colleagues across the business, working under 
very difficult circumstances and proving again and 
again throughout 2020 that they act and execute in 
accordance with our values.
in the leadership team it gives us great joy to witness 
how the esteem of our colleagues in the front line has 
grown in the wake of covid-19.

letter from the chairman
thank you!
the board would also like to thank nils smedegaard 
andersen for his exceptional contribution as a  
chairman for the last 12 years. he has been the  
architect of both the buyback for salling group and 
the transformation of the group over the last decade.  
salling group would not be where it is today without 
him. nils stepped down as chairman at the beginning 
of the year and it is an honour for me to follow in his 
footsteps as chairman of this great company.
i and the rest of the board are very proud to be part 
of the salling group family and look forward to 
on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to 
thank our employees for the excellent job they did in 
2020. the covid-19 pandemic made it a very difficult 
year with a lot of fear and uncertainty. none of us has 
experienced anything like it before, but the way our 
employees and the leadership team handled this was 
very impressive.
the whole company acted like a family and everybody 
took on the tasks and challenges that were necessary 
to maneuver successfully through the year. this was 
very visible across formats, countries and functions.
thanks to excellent leadership, good communication 
– both internally and externally, and the great positive 
attitude of our workforce, salling group did not only 
deliver a fantastic financial result but also gained a lot 
of recognition in 2020.
we are convinced that salling group will continue  
to strengthen its positioning in 2021 and beyond. 
our financial strength allows us to continue to invest 
in the future. continued upgrades of our formats, 
accelerated investments in digitalisation and “food 
online”, and a very strategic investment with the 
acquisition of tesco in poland are current priorities 
that confirm our optimism and commitment to invest 
in the future.
we can allow us to think long-term, because our  
owners, the salling foundations, have decided that 
the profit of salling group shall only be used for two  
purposes: investing in the group to ensure a long-
term healthy growth or for donations through the 
foundations for good causes. all profits we generate 
bjørn gulden, chairman
will either be reinvested in the group or used to  
improve the daily life of our customers and employees 
through donations to scientific research, cultural  
institutions, sports and community work. this is a 
major competitive advantage that we all can be very 
proud of and thankful for.
the performance in 2020 was excellent despite the 
very difficult circumstances created by the global  
pandemic. we know that 2021 will also have a “bumpy” 
start and that we will be affected by covid-19 for 
parts of this year. the fact that we managed to get 
through the first ten months of the pandemic so well 
and that we have vaccines coming soon to stop  
covid-19 from spreading makes me optimistic for  
the full year. salling group and our formats will  
continue to develop positively.
continuing the strong relationship and cooperation  
we have with the leadership team, the workers’  
representative and of course with all our employees.
stay strong, stay healthy!

improving everyday life
our purpose is to improve everyday life – for our 
customers and for the society we are a part of. we 
do this through more sustainable solutions, the best 
customer value, job opportunities for all and dona-
tions to good causes through our owners, the salling 
foundations.
best at creating customer value
we strive to be our customers’ trusted partner in their 
everyday lives. we continuously invest in activities 
and new solutions that our customers find valuable, 
inspiring and helpful, offering them better and easier 
shopping, broad range at competitive prices and  
inspirational modern stores. 
more sustainable solutions 
we believe that the majority of our customers would 
like to increase their share of responsible shopping. 
we nudge our customers with affordable prices, step-
by-step solutions, label transparency and visibility  
in our stores and actively seek to reduce our impact 
on climate and environment, within animal welfare,  
organic products, food waste, reduction of plastic 
waste, recycling and our carbon footprint.
opportunities for everyone
a significant contribution to improving everyday life  
in society is creating job opportunities for people at  
all educational levels. we are a diverse organisation 
with more than 55,000 colleagues and we also have 
room for people who need a little extra help to gain  
foothold in the job market.
profit used for good 
part of our profit is donated to good causes through 
our owners, the salling foundations. since 2012,  
the salling foundations have donated more than  
dkk 1 billion to initiatives within culture, education, 
sports, social work and local inventiveness to help 
improve everyday life in our society.
our strategy
in 2019 salling group laid out a new overarching strat-
egy steering our way towards 2025 and ensuring that 
we grow our business and further develop our posi-
tion across denmark, poland and germany. the three 
main pillars in our overall strategy towards 2025 are:
•  expanding in poland: becoming a significant retailer 
in one of europe’s largest markets which already 
constitutes our no. 1 growth opportunity.
•  e-commerce & food online: strengthening our  
online offer in combination with offline brick & 
mortar channels with significant focus on online 
food solutions, over time enabling us to reach a 
market share online equivalent to that of food  
sales in the physical stores. 
•  develop the foundation: invest heavily in the  
core of our business to remain relevant across all  
formats powered by an up to date backbone within 
it, digital, and supply chain & logistics. 
our overarching corporate strategy directs our invest-
ments in future growth areas while continuing our 
focus on core markets to ensure the foundation for 
continued development.

strategy & values
responsible action
the employees of salling group, and the products we 
sell in our stores, are fundamental for our business 
and hence also fundamental for our csr strategy.  
we will act responsibly towards our employees and 
will make responsible purchases. this is crucial for  
our csr strategy.
at the same time, we honour our commitment to act 
responsibly and address matters of concern to our 
customers and society at large. we will make respon-
sible decisions and will help customers to do likewise, 
especially as regards climate action and health.
in 2019, in the process of ensuring an ambitious and 
structured corporate social responsibility programme, 
we launched our new csr strategy platformed on the 
global goals (un sdgs) 3, 12 and 13. climate action 
and good health and well-being are special focus  
areas in our csr strategy because we believe that we 
can make a difference in these areas. in 2020, these 
were incorporated organisation-wide to ensure that 
everyone within salling group engages in the efforts 
to fulfil the global goals.
in our efforts towards fulfilling the global goals, we 
perform ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the 
need for adjustments in order to continuously ensure 
that our efforts are applied to areas in which we can 
make the biggest difference. in 2018, these areas were 
global goal 3 (good health and well-being); 4 (quality 
education); and 12 (responsible consumption and 
production). however, in 2019, when we adopted our 
new csr strategy, in which our employees, together 
with our customers and products, are fundamental 
for our business, we decided to replace global goal 4 
with global goal 13 (climate action) and continue our 
efforts towards global goals 3 and 12. with compre-
hensive training programmes for all of our 55,000 
employees, we are still contributing to global goal 4, 
but with employee development being such a natural 
element in our daily undertaking, we judged that with 
global goal 13, we will be able to make a bigger differ-
ence by taking responsibility for, and intensifying our 
efforts in support of, climate action.

employees are the greatest asset
salling group is one of the largest employers in  
denmark and our employees are the group’s greatest  
asset and the key to our continued development. 
by focusing on creating a working environment that 
fosters co-operation, agile thinking and quick decision 
making in challenging situations we strive to give our 
colleagues the best opportunities for career develop-
ment and personal growth. 
we expect our managers to lead by example and to 
steer by a strong ethical compass ensuring that our 
competitive, passionate and efficient nature goes 
hand in hand with appropriate behavior. 
home to more than 55,000 employees encompassing 
a total of 104 different nationalities we know that  
running a sustainable company not only involves  
selling sustainable products but also entails acting 
with integrity and taking social responsibility. 
a diverse workplace
in salling group we are proud that there is room for 
everyone – and that everyone has the opportunity to 
make a difference, no matter who they are or what 
their background is. every year, we reach out to fellow 
citizens who, because of stress diagnoses, long-term 
unemployment, physical and mental disabilities,  
refugee status or other reasons, find themselves on 
the edge of the labor market. 
we do so because the success of each individual 
benefits not only the workplace, but society at large. 
in 2020 the social calculator* showed that salling 
group’s work to include citizens on the fringes of the 
labor market indirectly benefitted the danish society 
with more than dkk 88 million in increased taxes and 
saved social benefits. our bi-annual employee  
satisfaction survey shows that employees hired  
from the edge of the labor market are still employed 
after 12 months.

information centre established by the danish ministry  
of employment.
the salling group academy
we believe that practical experience in everyday 
life, combined with periods of professional training, 
provides a strong starting point for personal and 
professional development. this is why we operate our 
own training centre, the salling group academy. here, 
our employees participate in customised professional 
courses – and also get the opportunity to share expe-
riences with colleagues from other parts of the group.
prioritising training and education at all levels of the 
organisation we seek to offer some of the most attrac-
tive trainee and talent programmes in the business. 
nurturing the next generation
for many young employees the job in the local store or  
warehouse leads to a part time job, an apprenticeship 
and later perhaps a career in retail. in any case, we 
make sure we prepare our young colleagues properly 
so they can fare well in the labor market – with us or 
in another organisation.
at salling group, we train more apprentices than any 
other danish company with in excess of 1,000 appren-
tices being trained at a time. our apprentices follow 
an individual education plan through a process

in which work in the store is combined with a stay at 
our own academy. for some colleagues apprentice 
training in an international company is a powerful 
springboard in their career, and we recruit a large 
part of our leadership and key positions internally. in 
fact, more than a third of our store managers in bilka 
and føtex and half of our section managers in those 
formats had their apprenticeship in salling group.
unfolding the talents of tomorrow
2020 saw the culmination of long term work done  
by salling group to ensure the succession to key  
positions in stores and central functions including  
our commercial team. 
the first team of graduates from our internal manage-
ment trainee programme, supporting our pipeline for 
team coordinators, came through the ranks as 83 % 
of the management trainees were employed as team 
coordinators after finalising their apprenticeship.
together with fellow founding partners such as arla, 
bestseller and danish crown last year salling group 
initiated and helped launch the msc in commercial 
and retail management at aarhus university aimed at 
preparing students for a career in hq functions of the 
rapidly evolving retail and consumer goods industry. 
the successful launch of the degree programme in 
the fall of 2020 with a student intake of approx. 100 
coincided with salling group leaping from 41 to 28 in 
the 2020 edition of the universum employer brand 
ranking signaling that university graduates view  
salling group as an attractive potential future  
employer to an increasing degree.

taking a firm stand on offensive behavior
while our corporate values guide our conduct in the 
workplace by expressing the behavior we expect of 
each other as colleagues and what others can expect 
from us, certain areas of corporate culture still require 
extra detail. as #metoo has swept through various 
industries in 2020 we too have taken steps to ensure 
that our practice is up to date.
to supplement existing procedures in 2020 we de-
veloped a policy explicitly aimed at preventing sexual 
harassment and offensive behavior which together 
with e-learning courses for managers and hr facili-
tated leader-sessions regarding behavior and culture 
could further aid all levels of the organisation. in order 
to strengthen the set up a toolbox is being developed 
specifically for managers and hr business partners  
to take proactive actions against sexism and other 
forms of unacceptable behavior.
furthermore, process descriptions for employees  
and managers who are concerned that someone  
is violating our values or policies were updated  
and information about our existing whistle blower 
solution repeated.

owned by the salling foundations
salling group is owned by the salling foundations. 
this means that salling group’s annual profit is  
reinvested in the business for the benefit of customers  
who enjoy even better customer experiences. in 
addition, the salling foundations make annual 
donations to worthy causes in denmark.
since 2012, the salling foundations have donated 
more than dkk 1 billion in support of cultural, sports, 
charitable, educational and research activities. in 
2020, the salling foundations donated dkk 139.1 
million to beneficiaries including energy and climate 
academy of denmark, concito climate database 
and supported a relief package for sports and 
athletics in aarhus.
salling group and subsequently the salling 
foundations were established by the founders 
herman salling and ferdinand salling. in 2014, the 
salling foundations initiated the gradual reacquisition 
of shareholdings from a. p. møller – mærsk a/s, which 
held a stake in the business. today, salling group is 
owned by the salling foundations.
in 2018, the salling foundations’ sole shareholding 
was cemented by the change of name from dansk 
supermarked to salling group in recognition of our 
corporate history, and in tribute to the ties to the 
salling foundations.

digital development influences customer shopping 
patterns. advances in digitalisation hold new oppor-
tunities, and responding to customer digital adoption 
calls for high-level agility. constant changes mean that 
salling group is continually adapting to the new digital 
capabilities, catering to customer needs and creating 
competitive solutions. 2020 was the year in which 
salling group also saw significant results generated by 
the digital development undergone by the business. 
salling group today has a state-of-the-art digital  
architecture on all platforms, in which its sap system 
is pivotal, a range of microservices and an array of 
front ends enabled for rapid implementation and  
realignment in response to demand. in 2020, this  
presented an opportunity for initiating a series of 
business critical digital activities and implementing 
them at a rapid rate.
new online engagement
growth in e-commerce increased significantly during  
2020. covid-19 resulted in a boom in customer  
preferences for ordering products online for collection 
or home delivery. at the same time, salling group  
pursued new opportunities by offering customers  
unprecedented options for shopping online in its  
supermarkets and department stores.
our business
digitalisation and supply chain
bilka registered significant growth with its bilkatogo
concept in 2020 and as a new service for bilka and 
føtex customers, over the year, we launched a  
click-and-collect concept for non-food products 
whereby customers can reserve items online for  
in-store collection.
in the spring, we made a strategic decision to become 
a prominent player in home delivery of groceries 
to danish customers via føtex.dk. in early 2021, 
customers in greater copenhagen will be first in line 
for the roll out of our state-of-the-art solution based 
on the large assortment and best-value prices in føtex 
supplemented by a high-profile additional assortment  
from the løgismose and skagenfood brands for  
example.
the ambition is to offer customers unbeatable service 
in denmark via our own fleet of refrigerated trucks 
and specially trained føtex service couriers plus a 
world-class digital platform.
customer loyalty programmes
during 2020, we launched  bilka+, føtex+ and 
netto+ as new customer loyalty programmes. with 
this initiative, our customers gain easier access to 
even more competitive offers generally, but also 
personalised offers adapted to individual purchasing 
patterns.
within 2020, we had already gained one million 
unique members.
optimised forecast models
in 2020, the efforts to convert the group’s large data 
volumes into business development were intensified, 
and a new strategy for this area was launched.  
the aim is, by harnessing artificial intelligence (ai) and  
machine learning, to gain optimised forecasting models 
for the benefit of customers, while minimising losses 
and further improving our food waste avoidance.

logistics and supply chain
in 2020, we launched a substantial renovation and 
modernisation of our distribution centre in køge for 
netto denmark with an investment in excess of dkk 
300 million. with this enlargement, we will be fully 
able to support netto’s continued expansion. with a 
semi-automated warehouse, we ensure our capacity 
to keep costs down and thereby to continue offering 
our customers the right assortment at the best prices.
we re-insourced our fresh in-store baked goods trans-
portation logistics from our existing baked goods sup-
pliers to all stores in denmark. two new terminals in 
eastern and western denmark are now the hubs for 
the group’s fresh in-store baked goods deliveries to 
all stores. our suppliers supply the goods to the two 
terminals and from there we handle the distribution 
to the stores. this solution – when fully implemented 
in april 2021 – saves 40,000 lorry deliveries annually 
for the benefit of our stores and the climate.
tesco poland 
in june 2020, we announced salling group’s largest  
intended acquisition on record of the uk retail busi-
ness tesco’s polish activities. this acquisition will give 
us an additional 301 stores and two logistics centres,  
making netto a substantial player in one of europe’s 
largest high-growth markets. this is a key element  
in salling group’s main strategy and will generate 
growth for the group for many years to come.  
the acquisition was completed on 16 march 2021.

market development
in 2020, due to the covid-19 pandemic the market  
for groceries grew at an unusually high pace in all 
markets. customers were forced to eat out less due 
to restrictions which moved consumption into our 
stores. in salling department stores, our restaurants 
and br the restrictions had an adverse impact on sales. 
 
during 2020, netto rolled out more of the new netto 
3.0 store concept through refurbishment of existing 
stores and expansion with new locations. in total, dur-
ing 2020 182 netto stores were refurbished or opened 
as 3.0 stores and the customer response to the new 
concept is promising. in germany the number of 
3.0 conversions was 67 stores and in poland 33 new 
stores or converted stores opened as 3.0.
the non-food market grew at a higher pace than  
previous years due to covid-19 and all online  
group performance

of the consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial 
statements is danish kroner. all amounts have been rounded to the nearest million, 
unless otherwise indicated.

statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments, which are measured at fair value.

during 2020 skagenfood a/s acquired 51 % of the company bodebjerg aps. skagenfood 
a/s holds call options to purchase the remaining 49 % of the shares in bodebjerg aps  
at a favourable price. the call options can be exercised in 2023 and 2025. as the call 
options in reality give skagenfood a/s present access to the returns associated with that 
ownership interest, the non-controlling interests that are comprised by the call options 
are considered to be purchased at the point in time, where the call options are written. 
thus, no non-controlling interests are recognised in the income statement, the statement 
of other comprehensive income or the equity regarding the comprised non-controlling 
interests. the call option liability is recognised at fair value at acquisition date as part of 
other non-current financial liabilities and is subsequently measured at amortised costs.

and netto fastigheter ab, to the swedish company coop butiker och stormarknader 
ab. in 2019 salling group a/s founded the subsidiaries fastighetsbolaget den 10. maj

visionsbolaget 18748 ab (swedish logistic property förvaltning ab) during december 2019.
as put options regarding non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, which are written 
in connection with business combinations, are treated according to the anticipated 
acquisition method, according to which the non-controlling interests that are comprised 
by the put options are considered to be purchased at the point in time where the put 
options are written, no non-controlling interests are recognised in the income statement, 
the statement of other comprehensive income or the equity regarding the comprised 
non-controlling interests. in 2017, when salling group a/s acquired 80 % of the issued 
share capital and voting rights of skagenfood a/s, it also wrote put options regarding 
the 20 % of skagenfood a/s, which were then owned by kuba holding aps. a further 
10 % were acquired during 2019, and a put option remains regarding the 10 %, which 
continues to be owned by kuba holding aps. no non-controlling interests regarding the 
10 % of skagenfood a/s are recognised in the consolidated financial statements. the put 
option liability is recognised at fair value at acquisition date as part of other non-current 
financial liabilities and is subsequently measured at amortised costs.

revenue from contracts with customers
revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or 
services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services taking 
into account the amount of any trade discounts and expected returns, and excluding 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes and value added taxes. 
thus, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale (at delivery) in 
the store and for online purchases at collection in a store or at delivery of the goods, i.e. 
when the performance obligations are satisfied. 
the group provides customers with a right to return the goods within a specified period, 
and a refund liability and a right of return asset will be recognised if not immaterial.

the amount of commission plus any other amounts received from the principal or other 
parties. 
customer loyalty programmes give rise to a separate performance obligation, and the 
portion of the transaction price that is allocated to the customer loyalty programmes 
based on the relative stand-alone selling prices is deferred, and is recognised as revenue 
when the obligations to supply the discounted products are fulfilled or no longer 
probable.

will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. when the grant relates 
to an expense item, it is recognised as a deduction of the related expense. when the grant 
relates to an asset, it is recognised as a deduction of the carrying amount of the asset, and 
is recognised in the income statement as a deduction of the related depreciation.
share of profit/loss from subsidiaries, net of tax
investments in subsidiaries are measured in the parent company’s statement of financial 
position using the equity method. the share of profit/loss from subsidiaries after elimination 
of unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the parent company

expenses related to lease liabilities (all leases except for short-term leases and leases 
of low value assets), exchange gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies as well as fair value adjustments of financial assets held for trading. moreover,

consolidated financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements
subsequent to initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost net of accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. goodwill is not amortised. for the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to the group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination.
software and software development in progress
acquired software and software licenses are measured on initial recognition at cost.  
subsequent to initial recognition acquired software and software licenses are measured 
at cost net of accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
development costs, that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable 
and unique software controlled by the group, are recognised as software development in 
progress, if it is the intention to complete the software, if sufficient resources to complete 
the software are available, if the costs can be measure reliably, and if the software is 
expected to generate probable future economic benefits. 
the cost of the internally developed software comprises employee related costs,  
external costs as well as interest expenses during the period of production. 
when internally developed software is available for use, it is reclassified from the line 
item software development in progress to the line item software. internally developed 
software, which is available for use, is measured at cost net of accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
brands and other separately acquired intangible assets
intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.  
the cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the  
date of acquisition. following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  
net of accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets, as follows:
goodwill 
no amortisation
acquired software 
3 - 10 years
internally developed software 
3 - 10 years
software development in progress 
no amortisation
brands 
10 - 15 years
other separately acquired intangible assets 
3 - 10 years
property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment comprises land and buildings, fixtures and fittings, 
tools and equipment, leasehold improvements and assets under construction and 
prepayments. property, plant and equipment is measured initially at cost comprising 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date,  
when the asset is available for use. government grants related to assets are deducted 
in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset. subsequent to initial recognition property, 
plant and equipment is measured at cost net of accumulated depreciation and  
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets, as follows:
land 
no depreciation
buildings, including investment property:
 technical installations within the property 
10 - 30 years
 foundation and bearing structure 
80 years
 remaining property 
40 years
fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 
3 - 20 years
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the expected lease term  
of the related lease and the estimated useful lives of 12 years.
the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively,  
if necessary. 
right-of-use assets
at contract inception it is assessed whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. a single 
recognition and measurement approach is applied for all leases, except for short-term 
leases and leases of low value assets. right-of-use assets representing the right to use  
the underlying assets and lease liabilities to make lease payments are recognised.
right-of-use assets are recognised at the commencement date of the lease. right-of-
use assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. the cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and 
lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter  
of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
land and buildings 
1 - 60 years
fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 
1 - 5 years
the short-term lease recognition exemption is applied to short-term leases (leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). the lease of low value assets recognition exemption is applied to 
leases that are considered to be low value. lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low value assets are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.

investment property is property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or 
both, not for use in the supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. 
investment property is measured initially at cost comprising purchase price and any 
directly attributable expenditure including transaction costs. subsequent to initial 
recognition investment property is measured at cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. depreciation is calculated on a straight-line  
basis over the estimated useful lives of the investment property. the useful lives are 
similar to those of other buildings.
borrowing costs
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of 
an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended 
use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. all other 
borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. borrowing costs consist 
of interest and other costs that are incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds.
investments in subsidiaries
investments in subsidiaries are measured in the parent company’s statement of financial 
position using the equity method. the share of profit/loss from subsidiaries, net of tax is 
recognised in the parent company’s income statement.
investments in joint ventures
investments in joint ventures are measured in the statement of financial position using 
the equity method. the share of profit/loss from joint ventures, net of tax is recognised  
in the income statement. 
impairment testing of non-current assets
goodwill and software development in progress are tested annually. the carrying amount 
of other non-current assets is evaluated annually for indications of impairment.
if indications of impairment exist, tests are performed to determine whether recognition 
of impairment losses is necessary for individual assets as well as groups of assets.  
if the recoverable amount is lower than an asset’s carrying amount, an impairment  
loss is recognised so that the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. 
the recoverable amount is the higher value of an asset’s net sales price and its value 
in use. the value in use is assessed as the present value of the expected net cash flow 
from utilisation of the asset or the group of assets and the expected net cash flow from 
disposal of the asset or the group of assets after the end of the useful life.
non-current assets held for sale
the group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be 
recovered primarily through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use. such 
non-current assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. the criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the 
sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
and the sale is expected to occur within one year from the date of the classification.  
non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of calculated cost (weighted averages) and net  
realisable value.
calculated cost comprises the purchase cost and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition, which include cost of transportation 
from central warehouses to individual stores. supplier discounts attributable to the  
articles in inventory reduce the calculated cost. borrowing costs are not included in  
calculated cost.
net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
trade receivables, securities and other financial assets
financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through 
profit or loss, based on two criteria: the business model for managing the assets, and 
whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding. purchases or sales of financial assets 
are recognised on the trade date. with the exception of trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component, the group initially measures a financial asset 
at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs. trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component 
are measured at transaction price.
financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest 
method and are subject to impairment. gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. this category is most 
relevant for the group, and generally it applies to trade and other receivables.
subsequently financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the 
statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as 
financial expenses (negative net changes in fair value) or financial income (positive net 
changes in fair value) in the income statement. financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated 
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. financial assets are classified 
as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the 
near term. derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified 
as held for trading, unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. this 
category includes derivatives not designated as hedges and securities, as they are held 
for trading.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
at present the category financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  
income is not relevant for the group.
a financial asset or a part of a financial asset is derecognised from the statement of 
financial position, when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or 
the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed 
an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party 
under a “pass-through” arrangement, and the group has either transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or the group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
impairment is recognised as an allowance for expected credit losses for all debt 
instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. the expected credit losses are 
based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive, discounted at an 
approximation of the original effective interest rate. the expected cash flows include 
any cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are 
integral to the contractual terms. for credit exposures for which there has not been 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, expected credit losses are 
provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 
12 months. for those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected 
over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default. for 
trade receivables, the group applies a simplified approach in calculating expected credit 
losses, and recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each 
reporting date irrespectively of changes in credit risk using a provision matrix, which is 
based on historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to 
the debtors and the economic environment. a financial asset is written off when there is 
no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
prepayments
prepayments are measured at cost price.
cash and short-term deposits
cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at 
banks and on hand and short-term deposits.
equity - development projects reserve
the development projects reserve, which is recognised in the separate parent company 
financial statements, comprises an amount equalling the capitalised development 
projects excluding payments for separable assets e.g. software licenses, and adjusted 
for the income tax effect. the reserve is an undistributable equity reserve, and cannot 
be used for dividends or for covering any deficits. the reserve is reduced as the 
development projects are sold or amortised by way of a transfer from development 
projects reserve to the distributable equity reserves. 
pensions
the group has entered into defined contribution pension schemes and similar 
arrangements with the majority of the group’s employees. contributions to defined 
contribution plans where the group pays fixed pension payments to independent 
pension funds are recognised in the income statement in the period to which they relate, 
and any contributions outstanding are recognised in the statement of financial position 
as other payables. 
for defined benefit plans an annual actuarial calculation (projected unit credit method)  
is made of the present value of future benefits under the defined benefit plan. the 
present value is determined on the basis of assumptions about the future development 
in variables such as salary levels, interest rates, inflation, retirement age and mortality. 
the actuarial present value is recognised in the statement of financial position under 
pension obligations. pension costs for the year are recognised in the income statement 
based on actuarial estimates at the beginning of the year. any difference between the 
calculated development in plan liabilities and realised amounts determined at year end 
constitutes actuarial gains or losses and is recognised in other comprehensive income.
provisions
provisions are recognised when, as a result of past events, the group has a legal or  
a constructive obligation and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources  
embodying economic benefits to settle the obligation. the amount recognised as a  
provision is management’s best estimate of the expenses required to settle the obligation. 
on measurement of provisions, the costs required to settle the obligation are discounted 
if the effect is material to the measurement of the obligation. 
a provision for onerous short-term leases and leases of low value assets is recognised 
when the expected benefits to be obtained by the group from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract. 
insurance provisions include the actuarial estimated costs expected to be paid by the 
group for insured events existing at the reporting date and risk margin. the estimate 
includes amounts expected to be incurred for the settlement of the obligations.  
discounting is performed based on an estimate of the expected payment period.
other provisions include among other things warranties, restructuring costs and jubilee 
benefits. provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised upon a sale of a product for 
which the group is liable for future warranty costs. initial recognition is based on historical 
experience. the estimate of warranty-related costs is revised annually. restructuring 
costs are recognised under liabilities when a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been 
announced to the parties affected no later than at the end of the reporting period.
loans, trade payables and other financial liabilities
financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans, borrowings and payables, or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. all financial liabilities are

notes to the consolidated financial statements
recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs. the group’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
subsequently financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the 
statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as 
financial items in the income statement. financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon 
initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. financial liabilities are classified 
as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. 
this category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the group 
that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships. separated  
embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated  
as effective hedging instruments. the group has not designated any financial liabilities  
as at fair value through profit or loss.
after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and payables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. accordingly, any difference between 
the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement as financial 
expenses over the term of the loan or at derecognition. this category is most relevant for 
the group. this category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. when an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and a recognition of a new liability. the difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
lease liabilities
at the commencement date of leases, lease liabilities are recognised measured at the 
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. the lease payments 
include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts 
expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. the lease payments also include 
the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised and payments 
of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects that the option to 
terminate is exercised. variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or  
a rate are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that 
triggers the payment occurs.
in calculating the present value of lease payments, the incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date is used unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is readily 
determinable. after the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased 
to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. in addition, 
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change 
in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g. changes to future payments  
resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments)  
or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
deferred income
deferred income is measured at the consideration received or receivable. 
taxes
current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. the tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised  
in equity and not in the income statement or the statement of other comprehensive 
income. 
deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date.
deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred 
tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised. the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the income statement 
is recognised outside the income statement. deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in the statement of other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
accounting policies, cash flow statement
the cash flow statement shows the cash flows from operating, investing and financing 
activities for the year, the year’s changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as cash and 
cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
the cash flow effect of acquisitions and disposals of enterprises is shown separately in 
cash flows from investing activities. cash flows from acquired businesses are recognised 
in the cash flow statement from the date of acquisition. cash flows from disposals of 
businesses are recognised up until the date of disposal.
cash flows from operating activities are calculated according to the indirect method as 
the profit before tax adjusted for non-cash operating items, changes in working capital, 
interest payments and income taxes paid.
cash flows from investing activities comprise payments in connection with acquisitions 
and disposals of businesses and of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and other non-current assets as well as acquisition and disposal of 
securities not classified as cash and cash equivalents.
cash flows from financing activities comprise changes in the size or composition of share 
capital and related costs as well as the raising of loans, repayment of interest-bearing 
debt including lease liabilities, and payment of dividends to shareholders.
cash flows in other currencies than the functional currency are translated using average 
exchange rates unless these deviate significantly from the rate at the transaction date.
accounting policies, other
discontinued operations
discontinued operations represent a separate major line of business disposed of. the 
results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement as 
profit/loss for the year from discontinued operations, net of tax. the comparative figures 
are restated. eliminations between the continuing and the discontinued operations are 
presented to reflect continuing operations as post-separation. assets and liabilities related 
to the discontinued operations disposed of are not presented as separate line items in 
the comparative figures in the statement of financial position as the criteria for held for 
sale classification was not regarded as met for the discontinued operations at the end 
of the comparative period. cash flows from discontinued operations are not presented 
serarately in the cash flow statement, but are included in net cash flows from operating 
activities, from investment activities and from financing activities. the effect from the  
discontinued operations on the cash flow statement is presented in note 10 along with 
other specifications related to the discontinued operations.
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company, salling group a/s, 
and the subsidiaries in which salling group a/s directly or indirectly exercises control. 
salling group a/s exercises control, if salling group a/s is exposed to or has rights to 
variable returns arising from its involvement in a company and may affect these returns 
through its power over the company. 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the accounts for the parent 
company and the subsidiaries and are a pooling of accounting items of similar nature.  
on consolidation intra-group transactions are eliminated.
joint arrangements are activities or enterprises in which the group exercises joint 
control through cooperation agreements with one or more parties. joint control implies 
that decisions on relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control over the arrangement. joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures or joint 
operations. joint operations are activities, where the participants have direct rights over 
assets and are subject to direct liability, whereas joint ventures are activities, where the 
participants solely have rights over the net assets.
business combinations of entities under common control are accounted for using the 
pooling of interests method, and the comparative figures are restated.
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, according to 
which the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. if the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously 
held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. any contingent consideration to be 
transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous 
interest held, over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. after initial  
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  
for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, 
from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units that  
are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 
put options regarding non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, which are written 
in connection with business combinations, are treated according to the anticipated 
acquisition method, according to which the non-controlling interests that are comprised 
by the put options are considered to be purchased at the point in time where the put 
options are written. non-controlling interests comprised of call options that in reality give 
present access to the returns associated with that ownership interest are considered to 
be purchased at the point in time where the call options are written. an amount equal 
to the financial obligation is recognised as part of the cost price of the investments in 
subsidiaries. as a consequence no non-controlling interests are recognised in the income 
statement, the statement of other comprehensive income or the equity regarding the 
comprised non-controlling interests, as the non-controlling interests are regarded as 
purchased. the obligation regarding the put and relevant call options is recognised 
as part of other non-current financial liabilities and is measured at fair value at initial 
recognition. subsequently, the obligation regarding the put and relevant call options is 
measured at amortised cost.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
foreign currency translation
for each of the enterprises in the group, a functional currency is determined. the 
functional currency is the currency used in the primary financial environment in which 
the enterprise operates. transactions denominated in other currencies than the 
functional currency are foreign currency transactions. 
on initial recognition, foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rates at the transaction date. foreign exchange differences 
arising between the exchange rates at the transaction date and at the date of payment 
are recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial expenses.
receivables and payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rates at the reporting date. the 
difference between the exchange rates at the reporting date and at the date at which the 
receivable or payable arose or the rates in the latest annual report is recognised in the 
income statement as financial income or financial expenses.
foreign consolidated enterprises’ statements of financial position are translated to 
danish kroner using the exchange rates at the reporting date, while the enterprises’ 
income statements and the statement of other comprehensive income are translated 
using the average exchange rates.
foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the opening equity of such 
foreign enterprises using the exchange rates at the reporting date and on translation 
of the income statements and the statement of other comprehensive income from the 
exchange rates at the transaction date to the exchange rates at the reporting date are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and in a separate translation reserve under 
equity.
derivative financial instruments 
the group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts 
and interest rate swaps, to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks, 
respectively. such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
designated as and qualifying for recognition as a cash flow hedge are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, and are reclassified to the income statement in the periods 
when the hedged item affects the income statement. changes in the fair value of other 
derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement. the positive 
and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are included in other financial 
assets or other financial liabilities, respectively.
fair value measurement
the group uses the fair value concept in connection with certain disclosure requirements 
and for recognition of some financial instruments. fair value is defined as the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants (“exit price”).
the fair value is a market-based and not an entity-specific valuation. the group uses the 
assumptions that the market participants would use for the pricing of the asset or liability 
based on existing market conditions, including assumptions relating to risks. the group’s 
intention to own the asset or settle the liability is thus not taken into consideration, when 
the fair value is determined.
the fair value measurement is based on the primary market. if a primary market does 
not exist, the measurement is based on the most favourable market, which is the market 
that maximises the price of the asset or liability less transaction and transportation costs.
to the widest possible extent, the fair value measurement is based on market values 
in active markets (level 1) or alternatively on values derived from observable market 
information (level 2). if such observable information is not available or cannot be used 
without significant modifications, fair values are based on generally accepted valuation 
methods and reasonable estimates (level 3). 
the group determines, whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy, 
by re-assessing the categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
main and key figures in the 5-year summary
changes to the composition of the group and the accounting principles applied have the 
consequence that not all of the main and key figures included in the 5-year summary in 
financial highlights for the group are comparable, as described below:
the main and key figures for the financial years 2016 - 2018 have not been adjusted to 
reflect the changed accounting principles resulting from the implementation of ifrs 16 
regarding leases in the group, as the changes have been implemented retrospectively 
but with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognised on  
1 january 2019. the comparative figures have not been restated as permitted by the 
specific transition provisions in the standard.
discontinued operations are included in all the main and key figures for the financial 
years 2016 - 2017 presented in the 5-year summary. thus, the main and key figures for 
the financial years 2016 - 2017 are not comparable to the main and key figures for the 
financial years 2018 - 2020.
the key figures that are included in the 5-year summary of financial highlight for the 
group are calculated as follows:
operating margin is operating profit (ebit) divided by total revenue.
return on equity is total profit for the year divided by the average equity (average of  
equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year).
net debt/ebitda is the net interest bearing debt divided by operating profit before  
depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses (ebitda).

consolidated financial statements
notes to the consolidated financial statements
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result  
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or  
liabilities affected in future periods.
in the process of applying the accounting policies, management has made the following 
judgements, estimates and assumptions, which have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements:
recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
in recognising right-of-use assets and lease liabilities the lease terms of the leases have 
to be determined. the lease term is the non-cancellable term of the lease together with 
any periods covered by an option to extend the lease, if it is reasonably certain to be 
exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably 
certain not to be exercised. several lease contracts include extension and termination 
options. the group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain 
whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. that is, all relevant 
factors that create an economic incentive to exercise either the renewal or termination 
are considered. after the commencement date, the group reassesses the lease term, 
if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and 
affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g. 
construction of significant leasehold improvements).
for leases of land and buildings renewal periods are included as part of the lease term 
for leases with shorter non-cancellable periods. the renewal periods are included for the 
period that the group expects to continue the lease taking into consideration that the 
retail business might look different in the future compared to the present set-up. the 
renewal periods for leases of land and buildings with longer non-cancellable periods are 
not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised. 
in addition, the renewal options for leases of motor vehicles are not included as part of 
the lease term because the group typically leases motor vehicles for no longer than the 
non-cancellable period and, hence, is not exercising any renewal options.
valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of use assets and 
investment property
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment 
property are tested for impairment, if there is an indication of impairment. for goodwill 
and intangible asset that are not yet in use, annual impairment tests are carried out. an 
impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than the 
asset’s carrying amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on 
available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar 
assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. the 
value in use calculation is based on a dcf model. the cash flows are derived from the 
financial five-year plan. the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used 
for the dcf model as well as the development in turnover and gross margins during the 
forecast period and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. for most intangible 
assets no fair value less costs of disposal exists. the key assumptions used to determine 
the recoverable amount are disclosed and further explained in the relevant notes.
depreciation and amortisation
the useful lives and residual values of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
right-of-use assets and investment property are reviewed annually based on available 
information. if necessary, they are adjusted prospectively. changes to estimates of  
useful lives and residual values may affect the annual depreciation and amortisation  
and thereby the results for the year significantly.
inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of calculated cost (weighted averages) and net 
realisable value. the calculated cost comprises supplier discounts. supplier discounts 
are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the group. a specific assessment of the need for write-down  
for obsolescence of inventories is made based on the future sales potential.

divided on countries, where salling group has operating activities, the effective tax rate 
of 20.8 % (14.8 % in 2019) shown above can be specified as follows: denmark 23.2 %  
(13.0 % in 2019), sweden 4.8 % (-3.1 % in 2019), germany 3.8 % (28.0 % in 2019) and 
poland 19.8 % (20.1 % in 2019). the low effective tax rate in germany for 2020 is due to 
adjustments to prior periods’ taxes on group level. the low effective tax rate in sweden 
for 2019 and 2020 is due to the not capitalised tax losses carry forwards. the low tax  
rate in denmark in 2019 was due to non-taxable income from the sale of subsidiaries.

the recoverable amount of the goodwill related to the danish retail activities has been 
determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from the 
financial five-year plan approved by management. the pre-tax discount rate applied to 
cash flow projections is 6 % (6 % in 2019), and cash flows beyond the five-year period  
are extrapolated using a 2 % growth rate, which is the expected long-term inflation rate  
(2 % in 2019). as a result of the impairment test management did not identify any 
impairment losses regarding goodwill. 
the calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: 
development in turnover and gross margins during the forecast period and growth rates 
used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period, as well as the discount rate 
used. development in turnover and gross margins is based on expectations of an average 
growth for 2021 - 2025.
discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks, taking into 
consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that 
have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. the discount rate calculation 
is based on the specific circumstances of the group, and is derived from its weighted 
average cost of capital (wacc). the wacc takes into account both debt and equity. the 
cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the group’s investors. 
the cost of debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the group is obliged to 
service. the beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data. 
adjustments to the discount rate are made to factor in the specific amount and timing of 
the future tax flows in order to reflect a pre-tax discount rate. 
management has considered and assessed reasonably possible changes for the key  
assumptions and has not identified any instances that would cause the carrying amount 
of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
during 2020 and 2019 no impairment losses have been recognised regarding intangible 
assets.
impairment losses, if any, and reversal of impairment losses, if any, are recognised in the 
income statement as part of impairment losses.

impairment losses during the year
during 2020 impairment losses were recognised regarding a few buildings that had been vacated 
in connection with relocations of the stores to other locations, and where it was assessed that 
the expected sales price of the buildings were lower than the carrying amount of the buildings. 
impairment losses were recognised regarding leaseholds that had been closed or vacated in 
connection with relocations. also a few stores were, due to competitive pressures in the local areas 
of the stores, not sufficiently profitable to cover the full carrying amount of the investments. in 
total impairment losses were recognised regarding 10 danish stores and 1 german store. at the 
same time, an impairment loss has been reversed regarding 1 danish store, where the profitability 
has increased sufficiently to cover the investments. the impairment losses and reversal of 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as part of impairment losses.

investment property comprises a shopping centre and flats located adjacent to salling 
group’s stores.
during 2020 impairment losses were recognised regarding one danish and a few german  
investment property, where the expected sales price of the investment property is 
lower than the carrying amount of the investment property. no impairment losses were 
recognised in 2019. the impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses, if any, are 
recognised in the income statement as part of impairment losses.
the estimated fair value of investment property amounted to dkk 1,221 million at  
31 december 2020 (dkk 1,036 million at 31 december 2019). the fair value is not based  
on a valuation by an independent valuer.
the fair value of the investment property falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
the fair value is based on a rate of return compared with a price per square metre.  
the rate of return is based on experience with real estate deals.

hedging activities and derivatives
salling group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations.  
the primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and 
interest rate risk. the group’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage 
risk is explained below. 
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
salling group uses foreign currency-denominated forward contracts to manage some 
of its transaction exposures and intercompany balances. the foreign exchange forward 
contracts are not designated as cash flow hedging instruments and are typically entered 
into for periods of up to 3 months.
derivatives designated as hedging instruments (cash flow hedges)
the hedged item is the highly probable interest rate payment on the group’s mortgage 
loan portfolio. the loan portfolio has been hedged in layers, where each layer is hedged 
by a single interest rate swap. the hedged item and the hedging instrument are identical 
in respect of the critical terms. to illustrate the robustness of the hedge relationship,  
a regression analysis using historical monthly swap rate, cibor and bond price data  
for a rolling 5 year period is performed. hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
•   unexpected changes to the size of hedged items from sale of properties with repayment 
of related mortgage loans,
•   counterparties not fulfilling their contractual obligations,
•   refinancing of underlying mortgage bonds, if known critical terms should be changed.

the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and affect the income statement during 
the coming 10 years. during the coming year dkk -103 million is expected to affect profit 
before tax (dkk -109 million in 2019), dkk -266 million is expected to affect profit before 
tax during 1 - 5 years (dkk -308 million in 2019), and after 5 years dkk -26 million is 
expected to affect profit before tax (dkk -26 million in 2019).
the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is 
recognised in other comprehensive income, while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. the amount accumulated in other comprehensive 
income is reclassified to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement. 
there was no ineffectiveness recognised in 2020 or 2019. 
the ibor reform refers to the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes 
the replacement of some interbank offered rates (ibor) with alternative benchmark 
rates. at the moment, it’s unclear what will happen to cibor references in the future. 
therefore, it has been assumed that the cibor interest rate, on which the group’s 
hedged debt is based, does not change as a result of the ibor reform. in assessing 
whether the hedges are expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis, it has 
been assumed, that the cibor interest rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged debt 
and the interest rate swap that hedges it, is based is not altered by the ibor reform.

fair value
for cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, other receivables 
and payables and other short-term receivables and payables the carrying amount is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value, largely due to the short-term maturities of the 
financial instruments.
cash flow hedges and other derivatives not defined as hedges are valued using valuation 
techniques, which are based on market observable inputs, and thereby fall within level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy. the most frequently applied valuation technique for interest 
rate swaps, i.e. a fixed rate swapped for a floating rate, is determining the present value 
of the fixed leg and the floating leg using a relevant swap curve.
the fair value of securities is derived from quoted market prices in active markets, and 
falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
the fair value of mortgage loans is derived from quoted market prices in active markets, 
and falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. fair value of the remaining borrowing 
items falls within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and is calculated on the basis of 
discounted interests and instalments.
risks arising from financial instruments
the group’s main risks are market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
and interest rates, liquidity risk relating to the availability of funds to support business 
needs and credit risk relating to the undesirable event of a default among the group’s 
financial counterparties. there has been no structural changes in the group’s risk 
exposure or risks compared to 2019. the policies for managing risk are explained below.
the overall framework for financial risk management is set out in salling group a/s’ 
financial policy approved by the board of directors. the objective of the financial policy 
and the independent controls, that are established, is to minimise the potential adverse 
impact on the group’s financial performance.  the financial policy is reviewed and 
updated on a regular basis. salling group a/s has a centralised management of financial 
risks undertaken by group treasury.

in accordance with policies, group treasury uses derivative financial instruments with the 
purpose of hedging exposures related to the group’s operations and its source of financing. 
all derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialists that 
have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. it is the group’s policy to minimise  
the potential adverse impact on the group’s financial performance and protect the group 
against negative impact from market risks. group treasury has primarily used forward 
contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures and interest rate swaps to hedge interest 
rate exposures. treasury transactions and hedging activities are recognised in a treasury 
management system with a high degree of system integration, control and automation of 
processes on treasury transactions. 
market risk
market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in market prices. market risk comprises three types of risk: 
currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risks such as commodity risk. financial 
instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, debt, fixed 
income investments and derivative financial instruments.  
the sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the positions as at 31 december 
2020 and 2019. the sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount 
of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the 
proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis 
of the hedge designations in place 31 december.
currency risks
foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will 
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. the group’s exposure to the risk 
of changes in foreign exchange rate relates primarily to the group’s operating activities 
and the group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. the framework for hedging 
guidelines and risk mandate is covered by the fx risk management policy. 
the majority of purchases of goods for resale made by the group are denominated 
in the parent company’s functional currency dkk. however, some trade purchases 
are made in other currencies, primarily eur and usd. it is the group’s policy to hedge 
known purchase orders in specific material currencies. presently, usd is assessed to be 
a material currency, and purchase orders in usd are hedged. purchase orders in other 
currencies are considered immaterial, and are therefore not hedged. 
hedge accounting has not been used regarding the hedging of purchase orders. in other 
words, changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in the income 
statement on a continuous basis, which can result in timing discrepancies.

material committed and uncommitted investments in foreign currency can be hedged. 
hedge accounting is not used regarding such hedges.
according to the fx risk management policy, cash positions (internal and external)  
are hedged. according to the policy exposures in eur need not be hedged.
the group’s net currency exposure is the basis for determining the group’s risk.  
the hedging principles determine the risk neutral position (fully hedged) in regards of 
foreign exchange exposures. deviations from the risk neutral position are summarised  
in an absolute var-based risk figure covering the various currency exposures. the foreign 
exchange exposures and the var-based risk figure are monitored and controlled on a 
daily basis, thereby securing compliance with thresholds and policies.
the following overview illustrates the effect on the consolidated income statement  
and the consolidated equity that would result at the balance sheet date, from changes  
in currency exchange rates that are reasonable possible for material currencies:

the sensitivity analysis only includes currency exposures arising from financial 
instruments. the applied change in the exchange rates is based on historical currency 
fluctuations. a decrease in the foreign currencies would have the opposite effect as the 
impact shown in the above overview.
interest rate risks
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. the group’s 
exposure to risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to group’s mortgage 
loan financing and its bond holdings. it is the group’s policy to limit fluctuations in 
interest rate expenses, and maintain a relative high degree of certainty for future interest 
payments. this is obtained through a diversified loan portfolio, consisting of both fixed 
and floating rate mortgage loans in combination with interest rate hedges. the hedged 
loan portfolio is actively managed by group treasury reflecting ongoing risk assessment 
and expectations for the future development in interest rates.  
having a longer-term perspective for the mortgage loan portfolio, it is the group policy  
to keep an overall duration target for the mortgage loan portfolio in the range of 4 to 8. 
the potential impact on the equity ratio will be considered and controlled by balancing 
the maturity of the hedging instruments.
as at 31 december 2020, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, 
approximately 96 % of the group’s mortgage loan portfolio are at a fixed rate, compared 
to 97 % as at 31 december 2019.
a general increase of 1 %-point in interest rates is estimated, all other things being equal, 
to affect profit before tax by dkk -13 million (dkk -31 million in 2019), and pre-tax equity 
by dkk 156 million (dkk 188 million in 2019). the direct impact on pre-tax equity is due 
to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.

the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount of net debt, the ratio 
of fixed to floating interest rate of the debt and the interest rate swap portfolio in place as 
at 31 december.
for receivables from and payables to entities with controlling or significant influence and 
other current financial assets interest rates are fixed based on the relevant interbank rate 
with a debit or credit margin. other receivables or payables are not interest-bearing if they 
are paid when due.
liquidity risks
liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to settle its financial liabilities, when 
they fall due.
the group ensures liquidity through flexibility and diversification of borrowing, maturity 
and renegotiation time points, as well as counterparts. flexibility in cash resources 
ensures that the group can act appropriately in case of unforeseen changes in liquidity. 
the liquidity reserves consist of cash, securities and undrawn credit facilities. the group 
currently has no covenants. the group assesses the liquidity risk to be low.
the group uses supply chain financing (scf) to strengthen its financial position. scf 
is based on a three-way relationship between salling group, a given supplier and the 
syndication banks facilitating the scf programme. a number of salling group’s suppliers 
participate in the scf programme. when suppliers participate in the scf programme they 
have the option to receive early payment from the syndication banks based on the invoices, 
that have been sent to salling group, when salling group has received and approved the 
goods or services, and accepted to pay the invoices at maturity date via the syndication 
banks. the arrangement of early payment is a transaction between the supplier and the 
syndication banks, and does not involve salling group. the advantage of participating in 
the scf programme for suppliers is that their cash position can be improved.

financial assets and financial liabilities - continued
salling group’s liability in relation to the scf programme is the invoices, which are 
recognised and presented as trade payables until maturity. any extended payment  
terms are agreed with the individual vendors directly, and are not a consequence of  
the scf programme. the payment terms of the suppliers that are participting in the  
scf programme are no more than 120 days. 
as at 31 december 2020 the group has utilised the scf facility by dkk 6.8 billion 
(dkk 5.9 billion in 2019).
the overview below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities 
based on contractual undiscounted payments. the undiscounted cash flows differ from 
both the carrying value and the fair value. floating rate interest is estimated using the 
prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.

credit risks
credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial 
instrument leading to a financial loss. the group is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with 
banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
the group prepares credit ratings of customers and counterparties on a regular basis. credit 
risks are managed on the basis of internal credit ratings and credit lines for customers and 
financial counterparties. the credit lines are determined on the basis of the customers’ 
and counterparties’ creditworthiness and local market risks. counterparty credit lines are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis and may be updated throughtout the year subject to approval 
of management. limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate 
financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
the group is exposed to credit risks from trade and other receivables, balances with banks 
in the form of deposits and other financial instruments. the majority of the group’s sales 
are made in cash, and therefore, the credit risks are very low. the group reduces its credit 
risks with banks by only doing business with banks with high credit ratings. moreover, excess 
liquidity is deposited with banks or placed in liquid government and mortgage bonds with a 
rating of minimum aa2. the overall duration of salling group’s bond portfolio will typically be 
low, currently 1.0.

the group recognises an allowance for impairment of receivables. the entire allowance for 
impairment of receivables relates to trade receivables, as the allowance regarding any other 
financial assets is immaterial. an impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date 
using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. the provision rates are based on 
days past due, and a provision is recognised for not due receivables as well as past due 
receivables. as at the 31 december 2020 the provision amounts to dkk 7 million (31 december 
2019: dkk 6 million). the maximum credit risk exposure at the reporting date is the carrying 
value of each class of financial assets. the group does not hold collateral or other forms of 
credit insurance as security. the group assesses the concentration of credit risk with respect  
to receivables as low.

in the group an unrecognised deferred tax asset of dkk 6 million exists both as at  
31 december 2020 and 31 december 2019 related to the swedish subsidiary. the 
deferred tax asset is unrecognised due to uncertainties regarding the future taxable 
profits against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. the swedish subsidiary has 
suffered a loss in both 2020 and 2019.

pensions
the group has entered into pension schemes and similar arrangements with most of the 
group’s employees. the majority of the group’s pension schemes are defined contribution 
plans. for a few former employees and some members of the founder’s family defined 
benefit plans exist. the defined benefit plans are lifelong. the defined benefit plans guarantee 
fixed amounts per year adjusted for price inflation, and the plans are fully unfunded.

the sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a significant assumption, keeping all other 
assumptions constant. the sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual 
change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would 
occur in isolation of one another.
no contributions will be made to the plans in the future. the average duration of the defined 
benefit obligation as at 31 december 2020 is 30 years (31 years in 2019). dkk 15 million is 
expexted to be paid from the plans in 2021.

provisions - continued
the provision for onerous contacts, if any, comprises provision for lease contracts 
for short-term leases and leases of low value assets and other contracts, in which the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under them. the provision is calculated as the least net 
cost of exiting from the contracts, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contracts 
and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil them.
the insurance provision comprises the estimated expenditure based on actuarial 
calculations that the group expects to incur. the insurance provision is based on insured 
events that have taken place before year end. the estimate includes the direct and 
indirect amounts that the group expects to pay to settle the outstanding claims. the 
provision is discounted based on estimates of the payment period, and dkk 59 million  
is expected to fall due after more than 5 years (dkk 56 million in 2019).
other provisions comprise a provision for warranties, a provision for jubilee benefits and 
a provision for pending lawsuits. the warranty provision is recognised upon a sale of a 
product for which the group is liable for future warranty costs. initial recognition is based 
on historical experience. the existing provision will expire in 2032. the provision for jubilee 
benefits concerns the danish employees, and is estimated based on the expected jubilees 
for current employees. of the provision dkk 17 million is expected to fall due after more 
than 5 years (dkk 16 million in 2019). no further information is provided regarding the  
provision for pending lawsuits as the information might harm the group’s position.

during 2019 no business combinations took place. 
during june 2020 the acquisition of uk retailer tesco’s polish business was announced, 
and a prepayment took place related to the acquisition during 2020. the deal was 
completed on 16 march 2021.

acquired 51 % of the issued share capital and voting rights in the company. 
bodebjerg aps is one of skagenfood a/s’ suppliers, and it is the intention to continue 
running bodebjerg aps as a separate company supplying both skagenfood a/s and 
other group companies with high quality meat products. the purchase consideration 
transferred consisted of cash. skagenfood a/s holds call options to purchase the 
remaining 49 % of the shares in bodebjerg aps at a favourable price. the call options  
can be exercised in 2023 and 2025. 
as the call options in reality give skagenfood a/s present access to the returns associated 
with that ownership interest, the non-controlling interests that are comprised by the call 
options are considered to be purchased at the point in time, where the call options are 
written. thus, no non-controlling interests are recognised in the income statement,  
the statement of other comprehensive income or the equity regarding the comprised 
non-controlling interests. the call options are recognised in the group at dkk 3 million  
as at 31 december 2020.

skagenfood a/s is one of the main players in denmark regarding sale of meal boxes, and 
salling group intents to continue running skagenfood a/s along side the group’s other 
online-activities. the purchase consideration transferred consisted of cash. salling group 
a/s entered into a contractual commitment to purchase the remaining 20 % of the shares 
in skagenfood a/s. the founders of the company held put options that allowed them to 
sell the remaining shares at prices dependent on the development of the company. the 
put options could be exercised in 2019 and 2023. during 2019 the first put option was 
exercised and an additional 10 % of skagenfood a/s was acquired. 
the remaining put option is treated according to the anticipated acquisition method, 
according to which the non-controlling interests that are comprised by the put options 
are considered to be purchased at the point in time where the put options are written. 
thus, no non-controlling interests are recognised in the income statement, the statement 
of other comprehensive income or the equity regarding the comprised non-controlling 
interests. the remaining put option is recognised at dkk 16 million as at 31 december 
2020 (dkk 10 million in 2019).

capital management
the group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the group will be able to  
continue as going concerns while maximising the return to the shareholders through  
the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. for the purpose of the group’s capital  
management, capital includes total equity.
the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in 
economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. to maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders 
or issue new shares.
the group has no covenants in relation to bank facilities or other financing activities, 
hence as at 31 december 2020 or 2019 no covenants exist.
no changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital  
during the years ended 31 december 2020 and 2019.

events after the reporting period
no subsequent events have occurred that affect the annual report for 2020. the current 
covid-19 crisis has had a positive effect on both revenue and profit for the year 2020, 
whereas the crisis had no effect on the annual report for 2019. the covid-19 crisis has 
also had a positive effect on revenue and profits for the first months of 2021, but this 
effect is expected to be reduced, as the group’s markets gradually reopen.
in june 2020, salling group announced the acquisition of the uk retailer tesco’s polish 
business. the deal was completed on 16 march 2021. the purchase price is dkk 281 
million (pln 171 million). of the total purchase price, dkk 41 million (pln 25 million) was 
paid upfront in may 2020. 
as per the date of publication of the annual report for salling group a/s for 2020 it has 
not been possible to obtain sufficient financial data to fulfill the reporting requirements 
according to ifrs 3 regarding business combinations. therefore information about the 
opening balance, the acquired net assets at the time of the acquisition and goodwill is  
not included in these financial statements.

a reclassification of dkk 132 million has been made in the comparison figures between 
land and buildings and investment property, as a few buildings had incorrectly been  
presented as land and buildings instead of investment property (dkk 133 million at  
1 january 2019). the accounting principles applied for investment property are similar  
to the accounting principles applied for land and buildings.

derivatives not designed as hedging instruments reflect partly the positive or negative 
change in fair value of those foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated 
in hedge relationships, but are, nevertheless, intended to reduce the level of foreign  
currency risk and partly the changes in fair value of those interest rate swap contracts 
used by the group to hedge cibor-based mortgage loans. 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include investments in listed danish 
mortgage bonds. fair values of these bonds are determined by reference to published 
price quotations in an active market.

hedge accounting and derivatives
cash flow hedging is used on group level to ensure that part of group’s interest rate  
risk exposure is at a fixed rate. in the parent company hedge accounting is not used.  
for further information about the use of hedge accounting please refer to note 16 in  
the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value
for cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, other receivables  
and payables and other short-term receivables and payables the carrying amount is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value, largely due to the short-term maturities of the 
financial instruments. 
derivatives not defined as hedges are valued using valuation techniques, which are based 
on market observable inputs, and thereby fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
the most frequently applied valuation technique for interest rate swaps, i.e. a fixed rate 
swapped for a floating rate, is determining the present value of the fixed leg and the 
floating leg using a relevant swap curve.
the fair value of securities is derived from quoted market prices in active markets,  
and falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
fair value of the remaining borrowing items falls within level 2 of the fair value  
hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.

risks arising from financial instruments
the parent company’s main risks are market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign  
exchange rates and interest rates, liquidity risk relating to the availability of funds to  
support business needs and credit risk relating to the undesirable event of a default 
among the parent company’s financial counterparties. there has been no structural 
changes in the risk exposure or risks compared to 2019. 
for an in-depth description of the policies for managing risks please refer to note 16  
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
currency risks 
foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will 
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. the parent company’s exposure 
to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rate relates primarily to the operating activities 
and the net investments in foreign subsidiaries. the framework for hedging guidelines 
and risk mandate is covered by the fx risk management policy. 
for a description of the fx risk management please refer to note 16 in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
the following overview illustrates the effect on the parent company income statement 
and the parent company’s equity that would result at the balance sheet date,  
from changes in currency exchange rates that are reasonable possible for material  
currencies:

the sensitivity analysis only includes currency exposures arising from financial  
instruments. the applied change in the exchange rates is based on historical currency  
fluctuations. a decrease in the foreign currencies would have the opposite effect  
as the impact shown in the above overview.
interest rate risks
the parent company’s exposure to risk of changes in market interest rates relates  
to mortgage loans, internal loans and intercompany balances and its bond holdings.  
for further descriptions regarding the overall interest rate risk management please  
refer to note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
a general increase of 1 %-points in interest rates is estimated, all other things  
being equal, to affect profit before tax and pre-tax equity by dkk -21 million

the sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the amount of net debt, the 
ratio of fixed to floating interest rate of the debt and the interest rate swap portfolio  
in place as at 31 december.
for receivables from and payables to entities with controlling or significant influence, 
subsidiaries and other current financial assets interest rates are fixed based on the  
relevant interbank rate with a debit or credit margin. other receivables or payables  
are not interest-bearing if they are paid when due.
liquidity risks
liquidity risk is the risk that the parent company will not be able to settle its financial 
liabilities when they fall due.
the parent company ensures liquidity through flexibility and diversification of borrowing, 
maturity and renegotiation time points, as well as counterparts. flexibility in cash 
resources ensures that the parent company can act appropriately in case of unforeseen 
changes in liquidity. the liquidity reserves consist of cash, securities and undrawn credit 
facilities. the parent company currently has no covenants. the parent company assesses 
the liquidity risk to be low.
the parent company uses supply chain financing (scf) to strengthen its financial 
position. scf is based on a three-way relationship between the parent company, a 
given supplier and the syndication banks facilitating the scf programme. a number 
of the parent company’s suppliers participate in the scf programme. when suppliers 
participate in the scf programme they have the option to receive early payment from 
the syndication banks based on the invoices, that have been sent to the parent company, 
when the parent company has received and approved the goods or services, and 
accepted to pay the invoices at maturity date via the syndication banks. the arrangement 
of early payment is a transaction between the supplier and the syndication banks, 
and does not involve the parent company. the advantage of participating in the scf 
programme for suppliers is that their cash position can be improved.
the parent company’s liability in relation to the scf programme is the invoices, which  
are recognised and presented as trade payables until maturity. any extended payment 
terms are agreed with the individual vendors directly, and are not a consequence of the 
scf programme. the payment terms of the suppliers that are participting in the scf  
programme are no more than 120 days. 
 
 
 
 
as at 31 december 2020 the parent company has utilised the scf facility by 
dkk 6.4 billion (dkk 5.5 billion in 2019).
 
 
 
the overview below summarises the maturity profile of the parent company’s financial 
liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments. the undiscounted cash flows 
differ from both the carrying value and the fair value. floating rate interest is estimated 
using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.

credit risks
credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial 
instrument leading to a financial loss or a counterparty not being able to meet any other 
obligations leading to a financial loss. the parent company is exposed to credit risk from its 
operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other 
financial instruments.
the parent company prepares credit ratings of customers and counterparties on a regular 
basis. credit risks are managed on the basis of internal credit ratings and credit lines for 
customers and financial counterparties. the credit lines are determined on the basis of the 
customers’ and counterparties’ creditworthiness and local market risks. counterparty credit 
lines are reviewed on an ongoing basis and may be updated throughout the year subject to 
approval of management. limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore 
mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

the parent company is exposed to credit risks from trade and other receivables, balances 
with banks in the form of deposits and other financial instruments. the majority of the 
parent company’s sales are made in cash, and therefore, the credit risks are very low.  
the parent company reduces its credit risks with banks by only doing business with banks 
with high credit ratings. moreover, excess liquidity is deposited with banks or placed in liquid 
government and mortgage bonds with a rating of minimum aa2. the overall duration of the 
bond portfolio will typically be low, currently 1.0.

the parent company recognises an allowance for impairment of receivables. the entire 
allowance for impairment of receivables relates to trade receivables, as the allowance 
regarding any other financial assets is immaterial. an impairment analysis is performed 
at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. the 
provision rates are based on days past due, and a provision is recognised for not due 
receivables as well as past due receivables. as at the 31 december 2020 the provision 
amounts to dkk 6 million (31 december 2019: dkk 6 million). the maximum credit risk 
exposure at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.  
the parent company does not hold collateral or other forms of credit insurance as 
security. the parent company assesses the concentration of credit risk with respect to 
receivables as low.

pensions
the parent company has entered into pension schemes and similar arrangements with 
most of the parent company’s employees. the majority of the parent company’s pension 
schemes are defined contribution plans. for a few former employees and some members 
of the founder’s family defined benefit plans exist. the defined benefit plans are lifelong. 
the defined benefit plans guarantee fixed amounts per year adjusted for price inflation, 
and the plans are fully unfunded.

no contributions will be made to the plans in the future. the average duration of the defined 
benefit obligation as at 31 december 2020 is 30 years (31 years in 2019). dkk 15 million is 
expexted to be paid from the plans in 2021.

provisions - continued
the provision for onerous contacts, if any, comprises provision for lease contracts for  
short-term leases and leases of low value assets and other contracts, in which the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under them. the provision is calculated as the least net 
cost of exiting from the contracts, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contracts 
and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil them. 
other provisions comprise a provision for warranties, a provision for jubilee benefits and 
a provision for pending lawsuits. the warranty provision is recognised upon a sale of a 
product for which the parent company is liable for future warranty costs. initial recognition 
is based on historical experience. the existing provision will expire in 2032. the provision 
for jubilee benefits concern the danish employees, and are estimated based on the 
expected jubilees for current employees. of the provision dkk 17 million is expected to fall 
due after more than 5 years (dkk 16 million in 2019). no further information is provided 
regarding the provision for pending lawsuits as the information might harm the parent 
company’s position.

independent auditor’s report
•  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s and the parent company’s internal control.
•  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
•  conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the group and the parent 
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, 
including the note disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
•  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant  
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management’s review provides the  
information required under the danish financial statements act. 
based on our procedures, we conclude that the management’s review is in accordance with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the danish 
financial statements act. we did not identify any material misstatement of the management’s 
review.
management’s responsibilities for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent 
company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with international 
financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu and additional requirements of the danish 
financial statements act and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements unless management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or  
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements as  
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
the financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. we also:
•  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the 
override of internal control.
