letter to our stakeholders
2020 has been a successful year 
for ntg despite global challenges 
surrounding the covid-19 
pandemic. we managed to pull 
through the uncertainties and are 
proud to present a record adj. ebit 
of dkk 260.7 million in ntg’s first 
full year as a public company. 
uncertainty was a significant concern during 2020. while some 
industries saw the direct negative impact of the spreading 
pandemic early on, the freight forwarding market opened up to 
new opportunities, which were seized by our entrepreneurial 
organization. 
our group management team was strengthened with michael 
larsen as new group ceo, peter grubert as executive vice 
president and announcement of søren holck pape as divi-
sional ceo for the air & ocean division. including group cfo 
christian d. jakobsen and ceo for road & logistics jesper e. 
petersen, we have now set a strong leadership for the future. 
to provide the best platform for ntg’s continued profitable 
development, certain non-performing business areas were 
restructured or closed down in 2020. combined with the 
effects of covid-19 during periods of extensive lockdowns, 
we experienced a negative organic growth for the first time in 
ntg’s history. with the global economy expected to return to 
normal in near future and integration of recent acquisitions, we 
continue to believe in our ability to meet mid-term targets of 
double-digit annual revenue growth. 
towards the end of 2020, ntg completed the acquisition of 
two companies; saga trans in norway and transbros in finland, 
whereas a new acquisition, cargorange, was closed in january 
2021. together with ebrex acquired at the beginning of 2020, a 
total of 4 new acquisitions were made over a 12-month period. 
ebrex is close to being fully integrated into ntg’s existing plat-
form, and the integration of saga trans, tb international and 
cargorange is well underway. 
finally, we would like to extend our gratitude to our employ-
ees, partners and other stakeholders who contribute to ntg’s 
continued success. 
yours sincerely,
eivind kolding, 
chairman of the board

management commentary
an eventful year
2020 was a year like no other. the resilience and adaptability of 
our business model and organization came to a test, and the un-
precedented velocity of change called for new ways of working 
together, remotely.
as covid-19 cases surged in early 2020 and the severity and 
speed of transmission became apparent, the path to recovery 
was unclear. we immediately implemented precautionary mea-
sures on all sites, including the expansion of possibilities for 
home workplaces, separation of teams and individuals as well 
as cancellation of non-vital travelling activities and physical 
meetings.
as the second wave of infections hit in late 2020, prompting 
governments to reintroduce lockdowns, the global economies 
were still reeling. at the time, we had adapted to the situation 
and operated as close to normal as possible under all precau-
tionary principles.
we are proud to say that all our locations continued to be fully 
operational throughout the year while strictly adhering to the 
health and safety guidelines from local authorities. all sub-
sidiaries managed to keep the wheels turning and contributed 
to the well-functioning of customers’ value chains.
we are grateful for our dedicated and determined employees 
and their commitment to serving customers in times of elevat-
ed uncertainty.
the strong performance in 2020 is a result of our business 
model rooted in an entrepreneurial mindset, decentralization of 
operations, and cooperation across entities.
we firmly believe this business model is a key to success in the 
rapidly changing freight forwarding markets.
preparing for brexit
the market impact of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu was 
immediate, and activity as well as trade patterns became no-
tably more volatile in the period leading up to the deadline. as 
of 1 january 2021, significant adjustments were required for 
businesses to import or export to the uk. 
to facilitate a seamless transition from one trade regime to 
another, we established a uk customs brokerage department 
in the road & logistics division that commenced operations on 
1 january 2021. the department consists of specialists offering 
around-the-clock customs services. 
strengthening the executive 
management
2020 was also a year of organizational changes.
on a corporate level, the executive management was strength-
ened on three occasions in 2020. michael larsen took office 
as group ceo in may, and the executive management struc-
ture was simplified to include a single group ceo. michael is 
co-founder, partner and former ceo of ntg’s first and largest 
subsidiary ntg nordic.
in september and november, we welcomed two new members 
to the ntg group management team. to strengthen ntg’s 
m&a activities, peter grubert joined as executive vice presi-
dent while simultaneously resigning from his position as mem-
ber of the board of directors of ntg, a position he held since 
2014. with the announcement of søren holck pape as ceo of 
the air & ocean division, the ntg group management team 
was officially complete. based on his management experience 
from several positions within the industry, he will contribute 
to realising our ambitions for the air & ocean division in the 
future. søren took office in january 2021.
10
setting the scene for future growth
a key priority throughout 2020 was to optimise the existing 
platform and set the scene for continued expansion of exist-
ing operations and entries into new markets. every operating 
subsidiary of the group was examined, and low performing 
entities had an extensive overhaul which, among others, result-
ed in the restructuring, close-down, or divestment of certain 
activities in germany, switzerland, sweden, estonia, romania, 
croatia, turkey, vietnam, and australia. 
in germany, the integration of ebrex and the overhaul led 
to a consolidation of road, logistics, air, and ocean activities 
in separate entities, and new country heads to oversee the 
operations were announced. the reinforcement of the german 
setup marks another step towards realising our ambitions of 
becoming a leading freight forwarder in europe.
the operational changes and favourable production costs 
contributed to a record-high operating margin in the third and 
fourth quarter of the year, exceeding our medium-term targets. 
with the strengthening of the organization and optimization 
in certain geographies, we are ready to build on our existing 
platforms through organic initiatives and m&a in 2021. 
diversifying incentive structures
the incentive structures embedded in our partnership model, 
with co-ownership of subsidiaries together with key employ-
ees, became twofold in 2020. with the introduction of a war-
rant and share purchase option program in november, we se-
cured the means for attracting, retaining, and incentivising key 
employees with no minority shareholdings. we will leverage 
both schemes in the future based on individual evaluations.  
realising growth strategy
in line with the growth strategy, four new greenfield start-ups 
were established in 2020, including two air & ocean start-ups 
in the us, and road & logistics start-ups in norway and the 
uk, respectively. each start-up is based on partnerships with 
key employees with vast experience from the industry and 
local markets. 
since the inception in 2011, m&a has been placed high on the 
strategic agenda, and 2020 was no different. 
following closing of the acquisition of ebrex in february 2020, 
the integration progressed according to plan, and we remained 
on track for harvesting all synergies identified at the time of 
the acquisition. 
two new companies were also added to the group in 2020. the 
acquisition of saga trans in norway and tb international in fin-
land increased the scale of our existing operations within each 
geography and added new capabilities on certain trade lanes. 
both acquisitions showcase the merits of our decentralised 
business model with local people on the ground to support the 
realization of our m&a agenda. 
we reiterate our commitment to the pursuit of m&a opportu-
nities in 2021 to realise our medium-term targets for growth 
and profitability.

business model
ntg’s delivers freight forwarding 
services to customers, thereby 
optimizing customer’s supply chains.  
the end-goal is to simplify our customers’ transport needs 
and limiting overall transport costs through cargo consolida-
tion. ntg acts as coordinator, planner and negotiator using a 
network of subcontractors to carry out the physical transports. 
we base this on an asset-light business model, enabling us to 
scale according to market developments and ntg’s growth.
empowerment
we want to be customers’ preferred choice for buying transport 
solutions. almost 1,500 highly skilled and dedicated employees 
embody ntg in everything we do, and they are the greatest asset 
in fulfilling this objective. therefore, the business model of ntg 
is based on a carefully crafted operating framework to attract, 
retain, and incentivise these employees. in practice this includes 
empowering employees to take ownership of the customers they 
serve, by delegating authority and decision-making, and by estab-
lishing a direct link between performance and remuneration. 
decentralisation
local knowledge is more important than ever to ensure 
customer loyalty in an industry characterised by a high degree 
of competitive intensity and rapid 
change. speed of response and 
flexibility to adapt to changing 
market conditions is a prerequisite 
to succeed. as an international 
group with offices in 23 countries, 
and customers and suppliers rep-
resenting even more nationalities, 
we rely on employees with insights 
into local conditions, language, and 
culture to live up to the customers’ 
expectations. by decentralising our 
operations in locally anchored sub-
sidiaries, we stay close to customers 
and monitor markets in real time. in 
this way, we continuously adapt our 
service offering for the benefit of 
our customers. 
collaboration
every subsidiary in every country 
is one of us – supported, guided, 
and motivated by a centralised management team. we make 
shared resources and competences available, and set out the 
legal, financial, and commercial standards applicable across 
the group, and we facilitate collaboration across the corpo-
rate footprint. in this way, we leverage the combined size of 
the group to serve customers across trade lanes and niches, 
realize economies of scale. we collaborate individually and 
together to create customer value.

growth strategy
1. organic growth
organic growth is the core of our growth 
strategy, and a proof-point to the opera-
tional setup and capabilities embedded in 
the decentralised business model. while 
the day-to-day decision-making and com-
mercial agenda are anchored locally within 
each subsidiary, the strategic direction and 
cooperation across subsidiaries are managed 
centrally. 
to support the continued development of 
and growth in each subsidiary, we proac-
tively work to disseminate knowledge and 
best practices, and apply core competencies 
across the group. we act as a sounding 
board, collaborator, and coordinator to 
achieve the overall ambition of organic 
growth above that of the market. 
 
 
organic net revenue growth on 
average from 2016 to 2020
2. start-ups
start-ups with local partners are another way 
to accelerate growth by establishing presence 
in new geographies or niches where commer-
cial, legal, cultural, or lingual barriers would 
otherwise have hindered entry or imposed a 
greater risk on ntg. 
start-ups are established as a partnership with 
one or more partners with a shared ownership 
to incentivise and empower them to grow 
rapidly. partners are typically local experts 
in their field of business and coupled with 
an asset-light business model and operating 
framework, start-ups become an attractive 
growth incubator with minimum investment 
requirements. 
ntg offers all necessary technical and com-
mercial frameworks, adapted to fit the require-
ments of each country, which enable start-ups 
to gain traction quickly and accelerate growth. 
start-ups established since  
inception
3. acquisitions
acquisitions are an efficient way of adding 
scale, products, or a foothold in new geogra-
phies – and to accelerate growth. we benefit 
from a highly fragmented market with multiple 
candidates across scales, geographies, and 
niches, though we primarily pursue acquisi-
tions of well-performing companies in europe, 
china and the us. 
subject to a range of criteria being fulfilled, 
we may consider underperforming candidates 
that can be merged with existing subsidiaries 
in geographies with sizeable and well-per-
forming operations. 
acquisitions will remain high on the strategic 
agenda in 2021.
 
 acquisitions integrated  
since inception
our growth strategy is based on three 
complementary pillars with different 
risk-reward profiles: organic growth, 
start-ups, and acquisitions. each pillar 
supports the overall ambition of achiev-
ing double-digit top line growth. 
the direction is consistent with previous 
years which led to the establishment of 
ntg as one of the leading players within 
road freight in northern europe and an 
upcoming player within global air and 
ocean freight. 
in the road & logistics division, the am-
bition is to enhance the setup by increas-
ing scale and profitability in our existing 
operations and expanding the footprint 
to new trade lanes across europe. 
in the air & ocean division, the ambition 
is to build on the platform established 
in 2016 by increasing scale in existing 
geographies and entering new markets 
across north-west europe, the us, and 
china. the air & ocean division is still in 
a growth phase, and it is a key focus area 
to establish ntg as an incumbent player 
within the industry.
as we grow our corporate footprint, and 
the financial scale and geographical reach 
of each division expands, we will continue 
to refine the focus areas within each 
growth pillar on a divisional level. but our 
focus and commitment to growing the 
business will remain unchanged.

2021 outlook 
for the full-year 2021, we expect 
a net revenue of dkk 5,500-
6,000 million and adjusted ebit 
of dkk 300-350 million.   
due to lower visibility than normal, the ranges in the financial 
expectations for net revenue and adjusted ebit reflect an 
increased level of uncertainty.
in the guidance on net revenue, we have assumed a continued 
success in expanding our sales to existing customers while main-
taining a net inflow of new customers in each division. we expect 
growth in the air & ocean division to stabilise in 2021. the gui-
dance does not include any assumptions regarding new start-ups. 
the acquisitions of ebrex, saga trans, and tb international will 
have full-year effects in 2021. the acquisition of cargorange will 
contribute with results from february 2021. the guidance only 
includes effects of aforementioned acquisitions.
the guidance on adjusted ebit reflects an increase of 15-34% 
compared to the results realised in 2020. the positive momentum 
in the fourth quarter of 2020 has continued into 2021 and under-
pin the financial guidance for the full year. the growth reflects an 
assumption of a continued materialization of margin-accretive 
activities launched in 2020, including the close-down, divest-
ment, and restructuring of non-performing entities. the guidance 
assumes a continued strict cost control across the group. 
in line with 2020, the focus in 2021 will be on a combination 
of optimization of the existing businesses and execution of the 
growth strategy.
due to the dynamic and unpredictable covid-19 situation, 
uncertainty remains elevated and the assumptions underlying 
the outlook for 2021 are more uncertain than usual. 
the guidance is based on the following principal assumptions 
that may affect, individually or jointly, the net revenue and  
operating margin:
• 
 stable macroeconomic recovery with no new material ad-
verse events affecting regional and global cargo volumes and 
trade patterns.
• 
 gradual reopening of countries with no further lockdown 
restrictions inflicted by covid-19.
• 
 no material changes in trade patterns between the eu and 
the uk following brexit.
• 
 currency exchange rates in line with 2020.
• 
 continued ability to attract and retain employees across 
subsidiaries.
medium-term financial targets
in connection with the listing of ntg on nasdaq copenhagen 
on 9 october 2019, medium-term targets were introduced as 
a supplement to the annual financial outlook. the targets were 
based on a three-to-five-year horison. 
the medium-term revenue growth targets include organic growth 
above the market growth and double-digit total growth. total 
growth comprises organic growth and growth from acquisitions. 
the growth targets are based on the principal assumption that 
we will continue to develop the business, establish start-ups, 
and be successful in executing the m&a agenda. 
on adjusted ebit, we target a margin of 4% to 5%.
 the medium-term financial targets remain unchanged.

capital structure and allocation
to support the realization of our 
medium-term target of double-digit 
total growth, we expect to maintain 
a capital buffer for acquisitions.    
capital structure
we target a leverage ratio, defined as net interest-bearing 
debt relative to ebitda before special items including effects 
of ifrs 16, below 2.0-3.0x. the ratio may exceed this level 
temporarily following significant acquisitions.
capital allocation principles
the allocation of capital is based on the following medi-
um-term strategic objectives:
• 
 maintain a leverage ratio below the target.
• 
 secure sufficient capital buffers for investments in organic 
growth and acquisitions.
• 
 cover obligations in relation to acquisition of minority 
shareholders’ shares in subsidiaries and obligations under 
share-based incentive programs through share buy-back 
programs.
• 
 distribute excess capital to shareholders through share 
buy-back programs. 
the board of directors evaluates the capital structure on 
an ongoing basis in relation to the current financial position, 
expected future cash flow, future investment requirements, and 
the ability to engage in value-adding acquisitions.
ring-the-bell
as partners cannot be forced to ring the bell, and no pre-de-
fined initiation of any ring-the-bell processes exists, capital 
requirements to be used for consideration in order to acquire 
non-controlling interests are generally not known until one 
year prior to the date of the first share swap. 
capital requirements for honouring future ring-the-bell share 
swaps are evaluated on an ongoing basis. for a further descrip-
tion of ring-the-bell refer to the section shareholder informa-
tion on page 40. 
investments
since the inception of ntg in 2011, all acquisitions have been 
financed via existing capital resources. 
in 2021, we primarily intend to use available financial resources 
and free cash flow to invest in start-ups, m&a, and share buy-
back programs. 
in case of larger acquisitions, we will investigate additional 
sources of funding, including the debt and capital markets or 
payment in shares. 
dividends
in line with the group’s dividend policy, no dividends have been 
proposed for 2020.

financial review
financial results were in line with 
the 2020 outlook. net revenue 
totalled dkk 5,332.2 million 
and adjusted ebit totalled dkk 
260.7 million, corresponding to 
an operating margin of 4.9%.   
net revenue growth was positively affected by strong perfor-
mance in the road & logistics division that grew 3.7% in 2020. 
despite the turbulence and elevated level of uncertainty due to 
covid-19, we delivered a net revenue in line with 2019, and an 
improved adjusted ebit. 
the progress was driven by strong performance in the road 
& logistics division that produced a strong operating margin 
in the third and fourth quarter of the year. the improvements 
were driven by a combination of increasing gross margins, due 
to favourable developments in direct costs, and an increasing 
conversion ratio resulting from internal efficiency initiatives, 
permanent cost savings, and restructuring of low-performing 
entities.

2020 was a challenging year for the air & ocean division, and the 
pandemic made it increasingly difficult to manoeuvre. non-per-
forming entities were closed or scaled down which contributed 
to the decline in net revenue in 2020. the effects of restructuring 
initiatives started to materialise towards the end of the year, and 
the conversion ratio increased notably in the fourth quarter. 
the negative organic growth in the air & ocean division, and 
to a lesser extent in the road & logistics division, was offset by 
the acquisitions of ebrex, saga trans, and tb international. 
the shareholdings in certain existing subsidiaries were also 
increased in 2020. among others, this included the acquisition 
of the remaining 15% of the shares in ebrex through an in-
crease in the share capital. in poland and finland, the partners 
and minority shareholders in ntg polar road embarked on the 
ring-the-bell process, and the first of five share tranches was 
swapped for shares in ntg.
the strong performance and increasing profitability in 2020 led 
to a return on invested capital before tax and including effects 
of ifrs 16 of 34.3%, compared to 30.2% in 2019. 
income statement
net revenue amounted to dkk 5,332.2 million in 2020 com-
pared to dkk 5,332.0 million in 2019. growth was composed 
of 4.9% acquired growth, driven by the acquisition of ebrex and, 
to a lesser extent, saga trans and tb international, and organic 
growth including start-ups of negative 4.9%.
of ntg’s main geographical presence, sweden showed the 
most significant positive growth (11.6%), whereas the other 
largest countries were influenced by a slightly negative trend. 
because of the restructuring in germany, net revenue in this 
area contracted by 17.9% in 2020.
in the air & ocean division, revenue decreased organically by 
12.8% due to muted activity and the close-down of non-per-
forming entities. 
gross profit increased 14.0% to dkk 1,238.4 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 1,086.5 million in 2019, corresponding 
to a gross margin of 23.2% and 20.4%, respectively. growth 
was driven by the road & logistics division that experienced 
a growth in gross profit of 25.3%, partly offset by a 15.5% 
decline in the air & ocean division.
other external expenses totalled dkk 219.5 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 195.3 million in 2019, mainly due to the 
inclusion of ebrex.
staff costs totalled dkk 589.6 million in 2020, compared to 
dkk 546.6 million in 2019. the increase was mainly due to 
the inclusion of ebrex and formation of start-ups during the 
year.
temporary cost savings and public support programs in cer-
tain countries had a positive effect on adjusted ebit of dkk 
17.0 million. 
21
amortizations and depreciations totalled dkk 168.6 million in 
2020, compared to dkk 136.6 million in 2019. the development 
was mainly due to a net increase in the number of recognised 
trailers and additions from the acquisition of ebrex that in-
creased depreciations on right-of-use assets under ifrs 16. 
adjusted ebit grew 25.3% to dkk 260.7 million in 2020, com-
pared to dkk 208.0 million in 2019, corresponding to an oper-
ating margin of 4.9% and 3.9%, respectively. the increase was 
mainly driven by the road & logistics division that reported an 
increase in adjusted ebit of dkk 65.8 million, corresponding 
to 36.3%. the air & ocean division experienced a decrease in 
adjusted ebit of dkk 12.2 million, corresponding to 50.1%. 
non-controlling interests’ share of adjusted ebit was 11.7% in 
2020, compared to 13.8% in 2019. the expectation for 2020 was 
around 10%. 
special item expenses totalled dkk 5.4 million in 2020, related 
to the integration costs due to the acquisition of ebrex. special 
item expenses in 2019 amounted to dkk 104.2 million, pri-
marily due to extraordinary costs related to the listing of ntg.
net financial expenses totalled dkk 45.3 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 49.3 million in 2019. the decrease was 
mainly due to currency exchange rate adjustments, and certain 
interest and other financial expenses. ifrs 16 interest expens-
es remained constant compared to 2019. 
the effective tax rate for 2020 was 29.1%, compared to 84.7% 
in 2019. the effective tax rate in 2019 was impacted by non- 
deductible items on listing costs and excess value expense 
arising from the reverse acquisition of neurosearch a/s. 
profit for the year totalled dkk 148.8 million, compared to 
dkk 8.3 million in 2019. earnings per share came to dkk 5.61 
per share, compared to negative 0.64 per share in 2019. 
cash flow statement
cash flow from operating activities totalled dkk 463.3 million 
in 2020, compared to dkk 201.5 million in 2019, corresponding 
to an increase of 129.9%. the development was mainly driven

by growth in earnings before interest and tax, a decline in net 
working capital, and lower special items compared to 2019.
cash flow from investing activities was negative dkk 158.5 
million in 2020, compared to negative dkk 52.3 million in 
2019. the decrease was primarily due to the completion of the 
acquisitions of ebrex, saga trans, and tb international in 2020. 
adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operating 
and investing activities adjusted for special items, acquisition of 
business activities, and repayment of lease liabilities, increased 
185.5% to dkk 314.2 million in 2020, compared to dkk 110.0 
million in 2019.
cash flow from financing activities was negative dkk 248.8 million 
in 2020, compared to negative dkk 126.7 million in 2019. the de-
crease was mainly due to additional repayments of lease liabilities 
and purchases of treasury shares. 2019 was positively affected with 
53.3 million by the reverse acquisition of former neurosearch a/s.
capital resources
net working capital improved another dkk 108.6 million to 
negative dkk 208.1 million in 2020, compared to negative 
dkk 99.5 million in 2019. the development was mainly a result 
of continued dedication to strict cash management. the impact 
of deferred payment schemes in certain public support pro-
grams was approximately dkk 10 million by year-end 2020.
net interest-bearing debt totalled dkk 420.4 million as of  
31 december 2020. excluding the effects of ifrs 16, net inter-
est-bearing debt would total negative dkk 196.2 million. the 
leverage ratio including effects of ifrs 16 was 1.0x ebitda 
before special items, below the target of 2.0x-3.0x.
invested capital totalled dkk 794.0 million as of 31 december 
2020. excluding the effects of ifrs 16, invested capital would 
total dkk 240.3 million. the return on average invested capital 
before tax, but including goodwill and effects of ifrs 16, was 
34.3% in 2020, up from 30.2% in 2019.

the road & logistics division reported an adjusted ebit of dkk 247.0 
million in 2020, representing a total growth of 36.3% compared to 
2019, and an operating margin of 5.8%. adaptability to the market 
situation, favourable development in prices and direct costs, and 
persistent cost control were key drivers of performance.

the road & logistics division is the largest division, in 2020 
accounting for 80.2% of total net revenue and 95.3% of adjust-
ed ebit. in 2020, the division reached new record levels amid 
extraordinarily high velocity of change and disruptions in trade 
patterns caused by the covid-19 pandemic. 
business highlights
covid-19 took its toll on organic growth in the road & logi-
stics division in 2020, though this was more than offset by the 
effect of acquisitions completed during the year. 
to adapt to the situation, permanent and temporary cost 
savings were introduced, and all subsidiaries were trimmed in 
preparation for a prolonged period of muted activity. in swit-
zerland and germany, the operations were restructured and  a 
minor logistic operation in sweden was closed. 
towards the end of the second quarter, activity rebounded 
across several verticals in the nordic and polish subsidiaries 
and bottlenecks in certain modes of transportation contrib-
uted to an increased inflow of new customers. the positive 
momentum continued throughout the rest of the year, and the 
reduced cost base resulted in increasing operating margins. 
in continental europe, our activity rebound was less prevalent 
and the operations performed below the full potential. the 
german activities were restructured, and certain non-core 
activities were closed or outsourced. following the overhaul 
of the german setup, heinrich josef de waal, chief operating 
officer of ebrex, was announced as regional director for the 
road & logistics activities in germany, switzerland, benelux, 
and the uk. 
in the uk, we established a uk customs brokerage department 
in the road & logistics division in preparation for the uk’s exit 
from the eu. the department, that commenced operations 
on 1 january 2021, consists of an in-house customs clearance 
team who monitor all developments regarding brexit. 
towards the end of the year, the finnish and norwegian organi-
zations were strengthened with the acquisitions of tb inter-
national and saga trans, respectively. the acquired companies 
will be merged into existing subsidiaries in 2021, expanding the 
scale and breadth of capabilities in each country. 
financial review
net revenue amounted to dkk 4,274.7 million in 2020 com-
pared to dkk 4,121.8 million in 2019. growth was composed 
of 6.3% acquired growth, driven by the acquisitions of primarily 
ebrex and, to a minor extent, saga trans and tb international, 
and organic growth including start-ups of negative 2.6%.
the organic growth was driven by a stagnation in demand 
across sectors (-0.3%), mainly due to covid-19, and the 
restructuring, close-down, or divestment of non-performing 
activities in germany in 2020, and the close-down and divest-
ment of activities in the czech republic and italy in late 2019 
(-2.5%). the impact from new start-ups in norway and the uk 
contributed positively to total growth for the period (+0.1%).
gross profit increased 25.3% to dkk 979.3 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 781.7 million in 2019, corresponding to a gross 
margin of 22.9% and 19.0%, respectively. the increasing gross 
margin was driven by improved prices due to pandemic-inflicted 
bottlenecks on certain trade lanes, an inflow of new customers in 
the nordics, and a favourable development in direct costs.
adjusted ebit grew 36.3% to dkk 247.0 million in 2020, com-
pared to dkk 181.2 million in 2019, corresponding to an oper-
ating margin of 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively. the increase was 
mainly driven by acquisition of ebrex,  improved gross profit, 
and an increasing conversion ratio resulting from restructuring 
and efficiency initiatives completed during the year.
25
strategic focus areas in 2021
like previous years, we will continue to promote the application of 
know-how rooted within individual subsidiaries across the group 
and leverage core competencies in adjacent geographical markets. 
in germany, we expect to leverage the fortified corporate struc-
ture to grow primarily the less-than-truckload and full-truckload 
activities, which currently represent the backbone of our nordic, 
baltic, and polish operations. by year-end 2020, approximately 
10 danish employees had been expatriated to germany to sup-
port the development of operations within these segments. 
in the uk, we will continue to develop our customs services 
platform. the first step was the integration of the customs it 
platform with our transport management system. the integration 
will broaden the platform’s field of application internally and enable 
additional subsidiaries across europe to offer uk customs services. 
the integration of ebrex, saga trans, tb international, and 
cargorange are expected to be completed in 2021, with all 
synergies and savings being realised. 
the road & logistics division is geared for more acquisitions 
in 2021, and we will continue to search the market for new 
opportunities.

in 2020, the air & ocean division accounted for 19.8% of total 
net revenue and 4.7% of adjusted ebit. 2020 was a challenging 
year for the division as covid-19 resulted in significant supply 
and demand imbalances that impeded the division’s ability to 
manoeuvre. the decline in net revenue was further accelerated 
by a divisional overhaul that led to the close-down, divestment, 
or restructuring of certain non-performing activities. 
business highlights
the covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the air & 
ocean division in 2020, as available freight capacities, volumes, 
and demand lingered significantly below pre-pandemic levels. 
the division is still in a build-up phase and the limited scale 
causes financial results to fluctuate in times of market turmoil.
as a response to the market situation, we introduced significant 
cost savings in the first quarter of the year, including the partici-
pation in local government support programs. 
in 2020, we also took a step towards creating a more homoge-
nous group of subsidiaries in the air & ocean division. among 
others, this led to the close-down, divestment, or restructuring 
of non-performing activities in germany, switzerland, turkey, 
and other countries with smaller operations. in the us, two new 
air & ocean start-ups in chicago and denver were established. 
the strategic overhaul of the division led to a redefined focus 
on core activities within a limited number of geographies. as 
per year-end 2020, the number of countries with operational 
subsidiaries was consequently reduced to 18. the reshaping of 
the division triggered further contractions in net revenue due 
to the absence of acquisitions.
the cost savings and restructuring initiatives started to materi-
alise during the fourth quarter of the year, and the air & ocean 
division reported an increasing operating margin and conver-
sion ratio compared to the same period last year, despite a 
gross margin contraction. 
financial review
net revenue amounted to dkk 1,057.0 million in 2020, com-
pared to dkk 1,211.9 million in 2019, representing an organic 
growth including start-ups of negative 12.8%. 
the organic growth was driven by a declining activity level 
(-12.8%) mainly due to covid-19, and the close-down, divest-
ment, or restructuring of non-performing activities in germany, 
switzerland, estonia, vietnam, australia, croatia, and turkey in 
2020, and italy and the czech republic in 2019 (-2.5%). the 
impact of new start-ups in the us contributed positively to 
total growth for the period (+2.5%).
gross profit decreased 15.5% to dkk 259.0 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 306.5 million in 2019, corresponding to a 
gross margin of 24.5% and 25.3%, respectively. the decreasing 
gross margin was due to a combination of challenging market 
conditions and product mix effects. 
adjusted ebit decreased 50.1% to dkk 12.1 million in 2020, 
compared to dkk 24.3 million in 2019, corresponding to an 
operating margin of 1.1% and 2.0%, respectively. the decrease 
was mainly driven by deteriorating performance in denmark, 
turkey, and switzerland, and a negative contribution from re-
cent start-ups in the us. the decline was partially offset by the 
turn-around in china and improved performance in sweden, 
finland, and the netherlands. 
strategic focus areas in 2021
as we redefined the geographical footprint and reduced the al-
location of resources to certain activities in 2020, we will also 
be more selective on opportunities we pursue in 2021. 
the initiatives introduced in 2020 illustrate a first step towards a 
reprioritization and refocusing of resources to a limited number of 
core markets that include north-west europe, the us, and china. 
28
we remain dedicated to strengthening the air & ocean division 
through increased scale and efficiency improvements. the 
progress made with non-performing entities in 2020, and the 
appointment of søren holck pape as ceo of the air & ocean 
division, are expected to support the division in returning to 
growth and increase profitability. 
in 2021, focus will be on building a unified air & ocean divi-
sion. by strengthening local organizations in core markets and 
increasing focus on sales, we expect to drive a growing share 
of controlled volumes. to achieve this, we will structure how 
we originate business from within and outside the group and 
leverage the scale of both divisions to generate new business 
opportunities. standardization, automation, and productivity 
improvements will be key in this respect. 
the air & ocean division is geared for acquisitions in 2021, and 
we will continue to search the market for opportunities that will 
add scale and capabilities in existing, core markets.

risk management
ntg monitors and manages the risks 
that our business is exposed towards. 
managing the identified risks will 
either reduce the likelihood of financial 
impact or occurrence and make ntg 
able to react in time to protect our 
people, assets, reputation, and clients.
occurrences with a potential effect on the group’s projected 
earnings are perceived as risks for ntg. based on the most 
recent risk evaluation, it is executive management’s assess-
ment that risks inherent to ntg do not individually or collec-
tively cast doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
risk governance
the board of directors is responsible for the overall risk 
management of the ntg. the audit committee monitors and 
evaluates the risk framework and provides recommendations 
to the board of directors. executive management supports 
the audit committee’s work by functioning as the prime driver 
of risk identification and mitigation. executive management is 
responsible for design and maintenance of risk management 
systems. the risk management process is linked to recurring 
strategic analysis within ntg.
risk management procedure
ntg applies a structured approach to risk management, orga-
nized according to the following four elements:
1) 
 identification and initial reporting – ntg group manage-
ment receives input following bi-annual business review 
meetings with the group’s most significant subsidiaries.
2) 
 analysis and assessment – identified risks are recorded 
in a work register and assessed in terms of likelihood of 
occurrence and potential financial impact.
3) 
 risk review and mitigation – key risks are selected for 
further review and design of mitigating actions. these 
include avoidance, transfer, reduction, or acceptance.  
4) 
 risk reporting – key risks and mitigating actions are 
reported according to the governance structure. 
identified key risks
1  talent identification and retention 
as a “people’s business” it is of utmost importance to identify 
and retain skilled employees. competition for talented employ-
ees is tough, requiring the ability to offer attractive conditions. 
ntg does so by providing a highly inspiring platform for exist-
ing talents and future high performers to hone their abilities. 
joining ntg through the partnership model gives each partner 
a possibility to take part in his/her own success on a sustain-
able  basis, while being backed by a strong network, a secure 
back-office and the large knowledge pool of existing partners. 
2  input factor shortage 
ntg relies on suppliers to deliver both transport and related 
services. shortage on subcontractor capacity due to either 
* certain risks have been updated from 2019. above represents 
a comparable placement for each key risks which the group 
considers relevant.

risk map
market factors or political developments may affect the 
group’s ability to service its customers. to maintain supplier 
loyalty and make ntg an attractive partner, value-creating 
programs are developed and offered to certain important 
subcontractors. ntg keeps close contact with critical suppliers 
and ensures an adequate standardization of the supply-chain 
to ensure contingencies in case of individual subcontractor’s 
inability to deliver.
3  compliance 
ntg is subject to extensive regulatory requirements, and it is 
imperative for ntg to be compliant with relevant legislation 
and regulatory standards. the use of independent carriers 
makes non-compliance both an internal and external risk factor. 
to provide a responsible basis of operations, ntg has imple-
mented codes of conduct covering employees of the group 
and suppliers and also management instructions to the local 
management teams. a new internal compliance framework and 
additional governance controls were implemented during 2020. 
these initiatives limit risks related to anti-bribery, sanctions 
and anti-trust/competition law. 
short lines of communication and ntg’s whistleblower system 
make identification of non-compliance more visible and com-
partmentalization of the group provides the ability to limit the 
legal impact of non-compliance.
4  it and cyber security 
as ntg becomes increasingly digitized, more devices and con-
trol systems are connected online. breach of ntg’s it-security 
or internal controls could cause disruption of ntg’s services, 
non-compliance with applicable laws and legislation or cause 
adverse effects on ntg’s reputation. improving and strength-
ening cyber security is a strategic priority for ntg. monitoring 
of controls and continuous update of systems alleviates the 
risk and impact of security breaches. ntg only contracts with 
top-tier service providers to guarantee a secure it platform. 
all employees in the group undergo cyber security training on 
a recurring basis to mitigate risks associated with attempts of 
phishing and online fraud. 
5  macro economy 
there is a strong correlation between the general economic 
activity and the freight forwarding market. ntg is – along with 
other participants in the freight forwarding market – exposed 
to slowdown in economic activity or financial crisis. this in-
cludes negative impact from disruptive forces, such as impact 
from global pandemics, or political developments imposing 
restrictions on free trade or the imposition of trade barriers. 
risks may be offset by increasing domestic activities and de-
mand for related logistics services, such as customs clearance.
global economic and political development is outside of ntg’s 
direct influence. maintaining an agile operational set-up and 
a flexible financial structure are the main steps taken by the 
group to mitigate such risks.
6  competition and market conditions 
the freight forwarding industry is known for undergoing rapid 
changes in the competitive landscape. in recent years, tech-
nological developments are beginning to have a significant 
impact. changes originate from existing market participants as 
well as new entrants. automation and digitization are currently 
seen as the most significant drivers of market change. these 
advancements imply an opportunity for optimizing workflows 
and productivity while providing higher levels of service and 
product offerings for customers. a strict focus on system stan-
dardization and digitization coupled with operational agility 
positions ntg to continually adapt its operations. 
7  mergers and acquisitions 
a cornerstone in ntg’s strategy is to expand through start 
ups and acquisitions, which has been a great success since the 
group’s inception. a clear acquisition framework ensures the 
right strategic fit with ntg’s existing organization, whereas 
a strong post-merger process ensures efficient realization of 
plans and management of potential issues. 
33
corporate governance
governance structure
ntg has a two-tier governance structure comprised by the 
board of directors and the executive management. ultimate 
governing authority rests with the general meeting.
in terms of internal organization, ntg group management com-
prises executive management, division ceos and executive vice 
president. executive management is the group ceo and the 
group cfo, as registered with the danish business authority.
the board of directors is responsible for overall strategic 
management and proper organization of the group’s activities 
as well as the group’s financial and material matters. the board 
has established an audit, a remuneration and a nomination 
committee focusing on preparatory tasks within the board of 
directors’ areas of responsibility. 
ntg’s registered executive management is responsible for 
ntg’s day-to-day management and is in charge of ensuring that 
the company and its operations are compliant with applicable 
legislation and the board of directors’ guidelines and instructions, 
including implementation of the strategy set by the board of 
directors and provide information on ntg’s operations to the 
board of directors. 
the further allocation of responsibilities between the board of 
directors and the executive management is set out in the rules 
of procedure of the board of directors and in a set of manage-
ment instructions issued to the executive management by the 
board of directors. 
board of directors
composition 
according to the articles of association, the board of directors 
must comprise not less than three and not more than eight 
members elected by the general meeting for terms of one 
year. board members are eligible for re-election.
in 2020, michael larsen, stefan pettersson and peter grubert 
stepped down from the board of directors. karen-marie katholm 
and carsten krogsgaard thomsen were elected as new members.
the composition of the board of directors is intended to 
ensure that the board of directors has a diverse competency 
profile enabling the board of directors to perform its duties in 
the best possible manner.
the board of directors currently comprise 7 members rep-
resenting strong knowledge and expertise within all areas of 
ntg’s business and strategic focus areas, including the interna-
tional transport sector in general, m&a, risk management, it, 
accounting and supply chain management. the current board 
composition is considered to have the right competencies sup-
porting the long-term value creation for ntg’s shareholders.
independence
six of the seven members of the board of directors are regard-
ed as independent, according to the danish recommendations 
on corporate governance. 
jørgen hansen is the founder of ntg and was a member of 
the executive management in nordic transport group a/s (the 
former parent company in the ntg group) until 2018 and is 
therefore not regarded as independent according to danish 
recommendations on corporate governance. 
board meetings in 2020
the board of directors held 12 board meetings in 2020. the 
agenda for each of the ordinary meetings is based on the 
board of directors’ annual wheel.
34
board committees
the board of directors has established three permanent com-
mittees for the purpose of assisting the board of directors with 
preparing decisions and submitting recommendations for the 
entire board. each committee is governed by its own charter, 
which describes the composition of the committee, its meeting 
schedule and its tasks, duties and responsibilities.
audit committee comprises three members: ulrik ross petersen 
(chairman), eivind drachmann kolding and carsten krogsgaard 
thomsen. the composition of the audit committee ensures 
that competences and experience within financial accounting 
and internal controls are represented in the audit committee. 
the committee’s tasks and duties include monitoring of ntg’s 
financial reporting process, internal controls, it, risk manage-
ment, and capital structure. the committee is also responsible 
for ensuring independence of the elected external auditor. 
remuneration committee comprises three members: eivind 
drachmann kolding (chairman), jørgen hansen and jesper 
præstensgaard. the committee’s tasks and duties include prepara-
tion of the group’s remuneration policy in accordance with section 
139a of the danish companies act, propose specific targets (kpis) 
for performance-related incentive programs and preparation of the 
remuneration report in accordance with section 139b of the dan-
ish companies act and the guidelines in the remuneration policy.
nomination committee comprises two members: eivind 
drachmann kolding (chairman) and jørgen hansen. the com-
mittee’s tasks and duties include recommendation of potential 
new members to the board, review diversity policy and assess-
ment of the board’s structure, size and composition. 
recommendations on corporate governance
ntg observes and applies the recommendations on corporate 
governance. for 2020, ntg has opted to partly derogate from 
2 of the 47 recommendations (recommendation no. 3.4.2 
regarding independence of majority of members in a board 
committee and recommendation no. 3.4.8 regarding the remu-
neration committee’s use of the same external advisors as the 
executive management).
according to the danish financial statements act section 107b, 
a statement on corporate governance for the financial year is pre-
pared and can be viewed at ntg’s investor site: investor.ntg.com.

ring-the-bell
our decentralised business model with 68 operational sub-
sidiaries owned together with more than 110 employees as 
minority shareholders is based on a pre-defined exit mecha-
nism called ring-the-bell.
ring-the-bell is an incentive model offered to minority share-
holders in certain subsidiaries, enabling partially owned sub-
sidiaries of ntg to become fully owned subsidiaries over time.    
after a minimum of five years, minority shareholders in certain 
subsidiaries may offer their shares to ntg against payment in 
cash or shares in ntg. once a ring-the-bell process has been 
requested, the share-swap occurs over a five-year period sub-
ject each year to the acceptance by ntg.
in 2020, the minority shareholders in ntg polar road in 
finland and poland were the first to execute a share swap 
under the ring-the-bell process. in the third quarter, the first 
of five share tranches in each subsidiary were swapped for 
shares in ntg. ntg paid with treasury shares in exchange for 
one-fifth of the shares held by the minority shareholders in 
the subsidiaries.
for 2021, the ring-the-bell process for ntg polar road in fin-
land and poland will continue, and share swaps will commence 
for ntg växjö in sweden and ntg nielsen & sørensen a/s in 
denmark. 
restrictions on sale of shares
by the end of 2020, lock-up undertakings were applicable to 
shareholders who obtained shares in ntg through a swap of 
shares in a subsidiary with shares in ntg.
in a reorganization on 7 october 2019, in preparation for the 
listing of ntg on 9 october 2019, minority shareholders in sev-
en of the largest subsidiaries (matured partners) swapped their 
shares in each subsidiary for shares in ntg. 15% of the shares 
received were issued as escrow shares with release subject to 
performance over five years. 
as part of the share swaps, each matured partner and certain 
other ntg shareholders (except holdingselskabet af 7. marts 
2019 aps) who received shares in ntg in connection with the 
listing undertook a five-year lock-up. pursuant to this lock-up, 
60% of the shares (including any escrow shares) received at 
the listing were under lock-up by year-end 2020. by 9 october 
2021, the lock-up will be reduced by 15 percentage points. 
the sequence will be repeated proportionately until  
9 october 2024. 
for further information on the reorganization, see the prospec-
tus dated 24 september 2019.
key employees that are shareholders in certain subsidiaries of 
ntg, or who swapped such shareholdings to shares in ntg 
through ring-the-bell, and other shareholders who received 
shares in ntg in connection with the listing, are obliged to 
carry out any sale of shares in a coordinated manner. 
in 2020, the coordinated sales were arranged in the four-week 
periods following publication of the financial reports and in 
connection with the private placement on 14 september 2020. 
 investor relations
we aim to maintain an open and active dialogue with share-
holders, investors, analysts, media, and the general public to 
contribute to ensuring an equal and timely dissemination of 
information to all market participants, and a fair pricing of the 
shares. this includes hosting of quarterly conference calls and 
participation in management roadshows, investor conferences, 
retail events, and one-on-one and group meetings with ana-
lysts and investors. 
our investor relations policy stipulates a four-week silent period 
before publication of any full-year or interim financial report.

globally we see a raised awareness 
regarding organizations’ sustainability 
and environmental impact. ntg 
supports initiatives for sustainable 
solutions in close collaboration with 
customers and other stakeholders.    
acting within the inherent confines of the transport industry, 
ntg is committed to promoting a sustainable agenda on key 
esg areas, including long-term value creation for the group’s 
shareholders and partners. 2020 was a year of transition for 
ntg. initiatives  were made to create a baseline towards future 
improvements and policies on the area.  this included data  
gathering and benchmarking towards industry standards. 
as a freight forwarder and logistics provider, ntg delivers 
value to customers and consumers by facilitating effective and 
efficient transport solutions for a wide range of goods around 
the globe. ntg acts as a coordinator and optimizer, using 
subcontractors such as hauliers, ocean carriers and airlines, 
to perform the actual transports. for a further description of 
ntg’s business model, refer to page 14 
environmental impact
with the current technologies available, transportation is a 
significant contributor to global carbon emissions. reducing 
emissions to a sustainable level is a challenge faced by all partici-
pants in the transportation industry. as a freight forwarder and 
logistics provider ntg’s direct emissions mainly relate to office 
buildings and terminals. ntg is continuously working to identify 
viable opportunities to reduce direct emissions through energy 
saving and conservation throughout the relevant locations.  
it is ntg’s goal to create higher transparency on the group’s 
level of carbon emissions and to identify relevant sources of 
greenhouse gas emissions in the operational value chain. 
efforts and results
to ensure consistent implementation and follow-up, ntg has 
implemented iso 14001 certification related to their environ-
mental management and implementation of environmental man-
agement systems. ntg’s environmental policies are formalized 
in the quality and environmental manual. as of december 2020, 
a total of 29 pads (2019: 24) distributed on more than 50 sites 
(2019: 42) were iso 14001 certified by reputable registrars.  
as an important milestone in creating transparency on the area 
of environmental impact, is the group’s first-ever estimations 
of ntg’s carbon footprint were carried out. estimations were 
performed on each of the group’s emissions scopes yielding a 
group-wide carbon emission estimate of 716 thousand tones 
co2 equivalents (co2e) in 2020. calculations were performed 
in accordance with ghg protocol principles and operation-
alized by using the global logistics emissions council (glec) 
framework, which provides a rigorous methodology for esti-
mating emissions in the transport industry. disclosures include 
estimates from all ntg’s direct and indirect emission sources, 
as presented on page 44. by using subcontractors to perform 
the physical transports, the main contributor to ntg’s total 
emissions are of an indirect nature. initiatives to increase the 
group’s carbon efficiency are continually investigated and eval-
uated. bringing transparency to the area of carbon emissions 
marks an important first step in creating actionable insight 
which opens doors for continued improvements and further 
sustainable service offerings to ntg’s customers.  
responsible business practices
responsible behavior is part of ntg’s core values, and customers 
and other stakeholders all expect ntg to conduct business in a 
responsible manner. ntg’s codes of conduct towards employees 
and subcontractors form the basis of all actions and activities 
carried out in ntg’s name.

efforts and results
in 2020, a new legal compliance program for anti-corruption, 
competition law, economic sanctions, human rights and export 
controls was established. the program is designed to fulfil 
global requirements and improve focus on legal compliance 
awareness and training. 
main legal compliance initiatives were:
risk assessments across the group on implementation of new 
governance controls, awareness of whistleblower system, 
anti-corruption, competition law, human rights and foreign 
trade controls. the outcome of the risk assessments is the basis 
for ntg’s annual mitigation plans which include training and 
third-party due diligence.
establishment of a global compliance champion network where 
local compliance champions serve as advisors and first point of 
contact to respond to the local operations’ routine legal com-
pliance-related questions. this helps to better integrate legal 
compliance matters into business operations. the network is 
anchored within headquarter and sponsored by ntg’s execu-
tive management. to support, each subsidiary has appointed 
local compliance champions in 2020. compliance champions 
are performing their new role in addition to their core job.
raising awareness about ntg’s whistleblower system. in 2020, the 
whistleblower system received 2 cases related to potential viola-
tions of group policies. both cases were investigated and cleared. 
implementation of a standardized third-party management pro-
cess, including the performance of a pre-boarding due diligence.
employees and diversity
ntg’s employees are the reason for the group’s success. their 
dedication and talent are the main assets of the company. ntg 
is committed to securing a safe workplace, ensuring employee 
satisfaction, limiting employee turnover and providing talent- 
based advancement opportunities for all employees on an equal 
basis. ntg does not discriminate but wants to employ the best 
candidate for given positions. 
management is aware the transport industry generally attracts 
some society groups to a higher degree, affecting diversity. 
management believes that ntg’s overall diversity is represen-
tative of the industry in general. however, to ensure continued 
access to a broad range of employees and skills, ntg has an 
objective of increasing diversity at all levels of the organiza-
tion. ntg’s csr and esg policy (available on investor.ntg.com) 
describes the groups approach to ensuring diversity throughout 
the organization. the policy covers all levels of the organization, 
including executive management and the board of directors. 
efforts and results
ntg monitors employee satisfaction yearly, and openly presents 
and discusses the results with employees in order to continuously 
improve the working conditions in the group. in 2020, ntg 
reached an employee satisfaction score, which is similar to  
comparable companies. 
in 2020, ntg concluded a survey of employee matters, in-
cluding data collection on work accidents, nationalities in the 
workforce, employee turnover and gender representation at 
employee and manager-level. generally, diversity is increased in 
connection with the group’s continued international expansion.
ntg has a target of 1/7 representation of the underrepresented 
gender on the board of directors, which was expected to be 
reached in 2022 at the latest. in 2020, this goal was reached, 
and the need of a revised diversity target is currently being 
evaluated.

1. basis for preparation 
this section provides an overview 
of the financial accounting policies 
and key accounting estimates applied 
in the preparation of the group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
the accounting policies set out 
in section 1.1 below have been 
applied consistently with respect to 
the financial year and comparative 
figures from previous year.
this section provides an overview of the financial accounting 
policies and key accounting estimates applied in the prepa-
ration of the group’s consolidated financial statements. the 
accounting policies set out in section 1.1 below have been 
applied consistently with respect to the financial year and 
comparative figures from previous year.  
the consolidated financial statements of ntg nordic transport 
group a/s have been prepared in accordance with the interna-
tional financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the 
eu and further requirements in the danish financial state-
ments act relevant for class d companies. 
the annual report for 2020 was approved by executive 
management and the board of directors on 11 march 2021 
and will be presented for approval at the subsequent annual 
general meeting on 8 april 2021.
1.1 accounting policies, estimates and judgements
the annual report for the period 1 january - 31 december 
2020 comprise the consolidated financial statements of the 
parent company ntg nordic transport group a/s and subsid-
iaries controlled by the parent company (the group).
the annual report has been prepared on a going concern basis 
and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except 
where ifrs explicitly requires use of other values.
new and amended standards adopted by the group
accounting policies have been applied consistently with those 
applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2019. 
the group has implemented all new eu-approved standards, 
interpretations and amendments effective on 1 january 2020. 
the amendments did not have any impact on the amounts 
recognized in prior periods and are not expected to significantly 
affect the current or future periods.
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
certain new accounting standards and interpretations have 
been published that are not mandatory for 31 december 2020 
reporting and have not been early adopted by the group. 
these standards are not expected to have a material impact 
on group in the current or future reporting periods and on 
foreseeable future transactions.  
consolidation principles
the consolidated financial statements comprise ntg nordic 
transport group a/s (parent company) and its subsidiaries.    
subsidiaries
subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. the 
group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct 
the activities of the entity. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the group. they are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations by the group (refer to note 7.1).
consolidation is performed by summarizing the financial state-
ments of the parent company and its subsidiaries. intercompa-
54
ny transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions 
between group entities are eliminated. unrealized losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the transferred asset. accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the group. 
acquired or sold subsidiaries are recognised in the consoli-
dated income statement for the period in which the parent 
controls such entities. comparative figures are not restated for 
recently acquired or sold entities. 
associates
associates are all entities over which the group has significant 
influence, but not control or joint control. this is generally the 
case when the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting 
rights. investments in associates are accounted for using the equi-
ty method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.
non-controlling interests
non-controlling interests’ share of profit/loss for the year and 
of equity in subsidiaries is included in the group’s profit/loss 
for the year and of the equity of subsidiaries, respectively, but 
shown as separate items. net profit for the year is allocated to 
non-controlling interests using the ownership interests present 
on the reporting date.
transactions with non-controlling interest that do not result 
in a change of control are recognized directly in equity. such 
transactions result in an adjustment between the carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to 
reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. any difference 
between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling 
interest and the consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in retained earnings attributable to owners of ntg 
nordic transport group a/s.  
foreign currency translation
functional and presentation currency
items in the financial statements of each reporting entity of the 
group are measured in the currency of the primary economic en-
vironment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
the functional currency of the parent company, ntg nordic 
transport group a/s is dkk.
the financial statements are presented in danish kroner (dkk), 
and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand.
transactions and balances
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transac-
tions. foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the set-
tlement of such transactions and from the translation of mon-
etary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
year end exchange rates are generally recognised on a net basis 
in the statement of profit or loss, within financial items.   
group entities
the results and financial position of all group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
1. 
assets and liabilities for each entity’s balance sheet are trans-
lated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
2. 
income and expenses for each entity’s income statement 
are translated at average exchange rates; and
3. 
all resulting exchange differences are recognized directly 
in other comprehensive income.
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. exchange differences 
arising are recognized in other comprehensive income.
55
statement of cash flow
the cash flow statement shows the group’s cash flows 
during the year distributed on operating, investing and 
financing activities, including changes in cash and cash 
equivalents at the beginning and at the end of the year. the 
cash flow statement cannot be derived directly from the bal-
ance sheet and income statement. 
cash flows from operating activities are calculated using the 
indirect method and as operating profit before special items 
(ebit) for the year adjusted for changes in working capital 
and non-cash operating items such as depreciation, amorti-
zation and impairment losses, and provisions. working cap-
ital comprises current assets less short-term debt excluding 
items included in cash and cash equivalents.
cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows 
from acquisitions and disposals of intangible assets, proper-
ty, plant and equipment as well as fixed asset investments.
cash flows from financing activities comprise cash flows 
from the raising and repayment of long-term debt, including 
servicing of leasing liabilities, as well as payments to and 
from shareholders.
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-
term liquid assets that are readily convertible to cash.
materiality
the financial statements separately present items which 
are considered individually material. individually immaterial 
items are aggregated with other items of similar nature in the 
statements or in the notes. all required disclosures by ifrs 
are presented unless the information is considered immaterial 
to the economic decision-making of the users of the financial 
statements.     
accounting estimates and judgements
the group makes estimates and assumptions concerning 
the future. the resulting accounting estimates rely on man-
agement judgement and will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience 
and other factors that management considers to be reliable, 
but which by their very nature are associated with uncertainty 
and unpredictability. these assumptions may prove incomplete 
or incorrect, and unexpected events or circumstances may 
arise. the estimates and assumptions deemed most significant 
to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are 
addressed below:
• 
acquisition of enterprises (note 7.1)
• 
defined benefit plans (note 8.3)
refer to each of the specific notes for details on relevant 
accounting policies and further description of significant esti-
mates and assumptions used. 
risk factors specific to the group are described in the manage-
ment report from pages 32-33 and in note 6.4.

2. profit for the year
this section includes disclosures 
on components of consolidated 
profit for the year.   
2.1 segment information
accounting policies
management monitors the operating results of its business 
units separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment. segment 
performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss be-
fore special items and is measured consistently with operating 
profit or loss in the consolidated statement of income.
operating segments
the group’s business operations are carried out by two 
divisions, forming the basis for the group’s segment reporting. 
information on business segments is based on the group’s risk 
and returns and its internal financial reporting system. the 
segmentation is a direct match to the group’s management 
structure, with a responsible ceo for each of the two operat-
ing segments. business segments are regarded as the primary 
segments. non-allocated items related to head-office func-
tions are not part of the business segments and are as such 
separated in the segment reporting.
all intersegment transactions and settlements are carried out 
on an arm’s length basis.
air & ocean
the air & ocean division provides international air and ocean 
freight services, including project transports.
road & logistics
the road & logistics division provides transport and ware-
housing solutions with a geographical focus on europe.
major customers
the group has no customers contributing revenue of more 
than 10 % of total revenue and the group is therefore not 
reliant on any major customers.

2.2 net revenue
accounting policies
the group derives revenue primarily from freight forwarding 
services related to transport of goods throughout europe and 
worldwide by road, ocean and air. 
revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when con-
trol of freight forwarding services are transferred to the customer 
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. freight for-
warding services and other services are generally characterized by 
short delivery times except for ocean transports that takes longer 
due to the nature of the service delivered.
timing of revenue recognition reflects when fulfilment of 
performance obligations towards customers take place and 
follows the over-time principle because the customer receives 
and uses the benefits simultaneously.  
revenue generated by providing other logistic services is rec-
ognised in the reporting period in which the service is rendered. 
when determining the transaction price for the sale of services, 
the group considers the effect of variable consideration and 
any other significant factors affecting the transaction price. the 
group’s ordinary course of business is to agree a price (transac-
tion price) with the customer for performing the specific service 
(price allocation) before booking a haulier/carrier and deliver-
ing the service. no material effect of variable consideration is 
present, and no material uncertainty is therefore associated with 
the contract price on an individual transport level. no signifi-
cant financing component is included in the transaction price, 
as sales are generally made with credit terms between 14-60 
days from the delivery date, in coherence with market practice. 
consequently, no adjustments to the transaction prices for the 
time value of money is carried out. 
estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward 
completion are revised if circumstances change. any result-
ing increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs 
are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the cir-
cumstances that give rise to the revision become known by 
management. change of circumstances relating to individual 
transports will ordinarily have a non-material effect on the 
group’s consolidated revenue. 
accrued revenue and accrued costs of services in progress 
at 31 december 2020 are presented on the line items trade 
receivables and trade payables, respectively. accrued revenue 
is estimated and recognized when a sales transaction fulfils 
the criteria for revenue recognition, but no final invoice has yet 
been issued to the customer at the end of the reporting period. 
accrued costs are estimated and recognized when supplier in-
voices relating to recognized revenue for the reporting period 
have yet to be received.
2.3 direct costs
accounting policies
direct costs comprise costs incurred to achieve the year’s reve-
nue and primarily includes costs for hauliers, shipping compa-
nies and airlines. 
2.4 other external expenses
accounting policies
other external expenses include expenses related to rent, it, 
training and education, travelling and other costs of operations 
and maintenance.
58
2.5 staff costs
accounting policies
staff costs include salaries, bonuses, pensions, social security 
costs, vacation pay and other benefits.
staff costs are recognised in the financial year in which the 
associated services are rendered by the employees. costs 
related to long-term employee benefits, e.g., defined benefit 
pension plans, are recognized in the periods in which they are 
earned.
government grants amounting to dkk 9.2 million was rec-
ognised as a deduction to wages and salaries (2019: dkk 0 
million). government grants are recognised at their fair value 
where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be 
received, and the group will comply with all attached condi-
tions. the government grants are related to covid-19 public 
support programs in certain countries. there are no unfulfilled 
conditions or other contingencies attaching to these grants.  
the group did not benefit directly from any other forms of 
government assistance. 
please refer to note 8.1 for detailed information on remuner-
ation of management and note 8.2 for detailed information 
on the groups share option schemes and 8.3 for detailed 
information on pension plans. 
2.6 amortization and depreciation for the year
accounting policies
amortization and depreciation relate to the following fixed 
assets in the balance sheet:  
• 
intangible assets (excluding goodwill),
• 
property, plant and equipment, and
• 
right-of-use assets capitalized (note 5.3)
amortization and depreciation profiles depend on the underly-
ing assets (see notes 5.1 and 5.2)
2.7 special items
accounting policies
special items are reported in the income statement and com-
prise significant income and expenses of an exceptional nature 
relative to the group’s ordinary operations or costs related to 
investments in future activities.
the items are stated separately to give a true and fair view of 
the group’s operating profit. 
special items for the year comprise transaction and integration 
costs from business combinations.

this section contains relevant 
disclosures and details regarding tax 
recognized in the financial statements. 
the total tax on group profit for the 
year amounts to dkk 61.2 million.       
3.1 income tax
accounting policies
the income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax 
payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the 
applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to 
temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the 
tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date in the countries where the group operates and generates 
taxable income. management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which appli-
cable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. it establishes 
provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expect-
ed to be paid to the tax authorities. management’s judgements 
in this respect are based on assumptions and estimates, which 
carry a degree of uncertainty with respect to actual outcomes. 
non-taxable items mainly relate to individual group compa-
nies, where tax losses are non-capitalized.
3.2 deferred tax
accounting policies
deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
however, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they 
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset 
is realized, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available, 
against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or differ-
ent taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis.
the group has non-recognized tax assets totalling 421 million 
at 31 december 2020 (2019: 390 million), of which the major-
ity relates to tax loss carry forwards. the majority of unrecog-
nized deferred tax assets have no significant time limitations. 
non-recognized tax loss carry forwards include dkk 1,742 
million acquired from the transaction with former neurosearch 
a/s. there is no assurance that the group will be able to utilize 
the acquired tax-loss carry forwards, and no deferred tax asset 
has therefore been recognized in this respect.

• 
specific information about each type of financial instru-
ment
•

the group’s exposure to various risks associated with the 
financial instruments is discussed in note 6.4. the maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the 
carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned 
above. 
4.1 trade receivables
accounting policies
a receivable is the group’s unconditional right to consideration 
and is accounted for in accordance with ifrs 9. receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for any transaction 
costs. subsequently, receivables are measured at amortized 
cost, which usually corresponds to the nominal value. 
trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services 
performed in the ordinary course of business. they are gener-
ally due for settlement on a short-term basis and therefore are 
classified as current. 
due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their 
carrying amounts are considered to be the same as their fair 
value. 
information about the impairment of trade receivables and the 
group’s exposure to credit risk, foreign currency and interest 
risk can be found in note 6.4. 
4.2 other financial assets
accounting policies
other financial assets consist of receivables other than trade 
receivables. these other receivables generally arise from trans-
actions outside the usual operating activities of the group. 
the non-current part of other receivables mainly consists of 
deposits, which are measured at cost less repayments and 
impairment (amortized cost).  
4.3 cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents disclosed in the statement of cash 
flows include dkk 21,4 million which are held on restricted 
deposit accounts. deposits are subject to regulatory restric-
tions and are therefore not available for general use by other 
entities within the group. 
4.4 trade and other payables
accounting policies
trade payables represents liabilities for services provided to 
the group prior to the end of financial year, which are unpaid 
trade receivables

at the balance sheet date. the amounts are unsecured and are 
usually paid on a short-term basis. trade and other payables 
are presented as current liabilities unless payment is due more 
than 12 months after the reporting period. they are recog-
nized initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method. carrying 
amounts of trade and other payables are considered to be the 
same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.  
4.5 other financial liabilities
accounting policies
other financial liabilities consist of individually immaterial posi-
tions related to short-term bank overdrafts and other borrow-
ing arrangements outside of credit institutions. 
other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, which 
corresponds to the net realisable value. 
other financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities un-
less the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. 
4.6 lease liabilities
accounting policies
lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of 
future leasing payments under the contract, discounted using 
either the interest rate implicit in the contract, or (if the implicit 
interest rate is not available) an incremental borrowing rate 
appropriate for the group.
subsequent to recognition, lease liabilities are measured at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method, adjusted for 
any remeasurements or contract modifications. lease payments 
are allocated between reduction of the liability and interest ex-
penses. interest expenses are charged to the income statement 
over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. 
for a description of accounting policies and details related to 
right-of-use assets including further disclosures in accordance 
with ifrs 16 refer to note 5.3.
certain lease contracts include extension options with the in-
tention of ensuring operational flexibility. the expected term of 
each lease contract is reflected in the recognized lease liability.

5.1 intangible assets 
goodwill
accounting policies
goodwill acquired in business combinations is recognised 
and measured as the difference between the total of the fair 
value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets on the date of acquisition. goodwill is 
not amortized. the carrying amount of goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually. impairment losses are recognized directly 
for the year and are not subsequently reversed.  
acquired other rights
accounting policies
acquired other similar rights are measured at cost less accumu-
lated amortization and less any accumulated impairment losses 
or at a lower value in use.
65
impairment
accounting policies
goodwill is tested for impairment once a year, other intangible 
assets are tested when there is indication of impairment. 
when performing the impairment test, an assessment is made 
as to the ability of individual cash generating units (cgus) 
to generate sufficient positive net cash flow in the future to 
support the value of the unit in question. 
impairment testing is performed for each cash-generating unit 
to which consolidated goodwill is allocated, as defined by man-
agement. the cash-generating units thereby follow the group’s 
divisional structure: 
• 
road & logistics, and
• 
air & ocean
goodwill is written down to its recoverable amount through the 
income statement, if this is lower than the carrying amount.
the recoverable amount is determined as the present value 
of the discounted future net cash flow from the cash-gen-
erating unit to which the goodwill relates. in calculating the 
present value, discount rates are applied reflecting the risk-free 
interest rate with the addition of risks relating to the individ-
ual cash-generating units, such as geographical and financial 
exposure.
the carrying amount of goodwill at the end of the reporting 
date equals dkk 506.1 million.  for goodwill impairment testing, 
a number of estimates are made. estimates are made in connec-
tion to the development in revenues, operating profits, future 
capital expenditures, discount rates and growth expectations in 
the terminal period. these estimates are based on assessments 
of the current cash-generating units road & logistics and air 
& ocean and are based on historical data and assumptions of 
future expected market developments, including expected long-
term average market growth rates.
the road & logistics division primarily operates in the northern, 
eastern and central european markets. future net cash flows 
of the division are affected by market development and growth 
rates in these regions.
the air & ocean division operates internationally, and its future 
cash flows are therefore exposed to developments in global 
trade and economy. 
future cash flows in both divisions are also affected by the 
development of internal factors, such as network synergies and 
productivity improvements. 
the expected future net cash flow is based on budgets and busi-
ness plans approved by management for the year 2021 and pro-
jections for subsequent years up to and including 2025. from 
2025, ntg nordic transport group a/s expects the growth rate 
to remain in line with the expected long-term average growth 
rate for the industry.

5.2 tangible assets and fixed assets investments
property, plant and equipment
accounting policies
property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumu-
lated depreciation and accumulated impairment. property, plant 
and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows: 
• 
land is not depreciated 
• 
warehouses and other productions buildings 20-30 years
• 
office buildings 40-50 years
• 
other plant and other operating equipment 3-7 years
the basis of depreciation is calculated with due consideration 
to the residual value and any prior impairment write down. the 
estimated useful life and residual value of each asset is deter-
mined at the date of acquisition and reassessed annually. 
impairment
assets are tested for impairment, if indications of impairment 
are present. in case a need for impairment is identified, the 
asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its re-
coverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount. any resulting impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement when the impair-
ment is identified.

5.3 right-of-use assets
contracts are assessed at inception to determine whether the 
group is entering into a lease. if a lease is identified, a right-of-
use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognized in 
the balance sheet at the contract’s commencement date. 
right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, equivalent to 
the relevant recognized lease liability adjusted for any leasing 
payments made on or before the commencement date, any 
initial costs associated to the lease and other directly related 
costs including dismantling and restoration costs. 
subsequent to recognition, right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of each asset’s useful 
life and the relevant lease term and adjusted for any remea-
surements of the lease liability.
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognised for low 
value lease assets or leases with a lease term of 12 months or 
less. these are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. any service elements separable from 
the lease contract are also accounted for following same principle.
in accounting for lease contracts, various judgements are 
applied in determining right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. 
judgements include assessment of lease periods, utilization of 
extension options and applicable discount rates. 
extension options are only included in the lease term if the 
lease is reasonably certain to be extended. the majority of 
extension and termination options held are exercisable only by 
the group and not by the respective lessor.
all right-of-use assets are presented in the balance sheet in the 
line item right-of-use assets. 
right-of-use assets classified as land and buildings mainly relate 
to leases of warehouses, terminals and office buildings, whereas 
assets recognised as other plant and equipment mainly relate 
to leases of trailers, trucks, company cars, forklifts and other 
office equipment.

5.4 provisions
accounting policies
provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is pro-
bable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. provisions 
are not recognised for future operating losses. 
where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood 
that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. a provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to 
any one item included in the same class of obligations may be 
small. 
provisions are measured at the present value of management’s 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period. provisions are in 
all material aspects short term and no interest expense due to 
the passage of time is recognized as an interest expense. 
the group’s provisions are divided into two categories:  
1) provisions for legal claims and restructuring and 2) other 
provisions. the latter mainly consists of provisions recognized 
through business combinations. 
movement in provisions
movements during the year are mainly related to re-organiza-
tion of former gondrand entities and certain legal cases.

6. capital and financial risks
the section describes the shareholders’ equity composition 
and capital management, including risks related to the financ-
ing structure of the group.  
6.1 equity
share capital
at 31 december 2020, the share capital of ntg nordic trans-
port group a/s dkk 453 million consisting of 22.6 million 
shares with a nominal value of dkk 20 each. on 7 july 2020, 
ntg acquired the remaining 15% of ebrex through an increase 
of ntg’s share capital of dkk 4.5 million. please refer to note 
7.1 for further information. 
shares consist of only one share class and include no special 
rights, preferences, or restrictions. all shares are fully paid up.
shares are issued in multiples of 20. each share has a nominal 
value of dkk 20. 
share premium
the share premium represents positive differences between 
the nominal share capital and the amount paid by shareholders 
for newly issued shares. 
the share premium is a distributable reserve.
treasury shares
treasury shares are bought back to meet obligations relating 
to acquisition of minority shareholders’ shares in ntg subsid-
iaries under the “ring-the-bell” concept and to cover obliga-
tions arising under future share-based incentive programs and 
potentially for other purposes such as payment in relation to 
m&a transactions.
the reserve contains the nominal value of treasury shares, 
where any difference to the market price is recognized directly 
in retained earnings in equity. 
the reserve is a distributable reserve.
the share capital is specified as follows:

exchange differences arising on translation of foreign controlled en-
tities are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumu-
lated in a separate reserve within equity. the cumulative amount is 
reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.  
dividends
dividends are recognized as a liability when approved by the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting. dividends recom-
mended to be paid for the year are stated as a separate line item 
under equity until approved at the annual general meeting.
6.2 earnings per share
earnings per share (eps) is calculated according to ias33, as 
shown below. 
6.3 capital management
the group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stake-
holders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce 
costs of capital.
free cash flows are allocated in the priority below:
• 
acquisition of new businesses with a strategic match to the 
group’s existing business
• 
investment in promising start-ups within the group’s industry
• 
repayment of external debt
• 
distributions to the group’s shareholders through payment 
of dividends
executive management and the board of directors monitor the 
share- and capital structure to ensure that the group’s capital 
resources support the strategic goals. through a close dialogue 
with its main lender, the group has been able to decide on fund-
ing of strategic initiatives within a short time frame.
the group’s target leverage ratio (measured as nibd including 
ifrs 16 relative to adj. ebitda) is 2.0 to 3.0 x. this level may be 
temporarily exceeded immediately after significant acquisitions. 
the group’s leverage ratio was 1.0 at 31 december 2020. 
6.4 financial risks
the overall financial risk management framework is laid down 
in the group’s finance policy, investment policy and policies 
regarding credit risks. the group’s finance functions manage 
financial risk at centralized level. thus, the group’s financial 
management is aimed solely at managing and reducing the 
financial risks directly associated with the group’s operations 
and financing.
the disclosures in this note solely concern the most critical 
financial risks, which are:
• 
currency risk
• 
interest risk
• 
liquidity risk
• 
credit risk
currency risk
foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash 
flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in 
foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the group’s operating 
activities due to the international activities of the group. the 
group’s revenues are mainly denominated in dkk, eur, sek, 
chf and pln.  expenses have a pattern in line with revenue. the 
expenses are mainly in dkk, eur, sek, chf and pln. the dkk 
rate is fixed to the eur and is therefore not perceived to present 
a significant currency risk.

interest risk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash 
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. the group’s exposure to interest risk 
arises mainly from the revolving credit facility held by group. the 
material amount relates to short-term facilities and management 
expects to repay the credit facility in the short term. therefore, 
exposure to interest rate risk is considered immaterial.
the group regularly monitors its interest rate risk and considers 
it to be insignificant, therefore an interest rate sensitivity analysis 
is not deemed necessary.
liquidity risks
the group is exposed to liquidity risk in relation to meeting 
future obligations associated with its financial liabilities, which 
mainly include trade payables, other payables and credit facility. 
the group ensures adequate liquidity through the manage-
ment of cash flow forecasts and close monitoring of cash in-
flows and outflows and through inter-group treasury accounts. 
in addition to cash flow from operations, the group’s liquidity 
position is secured through a credit facility with the group’s 
primary bank. at 31 december 2020, the undrawn amount of 
this credit facility totalled dkk 150 million.
credit risks 
the group’s credit risks are partly linked to receivables and 
cash at bank and in hand. the maximum credit risk linked to 
financial assets corresponds to the values recognized in the 
balance sheet. the group has no significant risk regarding one 
individual customer or partner. 
during 2020, the group expensed dkk 11.3 million on ex-
pected losses on trade receivables, corresponding to 0.21 % of 
the group’s net revenue.
due to very low historic realized losses on trade receivables, 
the group applies a simplified approach in calculating expected 
credit losses. therefore, the group does not track changes in 
credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on 
lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. the 
group has established a provision matrix that is based on its 
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking 
factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. 
expected losses on trade receivables, based on weighted loss 
percentages, are as follows:

dkk 31.0 million (2019: dkk 30.8 million). individual assess-
ments mainly cover specific debtors, where settlement of 
accounts is assumed to be unlikely. 
impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net 
impairment losses within operating profit. subsequent recov-
eries of amounts previously written off are credited against the 
same line item.

7. composition of the group
this section provides information 
how the composition of the group 
affects the financial position and 
performance for the year.
7.1 acquisition and disposal of entities
accounting policies
enterprises acquired or formed during the year are recognized 
in the consolidated financial statements from the date of 
acquisition or formation. enterprises disposed of are recog-
nized in the consolidated financial statements up to the date of 
disposal. discontinued operations and assets held for sale are 
presented separately. 
the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all 
business combinations, regardless of whether equity instru-
ments or other assets are acquired. the consideration trans-
ferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises:
• 
fair values of the assets transferred
• 
liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired 
business
• 
equity interests issued by the group
identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabili-
ties assumed in a business combination are, with limited excep-
tions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
estimates and assumptions are an integrated part of assessing fair 
values etc. in accordance with the acquisition method of account-
ing, as observable market prices are seldom available for the 
acquired assets and liabilities. assessments are carried out using 
management’s judgement with regards to future cash flows and 
other input factors to the valuation models used. 
acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred as special 
items.
the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. if 
those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable 
assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.
where settlement of any part of a cash consideration is deferred, 
the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present 
value as at the date of exchange. the discount rate used is the 
entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a sim-
ilar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier 
under comparable terms and conditions.
contingent considerations are classified either as equity or 
financial liabilities. amounts classified as financial liabilities are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss.
if measurement of the identifiable net assets is uncertain at the 
date of acquisition, initial recognition is done based on provisional 
amounts. measurement period adjustments to the provisional 
amounts may be done for up to 12 months following the date of 
acquisition. 
acquisitions during the year
ebrex business solutions 
on 27 february 2020, ntg completed the acquisition of 85% 
of the shares in ebrex business solutions ltd. and its subsid-
iaries (ebrex group). the acquisition marks another important 
step for the group towards becoming a market leader within 
freight forwarding services in the nordics and europe.
consideration transferred
the total consideration consists of a cash payment of dkk 111 
million and a loan of dkk 5 million for settlement during 2020.
adjusted for the fair value of acquired cash and cash equiva-
lents of dkk 8.7 million, the net cash flow amounted to dkk 
102.8 million (outflow).
74
earnings impact
during the 10 months after the acquisition date, ebrex group 
contributed with dkk 253.9 million to the group’s revenue, dkk 
25.9 million to the group’s adj. ebit and dkk 21.6 million to 
the result after tax. if the acquisition had taken place 1 january 
2020 the group’s revenue would have amounted to dkk 5,389.2 
million and result after tax would have amounted to dkk 151.8 
million.
transaction costs
total transaction costs relating to the ebrex acquisition amount 
to dkk 0.9 million. transaction costs are accounted for in the 
income statement as other external expenses. 
integration of ebrex group is still ongoing, and consequently 
net assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, may 
be adjusted, and off-balance sheet items may be recognized for 
up to 12 months after the acquisition date 28 february 2020, in 
accordance with ifrs 3.
fair value of acquired net assets and recognized goodwill
provisional fair values of acquired assets and liabilities at the 
acquisition date are given in the table. 
fair value of acquired trade receivables and other receivables 
amounts to dkk 75.7 million. collectability of receivables has 
been assessed based on group credit assessment policies. in 
total dkk 1.5 million has been provided for as doubtful trade 
receivables. goodwill is primarily related to synergy effects 
from integration with ntg’s existing infrastructure and net-
work. goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes.
share swap with ebrex 
with reference to company announcement no. 17 – 20 of 7 
july 2020, ntg nordic transport group a/s increased the 
share capital by nominally dkk 4,444,600 (222,030 shares of 
dkk 20) at a share price of 95.90, against a contribution of the 
remaining 15% of the shares in ebrex business solutions ltd 
(“ebrex”). following this, ntg nordic transport group’s own-
ership of ebrex is 100%. the share swap transaction is separate 
to ntg nordic transport group’s initial acquisition of ebrex. 
result of this separate share swap is presented as part of the 
line item “acquisition of shares from non-controlling interests” 
in the statement of changes in equity.

acquisitions in 2019
d.a.p (uk) 
by 1 january 2019 the group acquired a 100% ownership inter-
est in uk-based freight forwarder d.a.p. (uk). the acquisition 
increased the group’s presence in a new geographical market 
and increased activity in both of the group’s business segments.   
consideration transferred
the total consideration consists of a cash payment of dkk 35 
million in addition to a contingent consideration. the contin-
gent consideration is determined over a period of 3 years from 
the acquisition date with vesting each year during the 3-year 
period. for each vesting year, the contingent consideration 
is determined using three input factors: 1) the acquisition’s 
financial performance during the vesting year, 2) the group’s fi-
nancial performance during the vesting year, and 3) the group’s 
average market capitalization during the vesting year. the 
expected contingent consideration totaled dkk 20.3 million 
at 31 december 2019. at 31 december 2020, the remaining 
contingent consideration totals dkk 2.1 million. 
adjusted for the fair value of acquired cash and cash equiva-
lents of dkk 7.6 million, the net cash flow amounted to dkk 
27.7 million (outflow).
for further details on the d.a.p. acquisition please refer to note 
7.1 of the group’s annual report 2019.   
7.2 non-controlling interests
as part of ntg’s governance model, shareholders of non-con-
trolling interests in subsidiaries have, upon maturity, a pre-de-
fined mechanism of swapping their subsidiary shares with 
shares in the parent company (the “ring-the-bell” concept).  
the swaps are subject to an offer from non-controlling sub-
sidiary shareholders and an acceptance from ntg’s executive 
management. 
in addition to various minor transaction with non-controlling 
interest in the course of maintaining the group’s partnership 
structure, the following noteworthy transactions were carried 
out during 2020:
• 
share swap with ebrex to achieve 100 % ownership. refer-
ence is made to note 7.1 for further information.
• 
initiation of the “ring-the-bell” process in ntg polar 
road in finland, whereby the first of five tranches in the 
subsidiary was swapped for shares in ntg. ntg paid with 
treasury shares in consideration.
• 
initiation of the “ring-the-bell” process in ntg polar 
road in poland, whereby the first of five tranches in the 
subsidiary was swapped for shares in ntg. ntg paid with 
treasury shares in consideration.
on 31 december 2020, no non-controlling interests in any 
of the group’s subsidiaries are material to the consolidated 
financial statements.

8.2 share-based payment programs
accounting policies
employee services received in exchange for share based payments 
granted correspond to fair value on the grant date. share-based 
payments are either equity or cash settled and recognized in the 
income statement as staff costs over the vesting period. 
the fair value is determined using the black & scholes valua-
tion model measured on the grant date. valuation assumptions 
take into account terms and conditions applicable to the share 
options and warrants, and management’s expectations on the 
input variables. estimated volatility is based on a peer review, 
adjusted for ntg specific factors. a total of 3 employees held 
share options or warrants on 31 december 2020 (2019: 3 
employees). no share-based payment programs have reached 
maturity at 31 december 2020.
valuation of the share-based payments granted in 2020 and 2019 
is based on assumptions disclosed in the following table. a lower 
volatility in 2020 relative to 2019 is caused by a more comprehen-
sive trading history in the shares of ntg nordic transport group 
a/s following the reverse acquisition on 7 october 2019:

expenses arising from share-based payment transactions
total expenses arising from share-based payment transactions 
recognized during the period as part of employee benefit ex-
pense totaled dkk 1.3 million (2019: dkk 0.3 million).
warrants program 2020 
warrants are granted with a vesting period of three to ten 
years. on the grant date an estimate is performed over the 
number of shares expected to vest. this number is subsequent-
ly adjusted to match the actual number of warrants earned. 
79
the value of warrants will be capped at a maximum of dkk 
143 per warrant on average. the total number of warrants 
granted under the program will not exceed 700,000. 
non-vested warrants or share purchase options will, in certain 
circumstances, lapse in connection with a participant’s termina-
tion of employment.
ntg nordic transport group a/s has the right to settle war-
rants in either cash or shares when exercised. 
warrants program 2019
in 2019 members of the group’s executive management board 
were granted a one-off warrants program in connection with 
listing of the group on nasdaq omx copenhagen on 7 octo-
ber 2019. the program’s purpose is to retain members of the 
executive management board by providing an incentive to 
service the group for a period at least until vesting and to align 
interests with shareholders. 
the program has a three-year vesting period and ntg nordic 
transport group a/s has the right to settle warrants in either 
cash or shares when exercised. 
8.3 pension obligations
accounting policies
the pension obligations of most group entities are covered 
by independent pension funds or insurance contracts (defined 
contribution plans) to which group companies pay regular 
contributions. for a few group companies, pension obligations 
are not covered or only partly covered by insurance (defined 
benefit plans).
for defined-benefit plans, the net present value is only calculat-
ed for those benefits by employees up until the balance sheet 
date. the present value of future pension payments is estimat-
ed actuarially and shown net of the fair value of any plan assets 
in the balance sheet as pension obligations. 
differences between estimated pension assets and liabilities 
and their realized values are termed actuarial gains and losses. 
actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of 
other comprehensive income. 
changes in benefits earned to date are actuarially calculated 
and expensed immediately when the employees have already 
earned the right to the changed benefits. otherwise, they are 
recognized in the income statement over the period during 
which the employees earn the right to the benefits. 
accounting estimates and judgments
generally, pension plans within the group are defined contri-
bution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income 
statement on an accrual basis. these types of pension plans do 
not require material estimates.  
for defined benefit plans, annual actuarial calculations are made 
of the net present value of future benefits to be paid under the 
plan. the net present value is calculated based on assumptions 
of the future developments of salary, interest, inflation, and 
mortality rates. assumptions are assessed at the reporting date 
and changes in these assumptions may significantly affect the 
liabilities and pension cost under defined benefit plans.
below is shown the most important assumptions made when 
determining the net present value of the defined benefit plans 
and a sensitivity analysis relating to these assumptions.
under defined benefit plans, the employer is obliged to pay a 
defined benefit (for example a fixed percentage of an employ-
ee’s final salary) to the employee after retirement. the group 
thereby carries a risk with respect of future developments in 
interest rates, inflation, mortality and disability.

defined benefit plans in the group are only related to germa-
ny and switzerland. the pension plan in germany accounts for 
76 % of the net liability at year-end and is closed for further 
accrual of benefits by the company’s employees. remaining 
plan participants in germany receive benefit based on past 
service. in switzerland, the pension plan is a result of the swiss 
pensions system’s “second pillar”, and offers old age pensions, 
survivors’ and invalidity insurance. the plan is a fully insured 
bvg plan according to swiss federal law on occupational 
benefits, meaning that the full actuarial risk is re-insured with a 
third-party life-insurance company. 
the group’s plans are funded in accordance with applicable 
local legislation. at 31 december 2020 the group has covered 
42.4% of the pension liability.
the expected contributions to the group’s plans for 2021 are 
dkk 10.4 million and the expected average duration of the 
obligations is 7.8 years. 
actuarial adjustments have no tax effect for the financial year 2020.

8.7 events after the reporting period
on 29 january 2021 ntg acquired 100 % of the issued shares 
in cargorange ab. the acquisition is expected to increase 
the group’s market presence in sweden. the fair value of the 
consideration totals dkk 41.2 million in cash payment and an 
additional minor adjustment related to realized results in 2020.  
the financial effects of this transaction have not been recog-
nized at 31 december 2020. the operating results and assets 
and liabilities of the acquired company will be consolidated 
from 29 january 2021.
at the time the financial statements were authorized for 
issue, the group had not yet completed the accounting for 
the acquisition of cargorange ab. in particular, the fair values 
of the acquisition’s assets and liabilities have yet been deter-
mined as valuations have not been finalized. it is therefore not 
yet possible to provide detailed information about each class 
of acquired receivables and any contingent liabilities of the 
acquired entity. the acquisition’s financial reporting has not 
yet been converted to the group’s reporting principles, and no 
disclosure is therefore made of the acquisitions past financial 
results.

independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of ntg 
nordic transport group a/s
our opinion
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a 
true and fair view of the group’s financial position at 31 decem-
ber 2020 and of the results of the group’s operations and cash 
flows for the financial year 1 january to 31 december 2020 in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act.
moreover, in our opinion, the parent company financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the parent company’s finan-
cial position at 31 december 2020 and of the results of the 
parent company’s operations for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act.
our opinion is consistent with our auditor’s long-form report 
to the audit committee and the board of directors.
what we have audited
the consolidated financial statements of ntg nordic trans-
port group a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 decem-
ber 2020 comprise the consolidated income statement and 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance 
sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated cash flow statement and the notes, including 
summary of significant accounting policies.
the parent company financial statements of ntg nordic 
transport group a/s for the financial year 1 january to 31 
december 2020 comprise the income statement, the balance 
sheet, the statement of changes in equity and the notes, includ-
ing summary of significant accounting policies.
collectively referred to as the “financial statements”.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international stan-
dards on auditing (isas) and the additional requirements applica-
ble in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and 
requirements are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the inter-
national ethics standards board for accountants’ code of ethics 
for professional accountants (iesba code) and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark. we have also fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-au-
dit services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no 
537/2014 were not provided.
appointment
following the admission of shares of ntg nordic transport 
group a/s for the listing on nasdaq copenhagen, we were first 
appointed auditors of ntg nordic transport group a/s on 16 
april 2020. we have been reappointed annually by shareholder 
resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 1 
year, including the financial year 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the finan-
cial statements for 2020. these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
87
revenue recognition and accrued cost of services
the group’s revenue consists primarily of services, i.e. transportation of goods 
between destinations, which by nature is rendered over a period of time. the 
determination of timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the application of 
the group’s accounting policies and terms in customer contracts.
we focused on this area because the process of accruing for services rendered around 
the balance sheet date (accrued cost of services) is complex and dependent on mana-
gement accounting estimates and relevant controls in certain operational systems.
reference is made to notes 2.2 and 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements.
how our audit addressed
our audit procedures included assessing the accounting policies for revenue 
recognition applied by management. 
we tested relevant internal controls, including it controls, concerning the timing 
of revenue recognition and evaluated whether these were designed in line with 
the group’s accounting policies and were operating effectively.
we selected a sample of revenue transactions during the year and traced these to 
underlying evidence. in addition, we used data auditing tools to identify non-stan-
dard transactions and examined these.
for revenue, we examined reports concerning services in progress and challenged 
the estimates made by management in this regard. for accrued cost estimates in 
prior periods, we performed look back procedures to evaluate the precision in the 
estimates of accrued costs.
business combinations
in 2020, ebrex group was acquired with accounting effect as at 28 february 
2020. management prepared a purchase price allocation for the acquisition, resul-
ting in assets and liabilities being separately recognized and valued in the opening 
balance sheet.
we focused on this area as identification and measurement of assets and liabilities 
related to the business acquisitions are based on significant accounting estimates 
made by management.
reference is made to note 7.1 to the consolidated financial statements.
how our audit addressed
our audit procedures included assessing the accounting policies applied by  
management.
we verified the assets and liabilities recognised in the opening balance sheet, 
including the completeness thereof, by performing audit procedures in relation to 
the opening balance sheet.
we assessed the method used by management to identify and measure assets 
and liabilities, and we challenged the assumptions applied, using our knowledge 
and professional scepticism.
finally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures relating to the business acquisitions.
88
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for management’s review.
our opinion on the financial statements does not cover man-
agement’s review, and we do not express any form of assur-
ance conclusion thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read management’s review and, in doing so, 
consider whether management’s review is materially inconsis-
tent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, we considered whether management’s review 
includes the disclosures required by the danish financial 
statements act.
based on the work we have performed, in our view, manage-
ment’s review is in accordance with the consolidated financial 
statements and the parent company financial statements and 
has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the danish financial statements act. we did not identify any 
material misstatement in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for 
the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consoli-
dated financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and further requirements in the danish 
financial statements act, and for the presentation of parent 
company financial statements that give a true and fair view in 
accordance with the danish financial statements act, and for 
such internal control as management determines is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the financial statements, management is re-
sponsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liqui-
date the group or the parent company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the addi-
tional requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas and the additional 
requirements applicable in denmark, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. we also:
• 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, mis-
representations, or the override of internal control.
• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are ap-
propriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s 
and the parent company’s internal control.
• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relat-
ed disclosures made by management.
• 
conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncer-
tainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the group’s and the parent compa-
89
ny’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions 
may cause the group or the parent company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
• 
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underly-
ing transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the group to express an opinion on the consoli-
dated financial statements. we are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. 
we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with governance regard-
ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant de-
ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with governance with a state-
ment that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all re-
lationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
from the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

accounting policies
ntg nordic transport group a/s’ parent company financial 
statements are disclosed as separate financial statements as 
required by the danish financial statements act. 
the annual report of ntg nordic transport group a/s for 
2020 has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the danish financial statements act applying to enterprises of  
reporting class d. 
the company’s financial statements for 2020 are presented in 
dkk million and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
the annual report is prepared according to the same accounting 
policies as last year.
translation policies
transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the ex-
change rates at the dates of transaction. exchange differences 
arising due to differences between the transaction date rates 
and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in finan-
cial income and expenses in the income statement.
receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign 
currencies that have not been settled at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. 
any differences between the exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and the rates at the time when the receivable or the 
debt arose are recognised in financial income and expenses in 
the income statement.
cash flow statement
no separate cash flow statement has been prepared for the 
parent company in accordance with the exemption clause of 
section 86(4) of the danish financial statements act.
income statement
revenue
revenue from the sale of services etc. is recognised in the 
income statement provided that delivery and transfer of risk 
have been made to the purchaser by year end and provided 
that the revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable 
that the economic benefits relating to the sale will flow to the 
company.
revenue is measured at the consideration received and is rec-
ognised exclusive of vat and net of discounts relating to sales.
other operating income
other operating income includes items of secondary nature to 
the company’s main area of business. 
other external expenses
other external expenses comprise expenses for distribution, 
sales, marketing, administration, premises, bad debts as well as 
leases, etc.
staff costs
staff expenses comprise wages and salaries as well as payroll 
expenses.
income from investments in subsidiaries
income from investments in subsidiaries consists of dividends 
from investment in subsidiaries.  
dividends from investments in subsidiaries are measured at 
cost and are recognized as income in the parent company’s 
income statement in the financial year in which the dividend is 
declared. 
dividends from investment in subsidiaries are recognised as 
income in the company’s income statement under financial 
income. 
financial income and costs
financial income and costs comprise interests, realized and 
unrealized gain from exchange rates as well as other financial 
income and expenses.
95
tax on profit/loss for the year
tax for the year consists of current tax for the year. the tax at-
tributable to the profit for the year is recognised in the income 
statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions 
is recognised directly in equity.
the company is jointly taxed with its danish subsidiaries. the 
tax effect of the joint taxation is allocated to enterprises in 
proportion to their taxable incomes.
balance sheet
investments in subsidiaries
investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost. if the cost ex-
ceeds the recoverable amount, this is written down to a lower 
value. any impairment is recognized in the company’s income 
statement under impairment of financial assets. 
dividends from investment in subsidiaries are recognized in 
the income statement as financial income. dividends distrib-
uted from the subsidiary to the parent company are generally 
recognized in the income statement of the parent company 
only if the distribution arises from earnings obtained after the 
parent company acquired the subsidiary. dividends relating to 
earnings earned before the acquisition date are recognized as a 
reduction to the cost price.
receivables
receivables are measured in the balance sheet at amortized 
cost, which substantially corresponds to nominal value. an 
impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence that 
a receivable or a group of receivables is impaired. if there is 
objective evidence that an individual receivable has been im-
paired, an impairment loss is recognised on an individual basis. 
receivables in respect of which there is no objective evidence 
of individual impairment are tested for objective evidence of 
impairment on a portfolio basis. the portfolios are primarily 
based on the debtors’ domicile and credit ratings in line with 
the company’s risk management policy. the objective evidence 
applied to portfolios is determined based on historical loss 
experience.
equity - dividend
dividend proposed for the year is recognised as a liability once 
adopted at the annual general meeting (declaration date). 
dividends expected to be distributed for the financial year are 
presented as a separate item under “equity”.
current tax receivables and liabilities
current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the 
balance sheet as the expected taxable income for the year ad-
justed for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and tax paid on 
account. extra payments and repayment under the on account 
taxation scheme are recognised in the income statement in 
financial income and expenses.
financial liabilities
financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing 
at the net proceeds received less transaction costs paid. on 
subsequent recognition, financial liabilities are measured at 
amortized cost, corresponding to the capitalised value, using 
the effective interest rate. accordingly, the difference between 
the proceeds and the nominal value is recognisedin the income 
statement over the term of the loan.
other liabilities are measured at amortized cost, substantially 
corresponding to nominal value.

of investments in subsidiaries. if indications are present, investments will be 
tested for impairment using the same principles as applied on the group’s
