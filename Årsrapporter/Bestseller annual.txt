independent auditor's report
to the shareholder of bestseller a/s
opinion
we have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of
bestseller a/s for the financial year 1 august 2019 - 31 july 2020, which comprise income statement,
balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement, notes and summary of significant
accounting policies, for both the group and the parent company. the consolidated financial statements and the
parent company financial statements are prepared under the danish financial statements act.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true
and fair view of the group and the parent company's financial position at 31 july 2020 and of the results of the
group and the parent company's  operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 august 2019 - 31 july 2020
in accordance with the danish financial statements act.
basis for opinion
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas) and the additional
requirements applicable in denmark. our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further
described in the “auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent
company financial statements” (hereinafter collectively referred to as ”the financial statements”) section of our
report. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants'
code of ethics for professional accountants (iesba code) and the additional requirements applicable in
denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
management's responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company
financial statements, that give a true and fair view in accordance with the danish financial statements act and
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements and the parent company the financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements, management is
responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements unless management
either intends to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.

independent auditor's report
auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company
financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and
parent company financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional
requirements applicable in denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements and parent company financial statements.
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with isas and the additional requirements applicable in denmark,
we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. we also:

identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and parent
company financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.

obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the group's and the parent company's  internal control.

evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company's  ability to continue as a going concern. if we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. however, future events or conditions may cause the group
and the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated financial statements and
parent company financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements and parent company financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that gives a true and fair view.

management's review
bestseller remains committed to fashion fwd
since the launch of our sustainability strategy fashion fwd, we have taken important steps in building a
foundation that will enable us to address some of the fashion industry’s key sustainability challenges.
fashion fwd will launch us towards our north star – our ultimate ambition – bestseller is climate
positive, fair for all and circular by design. to illustrate our commitment to these goals – and to underline
that collaboration is essential to accelerate sustainable change in our industry – we signed the g7 fashion
pact in august 2019 to show our support to a series of environmental commitments based on science-based
targets. this report will outline bestseller’s progress during the financial year of 2019/20 with regards to
the three elements of our north star.
while the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on bestseller and the fashion industry
in general, it has also reemphasised for us that sustainability is an absolute basic principle for creating a
resilient world with thriving businesses. we cannot lose momentum on the progress and the important
initiatives we have worked hard for in recent years. as a company with a wide reach, we know we have a
large responsibility and sustainability is embedded in our culture.
turning ambition into action
in 2019/20, bestseller has continued developing roadmaps and setting baselines to build the foundation
required to achieve our fashion fwd goals and continue our advance towards our north star. we have also
taken significant steps in transforming our business processes, product design and material sourcing, so that
we can integrate sustainability within our business.
the importance of strong relationships with our partners and suppliers, through which we have grown our
common business over the years, have really shown their value during these uncertain times. we are grateful
for all these relationships.
key highlights

we are well on the way to transforming our cotton sourcing to 100 percent more sustainable cotton. in
2019/20, 81 percent of the cotton we sourced came from more sustainable sources, including 19 percent
organic cotton.

in january 2020, we became a partner of the organic cotton accelerator – the only multi-stakeholder
organisation fully dedicated to organic cotton. bestseller has signed agreements with two farm
groups in india – totalling 2,000 organic cotton farmers.  

in december 2019, we intensified our long-term collaboration with bsr’s herproject™ by signing a five-
year partnership agreement. in total 78,478 women have benefitted from herproject™ workplace
programmes in bestseller’s supply chain.

management's review
climate positive
in bestseller, we want to have a positive impact on the planet’s climate across our value chain by
removing more greenhouse gases than we emit. our fashion fwd strategy sets out our policies, programmes
and goals with regards to the environment and climate. in particular, we are focused on improving the raw
materials we use, reducing our impact on water systems, protecting biodiversity and reducing carbon
emissions. in general, bestseller is committed to creating a future for fashion within planetary
boundaries.
in 2018, bestseller officially committed to setting goals for the reduction of greenhouse gases through
the science based targets initiative (sbti). since then, we have been working hard to collect data and create
a baseline for our climate goals and action plans. in 2019/20, this has included conducting screening
assessments to understand what is material and relevant, as well as peer benchmarking studies. we expect
to make our sbt climate goals public during fy 2020/21.
a large proportion of the resources used by the fashion industry is related to the materials used to make
textiles and is therefore a risk to our planet due to the environmental impact. from growing raw materials to
producing usable fibres and fabrics, our business relies on substantial amounts of energy, water, land and
chemicals. additionally, the fashion industry is contributing to the increasing scarcity of resources and
rising level of waste at a global level, which effects our natural world and challenges our business resilience. 
making a material difference
bestseller has a significant opportunity to make an overall positive impact on environment and people
by improving the raw materials we use to make our products. this includes investing in the global supply
and resilience of organic cotton, increasing our use of innovative and recycled fibres and setting high
standards in terms of animal welfare.
with regards to bestseller’s sourcing, we have prioritised transitioning to more sustainable cotton due to
cotton’s position as one of our most important raw materials by volume, and this can be seen in our results
so far. we still have some work to do with regards to the integration of recycled polyester. read about our
progress below:

fashion fwd goal: by 2022, we will source 100% of our cotton from more sustainable alternatives.
o     2019/20 status: 81%

fashion fwd goal: by 2025, within our 100% more sustainable cotton supply, we will source 30% organic
cotton.
o     2019/20 status: 19%

fashion fwd goal: by 2025, we will source 50% of our polyester from recycled polyester or other more
sustainable alternatives.
o     2019/20 status: 6%

management's review
collaborating with major sustainable textile initiatives such as fashion for good, textile exchange (te) and
the better cotton initiative (bci), we are working with industry peers to increase the availability, and our
own sourcing, of fibres and materials produced with a smaller environmental footprint. for example, in
january 2020, we proudly partnered with the organic cotton accelerator to create conditions of change to
secure the future of organic cotton and from the upcoming harvest we expect to source 1,500 tonnes of
organic cotton direct from farmers. in june 2020, we announced that we had partnered with environmental
organisation canopy to eliminate the use of man-made cellulosic (mmc) fibres, paper and packaging sourced
from ancient and endangered forests in our supply chain. bestseller has committed that by 2022, 100
percent of our mmc fibres will be sourced responsibly in line with industry best practice, such as the forest
stewardship council (fsc).
at bestseller, we have a policy that no animals should be harmed during the manufacturing of our
products. we are working with industry experts to support the development and implementation of credible
animal welfare standards. bestseller’s long-term ambition is to source all our raw materials from
responsible sources, and we are committed to driving transparency and traceability in the supply chains of
animal derived fibres and materials. in addition, we support the use of recycled animal fibres and more
sustainable innovations of non-animal origin that can replace animal-based fibres. bestseller is a fur-free
company and does not accept the use of materials derived from endangered species.
all the virgin down used in bestseller products comes from sources certified according to the responsible
down standard (rds). alternatively, certified recycled down can be used. we have a goal to source all our
wool from responsible sources by 2025 – meaning certified to the responsible wool standard (rws) or
equivalent standards, organic wool or recycled wool. we have partnered with the good cashmere standard®
by abtf and will effectively start sourcing cashmere fibres for our products through this source from 2020
onwards. 
improving environmental management in our supply chain
bestseller measures the environmental performance of our suppliers’ facilities across seven impact areas:
environmental management systems, water use, wastewater, chemical use, waste management, energy use
and greenhouse gas emissions. we have set year-on-year targets for our suppliers to work towards and we
track and support environmental management improvements across our supply chain. 
when choosing our suppliers, we consider the level of risk and sustainability performance, and we drive
improvements through incentives. bestseller has committed that by 2025 we will source 75 percent of all
our product orders with suppliers performing highly in both environmental and social sustainability. in
2019, we have engaged 227 factories across seven countries in the adoption and utilisation of the higg fem
(facility environmental module) tool. the average score from our suppliers was 45/100 for 2019 up from
37/100 in 2018.
to help protect water sources and safeguard long-term water use, we have focused on materials that require
less water to be produced, and we have worked with our suppliers to encourage more responsible water
management and the adoption of advances such as waterless dyeing and energy/water-efficient laundry
machineries. 
bestseller a/s
page 14
management's review
in 2019/20, we have undertaken more strategic mapping of water use in our supply chain, so we can set more
tangible targets. we have become a member of the alliance for water stewardship (aws) and we are
adopting its standard framework for achieving sustainable water management in a river catchment context.
in pakistan, three of our suppliers in karachi have been working with aws to implement the framework and
we will share the lessons learnt throughout our supply chain going forward.
we have a strong focus on chemical management to verify that our finished products are meeting our
stringent requirements, and to protect workers in the supply chain from hazardous chemicals. our
restricted substances list (rsl), packaging restricted substances list (prsl) and manufacturing restricted
substances list (mrsl) catalogue chemicals that are banned and restricted in our final products. through
our chemical testing programme, we regularly utilise certified independent laboratories to ensure full
compliance. our rsl has been developed by our internal chemical specialists, is updated yearly and is fully
in-line with all global legislation. we set year-on-year chemical management targets for key suppliers and
support their progress towards these goals. as a member of the afirm group, we align with the industry on
test methods, as well as collaborate on chemical investigations and legislative updates. 
in 2020/21, bestseller will integrate a digital chemical inventory tool into our supply chain after a
successful pilot. the tool will enable our supply chain partners to easily identify the existence of potentially
hazardous chemicals, so they can be phased out. this will increase the transparency of chemical use
throughout the supply chain. by 2025, bestseller has committed to having 100 percent approved and
traceable chemicals in all our core products. 
transforming energy use in our own operations
as part of fashion fwd, bestseller has set a goal to reduce our energy consumption in our owned and
operated buildings by 30 percent by 2025. in 2019/20, we started to research systems and an efficient way to
collect and monitor our energy data. 
for our 2021 goal of powering our own and operated buildings globally with 100 percent renewable
electricity, we are on track. in august 2020, in collaboration with the danish company better energy,
construction began on our own 200-megawatt (mv) capacity solar plant. it will produce the equivalent of
bestseller’s entire global electricity consumption for owned and operated buildings. the new solar power
plant, which is privately funded with no subsidies, has been made possible by bestseller’s parent
company heartland.
fair for all
in bestseller, we want everyone working in our value chain to be empowered by jobs that are safe, that
protect human rights and provide fair incomes and opportunities for everyone to reach their personal
potential. as a large fashion company, we are touching the lives of millions of workers in our supply chain
every day and protecting them from human rights abuses is integral to bestseller’s values. 
to promote the wellbeing of the workers in our supply chain and support national stakeholders in driving
the garment and footwear industry forward, we work with our suppliers to provide safe workplaces and fair
employment.

management's review
due to the historical context and the social and political reality of the countries where our clothes are
produced, there are a number of salient risks associated with our supply chain. overall, there remains a risk
of unethical and unsafe working conditions within the global textile supply chain. these issues can lead to
instability in production and the abuse of both human and labour rights. 
raising safety standards
at bestseller, we do not own any factories, but collaborate with suppliers and factories to produce our
products. all factories must go through a comprehensive onsite social & labour and chemical & environment
assessment from one of our local responsible sourcing teams – or from a third party appointed by
bestseller – to be approved for bestseller production. we developed our factory standards
programme to ensure that all applicable human and labour rights are protected for workers in our supply
chain, that decent working conditions prevail, and that bestseller’s production does not have a negative
impact on the environment.
a large part of our production occurs at factories that we have worked with for 20 years or more. these long-
term partnerships help our mutual transition to a more sustainable reality. since the global outbreak of
covid-19, we have maintained an even closer dialogue with our suppliers to assist factories in a challenging
time. in particular, we have focused on preventive measures, wage payments and that any dismissals
adhered to all legal requirements.
bestseller is committed to embedding occupational health & safety (ohs) within all sourcing processes
and it is a central element of our factory standards programme. following the outbreak of covid-19, we
quickly identified the significant risks it would have on our supply chain. we have been and continue to be in
regular dialogue with our suppliers to help them through this difficult time. our responsible sourcing have
provided guidance and support on financial support opportunities and preventative health measures to limit
the spread of the virus.
to encourage suppliers to invest in ohs, we have been developing a business case that links ohs and
productivity in the factories. having a strong business case helps us and our suppliers to further build
internal and external awareness and interest for sustainable supply chain objectives, thus promoting
sustainability of the supply chain as a business enabling platform. to further contribute to this process, we
have joined various projects conducting research in this area. these projects include the productivity and
occupational health safety project (posh) designed by the university of aalborg, in collaboration with
ahsanullah university of science and technology (bangladesh) and funded by the danish development
agency (danida) that was successfully completed in 2019.
it is absolutely paramount that workers are safe from fire and electrical risks, and are able to work in safe,
structurally sound buildings. we are a signatory to the bangladesh accord on fire and building safety (the
accord), which was replaced by the rmg sustainability council (rsc) from june 2020. to build on our
efforts around fire and building safety, bestseller has joined and become a steering committee member
of the life and building safety (labs) initiative that is facilitated by the sustainable trade initiative (idh).
working with labs, we help improve the working conditions of garment workers – especially in india – by
addressing risks related to fire and electrical hazards, structural building safety and providing proper safety
training for workers.

protecting workers’ rights
constructive social dialogue between employers, workers and their representatives is vital to enabling
workers to understand their rights, voice their needs and negotiate improvements. over the past few years,
our approach has focused on developing workplace social dialogue in factories and developing social
dialogue at sectoral/industrial level. in bestseller, we believe social dialogue is a prerequisite for progress
with regards to key labour rights issues. these include freedom of association, women’s empowerment and
wage digitalisation.
as part of fashion fwd, bestseller committed to evaluating and redesigning our productivity & social
dialogue programme based on learnings from myanmar and bangladesh and further implement
improvements for management and workers in partnership with our key suppliers across key sourcing
countries by 2021. in 2019/20, we achieved the first part of that goal with the completion of a revamped
productivity & social dialogue programme.
in myanmar, bestseller has also worked together with two other global brands and act (action
collaboration transformation) to establish a freedom of association (foa) guideline with local labour
unions and suppliers’ representatives. the foa guideline and our dialogue programme has been crucial in
the aftermath of covid-19 to protect workers from unfair dismissal.
bestseller is a member of act – an agreement between global brands, retailers and trade unions to
transform the garment, textile and footwear industry and achieve living wages for workers through
collective bargaining at industry level that is linked to purchasing practices. bestseller has signed a
memorandum of understanding with industriall and agreed to respect and deliver on five act purchasing
practices commitments in a progressive manner.
for almost a decade, we have been working with business for social responsibility (bsr) and its local
partners on creating an environment that enables women to develop and access resources for continuous
personal development. having become a catalyst member of herproject™ this year, bestseller
intensified its relationship with bsr and formed a five-year strategic partnership. 
by the end of 2019/20, we had reached more than 44,574 women in bestseller’s supply chain across
bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, pakistan and vietnam. factoring in herproject™ programmes
supported by other brands, the total number of women that have benefited from herproject™ workplace
programmes in bestseller’s supply chain reached 78,478. in response to covid-19, bestseller
collaborated with bsr to repurpose herhealth materials and resources to compile locally relevant hygiene
resources.
cash payments in the global garment supply chain create significant challenges for both employers and
workers. for employers, this includes loss of worker production-time and risk of fraud during
transportation. workers face the threat of theft on payday and a lack of personal financial visibility in order
to save or invest money. 
bestseller a/s
page 17
management's review
bestseller joined the bsr / herproject™ wage digitalisation project in bangladesh in august 2019 to
contribute to finding a solution to these problems, simultaneously taking a step towards achieving one of
our fashion fwd goals: by 2025, we will support all tier 1 factories in implementing digital payment of
wages. initial results have shown that worker production-time lost on payday has fallen by 78 percent, while
12.5 percent of women reported an increased confidence to deal with expected or unexpected expenses and
10 percent stopped giving their salaries to others.
currently, we are working with bsr on scaling up our efforts in wage digitalisation and supporting our
suppliers and workers following the global outbreak of covid-19, enabling infrastructure for digital
solutions and preserving sustainability of the garment industry.
increasing transparency in our supply chain
we believe in increased transparency to the public and we believe that by opening up our factory list, we can
encourage everyone to take steps towards continuous improvements in the supply chain. twice a year, we
publish an updated list of our on-boarded tier 1 garment manufacturing factories. 
transparency enables bestseller to address risks, promote positive change and build further trust with
our stakeholders. we will continue to increase our transparency around our supply chain and products, and
we have a target to publish our key materials suppliers in 2021. and we are well on the way, as all chinese
material suppliers, who represent the majority, are published through the institute of public & environment
affairs (ipe).
the ipe is a non-profit environmental ngo based in beijing, which uses transparency to strengthen
environmental governance in china. amongst other tools, the ipe has online maps that display the pollution
records of millions of chinese factories. bestseller has joined the ipe’s green supply chain map, which
provides maximum transparency and accountability of our suppliers. bestseller’s logo is displayed in
connection with our suppliers’ facilities, so consumers and investors can stay updated on our supply chain’s
environmental management.
circular by design
in bestseller, we want our business model to be based on design principles that prioritise efficiency and
the reuse of resources at every level, from fibres to water and chemicals to post-consumer, in order to
minimise waste and keep resources in use.
bestseller understands the critical role collaboration will play in achieving systemic change. to help
drive this circularity transition, we have pledged to test and implement circular business models in selected
key markets with relevant partners by 2025. as a strategic partner of fashion for good and the global
fashion agenda, we are supporting innovative solutions that can facilitate a circular fashion model. in july
2019, vero moda signed up to the jeans redesign project developed under the ellen macarthur
foundation’s make fashion circular initiative and designed three styles of jeans following four specific
guidelines: durability, material health, recyclability and traceability. the jeans arrived in stores in july 2020.

reducing plastic use
we have mapped our plastic and packaging footprint to ensure we take action in impactful areas, all the
while making quick changes to reduce the use of plastic wherever and whenever possible. for example, we
have stopped using plastic shopping bags in our stores and replaced them with bags made from fsc paper,
while also working with our customers to reduce the use of bags in general. we are also assisting our
suppliers in replacing polybags that protect our garments during transportation with a certified recycled
plastic option as part of our policy for plastic packaging.
as a part of fashion fwd, we have set two goals to reduce our plastic use: 

by 2025, we will phase out single-use virgin plastic wherever possible.

by 2025, all consumer-facing packaging will be 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable.
these goals will also contribute to our commitment to protect the ocean environment as signatory of the g7
fashion pact.
looking ahead, we are committed to finding renewable bio-based alternatives to conventional plastic
through bestseller’s investment platform invest fwd, while we are also collaborating with external
stakeholders to support high-quality recycling of plastic in our distribution, e-commerce and retail
operations.
advancing digital solutions
we want to change the way we work and think, embedding digital solutions throughout our value chain –
from our product development processes and all the way through to customer sales solutions to make us
more efficient. 
in november 2019, we launched our first digital showroom in hamburg, germany. by digitalising the
buying journey for wholesale customers, we can present a collection with just 65 percent of the physical
samples we would normally use. in 2020, we plan to roll out improved software and embed remote selling
into the digital journey.
our people
our colleagues are the bestseller family. the expertise, knowledge and creativity our colleagues provide
is paramount to our success as a company. we empower our colleagues through active dialogue and by
providing a safe, diverse and inclusive workplace for them. because as they thrive, we also thrive as a
business. 
fostering diversity and inclusiveness
fairness, opportunities and a sense of responsibility is part of our vision at bestseller. we treat each
other as family, which means that we take each other’s differences into account, while creating an
empowering environment where people can thrive and develop.
bestseller a/s

management's review
our diversity & inclusiveness policy is the blueprint we use as we aim to assemble a workforce that is truly
representative of all sections of society. we recruit talents based on their personality, skills and experience
and irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or religious
background. an inclusive workplace and a diverse workforce is vital for our global competitiveness and
sustainable transition.
engaging employees
employee engagement continues to be a key focus for bestseller. we have been measuring engagement
in many parts of our company. in march 2020, we were planning to launch a global framework for our
engagement surveys. due to covid-19, this had to be postponed, but we will continue the work in 2020/21,
where we will launch our first engagement pulse in september 2020. despite the small setback, we remain on
track to reach our fashion fwd goal.
the surveys will gather feedback from up to 6000 of our colleagues based in locations such as denmark,
canada, uk, france, the netherlands, belgium, austria, turkey and greece to start with. based on periodic
surveys, the new system will capture feedback on what is most important to our colleagues regarding
workplace satisfaction, growth opportunities, inclusion, leadership and job content. with plans to roll out to
all global offices at bestseller, this centralised feedback gathering system will serve to inform strategic
actions that will help improve bestseller’s employee engagement and consequently our colleagues’
productivity and performance.
diversifying leadership training
continuously developing our leaders is important to us because it motivates our colleagues, while also
building business resilience. in 2019, bestseller introduced a new initiative to strengthen our succession
planning to ensure all managers work according to their specific leadership role and easily transition from
one role to another. our leadership approach is being embedded in the way we attract, recruit, develop and
assess leadership in bestseller. during the past year, our hr department – bestseller people – has
trained 124 managers in denmark. in 2020, this leadership training programme is being expanded
throughout our company to cover more markets and significantly more colleagues.
protecting employees’ health and wellbeing
we provide physical surroundings that make our colleagues feel safe and secure. during covid-19, we have
naturally adapted our policies and behaviour to ensure our colleagues remain comfortable about coming to
work. bestseller has closely followed the authorities’ covid-19 guidelines in all our locations around the
world, respecting the importance of doing our part to limit the spread of the virus. we are learning each day
and adapting to the new reality we face, so we can continue to support our colleagues in realising their full
potential. 
preventing corruption and bribery
due to the global nature of our business, including our supply chain, we are aware that there is a high risk in
certain countries where we operate. this risk is more likely in regions where political and social structures
are weakened, which reduces transparency.

management's review
to ensure we conduct business with ethics and integrity, and to protect our company from corrupt practices
that we may meet, bestseller has developed a code of ethics, which is updated biannually. our code of
ethics is a wide-ranging policy, which sets out the proper way to do business in bestseller, including anti-
bribery and corruption. all colleagues are to complete our e-learning course on the code of ethics to equip
them with the knowledge of bestseller’s guiding principles on conducting business in an honest manner. 
additionally, we have developed a code of ethics for business partners, which is also supported by
bestseller’s code of conduct for suppliers. anti-corruption clauses are included in our contracts with
suppliers and business partners, which state that we would stop working with them if an instance of bribery
or corruption should occur.
in october 2019, bestseller implemented a whistleblower system that helps to protect our company from
unethical and unlawful conduct. at bestseller, we base all relations on trust, respect and honesty.
colleagues are encouraged to speak up if there is anything they are concerned about. the whistleblower
system provides colleagues with a channel to report suspicions or knowledge of serious breaches of
bestseller’s code of ethics or violations of laws within certain areas, such as fraud, competition law,
human rights and child labour. reports can be submitted in both danish and english and can be submitted
anonymously.
looking ahead
the financial year of 2019/20 was an activity-filled period for bestseller, and not least in terms of our
sustainability work. accelerating the fashion industry’s transformation to a sustainable reality remains a big
challenge, however, we remain fully committed. we need to adapt to the reality we act in – and act to achieve
the reality we wish to be a part of.

accounting policies
the annual report of bestseller a/s for 2019/20 has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the
danish financial statements act applying to large enterprises of reporting class c.
the accounting policies applied are consistent with those of last year.
the annual report for 2019/20 is presented in tdkk
basis of recognition and measurement
income is recognised in the income statement as earned, including value adjustments of financial assets and
liabilities. all costs, including amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses, are also recognised in the
income statement.
assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
group's and the parent company's and the value of the asset can be measured reliably.
liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow from
the groups and the parent company's and the value of the liability can be measured reliably.
on initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. on subsequent recognition, assets and
liabilities are measured as described below for each individual accounting item.
certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
amortised cost is calculated as the historic cost less any installments and plus/less the accumulated
amortisation of the difference between the cost and the nominal amount.
on recognition and measurement, allowance is made for predictable losses and risks which occur before the
annual report is presented and which confirm or invalidate matters existing at the balance sheet date.
foreign currency translation
on initial recognition, foreign currency transactions are translated applying the exchange rate at the
transaction date. foreign exchange differences arising between the exchange rates at the transaction date and
at the date of payment are recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial costs. if foreign
currency transactions are considered cash flow hedges, the value adjustments are taken directly to equity.
receivables and payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. the difference between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date
and the date at which the receivable or payable arose or was recognised in the latest financial statements is
recognised in the income statement as financial income or financial costs.
fixed assets acquired in foreign currencies are measured at the exchange rate at the transaction date.
bestseller a/s
page 22
accounting policies
foreign subsidiaries and associates are considered separate entities. the income statements are translated at
the average exchange rates for the individual month, and the balance sheet items are translated at the
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. foreign exchange differences arising on translation of such entities
opening equity at closing rate and on translation of the income statements from the exchange rates at the
transaction date to closing rate are taken directly to equity.
foreign exchange adjustments of balances with separate entities which are considered part of the investment
in the subsidiary are taken directly to equity. correspondingly, foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and
derivative financial instruments entered into to hedge net investments in such entities is taken directly to
equity.
recognition and measurement of business combinations
newly acquired or newly established subsidiaries are recognised in the consolidated financial statement from
the date of acquisition or the date of establishment respectively. when subsidiaries are sold or liquidated, they
cease to be recognised in the consolidated financial statement at the time of transfer or time of liquidation and
earnings or losses at the time of sale or liquidation are recognised in the profit and loss account. the
comparative figures are not adjusted for acquisitions or disposals.
gains and losses on the disposal of subsidiaries and associates are calculated as the difference between the
sales amount and the carrying amount of net assets at the date of disposal including any non-amortised
goodwill and anticipated disposal costs.
acquisitions of enterprises are accounted for using the purchase method, according to which the identifiable
assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. costs for restructuring
recognised in the acquired entity before the date of acquisition and not an agreed part of the acquisition is part
of the acquisition balance sheet and hence the calculation of goodwill. costs relating to restructuring decided
by the acquiring entity must be recognised in the income statement. the tax effect of the restatement of assets
and liabilities is considered.
any excess of the cost over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired (goodwill) is
recognised as intangible assets and amortised on a systematic basis in the income statement based on an
individual assessment of the useful life of the asset. any excess of the fair values of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired over the cost of the acquisition (badwill), representing an anticipated adverse development
in the acquired enterprises is recognised in the income statement at the date of acquisition when the general
revenue recognition criteria are met.
if, at the date of acquisition, the identification or measurement of acquired assets, liabilities and/or contingent
liabilities or the size of the purchase consideration are associated with uncertainty, initial recognition will be
based on preliminary calculated amounts. if it subsequently turns out that the identification or measurement
of the purchase consideration, acquired assets, liabilities and/or contingent liabilities was not correct on initial
recognition, the calculation will be adjusted with retrospective effect, including goodwill, until 12 months after
the acquisition, and comparative figures will be restated. subsequently, any adjustments made will be
recognised as error.
bestseller a/s
page 23
accounting policies
the purchase consideration for an entity consists of the fair value of the agreed consideration in the form of
assets transferred, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued. if part of the purchase consideration is
contingent on future events or compliance with agreed terms, such part of the purchase consideration is
recognised in the income statement.
costs incurred to acquire entities are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
recognition and measurement of intra-group business combinations
the uniting of interests method is applied to business combinations such as acquisition and disposal of
investments, mergers, demergers, additions of assets and share conversions, etc. in which entities controlled by
the parent company are involved, provided the combination is considered final at the time of acquisition with
restatement of comparative figures. differences between the agreed consideration and the carrying amount of
the acquired entity are recognised in the equity.
consolidated financial statements
the consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company bestseller a/s and subsidiaries in
which the parent company, directly or indirectly, holds more than 50% of the voting rights or otherwise has a
controlling interest. entities in which the group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights and over
which it exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, are considered associates, cf. the group
chart.
the consolidated annual accounts are prepared as a consolidation of the accounts of the parent company and
the individual subsidiaries. adjustments are made for intercompany turnover and expenditure, shareholdings,
intra-group balances and dividends, as well as unrealized internal income and loss. the accounts used for the
consolidation are prepared in accordance with the group's accounting policies.
investments in subsidiaries are set off against the proportionate share of the subsidiaries' fair value of net
assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
entities acquired or formed during the year are recognised in the consolidated financial statements from the
date of acquisition. entities disposed of are recognised in the consolidated income statement until the date of
disposal. comparative figures are not restated for acquisitions or disposals.
non-controlling interests
the annual accounts of the group's subsidiaries are included 100% in the consolidated figures. the non-
controlling interests proportionate share of the profit and loss as well as the equity in subsidiaries not 100%
owned by the group are included as a part of the group's profit and loss but are disclosed separately.
on initial recognition, non-controlling interest are measured at the fair value of the non-controlling interests'
proportionate share of the fair value of the acquired entity's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities. goodwill relating to the non-controlling interests' share of the acquire is thus recognised.

securities, payables and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, dividends received on other
investments, amortisation of financial assets and liabilities as well as surcharges and refunds under the on-

subsidiaries participate in the joint taxation arrangement from the time when they are included in the
consolidated financial statements and until the time when they withdraw from the consolidation.
on payment of joint taxation contributions, the current danish income tax is allocated between the jointly
taxed entities in proportion to their taxable income. entities with tax losses receive joint taxation contributions
from entities that have been able to use tax losses to reduce their own taxable profits.
tax for the year, which comprises the current tax charge for the year and changes in the deferred tax charge, is
recognised in the income statement as regards the portion that relates to the profit for the year and directly in
equity as regards the portion that relates to entries directly in equity.
balance sheet
intangible assets
intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. cost comprises
the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is
available for use. interests are not included in the cost. where individual components of an item of intangible
assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.
non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on cost and on the following continually
estimated useful lives:
software is amortized according to the straight-line method over the expected useful life of 3 years.
leasehold rights/key money is amortized according to the straight-line method of the non-terminable lease
term. in case such term does not exist, the leasehold right/key money is amortized over 5 to 7 years.
goodwill is amortised over the estimated useful life between 5-20 years. the estimated useful life is determined
by management based on their experience within each area of business. the amortisation period is determined
based on to what extent the purchase concerns a strategically acquired company with a strong market position
and a long-term profitability and to what extent the goodwill includes temporary intangible resources which
has not been able to spin off and recognise as individual assets.
gains and losses on the disposal of intangible assets are determined as the difference between the selling price
less selling costs and the carrying amount at the date of disposal. gains or losses are recognised in the income
statement as other operating income or other operating costs.
bestseller a/s
page 26
accounting policies
property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. cost
comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the
asset is available for use. interests are not included in the cost.
where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items, which are depreciated separately.
non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on cost and on the following continually
estimated useful lives:
useful life
buildings
10-50
years
other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment
3-5
years
leasehold improvements
5-10
years
the basis of depreciation is based on the residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life. the depreciation
period and the residual value are determined at the time of acquisition and are reassessed every year. where
the residual value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, no further depreciation charges are recognised.
in case of changes in the depreciation period or the residual value, the effect on the depreciation charges is
recognised prospectively as a change in accounting estimates.
property, plant and equipment are written down to its recoverable amount if this is lower than the carrying
amount.
gains or losses from the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as
other operating income or other operating costs, respectively.
non-current investments
investments in subsidiaries and associates
investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured at the proportionate share of the net asset value of
the entities, calculated on the basis of the group's accounting policies, plus or less unrealised intra-group gains
or losses and plus or less any remaining value of positive or negative goodwill stated according to the purchase
method.
investments in subsidiaries and associates with a negative net asset value are measured at dkk 0, and the
carrying amount of any receivables from these entities is reduced to the extent that they are considered
irrecoverable. if the parent company has a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit that exceeds the
receivable, the balance is recognised under provisions.
net revaluations of investments in subsidiaries and associates are taken to the net revaluation reserve
according to the equity method in so far as that the carrying amount exceeds the cost.
bestseller a/s
page 27
accounting policies
other non-current investments
other non-current assets consist of deposits in leaseholds and securities, measured at cost, which the entity
plans on holding until expiry.
impairment of fixed assets
the carrying amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment is reviewed in general to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment in addition to that expressed by amortisation or
depreciation. the impairment test is performed for each individual asset or group of assets. the recoverable
amount of the asset is calculated as the value in use or the fair value less disposal costs, whichever is higher.
where there is indications of impairment, an impairment test is performed for each individual asset or group of
assets, respectively. if it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for individual assets, the assets
are reviewed jointly in the smallest identifiable group of assets to determine a reliable recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and the value in use. the value in use is
determined as the present value of the anticipated net cash flows from the use of the asset or group of assets
and the anticipated net cash flows from the disposal of the asset or group of assets after the end of their useful
life.
domicile properties and other assets, for which it is not possible to calculate an individual capital value as the
asset, in itself, does not generate future cash flows, are subject to a test for indication of impairment together
with the group of assets, to which they may be attributed.
previously recognised impairment losses are reversed when the reason for recognition no longer exist.
impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
inventories
inventories are measured at cost using the fifo method. where the net realisable value is lower than the cost,
inventories are recognised at this lower value.
the cost of inventories comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs.
the net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the selling price less costs of completion and costs
incurred to effect the sale. the net realisable value is determined taking into account marketability,
obsolescence and expected selling price movements.
receivables
receivables are measured at amortised cost.
an impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence that a receivable or a group of receivables is
impaired. if there is objective evidence that an individual receivable is impaired, an impairment loss for that
individual asset is recognised.

prepayments
prepayments recognised under 'current assets' comprises costs incurred concerning subsequent financial
years.
cash at hand and in bank
cash at hand and in bank comprise cash at hand and in bank.
equity
reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method
the reserve for net revaluation according to the equity method in the company's financial statements
comprises net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associates relative to the cost.
dividends
proposed dividends are disclosed as a separate item under equity. dividends are recognised as a liability when
declared by the annual general meeting of shareholders.
provisions
provisions are measured at net realizable value or fair value. if the obligation is expected to be settled far into
the future the obligation is measured at fair value. provisions comprise anticipated costs for losses on returned
goods, obligations concerning leases and other contractual liabilities. provisions are recognised when the group
has a legal or constructive obligation at the balance sheet date and there is a probability of an outflow of
resources required to settle the obligation.
current tax and deferred tax
current tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as the estimated tax on
the taxable income for the year, adjusted for tax on the taxable income for previous years and tax paid on
account.
deferred tax is measured according to the liability method in respect of temporary differences between the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base, calculated on the basis of the planned use of the
asset and settlement of the liability, respectively.
adjustment is made to deferred tax resulting from elimination of unrealised intra-group profits and losses.
deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax losses allowed for carry forward, are measured at the value to
which the asset is expected to be realised, either as a set-off against tax on future income or as a set-off against
deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity. any deferred net tax assets are measured at net
realisable value.
deferred tax is measured according to the tax rules and at the tax rates applicable in the respective countries at
the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. deferred tax adjustments
resulting from changes in tax rates are recognised in the income statement, with the exception of items taken
directly to equity.

liabilities other than provisions
financial liabilities are recognised on the raising of the loan at the proceeds received net of transaction costs
incurred. on subsequent recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to
the capitalised value, using the effective interest method. accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and
the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan.
other liabilities, which include trade payables, payables to group entities and other payables, are measured at
amortised cost, which is usually equivalent to nominal value.
deferred income
deferred income recognised under 'current liabilities' comprises payments received concerning income in
subsequent financial years.
derivative financial instruments
on initial recognition in the balance sheet, derivative financial instruments are measured at cost and
subsequently at fair value. positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are included in
'other receivables' or 'other payables', respectively.
fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for recognition as a fair
value hedge of recognised assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement together with fair value
adjustments of the hedged asset or liability.
fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments designated as and qualifying for hedging of future
cash flows are recognised in other receivables or other payables and in equity. if the future transaction results
in recognition of assets or liabilities, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the cost of the
asset or the liability, respectively. if the future transaction results in income or costs, amounts previously
recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects the
income statement.
as for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, fair value adjustments are
recognised in the income statement on a current basis.
cash flow statement
the cash flow statement shows the group's and the parent company's cash flows for the year, broken down
under cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, the year's changes in cash and cash
equivalents and the group's and the parent company's cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and at the
end of the year.
the cash flow effect of additions and disposals of entities is shown separately under cash flows from investing
activities. the cash flow statement includes cash flows from acquired entities from the time of acquisition, and
cash flows from sold entities are included until the date of sale.

accounting policies
cash flows from operating activities
cash flows from operating activities comprise cash flows presented according to the indirect method and are
calculated as the groups share of the profit/loss for the year adjusted for changes in the working capital, paid
corporate taxes and non-cash income statement items such as depreciation, amortisation and impairment
losses and provisions made. the working capital comprises current assets less current liabilities – exclusive of
the financial statement items included in cash and cash equivalents.
cash flows from investing activities
cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows from payments associated with the purchase of sale
of companies, activities and financial non-current assets as well as purchase, development, improvement and
sale etc. of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment including the acquisition of financially leased
assets.
cash flows from financing activities
cash flows from financing activities comprise changes in the size or composition of the group's and the parent
company's share capital and related costs, as well as the raising of loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt
and payment of dividends to shareholders.
