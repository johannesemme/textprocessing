our newly-built operations hub in 
vlissingen in the dutch province 
of zeeland is the base for our first 
offshore wind farm in the netherlands, 
borssele 1 & 2. as well as hiring staff 
locally where possible, we work  
closely with nearby schools, libraries, 
and museums to inspire the next  
generation of wind turbine technicians.

enabling the world’s green  
transformation
the decisions our global society takes today, 
and in the next few years, determine whether 
we pass a habitable planet on to future gen-
erations. science recommends that we halve 
global carbon emissions by 2030 to have a  
chance of limiting the temperature rise to  
1.5˚ c and mitigating the risk of irreversible 
tipping points in our global ecosystems. 
in 2020, we saw progress. many governments 
raised their carbon emission reduction targets 
and further reinforced their build-out plans 
for renewable energy production capacity. 
several large companies also set targets for 
their decarbonisation and acted firmly to 
make their business models more sustainable. 
targets and actions by both governments and 
corporations bode well for our planet, but 
to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5 ˚ c, 
even more decisive action is needed.  
our target is to become a fully carbon-neutral 
company by 2025. in 2020, we continued 
the build-out of our green power generation 
capacity both onshore and offshore. we also 
initiated a range of renewable hydrogen  
projects. renewable hydrogen will enable  
sectors like cement, ammonia, heavy road 
transport, aviation, and shipping to transition 
to fossil-free energy. like it was for offshore 
wind, innovation and industrialisation in 
renewable hydrogen are required to bring 
down costs, making the new green fuels 
competitive.
this year, we divested our downstream retail 
customer and power distribution businesses, 
which marks another big step in the renew-
able energy transformation. our vision is a 
world that runs entirely on green energy. 
Ørsted wants to partner with countries and 
companies, helping them to leave fossil fuels 
behind, and in 2020, we saw a breakthrough 
for comprehensive long-term green power 
purchase agreements.
the covid-19 pandemic affected everybody 
in 2020. we are a safety-first company, and 
during the pandemic, our priority has been the 
health and well-being of our employees, their 
families, and the communities which we are 
a part of. thanks to our careful and talented 
staff, Ørsted’s operations have remained 
stable, and our development and construction 
projects have moved forward according to 
plan during the pandemic. all employees have 
adapted impressively to new routines and 
pushed through with projects, despite sudden 
and unforeseen obstacles. we will continue 
to closely follow the situation in the markets 
where we operate and will continue adhering 
chairman’s statement
to national guidelines and regulations to help 
minimise the spread of the pandemic and 
keep our employees and partners safe. 
even in this time of significantly increased 
global uncertainty, Ørsted’s business model 
has demonstrated its resilience. we were able 
to raise our financial guidance in march and 
maintained it throughout the year. ebitda for 
the year amounted to dkk 18.1 billion, thereby 
exceeding our expectations and resulting in 
a roce of 10 %. profit for the year amounted 
to dkk 16.7 billion, significantly impacted 
by the gain from divestment of our power 
distribution activities. the board of directors 
recommends paying a dividend of dkk 11.5 
per share, corresponding to dkk 4.8 billion.
on behalf of the board of directors, i would 
like to thank the employees and management 
of Ørsted for an outstanding effort during a 
period of global uncertainty and for keeping 
us on track towards creating a world that runs 
entirely on green energy. 
i would also like to express special thanks to 
former ceo henrik poulsen for his exemplary 
leadership in the past eight years during  
which Ørsted was transformed completely 
from a financially challenged, regional, 
fossil-based energy company to a highly 
profitable global leader in renewable energy. 
our company is stronger than ever and – even 
more important – has developed a promising 
platform for continued growth. 
with mads nipper on board as our new ceo 
from this january, we remain as committed as 
ever to staying at the forefront of the global 
energy transformation and to offering cost- 
effective green energy solutions and enabling 
governments and companies to power the 
world with green energy.

business development
signed agreements to farm-down 50 % 
of the offshore wind farms greater 
changhua 1 and 25 % of ocean wind 1. 
signed corporate power purchase  
agreements (cppas) with tsmc for  
our offshore wind project greater  
changhua 2b & 4 in taiwan and with  
amazon for borkum riffgrund 3 in  
germany. the first being the largest- 
ever renewable energy cppa.
we took fid on the onshore wind farm 
western trail and the old 300 solar 
center in texas.
we acquired and took fid on the solar 
project muscle shoals in alabama and 
the onshore wind project haystack in 
nebraska. 
we secured funding for three renewable 
hydrogen projects, one in the uk, one in 
germany, and a joint project consortium 
in the eu. we also entered into three 
additional renewable hydrogen partner-
ships in the netherlands, denmark, and 
germany, respectively.
we divested the danish power distribu-
tion, residential customer, and city light 
businesses which resulted in a gain of 
dkk 10.9 billion.
the divestment of our lng business was 
completed, and an agreement to divest 
our b2b business in the uk was signed. 
2020 showed very strong results, both operationally and  
financially. although the world is in the midst of a global 
pandemic crisis, our business model has proved resilient. 
2020 also showed great strategic progress. 
financial results
in 2020, our operating profit (ebitda)  
amounted to dkk 18.1 billion, a 4 % increase 
compared to last year. 
earnings from our offshore and onshore wind 
farms in operation increased by 14 %. this was 
driven by ramp-up of green power generation 
from hornsea 1, borssele 1 & 2, lockett, sage 
draw, plum creek, and willow creek and 
receipt of cfds of another 400 mw of  
hornsea 1 from april. futhermore, we had  
higher wind speeds in 2020. 
these positive effects were partly offset 
by lower earnings from trading related to 
hedging of our power exposures, which gener-
ated very high earnings in 2019, and adverse 
covid-19 related impacts. the latter mainly 
manifested itself in the uk power prices due 
to a lower demand for electricity. this led to 
higher balancing tariffs (bsuos) from national 
grid and lower roc recycle prices. further-
more, we saw hours with negative prices in  
the uk from april to july.
we are on track to meet our target of an  
average yearly increase in ebitda from 
offshore and onshore wind farms and solar 
farms in operation of 20 % from 2017 to 2023.
the divestment of our danish power distribution, 
residential customer, and city light businesses 
resulted in proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion with a 
gain of dkk 10.9 billion which will be deployed 
into our global renewable energy build-out plan.
our green share of heat and power generation 
continued to increase and reached a new high 
of 90 %. 
return on capital employed (roce) was 10 % 
for 2020, in line with our target. 
covid-19
since the outbreak of covid-19, our corporate 
crisis management organisation (ccmo) has 
met regularly, focusing on the health and  
safety of our employees and on ensuring 
business continuity. during 2020, we had 146 
confirmed infected colleagues and fortunately 
no casualties from covid-19. we continue to 
do our utmost to keep our colleagues safe 
across our locations. our asset base has been 
fully operational, and we maintained normal 
availability rates at our offshore and onshore

construction of our projects largely pro-
gressed according to plan, both in europe,  
asia pacific, and the us. the construction 
project most affected by covid-19 was the 
offshore wind farm hornsea 2, due to delays 
in the offshore topside construction at a 
shipyard in singapore which was temporarily 
closed. however, we do not expect the delay 
to affect the commissioning date.
offshore
2020 was a good year for our offshore 
business with many significant milestones 
and achievements, although with some 
headwind in the us.
in december, we commissioned the 752 mw 
dutch wind farm borssele 1 & 2 on schedule 
and within budget. the wind farm deploys 94 
siemens gamesa 8 mw wind turbines, making 
it the largest-ever built in the netherlands, and 
will supply renewable energy to 1 million house-
holds. during the construction of borssele 1 & 2, 
we passed a significant milestone by installing 
Ørsted’s offshore wind turbine number 1,500.
in north america, the 12 mw coastal virginia  
demonstration project, which we have 
constructed for dominion energy as an epc 
contractor, was commissioned. the offshore  
wind farm is the first-ever to receive federal 
permits and be installed in us federal waters.

in december, we signed an agreement to  
farm down 50 % of the 605 mw offshore wind 
farm greater changhua 1 to cdpq, a canadian  
pension fund, and cathay pe, a taiwanese 
private equity fund. the farm-down is the  
largest-ever renewable energy m&a

attractiveness of our offshore wind assets  
in asia pacific.
we selected siemens gamesa as preferred 
wind turbine supplier for our 900 mw borkum 
riffgrund 3 and 242 mw gode wind 3 projects. 
subject to final investment decision, both 
projects will deploy 11 mw wind turbines with 
200-metre rotors. in addition, we signed a 
10-year corporate power purchase agreement 
(cppa) with amazon to buy 250 mw of the 
output from borkum riffgrund 3. this is our 
first offshore wind ppa with a global tech 
company and the largest offshore wind  
cppa in europe.

in july, we signed a cppa with taiwan-based 
tsmc, the world’s largest semiconductor 
foundry. tsmc will offtake the full generation 
from our 920 mw offshore wind farm greater 
changhua 2b & 4, making it the largest-ever 
renewable energy cppa. the 20-year fixed-
price contract period will start once the wind 
farm reaches commercial operation, expect-
edly in 2025 or 2026, subject to grid availabili-
ty and Ørsted’s final investment decision.
in december, we entered into an agreement 
with new jersey’s public service enterprise 
group (pseg) to sell a 25 % ownership interest 
in our 1.1 gw offshore wind development 
project ocean wind 1. the project is the first 
large-scale offshore wind farm in new jersey.
 
in march, we entered into an agreement with 
tepco to establish a joint venture company 
for offshore wind in japan, with the intention 
of working towards a joint bid in the first  
japanese auction, now expectedly this year.
in december, we were granted consent to 
move into the final development phase of 
the offshore wind farm hornsea 3 by the uk 
secretary of state for the department for 
business, energy & industrial strategy. the 
offshore wind farm has a potential capacity 
of more than 2.4 gw and is adjacent to our 
offshore wind farms hornsea 1 and hornsea 2, 
off the east coast of the uk. with the consent 
granted, the wind farm will be able to enter 
the next uk auction round for a contract for 
difference (cfd), expectedly in 2021. 
our pipeline of us offshore development 
projects is moving forward, but we are still 
waiting for the us bureau of ocean energy  
management (boem) to decide on the  
preferred wind farm layout for the build- 
out of offshore wind for our north-eastern 
projects in our new england lease areas.  
 
furthermore, while we are still waiting for  
clarity concerning the federal permitting 
process for our projects, there are positive 
signs that the bottleneck will be resolved 
imminently. we had expected to receive 
the ‘notices of intent’ (nois) from boem for 
our advanced-stage development projects 
following the release and public comment 
process regarding the vineyard wind supple-
mental environmental impact study in 2020. 
while that did not happen, we are starting  
to see some promising signs of movement. 
the timely issuance of the draft ‘environmental 
impact statement’ (eis) on 4 january 2021 for 
our south fork project bodes well. so does 
the announcement of the ‘initiation of action 
notice’ (ian) (a prelude to nois issuance) for 
the ocean wind 1 project. all signs from the 
incoming joe biden administration indicate 
they will support a timely, predictable permit-
ting regime.
 
revolution wind, ocean wind 1, skipjack 
wind, and sunrise wind will likely be delayed 
beyond the previously expected 2023 and 
2024 construction years. we have flexibility in 
the timeline for all four projects, and we have 
been able to make good progress on other 
project milestones in the meantime. however, 
until there is a clear timeline from boem, we 
cannot solidify our construction schedules.
 
with regards to south fork wind, we remain 
comfortable with our previously communicated 
timeline with cod in late 2023. 
 
despite the permitting delays, we remain 
confident that we can deliver our us project 
portfolio with satisfactory value creation, 
which is supported by the commitment to 
rapid clean energy deployment from the joe 
biden administration, the us treasury’s recent 
announcement of a 10-year continuity safe 
harbour for offshore wind in addition to a new 
30 % itc level for projects starting construc-
tion in 2017-2025, which will help expand tax 
credit eligibility. we continue to see solid long- 
term growth and value creation potential  
in us offshore wind. 
in 2020, we made progress towards a greener 
future based on renewable hydrogen. we  
continuously pursue opportunities within 
industrial-scale production of renewable 
hydrogen, and during 2020 and early 2021, 
we have secured funding for three projects, 
one in the uk, one in germany, and a joint 
consortium in the eu. we also entered into an 
additional three partnerships, one in germany, 
one in the netherlands, and one in denmark. 
our most recent hydrogen partnership was 
agreed with british energy company bp 
in november and will comprise a 50 mw 
electrolyser plant at bp’s lingen refinery in 
germany. the plant is expected to be opera-
tional in 2024 and will replace approx. 20 % of 
the fuel-based hydrogen from the refinery. the 
project is the first stage towards a long-term 
ambition to build a capacity of more than 
500 mw of renewable hydrogen at lingen. 
this would replace the entire production of 
fuel-based hydrogen at the refinery. 
furthermore, we joined forces with yara,  
the world’s leading fertiliser company, to  
develop a pioneering project aiming at  
replacing fossil hydrogen with renewable  
hydrogen in the production of ammonia  
with the potential to abate more than 
100,000 tonnes of co2 per year.

in 2020, we saw strong traction in our onshore 
business, underpinned by the commissioning 
of three new wind farms, the acquisitions of 
two late-stage projects, and the decision to

construct another onshore wind farm and a 
solar farm. 
during the year, we successfully commissioned 
the three us onshore wind farms sage draw, 
plum creek, and willow creek, located in texas,  
nebraska, and south dakota, respectively.  
in july, we acquired the 227 mwac solar project 
muscle shoals in alabama, us. the project is 
expected to be commissioned in q3 this year 
and will become the largest solar energy 
asset in the south-eastern us. the project is 
eligible for 30 % itc and has a fully contracted 
20-year utility ppa. the project further diver-
sifies the geographic footprint of our asset 
base by establishing a foothold in the rapidly 
growing south-eastern solar market.
in september, we took final investment deci-
sion on constructing the onshore wind farm 
western trail in texas. this greenfield project 
has a capacity of 367 mw and is eligible for 
100 % ptc when commissioned, expectedly 
during q3 this year. 
in october, we acquired the late-stage 298 mw  
onshore development project haystack. 
the wind project is located very close to our 
onshore wind farm plum creek in nebraska,  
also residing in the south-west power pool 
(spp) area. with the acquisition, we further 
expanded our footprint into this market which 
will play an important part in our growth in 
north america and diversify our portfolio. 
in november, we also took final investment 
decision on constructing the old 300 solar 
center which is a 430 mwac solar project also 
located in texas with 30 % itc eligibility. we 
expect old 300 to be commissioned during 
q2 2022. 
in addition, we are currently constructing 
the combined solar (420 mwac) and storage 
(40 mwac) project permian energy center in 
texas, us. the project is progressing according 
to plan, and we expect permian to be commis-
sioned by mid-2021 with 30 % itc eligibility. 
with the completion of sage draw, plum 
creek, and willow creek and the addition of 
muscle shoals, western trail, haystack, and 
old 300 solar center, we now have 3.4 gw  
of combined onshore wind and solar pv in  
operation or under construction, and we 
remain very satisfied with the expansion of  
our onshore business.
markets & bioenergy
during 2020, we continued streamlining our 
markets & bioenergy business. 
in august, we completed the divestment  
of our danish power distribution, residential 
customer, and city light businesses to seas-
nve (now andel). the divestment marks an 
important strategic milestone for Ørsted,  
and the proceeds will be deployed into our 
global renewable energy build-out plan.
in december, we completed the divestment 
of our lng activities to glencore, and in 
september, we signed an agreement to divest 
the vast majority of our uk b2b customer 
portfolio to total gas & power. we will keep 
borssele 1 & 2, near vlissingen,  
the netherlands.
some of our strategic long-term partners and 
customers to whom we deliver risk manage-
ment products. we expect the transaction to 
close in q1 2021.
in november, we signed a 15-year route-to-
market agreement with sse renewables and 
equinor to balance power generation from their 
offshore wind farm dogger bank in the uk. 
the contract is the largest balancing agreement 
won in a competitive tender process in the uk 
market. under the agreement, Ørsted will be 
 responsible for trading and balancing 40 % of 
the 960 mw generated from the first two phases 
of the wind farm, when completed in 2026. 
the agreement will add further scale to our 
portfolio and underlines our position as a leading 
green energy trading company in the uk.
in mid-october, the renescience waste- 
recycling plant in northwich, the uk, was 
successfully commissioned after passing  
the final performance test. with the commis-
sioning of renescience northwich, we reached 
another important milestone. we will continue 
to monitor the plant’s performance, while 
exploring the broader commercial potential  
of this recycling technology.
in march, the copenhagen maritime & com-
mercial court decided to close the action for 
damages, ruling in Ørsted’s favour. the action 
related to a claimed abuse of a dominant po-
sition on the market for wholesale of physical 
electricity in western denmark from 2003 to 
2006. however, the action will continue in 
2021 as the claimants have decided to appeal 
the case to the danish western high court.

name. in may 2019, the copenhagen maritime 
& commercial court ruled in favour of Ørsted. 
following the ruling, the plaintiffs decided 
to appeal the case. in november 2020, the 
danish supreme court also ruled in favour of 
Ørsted, and the case is now closed. 
we are very pleased that the ruling of the 
supreme court upholds our right to use 
the Ørsted name. it was chosen as a tribute 
to hans christian Ørsted, one of the greatest 
danish scientists of all time. he discovered 
electromagnetism 200 years ago and thus 
laid the foundation for how we produce 
electricity.
in december, we received an administrative 
decision from the danish tax agency requiring 
danish taxation of our british offshore wind 
farms walney extension and hornsea 1. the 
claim amounted to dkk 5.1 billion, plus inter-
est, in addition to the taxes we have already 
paid in denmark. according to the decision, 
Ørsted is to be taxed in denmark on the full 
future value of the two offshore wind farms, 
despite the fact that they are developed, 
owned, and operated by british subsidiaries 
of the Ørsted group and are taxed in the uk. 
we disagree with the decision which in our 
view is based on a misconception of the risks 
and value creation in our business model 
for developing, constructing, and operating 
offshore wind farms and have appealed it to 
the danish tax appeals agency. furthermore, 
we have taken steps to ensure that the danish 
and uk tax authorities initiate negotiations 
to avoid Ørsted being subjected to double 
taxation, if necessary, by referring the case to 
an independent arbitration panel.
employees
our talented people remain the most impor-
tant assets in Ørsted, and on behalf of the 
executive committee, i would like to take this 
opportunity to acknowledge and thank all our 
employees for the great job they have been 
doing throughout the year, including how they 
have all adapted to the new challenges in the 
wake of the covid-19 pandemic.
 
it is very important for us to attract, develop, 
and retain the best talent, and we strongly 
believe in the value of a diverse workforce.  
we aspire to create an environment where 
everyone, whatever their personal back-
ground, can thrive, perform, and grow. 
therefore, we were also pleased to see that 
the 2020 employee satisfaction survey, 
people matter, showed a record-high satis-
faction and motivation score of 78 out of 100, 
placing Ørsted in the top 10 % of our external 
benchmark.
new corporate structure
on 28 january, we announced a change to our 
organisational structure which will take effect 
from 4 february.
the change entails moving from a business 
unit structure to a more functional structure 
where the commercially focused functions 
from the current business units offshore and 
markets & bioenergy will be brought together 
under the leadership of martin neubert who 
will become cco, deputy ceo, and member 
of the executive board.
the operationally focused functions will 
be brought together under a new coo as 
anders lindberg has decided to take on a new 
position outside Ørsted. the coo will report 
to mads nipper.
as a consequence of the new corporate struc-
ture, morten h. buchgreitz has decided to leave 
the company. both anders and morten have 
done a tremendous job during their tenure in 
Ørsted, and we owe them great gratitude. 
onshore will remain a separate business unit. 
the onshore business differs from the rest 
of Ørsted when it comes to technological 
maturity and business model, and we believe 
that onshore will be best positioned to realise 
its full potential as a separate business unit.
we are making these changes in our  
organisation to establish an even stronger  
customer and market focus, to further 
strengthen the focus on epc and operations, 
and to support the scaling of our organisation 
as we continue our strong growth trajectory  
in the years to come. 
externally, we will continue to report offshore 
and onshore financials as we do today.  
this means that offshore will continue to 
include our hydrogen activities. bioenergy, 
our legacy gas activities, and renescience 
will be reported in a separate segment called 
bioenergy & other.
concluding remarks from the new ceo
we are very satisfied with our strategic pro-
gress and results in 2020, and i am grateful for 
the support and professionalism of our custom-
ers and partners. i am keenly aware that only 
together, we can do great things and live up 
to our high ambitions. we maintain a leading 
position in a global high-growth market and 
have built a strong and financially sustainable 
pipeline, laying the path for future growth. 
i am proud of and humbled by the board of  
directors’ trust in me to succeed henrik  
poulsen as ceo of Ørsted. creating a world 
that runs entirely on green energy is a vision 
close to my heart. i also want to thank the 
executive committee and all Ørsted  
employees for a warm welcome. 
i am deeply impressed and inspired by the 
passion and motivation i have encountered 
throughout the entire company, and it makes 
me excited for what we can achieve. i am con-
fident that Ørsted can stay a globally leading 
renewable energy producer, both offshore and 
onshore. i am convinced that Ørsted, as the 
world’s most sustainable energy company, has 
the potential to be a global catalyst for sys-
temic change, accelerating the green energy 
transition and how companies operate.

cash flow and balance sheet
in 2020, we maintained stable operations despite the 
pandemic and achieved an underlying ebitda exceeding 
our expectations at the beginning of the year. this was 
mainly driven by an increase in generation from our 
offshore and onshore wind farms. 
profit for the year was dkk 16.7 billion. the significant 
increase compared to 2019 was due to the divestment 
of our danish power distribution, residential customer, 
and city light businesses (rbc), resulting in a gain of 
dkk 10.9 billion.
the gross investments reached dkk 27.0 billion, 
a record-high level, driven by an increase in our 
construction activity, both offshore and onshore.
gross investments are slightly below our guidance, 
mainly due to timing across years.
roce was 10 % for the year, which was in line with 
our target of an average roce of approx. 10 % for 
the group in the period 2019-2025. in 2018, roce 
was significantly impacted by the 50 % farm-down 
of hornsea 1. 
the credit metric ‘funds from operations’ (ffo) 
relative to adjusted net debt amounted to 48 %  
in 2020, well above our target of around 30 %.  
in the outlook announced in our annual report  
for 2019, we expected ebitda excluding new  
partnerships of dkk 15-16 billion and gross 
 investments of dkk 30-32 billion for 2020.
with ebitda excluding new partnerships of  
dkk 18.1 billion, we exeeded our expectations. 
gross investments amounted to dkk 27.0 billion. 
our net debt decreased to dkk 12.3 billion, mainly 
due to the divestment of our danish power distribu-
tion, residential customer, and city light businesses, 
resulting in proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion.

the green share of our heat and power generation 
continued to increase to a new high of 90 %, following 
continued ramp-up of our offshore and onshore wind 
capacity and lower heat and power generation based 
on fossil fuels.
installed green capacity increased by 14 % to 11.3 gw 
in 2020 due to the commissioning of the offshore 
wind farm borssele 1 & 2 and the three onshore wind 
farms sage draw, plum creek, and willow creek.
avoided emissions from our green heat and power 
generation relative to fossil-fuelled generation 
increased by 16 %, mainly due to increased wind-
based power generation.
the scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were 
at the same level as in 2019 despite lower fossil- 
fuelled heat and power generation. this was due to 
an increase from ancillary services from our coal-
fuelled units as we are legally obliged to deliver 
these services with the lowest marginal costs.
the 2020 employee satisfaction survey, people 
matter, showed a record-high satisfaction and 
motivation score of 78.
we continue to have a strong focus on the safety 
and well-being of our employees. we are progress-
ing satisfactorily towards our target of 2.9 by 2025.

financial estimates and policies
we made history in north america 
in 2020 when we built the first-ever 
offshore wind farm in us federal  
waters as epc contractor. the two 
wind turbines form the offshore wind 
farm coastal virginia wind, a pilot  
project located 43 miles off the coast 
of virginia beach. the experience 
gained here paves the way for  
an expansion in the offshore wind 
industry in the us.

group ebitda guidance
as in previous years, our ebitda guidance 
does not include earnings from new partner-
ship agreements as it is difficult to predict the 
exact timing of potential farm-downs as well 
as the distribution of income between years 
if the partnership includes a construction 
agreement. 
in terms of new partnerships in 2021, we 
expect to close the 50 % farm-down of 
greater changhua 1 following the agreement 
announced in december 2020. furthermore, 
we plan to farm-down a 50 % share of 
borssele 1 & 2 around summer. finally, we will 
explore the possibility of a farm-down of our 
solar pv portfolio following the commissioning 
of muscle shoals in q3. while we have not 
included any gains from these farm-downs 
in our guidance, we have assumed a derived 
reduction in site earnings. 
we had no earnings from new partner- 
ship agreements in 2020, while ebitda  
from existing partnerships amounted to  
dkk 1.6 billion. in 2021, ebitda from existing 
partnerships is expected to be close to zero.
in 2020, we divested our danish power  
distribution, residential customer, and city 
light businesses. these contributed with 
dkk 0.9 billion to our ebitda in 2020. 
operating profit (ebitda), excluding new 
partnership agreements, is expected to be 
dkk 15-16 billion in 2021. the outlook is based 
on the expected development in the business 
units compared to 2020, as described below.
offshore  (excluding new partnership 
 agreements) – lower
earnings in offshore (excluding new partner-
ship agreements) are expected to be lower 
financial outlook 2021
than in 2020. earnings are also expected to be 
lower than in 2020 adjusted for the net effect 
of the non-repetition of earnings from existing 
partnerships in 2020 (dkk 1.6 billion) and the 
positive effect (dkk 1.1 billion) of ceasing to 
report according to the business performance 
principle in 2021 (see page 16). we do not 
expect any further adverse covid-19-related 
impacts on earnings relative to 2020.
the positive impact on operational earnings  
in 2021 driven by the last 400 mw of hornsea 1 
receiving cfds from april and full-year effects 
from borssele 1 & 2 net of the reduction in site 
earnings from the assumed farm-down will be 
more than offset by a number of adverse effects:

preparing for operations, but we do 
not expect any ramp-up generation.

financial outlook
expensed project development costs amount-
ed to dkk 1.7 billion in 2020. for 2021, we 
expect expensed project development costs 
to be approx. dkk 2.0 billion as a natural 
consequence of our continued expansion of 
our footprint.
onshore – higher
earnings from onshore wind and solar farms 
in operation are expected to increase from 
ramp-up of generation at sage draw, plum 
creek, and willow creek (commissioned 
during 2020) and due to expected commis-
sioning of the new wind farms western trail 
and haystack, and the solar farms permian 
energy center and muscle shoals during 2021. 
the latter being net of the assumed reduction 
in site earnings from the possible farm-down 
of our solar pv portfolio. 
the increased operational earnings will be 
partly offset by higher costs related to the 
strategic expansion of the business and an 
adverse year-on-year impact from recognition 
of derivatives.
markets & bioenergy – lower
 our directional guidance for markets &  
bioenergy for 2021 is based on earnings in 
2020, excluding the divested danish power  
distribution, residential customer, and city 
light businesses. these contributed with  
dkk 0.9 billion to our ebitda in 2020. 
earnings in ‘gas markets & infrastructure’ 
are expected to be lower than 2020, mainly 
because the positive effects from revaluation 
of gas at storage caused by the increasing gas 
prices, especially during q4 2020, is expected 
to partly reverse in 2021.
earnings from our chp plants (including 
ancillary services) are expected to be in line 
with 2020.
 
gross investments
gross investments for 2021 are expected to 
amount to dkk 32-34 billion. the outlook 
reflects a high level of activity in offshore 
(hornsea 2, greater changhua 1 & 2a, and 
our us activities), and onshore (western trail, 
haystack, permian energy center, and old 
300 solar center). 
in addition to gross investments, significant 
funds are temporarily tied up in the construction 
of transmission assets for offshore wind farms in 
the uk and offshore wind farms for our partners. 
these funds are a part of our operating cash 
flow. at the end of 2020, funds tied up in work 
in progress totalled dkk 9.8 billion. during h1 
2021, we expect to divest the hornsea 1 offshore 
transmission asset, but we still expect to see a 
high level of funds tied up in work in progress in 
2021 as a result of the continued construction of 
the transmission assets at hornsea 2. we expect 
to divest the hornsea 2 offshore transmission 
assets in 2023.  
ceasing the use of business  
performance in 2021
with the implementation of ifrs 9 in 2018, it 
has become significantly easier to apply ifrs 
hedge accounting to our commodity hedges. 
we have concluded that ifrs 9 can replace 
our business performance principle, and 
therefore, we will be reporting based on ifrs 
only from 1 january 2021. this will simplify our 
reporting and avoid potential conflicts with 
future reporting requirements for alternative 
performance measures. 
at the end of 2020, the value of our business 
performance hedges deferred to a future 
period amounted to dkk -2.7 billion. this 
net loss has already been recognised in the 
income statement under ifrs, as we have 
not previously applied hedge accounting for 
these. consequently, for the period 2021-2025, 
ebitda (according to ifrs) will be higher with 
a similar amount compared to what the busi-
ness performance ebitda would have been in 
the same period if we had continued to report 
based on this principle. 
for 2021, ebitda according to ifrs is expected 
to be dkk 1.1 billion higher than what we 
would have expected if we had kept reporting 
according to the business performance princi-
ple. the main part of the amount is related to 
site ebitda in offshore. this effect is included 
in our directional guidance described above. 
in the management’s review, part of our 
interim and annual reports in 2021, we will use 
business performance as comparable numbers 
for 2020 for a better like-for-like comparison, 
while our consolidated financial statements 
will be reported after ifrs only. 
read more in notes 1.4 and 1.6 on pages 88 
and 90, respectively. 
uncertainties, prices, and hedges
our offshore wind farms are largely subject 
to regulated prices, implying a high degree 
of revenue certainty. this means that we 
know the price per generated mwh for most 
wind farms in denmark and germany, our 
first dutch wind farm as well as the cfd 
wind farms in the uk. for our british roc 
wind farms, we also know the subsidy per 
generated mwh which we will receive in 
addition to the market price. 
the part of our generation from offshore 
and onshore farms and power plants which 
is exposed to market prices has to a large 
extent been hedged for 2021. the same ap-
plies to our currency risks. the market value 
of financial hedging instruments relating to 
our operations and divestments of assets 
deferred for recognition in ebitda amounted 
to dkk 0.1 billion at the end of 2020. this
effect is included in the outlook for 2021 (see 
note 1.6).
the most significant uncertainty about the 
operating profit from existing activities in 
2021 relates to the size of our power gen-
eration which depends on wind conditions, 
ramp-up of new wind farms, and asset 
availability.
forward-looking statements
the annual report contains forward-looking state-
ments which include projections of our short- and 
long-term financial performance and targets as 
well as our financial policies. these statements are 
by nature uncertain and associated with risk. many 
factors may cause the actual development to differ 
materially from our expectations. 
these factors include, but are not limited to, changes 
in temperature, wind conditions, wake and blockage 
effects, precipitation levels, the development in 
power, coal, carbon, gas, oil, currency, and interest 
rate markets, changes in legislation, regulations, or 
standards, the renegotiation of contracts, changes 
in the competitive environment in our markets, and 
reliability of supply. read more about the risks in the 
chapter ‘risk and risk management’ and in note 7.

financial estimates 
we remain well on track to deliver on our 
long-term financial targets.
for the period 2019-2025, we expect total 
gross investments of approx. dkk 200 billion, 
of which dkk 50 billion was spent in 2019  
and 2020. 
from 2017 to 2023, we expect an average 
increase in operating profit (ebitda) from 
offshore and onshore wind and solar farms in 
operation (including o&m agreements and 
power purchase agreements) of 20 % annually, 
reaching a level of dkk 25-26 billion in 2023.
the largest share of Ørsted’s operating profit 
(ebitda) will be generated by long-term  
contract-based or regulated activities. we  
expect an average of around 90 % of ebitda 
in the period 2019-2025 to stem from long-
term contract-based or regulated activities.
our target is an average return on capital  
employed (roce) of approx. 10 % for the 
group in the 2019-2025 period.

of dkk 11.5 per share be paid for 2020,  
equating an increase of 9.5 % and a total  
of dkk 4.8 billion. 
supported by the expected increase in cash 
flows from future offshore and onshore wind 
farms, we still intend to increase annual 
dividends by a high single-digit percentage 
compared to the previous years’ dividends, 
covering the period up until 2025.
our dividend policy and other expected

the uk, is the world’s largest offshore 
operations and maintenance centre. 
it serves our four operational wind 
farms in the area, along with the 
construction of a fifth. aarron is based 
there as a wind turbine technician 
on hornsea 1 offshore wind farm. 
he is one of hundreds working in 
a job generated by Ørsted, whose 
investment here has reinvigorated the 
former fishing town’s economy.

a catalyst for change
the eu is defining ‘green’ 
sustainable finance is a critical enabler of the 
green transformation of industries across the 
eu and globally. for the energy industry alone, 
the ipcc estimates a usd 2.4 trillion annual 
shortfall in clean energy investment through 
2035 to meet the 1.5 °c paris agreement goal. 
mobilisation and reallocation of institutional 
and private capital will be necessary to meet 
this challenge. the global economy remains 
far from operating at a net-zero level, and 
emissions are not being reduced by the required 
volume and pace. at the same time, countries 
and businesses need to prepare better for a 
changing climate.
the eu is preparing a taxonomy to be used as 
a tool to help plan and report on the transition 
to an economy that is consistent with the eu’s 
environmental objectives. upcoming taxonomy 
regulation will determine when an economic 
activity can be considered sustainable.
in 2018, the european commission established 
a technical expert group on sustainable 
finance which was assigned with developing 
recommendations on the taxonomy’s technical 
screening criteria for the objectives of climate 
change mitigation and adaptation. the group’s 
recommendations were presented to the 
european commission in march 2020 and gener-
ally formed the basis for draft legislation put 
forward by the commission in november 2020. 
at Ørsted, we plan to align with the taxonomy 
after the final version is launched by the eu, 
expectedly in 2021.
2020 demonstrated the vulnerability of global society.  
in the past year, the world was shaken by a global pandemic 
with more than 80 million cases of covid-19 and more than  
1.8 million lives lost, disrupting all parts of the global economy.
in parallel with the unprecedented pandemic, 
2020 ended as another record-breaking year 
for climate change as it became the joint 
hottest year on record and by far the warmest  
year ever recorded in europe, while the 
frequency and severity of extreme weather 
events continued to increase. in february, 
the antarctic hit 20 °c for the first time ever, 
and its ice cap shrank to the second-smallest 
ever. record-breaking wildfires raged through 
australia and the us west coast, fuelled by 
longer dry seasons and extreme events like 
heatwaves. we saw the most active atlantic 
hurricane season on record, and an unusually 
heavy monsoon flooding in india and in south 
and east asia ruined millions of homes. 
the unprecedented events of 2020 have 
clearly reinforced the urgency to change the 
way humanity treats our planet and accounts 
for environmental and social risks. climate 
change threatens to fundamentally change 
the conditions for life on our planet. the impor-
tance of collective action, decision-making  
based on facts and guided by science, and 
decisive reactions are more evident than ever. 
and while it is of essence that the transition to 
a global green economy happens in balance 
with our natural environment and societies, 
it is critical that we keep momentum. this 
is a moment for the world to take bold and 
necessary action. the need to build a more 
sustainable world has never been stronger.
how to stay below 1.5 °c 
the science is clear: we are heading towards 
an increasingly vulnerable world with com-
plex environmental, health, and economic 
crises if we do not act now. to meet the 1.5 °c  
paris agreement goals, humanity must at 
least halve global carbon emissions during 
the next ten years. 
the first important stones have been laid 
to ensure the right conditions for this to 
happen. wind and solar pv are today the 
cheapest sources of new-built generation in 
at least two-thirds of the world. since 2012, 
the cost of electricity from offshore wind has 
decreased by 66 % and is now lower than 
electricity generated by nuclear power, coal, 
or natural gas. so far, 121 countries have com-
mitted to net zero emissions by 2050, along 
with 454 cities and almost 1,400 businesses. 
through the net-zero asset owner alliance, 
33 of the world’s largest investors with  
usd 5.1 trillion of assets under management 
have agreed on portfolio decarbonisation 
targets to align portfolios with a 1.5 °c 
scenario. with the green deal, the eu has 
increased its green ambitions towards 2030, 
which can help drive further deployment  
of renewable technologies in the eu. 
still, progress is not happening remotely fast 
enough to reduce emissions at the necessary 
pace. although we saw global carbon emis-
sions fall temporarily in 2020 due to covid-19 
lockdowns and the resulting slowdown of 
the global economy, these reductions were 
neither systemic nor sustainable. in fact, 
supply chain disruptions from covid-19  
temporarily delayed the build-out of renew-
able energy in the eu energy sector.

climate-related financial disclosures 
at Ørsted, we are aware of the transitional 
and physical impacts of climate change on 
the resilience of our business as recommend-
ed by the task force on climate-related 
financial disclosures (tcfd). by endorsing and 
aligning our practices and reporting with the 
tcfd recommendations over the past three 
years, we have crystallised our understanding 
and disclosure of climate-related risks and 
opportunities.
our tcfd disclosure is integrated throughout 
the strategy, risk, and governance sections 
of this annual report. this year, we expanded 
our esg performance report to include a one-
page overview with references to our tcfd 
alignment: orsted.com/esgperformance2020
limiting global warming to 1.5 °c will require 
a structural change of the global energy 
 system as 73 % of global greenhouse gas 
emissions come from the use of energy, 
 mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels. 
the 1.5 °c pathway requires a significant 
increase in electrification, acceleration 
of green energy build-out, phasing out of 
fossil fuels, and increased energy efficiency. 
the share of electricity in overall energy 
consumption must increase from about 
20 % today to at least 50 % by 2050. the 
projected rate of the green energy build-out 
must be more than doubled towards 2030, 
and coal-fired power generation needs to be 
phased-out at least three times faster than 
the projected rate of retirement. 
by a wide margin, climate change is humani-
ty’s greatest challenge. although renewable 
energy build-out has the risk of impacting 
land-use and biodiversity, it is critical we 
keep momentum. the global energy industry 
has the technologies and capabilities need-
ed to undertake the transformation. now, it 
is time to act. it is time to deliver on commit-
ments, to deploy and scale technologies at 
hand, and to accelerate the transformation 
to a sustainable society.
Ørsted wants to be a catalyst for change 
our vision is a world that runs entirely on 
green energy. every day, we act as a catalyst 
for the change needed to build a sustainable 
energy supply. over the past decade, we have 
transformed our business fundamentally, 
from being one of the most carbon-intensive 
utilities in europe to becoming a renewable 
energy major and one of the most sustainable 
companies in the world. we are committed to 
taking a leading role in the global green ener-
gy transformation, and we have set ambitious 
targets for reducing our carbon footprint.
by 2025, we aim to be a carbon-neutral 
company (emission scopes 1 - 2), which we 
plan to achieve by at least a 98 % reduction 
in carbon emissions from our energy genera-
tion and operations compared to 2006. the 
remaining less than 2 % will be either elimi-
nated or covered by certified carbon offsets. 
by 2040, we aim to reach net-zero emissions 
across our entire value chain (scopes 1 - 3), 
having a midway target to reduce our scope 3 
emissions by 50 % by 2032. our carbon reduc-
tion targets are confirmed by the science 
based targets initiative to be consistent with 
the reductions required by energy companies 
to keep global warming below 1.5 °c and are 
the most ambitious science-based targets in 
our sector.
in 2020, we made significant progress to- 
wards these targets with green energy  
build-out and scaling-up of new technolo-
gies, including renewable hydrogen. during 
the year, we added 1.4 gw of installed 
renewable energy capacity in onshore 
and offshore wind, adding up to our total 
of 11.3 gw. our carbon emissions intensity

(scopes 1 and 2) decreased in 2020 by 11 %. 
however, 2020 showed an increase in 
Ørsted’s absolute carbon emissions due to 
a temporary increase in our use of coal of 
13 % at our danish power plants. our service 
obligations in denmark require us to provide 
ancillary services that help grid operators 
maintain a reliable electricity system.  
this sometimes requires the use of coal 
to ensure a stable supply of energy. our 
commitment to end our use of coal by 2023 
remains unchanged, and we are on track 
towards this goal. until then, however, we 
may see fluctuations in coal consumption, 
driven by market and weather conditions.
the next frontier in our journey towards 
net-zero emissions in our total carbon 
footprint by 2040 is to gradually phase 
out our supply of gas from long-term gas 
contracts and to decarbonise our supply 
chain. therefore, we allow existing long-term 
gas contracts to expire gradually and do not 
enter into new contracts. across our supply 
chain, we are committed to reaching beyond 
our own emissions and to working with 
our suppliers to gradually remove carbon 
emissions. thus, we encourage our strategic 
suppliers to: 1) disclose their emissions and 
set science-based targets aligned with a 
1.5 °c scenario, 2) use 100 % green electricity 
in the manufacturing of wind turbines, foun-
dations, cables, and substations by 2025, 
3) optimise their vessel fleets and develop 
a roadmap towards powering vessels with 
renewable energy. 
our contribution to the sustainable development goals
the year 2020 reinforced the global 
realisation of people, businesses, and nature 
being interconnected and interdependent. 
experiences of the past year clarified the 
need to deliver on the united nations’ 17 
sustainable development goals (sdgs) 
which address the key economic, social, and 
environmental challenges the world faces 
and acts as a global framework for achieving 
a more sustainable future. 
we acknowledge that the resilience and 
long-term success of Ørsted’s business 
directly depend on us supporting a global 
society that is in balance with the resources 
of our planet, protecting natural habitats 
and local communities as much as economic 
growth. to sustain our long-term value 
creation, we ensure that our green energy 
build-out is executed sustainably through 
a systematic and programmatic approach 
to sustainability. we seek to strengthen the 
positive impacts and to mitigate and avoid 
potential negative impacts derived from 
our core business activities and a global 
green transition.
with our core business, we aspire to have 
a transformative impact on sdg 7 on afforda-
ble and clean energy and sdg 13 on climate 
action. moreover, we indirectly impact several 
other sdgs, especially those listed to the right.
catalysing the green energy transformation
addressing the sustainability impacts  
of the green energy transformation
we report on our sdg contributions and 
impacts and all our 20 sustainability 
programmes in our sustainability report, 
orsted.com/sustainability2020. a full esg 
data overview and our accounting policies 
are available in our annual esg performance 
report, orsted.com/esgperformance2020. 
together, the two reports constitute our 
annual communication on progress to the 
un global compact and comply with the re-
quirements for corporate social responsibility 
reporting set out in section 99 a of the danish 
financial statements act as well as section 
99 b on gender distribution and section 107 d 
on diversity at management levels.
we launched our supply chain decarbonisa-
tion programme a year ago. during this first 
year, we have focused on building the foun-
dation and management structure to drive 
our programme and have begun to engage 
with our strategic offshore wind suppliers 
on the decarbonisation journey ahead. the 
offshore wind supply chain today includes 
carbon intensive activities, particularly the 
use of energy-intensive construction materi-
als, such as steel, aluminium, and copper, as 
well as fuel for offshore construction vessels. 
as part of our dialogue with our top strategic 
suppliers, including wind turbine, foundation, 
and cable manufacturers, we support them 
in building solid and uniform carbon account-
ing policies and data capture by utilising the 
cdp reporting framework. based on this  
solid foundation, we will work with our 
suppliers over the coming years to establish 
emission reduction roadmaps and targets 
supporting our overall strategic targets.

our strategic aspiration and growth platform
our global leadership position in 
offshore wind and strong north 
american position in onshore 
wind and solar photovoltaics 
(pv) provide a solid foundation 
for tapping into the significant 
growth opportunities in renew-
able energy and for realising 
our aspiration of becoming a 
global green energy major.
Ørsted develops, constructs, owns, and 
operates wind farms, solar farms, and energy 
storage facilities, and we own and operate 
bioenergy plants. in addition to our generation 
activities, Ørsted engages in partnerships and 
develops projects related to the production 
of renewable hydrogen. finally, we bring our 
power and heat to market and engage in  
trading activities to secure offtake and  
provide energy solutions to our customers.
we are the largest offshore wind constructor 
in the world, and we are market leader in each 
of the four regions where we operate: the uk, 
continental europe, north america, and asia 
pacific, excluding mainland china. our strate-
gic ambition is to maintain a market-leading 
position in all regions where we operate.
our onshore wind and solar pv business is 
expanding rapidly, and we are now among 
the five largest us constructors in terms of 
new capacity additions in 2020. our strategic 
ambition is to further strengthen our position 
in north america by building a diverse onshore 
wind and solar pv portfolio. in addition, we 
continue to monitor onshore growth opportu-
nities in europe and asia pacific.
we see increasing political support in europe 
for the development of renewable hydrogen. 
when produced with renewable power, 
hydrogen offers a solution for decarbonising 
industries such as ammonia, steel, refining, and 
heavy transport where direct electrification 
is difficult or impossible. however, renewable 
hydrogen is currently not cost-competitive 
with fossil-based alternatives. significant  
challenges must be overcome to create and 
scale a hydrogen market, requiring action  
from both policymakers and companies.
Ørsted has established a pipeline of eight 
renewable hydrogen projects in denmark, 
germany, the uk, and the netherlands. in  
january 2021, we took fid on our first renew-
able hydrogen project, marking the beginning 
of a new phase in Ørsted’s green transfor-
mation journey. we see growth potential in 
renewable hydrogen and are pursuing scale-up 
opportunities as we execute on our pipeline.
our growth platform in offshore wind,  
onshore wind, and solar pv, and our growth 
potential in renewable hydrogen provide a 
solid foundation for realising our aspiration  
of becoming a global green energy major.

our markets and strategy
global demand for renewable energy is increasing. we are well-
positioned to tap into this growth and are on track to maintain our 
undisputed leadership position in offshore wind as we continue 
to strengthen our position in onshore wind and solar pv.
global installed renewable capacity is expected 
to exceed 4 tw in 2030, more than double 
today’s capacity. offshore wind, onshore wind, 
and large-scale solar pv are expected to grow 
towards 2030 by 19 %, 11 %, and 9 % per year, 
respectively. this reflects increasing demand 
for electricity worldwide, ambitious govern-
ment decarbonisation programmes, and the 
cost-competitiveness of renewable technologies 
– many of which still have not fully matured.
so far, renewables have proved resilient to 
the impacts of covid-19 compared to other 
sectors, and long-term capacity forecasts 
have remained stable. bloomberg new energy 
finance’s (bnef) post-covid-19 2030 forecast 
for renewable capacity fell by just 1 % relative 
to last year’s forecast. in the short term, some 
delays to renewable energy projects are antici-
pated; however, growth is expected to resume in 
2021 as delayed projects come online. we also 
see covid-19 recovery packages adding new 
impetus to green transitions in some markets. 
most notable is the european commission’s 
eur 750 billion package which focuses on 
decarbonising buildings, supporting growth in 
renewable power, and accelerating investment 
into renewable hydrogen and clean transport. 
however, it is currently not possible to know the 
long-term impact of covid-19.
have long been an important part of doing  
business in onshore wind and solar pv, and in 
2020, we signed over 700 mw of cppas with 
five different customers across four us projects. 
Ørsted is also playing a key role in developing 
the global cppa market for offshore wind,  
with several landmark agreements in 2020.  
in july, Ørsted and taiwan-based tsmc signed  
a 20-year contract, under which tsmc will 
offtake the full production of Ørsted’s 920 mw 
offshore wind farm greater changhua 2b & 4, 
making it the world’s largest renewables cppa. 
in december, we signed a 10-year cppa with 
amazon who will offtake 250 mw of borkum 
riffgrund 3 offshore wind farm’s total capacity 
of 900 mw. this is europe’s largest cppa to date.
competition within the renewables industry is 
intensifying due to the significant growth oppor-
tunities ahead. new competitors have entered 
the market, oil majors have announced signifi-
cant renewable energy ambitions, and leading 
utilities are reshaping and expanding their re-
newable portfolios. we welcome the increasing 
involvement of new and existing players as the 
build-out of renewable energy must accelerate 
if we are to halve global emissions by 2030 in 
line with the paris agreement. we continue to 
see many profitable growth opportunities and 
remain confident that we will meet the strategic 
ambition set in november 2018 of installing more 
than 30 gw of renewable capacity by 2030.
Ørsted is organised into three business units.  
offshore includes our offshore wind portfolio 
and our emerging renewable hydrogen business, 
and onshore is responsible for our onshore wind 
and solar pv portfolio. markets & bioenergy 
plays an important role in supporting our  
generation portfolio by providing services that 
help offtake Ørsted’s energy production and 
manage our risk exposure. it is also responsible 
for our portfolio of combined heat and power 
(chp) plants which provide green heat and 
power as well as ancillary services to denmark’s 
energy system, making a significant contribution 
to the danish decarbonisation efforts.
across our markets, we are experiencing 
growing demand from companies for corporate 
power purchase agreements (cppas). cppas

our ambition and strategic focus  
in offshore wind
Ørsted is the world leader in offshore wind, 
with a market share of approx. 30 % of global 
capacity installed, excluding mainland china. 
we have played a key role in maturing the 
industry, and we have built more offshore wind 
farms worldwide than any other company.  
by the end of 2020, Ørsted had 7.6 gw  
of capacity installed, 2.3 gw of capacity  
under construction, and a further 5.0 gw  
of capacity awarded.
competition is intensifying as growth oppor-
tunities in offshore wind increase. this means 
that Ørsted cannot and should not win all the 
auctions and tenders in which we participate. 
we remain financially disciplined in our bidding 
and final investment decisions to make sure we 
build a healthy, sustainable business and, over 
time, secure enough wins to fulfil the strategic 
ambition set in november 2018 of maintaining 
our market leadership position in offshore  
wind and of reaching 15 gw of installed off-
shore wind capacity by 2025. with our current 
portfolio of projects under construction and 
awarded, we have nearly reached this target.

the uk
the uk is an attractive, advanced market with 
sophisticated regulatory schemes supporting 
an efficient and competitive deployment of 
offshore wind. with over 10 gw in operation 
today, the uk is the largest offshore wind  
market in the world. it also has one of the most  
ambitious national build-out programmes 
and is targeting 40 gw by 2030. with a visible 
pipeline of over 50 gw, the region is well- 
positioned to achieve this target.
Ørsted is market leader in the uk with a  
market share of 42 % of installed capacity. 
our portfolio includes 5.8 gw of capacity 
installed and under construction and up  
to 5 gw of capacity under development in  
the hornsea zone, more specifically our  
hornsea 3 and 4 projects. the uk is our  
largest market, and we currently operate  
15 offshore wind farms in british waters.
continental europe
offshore wind build-out is expected to ac-
celerate in continental europe, driven by the 
european commission’s european green deal 
and offshore renewable energy strategy. in the 
latter, the commission has set an objective of 
installing 60 gw of offshore wind by 2030 and 
300 gw by 2050 within the eu 27 to meet the 
climate goals of the paris agreement. 
at the country level, ambitions are also  
growing. denmark, germany, and poland 
raised their renewable and offshore wind 
targets in 2020. bnef estimates that euro-
pean offshore wind capacity will grow from 
14 gw today to 64 gw by 2030, exeeding the 
eu’s goal.
Ørsted has a strong position in continental 
europe. we are the largest offshore wind 
player with a market share of 23 % of installed 
capacity. our operating portfolio totals 3.1 gw, 
and we have been awarded 1.1 gw in germany. 
we have a strong market position in all major 
offshore wind markets in addition to significant 
partnership experience and an extensive indus-
try network across continental europe.
north america
us states are driving demand for offshore 
wind in north america, as state policymakers 
expand renewable energy programmes to 
meet decarbonisation goals. the us has less 
than 0.1 gw of offshore wind installed today, 
but is forecast to reach 7 gw by 2025 and 
23 gw by 2030.
Ørsted operates block island, the us’s first 
offshore wind farm, and we were the engi-
neering, procurement, and construction lead 
for the pilot project coastal virginia wind, 
the first offshore wind project in us federal 
waters, commissioned in october 2020. we 
have gained strong market traction as well as 
built partnerships in the emerging us market

1 all auction and tender timelines and capacities are based on current expectations and are subject to change.
 
expected offshore wind auctions and tenders in 20211
with approx. 2.9 gw of capacity awarded and 
4.5 gw of capacity under development along 
the east coast.
asia pacific
robust and favourable regulatory regimes 
position asia pacific as an important region 
for offshore wind. asia pacific has 0.4 gw 
of installed capacity today, but is expected 
to reach 36 gw by 2030, mostly driven by 
build-out in taiwan, japan, and south korea. 
taiwan has met its target of awarding 5.5 gw 
to be commissioned by 2025 and has released 
a draft auction guideline for the next 10 gw 
planned for construction between 2026 and 
2035. japan set new offshore wind targets in 
december 2020 and is now aiming for 10 gw 
by 2030 and 30 to 45 gw by 2040. achieving 
these goals would make japan one of the 
largest offshore wind markets in the world. 
south korea has announced it plans to build  
12 gw of offshore wind to reach its aim of 
20 % renewables in its energy mix by 2030  
and up to 35 % by 2040.
Ørsted is well-positioned to expand in asia 
pacific. we are the number one offshore wind 
player, excluding mainland china, with 0.1 gw 
of capacity in operation, 0.9 gw of capacity 
under construction, and 0.9 gw of capacity 
awarded. we have a strong pipeline of project 
opportunities in taiwan, japan, and south 
korea, supported locally through offices in 
taipei, tokyo, and seoul.
renewable hydrogen
in addition to offshore wind, we are pursuing  
opportunities in renewable hydrogen in 
europe. in july, the european commission 
launched the european clean hydrogen  
alliance with the target of building 6 gw 
of electrolyser capacity by 2024 and up to 
40 gw by 2030. the commission has an  
ambition of making europe a global front- 
runner within renewable hydrogen, and we  
expect this ambition to create additional 
growth opportunities for Ørsted, if policies  
and regulatory incentives make projects 
economically viable.
our pipeline focuses on the application of 
renewable hydrogen in refinery processes, 
ammonia production, and fuel production  
for trucks, buses, vessels, and planes. with  
the fid on the h2res project in january, 
Ørsted has 2 mw of electrolyser capacity 
under construction. the facility will produce  
renewable hydrogen to be used as fuel in  
road transport and will provide important 
learnings to help turn europe’s ambitious 
targets into reality.

onshore
the north american onshore wind  
and solar pv markets
onshore renewable energy is the largest 
non-fossil energy source in the world. onshore 
wind and large-scale solar pv accounted for 
75 % of installed renewable capacity and 77 % 
of new capacity additions worldwide in 2020.
in north america, onshore wind is the leading 
renewable technology. it reached 134 gw 
of installed capacity by the end of 2020 and 
is expected to continue growing by 5 % per 
year towards 2030. large-scale solar pv 
comes in second at 57 gw and is expected 
to accelerate towards 2030 at an annual 
rate of 10 %. the strong growth in solar pv 
is fuelled by its ability to cost-effectively 
replace retiring fossil-fuelled power stations 
across much of the western, central, and 
south-eastern us. in addition, companies 
are signing more solar cppas as they look to 
procure energy from different technologies 
in order to supply their operations 24/7 with 
clean energy.
our ambition and strategic focus  
in onshore wind and solar pv
our onshore business gained strong traction 
in 2020. Ørsted is now among the five largest 
constructors in the us when measured by new 
capacity additions. last year, we commis-
sioned the onshore wind farms sage draw, 
plum creek, and willow creek and took 
final investment decisions on the onshore 
wind farms western trail and haystack. this 
makes our onshore wind portfolio one of the 
fastest growing in the us, and we rank fourth 
in annual mw installed last year. furthermore, 
the acquisition of muscle shoals and the final 
investment decision on old 300 solar center 
strengthened our north american solar pv 
platform. Ørsted is currently ranked second in 
the us in terms of large-scale solar pv under 
construction. our onshore portfolio of assets 
installed and under construction now totals 
3.4 gw, of which 2.3 gw is onshore wind and 
1.1 gw is solar pv.
we also have 40 mwac of battery storage under 
construction in connection with the permian 
energy center. we view energy storage as a 
complement to our renewables portfolio, and 
we continue to pursue storage projects that 
allow us to optimise our generation assets. 
we are well on track to meet our target of 
5 gw of installed capacity by 2025. when 
the permian energy center comes online this 
year, we will have established a full-spectrum 
renewable portfolio in the us, spanning solar 
pv, onshore wind, offshore wind, and battery 
storage. our strategic ambition is to build a 
strong north american position in onshore 
wind and solar pv. onshore expansion is also 
part of our strategy, and we are actively 
seeking growth opportunities outside  
north america. our initial focus is on europe, 
but we continue to monitor opportunities in  
asia pacific. 
going forward, we aim to further diversify 
our onshore investments across markets  
and across our portfolio of technologies.  
this will allow us to offer new, global  
solutions to customers by taking advantage 
of complementary generation profiles,  
while reducing our risk exposure. in addition, 
we continue driving operational excellence, 
reducing lcoe, and working to secure  
tax equity financing for our projects in  
the medium term.
long-term, we are focused on securing  
power purchase agreements to ensure  
solid economics after the phase out of the 
production tax credit and the investment  
tax credit for wind and solar pv projects,  
respectively. we will also continue  
developing the capabilities of our us-based 
trading unit which manages risk and protects 
the value of our us generation portfolio.

excludes solar thermal, geothermal, marine,  
and tidal which combined account for less  
than 1 % of capacity.

markets & bioenergy
markets & bioenergy contributes to Ørsted´s 
business in five ways. it provides an efficient 
route-to-market for commodities, including 
power and green certificates, for Ørsted and for 
third parties. furthermore, it manages market 
risks for Ørsted’s generation portfolio. the 
business unit is also responsible for operating, 
optimising, and decarbonising our portfolio of 
chp plants and for optimising our gas portfolio. 
finally, markets & bioenergy is responsible for 
the operation of our waste-recycling plant,  
renescience northwich, which was commis-
sioned in october 2020.
the variable generation profiles of renewable 
assets do not always match short-term fore-
casts, and the difference needs to be balanced 
as power enters the market. markets & bioen-
ergy supports Ørsted’s generation activities by 
providing an efficient route-to-market, including 
balancing services, and seeks out opportunities 
to offer these services to third parties.
constantly fluctuating commodity prices and 
changing market conditions require strong risk 
management capabilities to protect the value 
of Ørsted’s generation portfolio. markets & 
bioenergy meets this challenge through the 
development and deployment of state-of- 
the-art risk monitoring and management  
tools for an expanding set of market risks.
asnæs power station, 
kalundborg, denmark.
our portfolio of chp plants continues to play 
a critical role in denmark’s heat and power 
systems and supports the green transforma-
tion by providing dispatchable power with a 
low carbon footprint. we have completed the 
planned conversions of our coal-fired units to 
renewable biomass and continue to source 
third-party certified sustainable biomass in line 
with denmark’s newly announced regulations. 
we are targeting full carbon neutrality in our 
chp operations by 2025. this includes the 
planned closure of our last coal-fired power 
station in esbjerg, denmark, in 2023 and the 
implementation of offset projects for our chp 
portfolio’s remaining carbon footprint.
natural gas is a fossil fuel and should be 
gradually phased out of the energy mix. 
 consequently, we neither enter into new long-
term gas sourcing contracts nor prolong 
expiring contracts. our focus is on maximising 
the value of our legacy natural gas portfolio 
through trading, contract negotiations, and 
portfolio optimisation.

our capital allocation and funding
in november 2018, we announced our strate-
gic plan to invest dkk 200 billion from 2019 
to 2025, with more than 95 % earmarked for 
our growth platform in offshore wind, onshore 
wind, and solar pv, the balance being dedicat-
ed to our markets & bioenergy activities. we 
have invested dkk 50 billion over the course 
of 2019 and 2020, primarily in offshore and 
onshore construction activities which total 
dkk 35 billion and dkk 13 billion, respectively.
we allocate capital according to the following 
principles in order of priority. first, we adhere 
to our strong commitment to our credit 
ratings (bbb+/baa1). second, we intend to 
increase our dividend by a high single-digit 
rate annually until 2025. third, we invest in 
value-creating growth opportunities. finally, 
potential excess capital will be returned to 
our shareholders in the form of additional 
dividends and/or share buy-backs.
the uncertainty concerning the economic 
impact of covid-19 caused turbulence in 
financial markets in the spring of 2020. 
however, Ørsted’s conservative approach to 
liquidity management allowed us to weather 
the crisis, and we completed our scheduled 
funding activities as planned. in november,  
we issued 15 billion in ntd-denominated 
bonds. furthermore, we completed the 
divestment of our danish power distribution, 
residential customer, and city light businesses 
in august 2020, freeing up dkk 20.5 billion for 
investment in our growth platform.
since 2017, all new capital has been issued in 
a green format in accordance with our green 
finance framework. with this year’s debt issu-
ances, our total outstanding debt, excluding 
hybrids, amounted to dkk 37.1 billion, of which 
more than 51 % was issued in a green format.
our strategy is backed by a dkk 200 billion investment  
programme for the period 2019 to 2025 and is entirely funded  
by green capital.

talent
talent has been the cornerstone of Ørsted’s 
transformation, and we will continue needing 
exceptional people with the right values as we 
grow our business and expand our geograph-
ical footprint. we want to be a global green 
energy major – powered by talent. thus, we 
have a strong focus on employer branding, 
talent acquisition, inclusion, and well-being as 
well as the identification, development, and 
deployment of diverse talent around the world.
in 2020, we made significant progress on our 
talent ambition. we improved our positioning 
in the universum employer branding rankings 
for denmark. for example, Ørsted moved from 
25th place in 2018 to seventh place in 2020 for 
experienced business professionals, with com-
parable changes in other candidate segments. 
we were also listed in fastcompany’s best 
workplaces for innovators for the first time – 
the only company with a european hq in the 
top 20. as a result of such branding, and with 
increased focus on recruiting best-in-class, 
diverse talent, we hired and onboarded over 
1,300 new employees around the world.
in addition, we launched our first global 
learning week which was accessed by 
thousands of employees. usage of digital 
learning content in our learning management 
system has increased more than tenfold 
since 2018. we also delivered virtual learning 
programmes for all managers to enable them 
to support career development in their teams.
finally, to ensure our culture is inclusive of 
diversity and supports our global growth, we 
surveyed all employees to understand their 
sense of opportunities and challenges in this 
area. the data gathered informs our focus on 
ensuring equal opportunities, cultivating psy-
chological safety, and building inclusive virtual 
workplaces. Ørsted’s executive committee has 
set targets for gender balance in all levels of 
the organisation and for the multicultural mix 
in our leadership team.
digitalisation
digitalisation is a key enabler of value 
creation at Ørsted. we systematically deploy 
a variety of digital technologies to streamline 
business processes to develop data-driven 
business cases, to drive state-of-the-art energy 
market and risk management, and to improve 
the design, construction, operations, and 
maintenance of our assets.
for example, Ørsted is using advanced data 
analytics and machine learning to achieve 
operations and maintenance cost reductions 
as well as annual energy production uplift. 
calendar-based maintenance schedules are 
being substituted for a data-driven  approach. 
this way, if an asset does not require 
 physical maintenance at the scheduled time 
and can be inspected remotely, we avoid 
unnecessary costs.
we also utilise wind turbine data to contin-
uously correct wind turbine yaw and pitch 
alignment. when aligned correctly into the 
wind, a wind turbine produces more electricity 
and is subject to less wear and tear over time. 
this increases the lifetime of the asset and 
reduces the lifetime maintenance cost.
finally, we utilise algorithm-assisted power 
market trading in continental europe and 
the uk. recent years have seen a significant 
increase in the frequency of trades and a 
decrease in the average tick size, leading to 
power trading at super-human speed. digital 
capabilities enable us to create value in 
fast-moving commodity markets by securing 
good prices for the inherently long position 
Ørsted has within power generation.

our strategic enablers
achieving our aspiration of becoming a global green energy 
major requires continuously strengthening our organisation 
in three key areas: talent, digitalisation, and innovation.
innovation
innovation is part of our dna. the willingness 
to challenge the notion of what is possible 
and the ability to identify opportunities and 
to innovate our way around challenges were 
instrumental in our strategic transformation. 
these competences are also what allow us to 
maintain our leadership position in the rapidly 
growing renewables market.
for example, we spearheaded the first  
commercial deployment of 66 kv array cables  
for an offshore asset project in 2020 at our  
borssele 1 & 2 offshore wind farm. previously, 
33 kv array cables were considered state-of-
the-art. Ørsted challenged this idea, and we 
succeeded in marshalling support from our 
peers and supply chain for the development 
and implementation of the new cables, reduc-
ing losses and ensuring optimal substation 
design. the next step is the development of 
132 kv array cables which will be needed to 
maximise the potential of the next generation 
of wind turbines with ratings of 15 mw or more.
in addition to pushing the boundaries of what 
is technically feasible, we are rethinking the 
deployment of renewable generation and 
transmission assets to support the green 
transition of europe’s energy system. the 
danish parliament has decided to develop 
an offshore wind hub of 2 gw by 2030 off 
the coast of bornholm, a danish island in the 
baltic sea, with the potential of connecting 
denmark, poland, sweden, and germany 
and of supporting the large-scale production 
of renewable hydrogen. we are engaged in 
ongoing dialogues with all stakeholders on 
how to expand the hub’s potential and how to 
ensure timely progress. this new energy hub 
represents the next step in technological scale 
and innovation and is key to unlocking the 
enormous potential of offshore wind.
finally, we continue to explore new products 
and technologies, focusing on the develop-
ment and launch of combined technologies 
for power-to-x. in 2020, we joined forces with a 
group of leading danish companies, represent-
ing both suppliers and buyers of sustainable 
fuels, in the green fuels for denmark partner-
ship which aims to develop a ground-breaking 
hydrogen and e-fuels production facility with 
the first phase in operation as soon as 2023. 
when fully scaled up by 2030, the project  
will deliver more than 250,000 tonnes of 
sustainable fuel every year for buses, trucks, 
vessels, and planes. production will be based 
on a total electrolyser capacity of 1.3 gw, 
which will likely make it one of the largest 
facilities in the world of its kind.

5. greenhouse gas emission intensity (scopes 1 and 2), g co2e/kwh
we are well on track to meet our scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (ghg) emission intensity target 
of less than 10 g co2e/kwh in 2025. in addition, we aim to be carbon-neutral in 2025 and will 
neutralise the remaining 10 g co2e/kwh or less with carbon offsets. we reduced our ghg intensity 
to 58 g co2e/kwh in 2020.
6. greenhouse gas emissions (scope 3), million tonnes co2e
we aim to reduce our scope 3 emissions by 50 % between 2018 and 2032. this year, our historical 
figures for scope 3 emissions have been rebased due to the divestment of our lng business.  
the primary source of our scope 3 emissions is indirect emissions related to wholesale buying  
and selling of natural gas and fossil-based power in our markets & bioenergy business and to the 
goods and services we source for the construction of our wind and solar farms. 
8. safety, trir
safety is high on our agenda, and we do our utmost to prevent accidents and injuries.  
our target is to reduce the total recordable injury rate (trir) to 2.9 by 2025.
7. employee satisfaction, index 1-100
we believe that employee satisfaction and strong results go hand in hand. therefore, we are  
continuously working to improve the well-being of our employees. in 2020, we reached a  
record-high score of 78, placing Ørsted in the top 10 % of our external benchmark group, just as  
in 2018 and 2019. in 2019, we set a target to stay in the top 10 % from 2020 to 2025 and are proud 
to have met our goal this year.

business performance versus ifrs
we use business performance as an alternative 
to the results prepared in accordance with ifrs. 
business performance represents the underlying 
financial performance of the group in the reporting 
period as results are adjusted for temporary 
fluctuations in the market value of contracts 
(including hedging transactions) relating to other 
periods. the difference between the two principles 
will be eliminated as the contracts expire. apart 
from this, there is no difference between business 
performance and the ifrs results. 
ebitda in accordance with ifrs amounted to  
dkk 16.6 billion in 2020 against dkk 19.0 billion in 
2019. in accordance with the business performance 
principle, ebitda was dkk 18.1 billion and 
dkk 17.5 billion, respectively. the difference between 
the two principles was thus dkk -1.5 billion in 2020 
against dkk 1.5 billion in 2019.
in the presentation of the results according to 
ifrs, we have elected not to apply the provisions 
on hedge accounting of commodities and related 
currency exposures. the market value adjustments 
of these are continuously recognised in the income 
statement, which means that the ifrs results for the 
individual years are not comparable. ifrs results do 
not reflect the commercial risk hedging, according to 
which the business units and the group are managed 
and evaluated. in the management’s review, com-
ments are made on business performance only. read 
more in note 1.6 and in note 7.  
ebitda
operating profit (ebitda) totalled dkk 18.1 billion 
compared to dkk 17.5 billion in 2019. 
earnings from offshore and onshore wind farms  
in operation amounted to dkk 16.9 billion. 
the 14 % increase relative to 2019 was due to 
the above-mentioned ramp-up of new wind 
farms in operation, receipt of cfds of another 
400 mw of hornsea 1 from april, and higher 
wind speeds. this was partly offset by adverse 
covid-19 impacts of approx. dkk 400 million 
on especially the uk power market due to 
a lower demand for electricity, which led to 
hours with negative prices from april to july, 
lower roc recycle prices, and higher balanc-
ing tariffs (bsuos) from national grid in 2020, 
and by lower earnings from trading related 
to hedging of our power exposures which 
achieved very high results in 2019. 
earnings from construction agreements for 
partners totalled dkk 1.6 billion compared to 
dkk 3.8 billion in 2019. in 2020, our earnings 
from construction agreements mainly related 
to the lowered assumptions regarding the 
preferred bidder’s expected return requirement 
on the hornsea 1 transmission asset, the 
construction of coastal virginia wind, and 
minor updates regarding finalised construction 
projects. in 2019, earnings from construction 
agreements primarily concerned hornsea 1. 
ebitda from chp plants amounted to  
dkk 1.1 billion, slightly below last year. 
financial results 
 
revenue
power generation from offshore and onshore 
wind increased by 35 % and totalled 20.9 twh 
in 2020, mainly due to ramp-up of generation 
from hornsea 1, borssele 1 & 2, lockett, sage 
draw, plum creek, and willow creek as well as 
higher wind speeds, mainly in q1 2020. this was 
partly offset by periods with negative prices 
due to a lower demand for electricity driven 
by the covid-19 pandemic, which led us to 
temporarily shut down generation.  
thermal power generation amounted to  
4.4 twh, a 4 % decrease compared to last year 
due to slightly warmer weather and less favour-
able market conditions for power generation, 
partly offset by a higher volume from ancillary 
services. heat generation amounted to 6.7 twh, 
down 20 % compared to last year, mainly due to 
a warm first quarter in 2020. 
offshore and onshore wind accounted for 83 % 
of our total power generation, up 6 percentage 
points from last year. 
revenue amounted to dkk 52.6 billion. the 
decrease of 22 % relative to 2019 was primarily 
due to limited construction works on wind 
farms for partners, significantly lower gas and 
power prices relative to last year, lower sales 
of gas, and lower thermal heat and power 
generation, partly offset by the increase in 
wind-based power generation.
the decrease was mainly due to lower 
thermal heat and power generation and lower 
power spreads as well as the reversal of a  
provision in 2019 of dkk 0.3 billion following 
the acquittal in the elsam case. this was 
partly offset by higher earnings from sale  
of ancillary services in 2020. 
ebitda from our gas activities were in line with 
last year. higher earnings from revaluation of 
our gas at storage and a positive impact from 
storage hedges were offset by lower trans-
ported and sold volumes due to the shutdown 
of the tyra gas field from late 2019 until 2022 
as well as a provision for bad debt in our b2b 
business to cover the extraordinary covid-19- 
related default risks among our customers.

ebit
ebit increased by 5 % to dkk 10.5 billion, 
primarily as a result of the higher ebitda and 
no impairment losses in 2020. depreciation 
increased due to more wind farms in opera-
tion. impairment losses in 2019 were related 
to a write-down of our renescience plant and 
our 20 mw battery storage project carnegie 
road, both in the uk.
gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises
gain on divestment of enterprises primarily 
concerned the divestment of our danish power 
distribution, residential customer, and city light 
businesses to seas-nve (now andel). the trans-
action resulted in a gain of dkk 10.9 billion. 
financial income and expenses 
net financial income and expenses  
amounted to dkk 2.5 billion compared  
to dkk 1.1 billion in 2019. the increase was

mainly due to a loss on interest rate swaps 
in june in connection with early termination 
of local project financing in the us, negative 
effects from exchange rate adjustments due 
to a weakening of gbp, and capital losses 
on the bond portfolio due to the increasing 
interest rates. 
tax and tax rate 
tax on profit for the year amounted to  
dkk 2.1 billion, which was dkk 0.6 billion 
lower than in 2019. the decrease was mainly 
due to higher net financial expenses, partly 
offset by initial recognition of deferred taxes 
of dkk 1.1 billion related to tax equity at 
sage draw in april, plum creek in june,  
and willow creek in september. 
the effective tax rate was 11 %, and it was 
significantly impacted by the non-taxable 
gain on the divestment of our danish power 
distribution, residential customer, and city 
light businesses mentioned above.
profit for the year from  
continuing operations
profit for the year from continuing operations 
totalled dkk 16.7 billion, dkk 10.6 billion 
higher than in 2019. the increase was primarily

cash flows and net debt
cash flows from operating activities
cash flows from operating activities totalled 
dkk 16.5 billion in 2020 compared to  
dkk 13.1 billion in 2019. the increase of  
dkk 3.4 billion was mainly due to lower paid 
taxes in denmark, tax equity contributions 
from our partners in the onshore wind farms 
sage draw, plum creek, and willow creek, 
lower trade receivables due to lower revenue, 
and the divestment of the offshore transmis-
sion assets at walney extension. this was part-
ly offset by 2019 being positively affected by 
received milestone payments related to the 
construction of hornsea 1 and the divestment 
of the race bank transmission assets. 
in 2020, we had a net cash outflow from 
work in progress of dkk 1.6 billion. this was 
mainly due to supplier payments related to 
the construction of hornsea 1 for partners 
and construction of the offshore transmission 
asset at hornsea 2, partly offset by the divest-
ment of the offshore transmission assets at 
walney extension.
investments and divestments
gross investments amounted to dkk 27.0 billion 
against dkk 23.3 billion in 2019. the main 
investments in 2020 were: 
–  offshore wind farms (dkk 19.5 billion),  
including borssele 1 & 2 in the netherlands,  
greater changhua 1 & 2a in taiwan, hornsea 2 
in the uk, and ocean wind 1 in the us
–  onshore wind and solar farms (dkk 6.6 billion), 
including permian energy center, muscle 
shoals, western trail, sage draw, plum 
creek, willow creek, and haystack in the us 
–  markets & bioenergy (dkk 0.7 billion),  
mainly related to maintenance of the  
power distribution grid.
cash flow from divestments in 2020 related 
mainly to the divestment of our danish power 
distribution, residential customer, and city 
light businesses. the transaction resulted in 
proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion. furthermore, 
we received minor proceeds regarding the 
divestment of our 10 mw oak solar farm in 
new jersey and our inbicon production facili-
ties. this was partly offset by a cash outflow 
in connection with the divestment of the lng 
activities of dkk 1.5 billion and compensations 
paid under our partnership agreements. 
cash flow from divestments in 2019 related  
to the receipt of deferred proceeds from the 
farm-down of 50 % of hornsea 1 in 2018  
(dkk 1.7 billion) and to the strengthening of  
our strategic partnership with eversource, as 
they became a 50 % partner in our activities  
in the new england area in february 2019  
(dkk 1.4 billion).
interest-bearing net debt
interest-bearing net debt totalled  
dkk 12.3 billion at the end of 2020 against  
dkk 17.2 billion at the end of 2019. the  
dkk 4.9 billion decrease was mainly due to  
a positive free cash flow of dkk 8.5 billion  
from continuing operations and a positive  
cash flow from discontinued operations  
where we have received deferred proceeds  
of usd 150 million from ineos regarding the 
oil & gas divestment in 2017. these positive 
cash flow effects were only partly offset by  
dividends and hybrid coupon payments of  
dkk 5.2 billion.

capital employed
capital employed was dkk 109.7 billion at

light businesses.
esg results 
green share of heat and power generation
the green share of heat and power generation 
amounted to 90 % in 2020, up 4 percentage 
points compared to last year. the increase 
mainly came from higher generation from 
offshore and onshore wind farms due to  
additional capacity and higher wind speeds. 
this was partly offset by an increase from 
ancillary services from our coal-fuelled units 
as we are legally obliged to deliver these 
services with the lowest marginal costs.
greenhouse gas emissions
the greenhouse gas intensity from our heat 
and power generation and other operating 
activities (scopes 1 and 2) decreased to 58 g 
co2e/kwh in 2020 against 65 g co2e/kwh in 
2019. the emissions per kwh decreased for the 
same reasons as mentioned above.
greenhouse gas emissions from our supply 
chain and sales activities (scope 3) decreased 
by 27 % to 25.3 million tonnes in 2020, driven 
by a 28 % decrease in gas sales.
safety
in 2020, we have had 77 total recordable 
injuries (tris), of which 58 injuries were related 
to our contractors’ employees. this was a 
decrease of 29 injuries compared to 2019, 
equalling a 27 % reduction. the number of 
hours worked was 21.5 million hours, 1 % 
more than in 2019. consequently, the total 
recordable injury rate (trir) over the last year 
decreased from 4.9 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2020.

financial ratios
return on capital employed (roce)
return on capital employed was 9.7 % in 2020 
against 10.6 % in 2019. the slight decrease 
was mainly attributable to the higher average 
capital employed, only partly offset by 
higher ebit.

business performance versus ifrs
business performance represents the underlying financial 
performance of the group in the reporting period, as results 
are adjusted for temporary fluctuations in the market value 
of contracts (including hedging transactions) relating to 
other periods. apart from this, there is no difference between 
business performance and ifrs results. read more in note 1.6.
 
the ebitda split between business units in the 
 comparative years 2016-2017 has not been updated  
to reflect that earnings from trading related to hedging 
of our power exposures and power portfolio optimisation 
activities in relation to offshore are presented in this 
business unit from 2018 (previously markets & bioenergy).

financial performance  
– group
revenue
revenue in q4 2020 decreased by 17 % relative  
to q4 2019 and amounted to dkk 15.6 billion. 
the lower revenue was mainly driven by 
significantly lower gas volumes sold and by 
construction agreements due to divestment  
of the transmission assets at race bank in  
q4 2019, partly offset by increase in our wind-
based power generation. 
ebitda
operating profit (ebitda) totalled dkk 5.0 billion  
compared to dkk 4.6 billion in q4 2019. the 
increase was mainly driven by ramp-up from 
new offshore and onshore wind farms in oper-
ation, which increased by 9 %, and higher wind 
speeds. in addition, the divested lng activities 
contributed positively year on year as the 
provision in q4 2019 was not repeated.
this was partly offset by lower earnings 
from trading related to hedging of our power 
exposure and power portfolio optimisation 
activities, which had high earnings in q4 2019, 
and from our gas portfolio where the net 
positive effect from revaluation of our gas at 
storage and storage hedges was higher in q4 
2019 than q4 2020. furthermore, ebitda from 
partnerships contributed negatively, due to 
minor updates regarding finalised construction 
projects. in addition, we had lower earnings 
from the divested danish power distribution, 
residential customer, and city light businesses. 
we also saw adverse covid-19 impacts on 
especially the uk power market due to a lower 
demand for electricity, which led to lower roc 
recycle prices and higher balancing tariffs 
(bsuos) from national grid. 
profit from continuing operations
profit from continuing operations increased by 
dkk 1.2 billion to dkk 2.2 billion. the increase 
was mainly due to the higher ebitda and 
impairment losses in q4 2019. 
cash flows from operating activities
cash flows from operating activities totalled 
dkk 6.8 billion in q4 2020 compared to  
dkk 4.8 billion in q4 2019. the increase of  
dkk 1.9 billion was mainly due to lower  
receivables at the end of 2020 compared to 
2019 and an early repayment related to our  
oil pipe facilities in q4 2020. 
investments and divestments 
gross investments amounted to dkk 8.6 billion 
in q4 2020. the main investments related to 
hornsea 2, greater changhua 1 & 2a, permian 
energy center, muscle shoals, western trail, 
and haystack.
cash flow from divestments was a cash 
outflow of dkk 1.5 billion and mainly related 
to the divestment of the lng activities.

– business units
offshore
power generation increased by 23 % relative 
to q4 2019. the increase was primarily due 
to ramp-up of generation from hornsea 1 and 
borssele 1 & 2. wind speeds amounted to a 
portfolio average of 10.4 m/s which was higher 
than in q4 2019, but slightly lower than nor-
mal wind speeds (10.5 m/s). availability ended 
at 94 %, which was 1 percentage point higher 
than in q4 2019.
revenue from offshore wind farms in  
operation increased by 8 % due to the above- 
mentioned ramp-up from new wind farms. 
revenue from power sales increased by  
dkk 1.2 billion due to higher power prices  
and higher volumes sold during the quarter.
revenue from construction agreements was 
limited in q4 2020 and mainly related to the 
construction of coastal virginia wind. in q4 
2019, it primarily related to the divestment of 
the transmission assets at race bank.
ebitda increased by dkk 0.1 billion relative  
to q4 2019 and amounted to dkk 4.1 billion.
ebitda from sites, o&m, and ppas amounted 
to dkk 5.0 billion, up 7 % compared to q4 
2019, driven by higher generation. the increase 
was partly offset by adverse covid-19  
impacts and lower earnings from trading 
related to hedging of our uk energy exposure, 
which had very high earnings in q4 2019.
ebitda from partnerships amounted to  
dkk -0.1 billion in q4 2020, mainly due 
to minor updates regarding finalised  
construction projects. 
onshore
power generation increased by 84 % relative 
to q4 2019. the increase was primarily due to 
new onshore wind farms in operation (sage 
draw, plum creek, and willow creek). wind 
speeds across the portfolio amounted to 8.0 m/s,  
which was higher than in the same period last 
year and a normal fourth quarter (7.7 m/s).
revenue from wind farms in operation in-
creased by 41 % due to the above-mentioned 
factors, partly offset by lower prices for the 
part of the portfolio not covered by ppas and 
a lower positive effect from derivate run-offs 
related to the acquisition of lce back in 2018. 
ebitda almost doubled to dkk 0.3 billion, 
primarily due to more wind farms in operation. 
markets & bioenergy
revenue decreased by 40 % and amounted 
to dkk 5.8 billion compared to q4 2019. the 
decrease was mainly due to significantly lower 
gas and power volumes sold.
ebitda totalled dkk 0.6 billion in q4 2020, 
which was dkk 0.2 billion higher than in q4 2019. 
ebitda from chp plants was in line with last 
year and amounted to dkk 0.3 billion.  
ebitda from gas markets & infrastructure 
decreased by dkk 0.2 billion and amounted to  
dkk 0.4 billion. the lower earnings were related 
to our gas portfolio where the net positive effect 
from revaluation of our gas at storage and stor-
age hedges was higher in q4 2019 than q4 2020.

introduction to offshore
Ørsted develops, constructs, owns, 
and operates offshore wind farms 
in the uk, germany, denmark, the 
netherlands, the us, taiwan, japan, 
and south korea. 
since we built the world’s first off-
shore wind farm in 1991, we have been 
pioneers of offshore wind, and with 
almost 30 years of experience, we 
have constructed more offshore wind 
farms than any other company.
we are market leader in all regions 
where we operate, with a total 
installed capacity of 7.6 gw. Ørsted 
has 28 offshore wind farms in operation 
that supply carbon-free power to more 
than 18 million people worldwide.
our integrated epc organisation has 
a strong track record of delivering 
projects on time and within budget 
and manages multiple large-scale 
offshore construction projects in 
parallel across the globe.
we are pursuing growth opportunities 
in renewable hydrogen in the uk and 
continental europe.
highlights 2020
operations
we commissioned borssele 1 & 2 and com-
pleted the construction of the demonstration 
project coastal virginia wind.
we have kept availability high across our 
operating portfolio during the covid-19 
pandemic.
business development
we installed our offshore wind turbine  
number 1,500.
we selected siemens gamesa renewable 
energy (sgre) as the preferred wind turbine 
supplier for our offshore wind farms borkum 
riffgrund 3 and gode wind 3.
we entered into the world’s largest renewables 
cppa with taiwan-based tsmc who will buy 
electricity from our offshore wind farm greater 
changhua 2b & 4.
we signed cppas with nestlé uk and amazon 
who will buy electricity from our offshore wind 
farms race bank and borkum riffgrund 3, 
respectively.

we entered into agreements to divest 25 % 
of ocean wind 1 to public service enterprise 
group (pseg) and 50 % of the project greater 
changhua 1 to cdpq and cathay pe.
we divested the transmission assets of our 
offshore wind farm walney extension. 
we established a joint venture with tepco  
to develop projects on the eastern coast  
of japan.
we have started developing a project in  
south korea with a capacity of up to 1.6 gw.
in renewable hydrogen, we took fid on  
the h2res project and secured funding  
for the oyster, gigastack, and westküste  
100 projects.
we launched three new renewable hydrogen 
projects: green fuels for denmark and our 
partnerships with yara and bp.
financial performance 2020 
power generation increased by 27 % relative 
to 2019, primarily due to ramp-up of gen-
eration from hornsea 1 and borssele 1 & 2 
(in total 1.6 twh) and higher wind speeds, 
mainly in q1 2020. this was partly offset by 
hours with negative prices from april to july 
due to a lower demand for electricity driven 
by the covid-19 pandemic, which led us to 
temporarily shut down generation. 
wind speeds were above last year and 
amounted to a portfolio average of 9.7 m/s, 
up from 9.2 m/s in 2019 and above a normal 
wind year (9.3 m/s), mainly due to very strong 
winds in q1 2020. availability was 94 %, 
which was 1 percentage point higher than  
in 2019.
revenue decreased by 14 % to dkk 34.5 billion. 
the decrease compared to 2019 was driven 
by revenue from construction agreements 
decreasing by dkk 9.0 billion, primarily due 
to high activity in 2019 related to the con-
struction of the offshore wind farm hornsea 1  
for partners and the divestment of the  
offshore transmission assets at race bank.  
in 2020, revenue from construction agree-
ments primarily related to the divestment  
of the offshore transmission assets at 
walney extension, construction of coastal 
virginia wind, and the finalisation of hornsea 1. 
 this was partly offset by revenue from off-
shore wind farms in operation increasing by 
17 % to dkk 19.4 billion, mainly due to higher 
generation. 
ebitda decreased by 3 % relative to 2019 
and amounted to dkk 14.8 billion. 
ebitda from sites, o&m, and ppas amounted 
to dkk 15.5 billion in 2020. the 13 % increase 
was primarily due to the above-mentioned 
ramp-up of hornsea 1 and borssele 1 & 2,  
receipt of cfds of another 400 mw of 
hornsea 1 from april, and higher wind speeds. 
the increase was partly offset by adverse 
covid-19 impacts on especially the uk 
power market due to a lower demand for 
electricity, which led to hours with negative 
prices from april to july, lower roc recycle 
prices, and higher balancing tariffs (bsuos) 
from national grid in 2020. furthermore, we 
saw lower earnings from trading related to 
hedging of our uk energy exposure, which

had very high earnings in 2019. excluding 
earnings previously reported as part of  
markets & bioenergy, ebitda from sites, 
o&m, and ppas increased by 17 %. 
ebitda from partnerships decreased  
by dkk 2.2 billion and amounted to  
dkk 1.6 billion. in 2020, our earnings  
from construction agreements mainly  
related to the lowered assumptions  
regarding the preferred bidder’s expected 
return requirement on the hornsea 1  
transmission asset, the construction of 
coastal virginia wind, and minor updates 
regarding finalised construction projects.  
in 2019, earnings from construction agree-
ments primarily concerned hornsea 1.  
ebitda from other activities, including project  
development, amounted to dkk -2.3 billion, 
in line with last year, and mainly related to 
our project development activities in the us. 
total expensed project development costs 
amounted to dkk 1.7 billion.
depreciation increased 11 % and amounted to 
dkk 6.1 billion. the increase was mainly due 
to completion of hornsea 1 and borssele 1 & 2.
cash flow from operating activities amounted 
to dkk 10.0 billion, which was dkk 0.7 billion 
higher than in 2019. the increase was primari-
ly due to less paid tax in 2020 relative to 
2019. this was partly offset by funds tied up 
in work in progress in 2020 versus a release 
in 2019. 
in 2020, we had a net cash outflow from 
work in progress of dkk 1.6 billion. this was 
mainly due to supplier payments related to 
the construction of hornsea 1 for partners 
and construction of the offshore transmis-
sion assets at hornsea 2, partly offset by 
the divestment of the offshore transmission 
assets at walney extension.
gross investments amounted to dkk 19.5 billion 
and mainly related to the construction of 
borssele 1 & 2, greater changhua 1 & 2a, 
hornsea 2, and ocean wind 1. 
cash flow from divestments in 2020 related 
to compensations paid under partnership 
agreements. in 2019, cash flow from divest-
ments related to the receipt of deferred 
proceeds from the 50 % farm-down of 
hornsea 1 in 2018 (dkk 1.7 billion) and to the 
strengthening of our strategic partnership 
with eversource, as they became a 50 % 
partner in our activities in the new england 
area in the us in 2019 (dkk 1.4 billion).
strategic and operational 
performance 2020
our offshore business delivered a strong 
performance in 2020, despite the challenges 
presented by the covid-19 pandemic. we 
commissioned our construction projects on 
schedule and within budget and achieved a 
park availability of 93.7 % across the portfolio, 
with borssele 1 & 2 delivering a park availabili-
ty of 97.4 % since may 2020.
in june, we reached a significant milestone 
with the installation of Ørsted’s offshore wind 
turbine number 1,500. we are set to more than 
double our offshore wind capacity in the com-
ing five years, and we are well on track to meet 
our strategic ambition of 15 gw of installed off-
shore wind capacity by 2025. with our current 
portfolio of projects under construction and 
awarded, we have nearly reached this target.
the uk
in the uk, we are building the offshore wind 
farm hornsea 2, which is our construction 
project most affected by covid-19. however, 
we do not expect this to delay commission-
ing, and we anticipate the project to stay 
within the budget set at fid. currently, we are 
installing foundations and array cables, and 
we expect the project to be completed in the 
first half of 2022.
in april, we signed a 15-year cppa with nestlé 
uk who will buy 31 mw of the output of our 
offshore wind farm race bank which has a to-
tal capacity of 573 mw. this is Ørsted’s largest, 
long-term, fixed-price cppa in the uk.
in december, we were granted consent to 
move into the final development phase of the 
offshore wind farm hornsea 3 by the uk secre-
tary of state for the department for business, 
energy & industrial strategy. the offshore wind 
farm has a potential capacity of more than  
2.4 gw and is adjacent to our offshore wind 
farms hornsea 1 and hornsea 2, off the east 
coast of the uk. with the consent granted,  
the offshore wind farm hornsea 3 will be  
able to enter the next uk auction round for  
a contract for difference (cfd).
finally, we divested the offshore transmission 
assets of walney extension to diamond 
transmission partners. the transmission assets 
were sold for gbp 447 million 100 % basis and 
included the onshore substation, the export 
cables, and the offshore substations. in the 
first half of 2021, we expect to divest the 
transmission assets of hornsea 1.

continental europe
in continental europe, we commissioned the 
offshore wind farm borssele 1 & 2 on time 
and on budget. borssele 1 & 2 is currently the 
largest offshore wind farm in the netherlands 
and added 752 mw to our installed capacity.
in addition, we signed a 10-year cppa with 
amazon who will offtake 250 mw of borkum 
riffgrund 3 offshore wind farm’s total capacity 
of 900 mw. this was our first offshore wind 
cppa with a global tech company and the larg-
est offshore wind cppa in europe. furthermore, 
we selected sgre as the preferred wind turbine 
supplier for our projects borkum riffgrund 3 
and gode wind 3. subject to final investment 
decisions, which we expect by the end of 2021, 
assuming the necessary consents are received, 
the projects will deploy sgre’s 11 mw wind 
turbine with a 200-metre rotor.
north america
in the us, we completed construction of the 
12 mw demonstration project coastal virginia 
wind where we were contracted for epc by 
dominion energy. the two-wind turbine off-
shore wind farm was the first to be federally 
permitted for installation in us waters.
in the north-eastern us, Ørsted and our part-
ners eversource and the state of connecticut 
reached a final agreement on a harbour de-
velopment plan for state pier in new london 
that will transform the pier into a world-class 
offshore wind centre.
in december, we signed an agreement with 
pseg which acquired 25 % of the offshore 
wind farm ocean wind 1. 
our offshore wind development pipeline in 
the us is progressing, but we are still waiting 
for the us bureau of ocean energy man-
agement (boem) to decide on key aspects 
related to the permitting process. as a result, 
the construction start dates for revolution 
wind, ocean wind 1, skipjack wind, and 
sunrise wind will likely be delayed beyond 
the expected 2023 or 2024. we have sched-
ule flexibility in all four projects and have 
been able to make good progress on other 
project milestones in the meantime. however, 
until there is a clear timeline from boem, we 
cannot modify the projects’ construction 
schedules. for our project south fork wind, we 
do not expect changes to the timeline or cod, 
currently scheduled for late 2023.
despite these permitting delays, we remain 
confident that we can deliver our us project 
portfolio with satisfactory returns. this is 
reinforced by the commitment of the incoming 
joe biden administration to rapid clean energy 
deployment as well as the us treasury’s 
recent announcement of a ten-year continuity 
safe harbour for offshore wind in addition to a 
new five-year, 30 % investment tax credit.
asia pacific
our construction activities at the offshore 
wind farm greater changhua 1 & 2a are 
moving forward as planned. currently, we are 
preparing for the installation of foundations 
which will commence in the first quarter of 
2021, and we expect commissioning in 2022. 
in december 2020, we entered into an agree-
ment to divest 50 % of greater changhua 1 
to canadian pension fund caisse de dépôt et 
placement du québec (cdpq) and taiwanese 
private equity fund cathay pe. the agreement 
marks a milestone in successfully applying our 
partnership farm-down model in asia pacific.
in july, we signed a cppa with taiwan-based 
tsmc, the world’s largest semiconductor 
foundry. tsmc will offtake the full production 
of our 920 mw offshore wind farm greater 
changhua 2b & 4, making it the largest-ever 
renewable energy cppa. the 20-year fixed-
price contract period will go into effect once 
greater changhua 2b & 4 reaches commercial 
operation, expected in 2025 or 2026, subject 
to grid availability and fid by Ørsted.
furthermore, we signed a 20-year lease with 
the port of taichung and a long-term vessel 
contract with ta san shang marine co. ltd 
for our offshore wind farms off the coast of 
changhua county, enabling construction of 
the first taiwan-flagged service operation 
vessel (sov). the sov will use the port of 
taichung as its base where Ørsted’s o&m 
facilities will also be located.
we also achieved significant progress in japan 
in 2020. we entered into an agreement with 
tepco to establish a joint venture company 
for offshore wind in japan, with the intention 
of working towards a joint bid in the first 
japanese auction, expectedly in the first half 
of 2021. 
in 2020, we achieved an important milestone 
by deploying four floating lidars and secur-
ing site exclusivity off the coast of incheon in 
south korea. we have begun to collect data 
for the site, an area with a potential capacity 
of 1.6 gw of offshore wind.
renewable hydrogen
we have made significant progress on our 
renewable hydrogen pipeline over the past  
18 months. in 2020 alone, we secured funding 
for two of the projects and launched three 
new projects together with different consortia. 
Ørsted’s renewable hydrogen pipeline now 
includes eight projects in denmark, germany, 
the uk, and the netherlands, of which half 
have received funding. 
in january 2021, Ørsted took fid on the 
demonstration project h2res which will 
produce renewable hydrogen for road transport 
from power generated by Ørsted’s two 3.6 mw 
offshore wind turbines at avedøre holme,  
denmark. h2res will have an electrolyser 
capacity of 2  mw and is expected to begin pro-
duction in late 2021, which will make it our first 
renewable hydrogen project to reach operation. 
also in january, the oyster project consortium, 
of which Ørsted is a member, was awarded five 
million euros from the european commission’s 
private-public partnership fuel cells and hydro-
gen 2 joint undertaking (fch2-ju) to develop a 
combined wind turbine and electrolyser system 
to produce renewable hydrogen offshore. the 
project is planned to run from 2021 to 2024, and 
we will lead the offshore deployment analysis 
and feasibility study and contribute to the 
design of the electrolyser system.
in august 2020, we secured funding for another 
two projects. phase two of the gigastack 
project received funds from the uk govern-
ment, enabling Ørsted and our partners to 
conduct a front-end engineering design (feed) 
study for a 100 mw electrolysis plant which 
will use electricity from the hornsea 2 offshore 
wind farm. the westküste 100 project was

also granted funding by the german federal 
ministry of economic affairs and energy as the 
first large-scale renewable hydrogen project 
within the reallabor (real-world laboratory) 
framework. westküste 100 is being developed 
by a cross-industry consortium of ten compa-
nies, including Ørsted, and seeks to decarbonise 
industrial processes, aviation, construction, and 
heating through renewable hydrogen. the first 
phase includes the construction of a 30 mw 
electrolysis plant and the development of a 
plan to scale the facility to 700 mw.
last year also saw the launch of three new 
renewable hydrogen projects.
in may, Ørsted and a group of leading  
danish companies partnered up to develop  
an industrial-scale facility in the greater  
copenhagen area to produce e-fuels for road, 
maritime, and air transport. the partnership, 
green fuels for denmark, brings together the 
demand and supply side of sustainable fuels 
under a vision of building one of the world’s 
largest electrolyser and e-fuels production 
facilities. Ørsted is part of the europa seaways 
consortium led by dfds, one of our partners 
in green fuels for denmark, which aims to 
develop the world’s first 100 % hydrogen- 
powered ferry for dfds’ oslo-copenhagen 
route. in november, we applied for support 
from the eu innovation fund to further  
progress this project.
in october, we launched a renewable hydro-
gen project in the netherlands together with 
yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company. 
the project will include a 100 mw electrolysis 
plant, producing renewable hydrogen from 
electricity from Ørsted’s offshore wind farms. 
the renewable hydrogen will replace fossil- 
based hydrogen in the production of ammonia 
at yara’s facility in sluiskil, with the potential 
of displacing more than 100,000 tonnes of 
carbon emissions per year. 
finally, Ørsted and bp agreed in november to 
develop a renewable hydrogen project at bp’s 
lingen refinery in emsland, germany.  
the project includes a 50 mw electrolysis 
system with the aim of replacing fossil-based 
hydrogen at the lingen refinery. this is the 
first step towards the project’s long-term 
ambition of building more than 500 mw of 
electrolyser capacity which could meet the 
refinery’s entire hydrogen demand and provide 
feedstock for future e-fuel production.

introduction to onshore
we develop, operate, and own onshore 
wind, solar pv, and storage projects 
across the southern and midwestern 
us, primarily in ercot, spp, and the 
south-east.
we own and operate seven onshore 
wind farms with a capacity of 1.7 gw.  
furthermore, we have 0.7 gw of 
onshore wind, 1.1 gwac of solar pv, and  
40 mwac of storage under construction. 
our established execution model 
allows us to manage key interfaces 
together with top-tier suppliers and 
contractors to deliver flexible energy 
solutions in response to the dynamic 
needs of the diverse north american 
customer base.  
highlights 2020
operations
we commissioned the 338 mw onshore wind 
farm sage draw in texas and expanded our 
operational footprint in the spp with the 
onshore wind farms plum creek (230 mw) and 
willow creek (103 mw), with all three projects 
completed on time and within budget.
business development
we received tax equity financing for our 
onshore wind farms sage draw, plum creek, 
and willow creek.
we signed 745 mw of long-term cppas with 
five different customers across four projects in 
both wind and solar.
we took fid on the 367 mw onshore wind 
project western trail and on the 430 mwac 
old 300 solar center.
we acquired and took fid on the 227 mwac 
solar farm muscle shoals and on the 298 mw 
onshore wind farm haystack.

financial performance 2020 
power generation amounted to 5.7 twh in 2020, 
which was a 64 % increase relative to 2019. 
the increase was due to new wind farms in 
operation (sage draw, plum creek, and willow 
creek) and a full year of generation from 
lockett. wind speeds amounted to a portfolio 
average of 7.6 m/s, up from 7.3 m/s in 2019 and 
slightly above a normal wind year (7.5 m/s).
revenue amounted to dkk 0.7 billion, up 9 %  
from 2019 due to higher generation, partly 
offset by lower prices for the part of the port-
folio not covered by ppas and a lower positive 
effect from derivate run-offs related to the 
acquisition of lce back in 2018. 
ebitda increased by 44 % and amounted to 
dkk 1.1 billion, driven by higher generation and 
related ptcs.  
 
cash flows from operating activities 
amounted to dkk 3.9 billion, which primarily 
comprised tax equity contributions from 
our partners at sage draw, plum creek, and 
willow creek. in 2019, it primarily comprised a 
tax equity contribution related to the onshore 
wind farm lockett.
gross investments amounted to dkk 6.6 billion  
in 2020 and was related to the construction 
of permian energy center, muscle shoals, 
western trail, sage draw, plum creek, willow 
creek, and haystack. 
divestments comprised the sale of oak solar 
farm in june 2020. in 2019, it primarily com-
prised a sale and lease-back arrangement for 
land related to permian energy center.
strategic and operational 
performance 2020
our onshore business made significant 
progress in 2020, taking fid on four projects 
and commissioning three projects on schedule 
and within budget, despite adverse covid-19 
impacts across the industry. operations 
remained stable throughout the year with high 
asset availability across our portfolio. a strong 
pipeline of onshore wind and solar pv projects 
is being developed and will be matured further 
in 2021, putting us well on track to achieve our 
strategic ambition of 5 gw of installed onshore 
wind and solar pv capacity by 2025.
onshore wind
in april, we commissioned the 338 mw onshore 
wind farm sage draw, our fifth in texas. with 
the completion of the 230 mw plum creek in 
nebraska in june and the 103 mw willow creek 
in south dakota in september, we expanded 
our footprint in the southwest power pool 
(spp), a market which plays an important  
part of our growth in north america. the  
commissioning of these wind farms brought  
our operating portfolio to a total of 1.7 gw.  
we have received tax equity financing for all 
three projects which are eligible for the full 
value of the renewable electricity production 
tax credit (ptc).
in addition, we supplemented our development 
activities with the acquisition of haystack,  
a 298 mw onshore wind project in nebraska. 
the project is adjacent to plum creek and will 
use the same interconnection infrastructure. 
haystack is expected to be commissioned in 
2021 and is thus expected to be eligible for the 
full value of the ptc.
ebitda increased  
by 44 %.

us competitive wholesale  
electricity markets
power sector governance in the us is complex 
and fragmented. approximately two thirds of 
the nation’s electricity load are served by seven 
competitive wholesale markets managed by 
regional transmission organisations (rtos). 
ercot and spp are two of these seven 
markets. the remaining load is served by 
traditional wholesale electricity markets where 
vertically integrated utilities act as regulated 
monopolies and are responsible for all activities 
related to the generation, transmission, and 
distribution of electricity. the south-east is a 
region with this market structure. 
we also strengthened our asset base in the  
electric reliability council of texas (ercot)  
by taking fid on western trail, our largest 
onshore wind project to date. located near  
our onshore wind farm lockett, the 367 mw  
project is expected to reach commercial  
operation in 2021.
in line with our strategy, we have transferred 
the asset management of willow springs,  
amazon, and tahoka to Ørsted’s asset man-
agement team. since lockett was completed, 
asset management has been performed 
inhouse for all new onshore wind projects and 
will be going forward. this improves our ability 
to optimise operational performance across 
the portfolio. 
solar pv
2020 also saw the continued expansion of our 
solar pv portfolio with the acquisition of and 
final investment decision on muscle shoals, 
our 227 mwac solar pv project in alabama. 
muscle shoals is fully contracted under a long-
term power purchase agreement with the 
tennessee value authority (tva), and we have 
secured tax equity financing for the project. 
the solar farm is expected to be operational in 
2021 and will thus be eligible for the full value 
of the business energy investment tax credit 
(itc). muscle shoals is our first project in the 
south east where we have a strong pipeline of 
projects under development.
in november, we took fid on the old 300 
solar center located near houston, texas.  
the 430 mwac project is expected to be 
commissioned in 2022 and will thus be eligible 
for the full value of the itc.
as our strategic focus being large-scale solar 
farms, we divested the 10 mwac solar farm 
oak solar in june.

introduction to markets & bioenergy
we serve as an efficient route-to- 
market for both Ørsted and third 
parties, by providing balancing services 
for renewable generation portfolios 
and by selling green certificates to the 
market. in doing so, we manage large 
volumes of power contracts that we 
optimise by leveraging the size of our 
combined portfolio and our origination 
and trading capabilities.
we spearhead market risk manage-
ment for our generation assets and 
contracts by trading power, green 
certificates, and other commodities.
we provide around one quarter of 
denmark’s district heating and around 
one third of denmark’s thermal power 
through our chp plants, making our 
chp business a leading provider of 
heat, power, and ancillary services in 
denmark. 
we ensure efficient operations and 
maximise the commercial value of our 
legacy gas portfolio. 
we manage renescience, our patented 
waste-to-energy technology.

operations
our us trading office began commercial opera-
tions, supporting our us renewables portfolio.
we achieved our target of sourcing 100 % 
third-party certified sustainable biomass for 
our biomass-fuelled chp plants.
we increased our provision of ancillary servic-
es vital to the stable operation of the danish 
grid and, in a first for denmark, began offering 
some of these services as green products.
we inaugurated the sustainable biomass-fired 
unit 6 of our asnæs power station in august.
we began commercial operations at our 
renescience plant in northwich, uk, marking 
a major milestone for our development of this 
technology.
we contributed to denmark’s public health 
response to the covid-19 outbreak by helping 
restart and operate our former bioethanol plant 
in kalundborg for the emergency production of 
ethanol for disinfectants.

business development
we won significant new third-party power 
balancing contracts with renewable assets  
in the uk and the netherlands.
we entered into an agreement to resell some 
of the natural gas Ørsted receives under our 
legacy gas purchasing contracts to pgnig 
supply and trading (pst).
we completed the divestment of our  
power distribution, residential, and city light  
businesses, our lng activities, and our danish 
energy efficiency consulting business.
we entered into an agreement to divest  
our uk b2b gas and power portfolios to total 
gas & power.
financial performance 2020
revenue decreased by 35 % compared to 
2019 and amounted to dkk 21.4 billion. the 
decrease was mainly driven by a significant 
drop in average gas and power prices relative 
to last year as well as lower gas and power 
volumes sold. 
thermal power generation amounted to  
4.4 twh, a 4 % decrease compared to last year 
due to slightly warmer weather and less favour-
able market conditions for power generation, 
partly offset by a higher volume from ancillary 
services. heat generation amounted to 6.7 twh, 
down 20 % compared to last year, mainly due to 
a warm first quarter in 2020. 
ebitda amounted to dkk 2.1 billion compared 
to dkk 1.5 billion in 2019. 
ebitda from chp plants totalled dkk 1.1 billion 
in 2020, a slight decrease compared to last 
year. the decrease was mainly due to lower 
thermal heat and power generation and lower 
power spreads as well as the reversal of a pro-
vision in 2019 of dkk 0.3 billion following the 
acquittal in the elsam case. this was partly 
offset by higher earnings from sale of ancillary 
services in 2020. 
ebitda from gas markets & infrastructure 
amounted to dkk 0.4 billion, in line with last 
year. higher earnings from revaluation of our 
gas at storage and a positive impact from stor-
age hedges was offset by lower transported 
and sold volumes due to the shutdown of the 
tyra gas field from late 2019 until 2023 as well 
as a provision for bad debt in our b2b business 
to cover the extraordinary covid-19-related 
default risks among our customers. 
ebitda from lng amounted to dkk 0 billion 
compared to a loss of dkk 1.0 billion in 2019. 
due to the agreement to divest our lng activ-
ities in 2019, we made provisions to offset the 
negative earnings until the divestment in 2020. 
ebitda from our danish power distribution, 
residential customer, and city light businesses 
amounted to dkk 0.9 billion in 2020 versus 
dkk 1.3 billion in 2019. as a result of the divest-
ment in august, earnings in 2020 only included 
eight months of operations. 
we had no impairment losses in 2020, whereas 
impairment losses amounted to dkk 0.5 billion 
in 2019 and were related to a write-down of 
our renescience plant in the uk, mainly due to 
delayed commissioning, increased capex, and 
changed cost and price estimates. 
ebitda increased  
by 43 %.

cash flow from operating activities amounted 
to dkk 2.9 billion in 2020. the increase of  
dkk 1.6 billion was mainly due to lower paid 
taxes (receipt of on account taxes in 2020 
versus payment of taxes on account in 2019), 
lower trade receivables due to lower revenue, 
an early repayment related to our oil pipe 
facilities, and changes in the value of deriva-
tives. this was partly offset by a change in the 
value of gas at storage.  
gross investments amounted to dkk 0.7 billion  
in 2020 and were mainly related to main-
tenance of the power distribution grid and 
concluding works related to the bioconversion 
of asnæs power station up until inauguration 
in august. 
cash flow from divestments amounted to  
dkk 19.1 billion in 2020, of which the 
above-mentioned divestment of our danish 
power distribution, residential customer,  
and city light businesses contributed with 
proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion. this was partly 
offset by a cash outflow in connection with  
the divestment of the lng activities of  
dkk 1.5 billion. 
strategic and operational  
performance 2020
in 2020, we made great strides in the devel-
opment of our core activities, while continuing 
to streamline markets & bioenergy through 
divestments.
provide and develop a  
competitive route-to-market
having consistently reduced balancing 
costs over the last few years, we provide an 
increasingly efficient route-to-market for 
Ørsted’s generation portfolio. in 2020, with 
the addition of our asset borssele 1, we grew 
the portfolio of Ørsted projects under our 
management to 5.6 gw.
our balancing services are also an increasingly 
competitive option for third-party renewable 
operators. we currently provide balancing 
services for nearly 600 mw of third-party ca-
pacity, and in 2020, we won a major contract 
with the dogger bank wind farm, which is 
currently under construction. we will provide 
balancing for 40 % of the volume from  
phases a and b of this project, amounting to  
960 mw when fully completed. we also made  
successful balancing-service bids for onshore 
third-party renewable projects in the  
netherlands and denmark.
spearhead market risk management
our market trading activities had another 
strong year in 2020, stemming from the 
successful hedging and trading of our energy 
exposures. we have especially benefitted 
from the flexibility embedded in the contract 
structures of our north-western european 
energy portfolio which we leverage to protect 
and extract value for Ørsted.
as part of our digital strategy for short-term 
trading, we rolled out a smart bidding tool 
which uses a parametric algorithm to auto-
matically trade volumes in small increments 
and improve the speed of our trade execution. 
the tool enhances our ability to capture 
stronger market prices in the uk, germany, 
and the netherlands.
our chicago-based us trading organisation 
began commercial operations in early 2020, 
managing market risk for our us portfolio. 
the organisation contributes to our ongoing 
capacity build-out in the us by providing the 
same risk management and route-to-market 
services as for our european portfolio.
optimise and decarbonise our chp plants
2020 was a milestone year for our biomass 
conversion programme. the crown prince of 
denmark inaugurated the sustainable bio-
mass-fired unit 6 of our asnæs power station 
in august, marking the completion of our con-
version programme and another step towards 
the full decarbonisation of our chp operations 
in denmark. furthermore, we reached our 
target of sourcing 100 % of our biomass from 
third-party certified sustainable suppliers. in 
2020, denmark passed new biomass sustain-
ability legislation that is in line with the strict 
standards we already require from our biomass 
suppliers on replanting of trees, protection of 
forest biodiversity, and supply chain emissions.
in addition, we are exploring the potential 
of carbon capture technology at our bio-
mass-fired chp plants. carbon captured from 
biomass combustion is biogenic and can 
contribute to negative emissions when stored 
permanently, or it can be used as a feedstock 
to produce carbon-neutral products.
this year saw a temporary increase in our 
use of coal as a proportion of our overall fuel 
inputs, stemming from statutory requirements 
as part of our provision of ancillary services to 
the danish power system. our commitment to 
phase out coal by 2023 remains unchanged.
by combining our dispatchable chp capacity 
with our offshore wind portfolio in denmark, 
we were for the first time able to offer some 
of our ancillary services as green products. 
our offshore wind farm horns rev 2 was the 
first intermittent renewable source to qualify 
for providing automatic frequency restoration 
reserve (afrr) services in denmark. 
optimise our gas portfolio
with the danish undergrund consortium- 
owned tyra gas field in the north sea shut 
down for redevelopment until june 2023, we 
have ensured continuous supply for our danish 
and swedish gas customers by importing 
piped volumes from germany. when tyra 
reopens, and as domestic biogas production 
increases, the dependence on imported gas to 
denmark will decrease.
we run our business on an end-to-end val-
ue chain thinking. all activities and earn-
ings that relate to offshore and onshore 
are reported in these segments, even if 
the daily activities are performed on be-
half of the group in markets & bioenergy. 
therefore, earnings from trading related 
to hedging of our power exposures and 
power portfolio optimisation activities 
in relation to offshore and onshore are 
presented in these business units. 
in 2020, ebitda of dkk 236 million 
and dkk 48 million were transferred 
to offshore and onshore, respectively 
(dkk 725 million and dkk -18 million, 
respectively, in 2019).

in october 2020, we entered into a contract 
with the polish natural gas company pst to  
sell approx. 70 twh of natural gas over the  
period from 2023 to 2028. under the agree-
ment, Ørsted will resell some of the natural  
gas received from the danish north sea as  
part of our legacy gas purchasing contracts. 
the agreement reduces our exposure to  
long-term financial risk in our gas portfolio  
and supports poland’s decarbonisation agenda. 
poland aims to reduce the share of coal in its 
energy mix from 75 % today to 11-28 % by  
2040 by substituting it with renewables  
and natural gas.
we developed and launched a first-of-its-kind 
trading contract for renewable hydrogen 
certificates in the uk. specifically targeting 
the decarbonisation of the transport sector, 
this contract builds on our other partnerships 
on renewable hydrogen technology.
commercialise renescience
in october, we successfully completed the final 
performance tests and began commercial op-
erations at our renescience plant in northwich, 
the uk. the technology has the potential to 
significantly increase recycling rates of unsort-
ed household waste and reduce the volumes 
of waste sent to landfills or incineration. the 
commissioning of our northwich plant marks 
a major milestone, and we continue to explore 
the broader commercial potential of this 
technology. 
deliver on divestments
in 2020, we continued streamlining markets 
& bioenergy to focus on our growth platform. 
at the end of july, we divested our energy 
efficiency consulting business to ebas. in 
august, we completed the divestment of our 
danish power distribution, residential custom-
er, and city light businesses to seas-nve (now 
andel), and in december, we completed the 
divestment of our lng business to glencore. 
finally, we signed an agreement with total 
gas & power in september to divest our uk 
b2b gas and power portfolios. this transaction 
is expected to close in q1 2021.

taiwan has set ambitious targets for 
renewable energy. it is an important 
market for Ørsted. we reached a 
significant milestone in the country 
in 2020 when we signed the world’s 
largest-ever renewable energy  
corporate power purchase agreement. 
the agreement, which will provide 
tsmc, a taiwanese semiconductor 
manufacturing company, with green 
power for 20 years, underlines our 
pioneering role in the development  
of renewable energy in the  asia- 
pacific region.

thomas thune andersen
chairman
message from the chairman
we have designed our corporate governance 
model to support transparency and com-
pliance with regulation and best practice 
and to support business conduct and 
decision-making that is agile, efficient, and 
of high quality. our corporate governance 
is supported by a company culture based 
on high ethical standards and clear values 
throughout the organisation. it is built on 
three pillars that are embedded throughout 
the organisation, from the board to the 
individual employee.
first, we have designed our management 
structure to enable the right decision-making 
power in the right places throughout the 
organisation. therefore, we have defined 
clear roles, responsibilities, and key perfor-
mance indicators at all levels of the organi-
sation. in the board, we oversee the overall 
strategic decision-making in Ørsted, while 
the executive board undertakes the day-to-
day management of the company through 
the executive committee. our management 
team of approx. 20 senior executives drives 
the strategic execution of our business plans 
and promotes a common culture across the 
company, supported by our wider manage-
ment system of more than 1,000 managers 
across the company. each employee across 
the company has clear targets for how to 
contribute, including personal development 
targets and success criteria that link back to 
our business strategy.
second, we want to ensure the right com-
petences to successfully drive our business 
forward. we spend considerable amounts of 
time assessing and ensuring that we have the 
right competences at executive and board 
levels and attach importance to the members 
having extensive knowledge and experience 
covering a wide range of geographies and 
fields of expertise. climate action is particu-
larly fundamental to our business strategy of 
deploying renewable energy, so climate- 
related issues are an integral part of board 
and executive agendas. therefore, a key set 
of competences for the board includes envi-
ronment, social, and governance (esg) as this 
is fundamental for Ørsted’s business. for the 
executive board, we have also integrated esg 
into their individual incentive schemes. 
to reinforce diversity, we have equal gender 
representation in the board as defined by 
danish law, and throughout the organisation, 
we continuously work to promote diversity 
through the representation of different nation-
alities, genders, age distribution, and mindsets. 
individual development is a key driver in 
helping to ensure that we have the right 
competences in place. that is why we have 
built a systematic approach to and culture 
of continuous development. our approach 
warrants personal development, enables nu-
anced, constructive feedback, and enhances 
growth opportunities for individuals at all 
levels of the organisation. 
third, we want to maintain and further cul-
tivate a company culture based on integrity. 
integrity is our root and is the first of our five 
guiding principles. our culture and focus on 
integrity are also supported by our policy on 
good business conduct and a set of internal 
controls aimed at protecting Ørsted’s integrity. 
we have clear policies, procedures, and guide-
lines in place to prevent and address potential 
violations of our policy on good business con-
duct. we have an internal audit function and 
a whistle-blower scheme where internal and 
external stakeholders can easily and anony-
mously report concerns about inappropriate 
and illegal conduct in the company through 
an independent third party.
in the board of directors, we firmly believe that good 
corporate governance and high standards of integrity 
are fundamental as we continue to develop Ørsted 
as one of the global leaders in renewable energy.  
we keep our governance principles under 
regular review, and we promote compliance 
internally and with our business partners 
through our code of conduct and due 
diligence, training, and reporting of miscon-
duct to support the highest levels of good 
governance and integrity. 
on the following pages, you can read more 
about our corporate governance, and how 
we work with it. i look forward to continuing 
serving the board in the coming year.

the board of directors appoints the executive 
board, consisting of the ceo and cfo who 
undertake the day-to-day management of 
Ørsted through the executive committee. 
none of our executives are members of the 
board of directors. a management team con-
sisting of the executive committee and senior 
vice presidents drives strategic development 
and cultural alignment across the company. 
shareholders and general meeting
Ørsted is a publicly listed company with the 
danish state as majority shareholder with 
50.1 % ownership. the danish state exercises 
its ownership interest in Ørsted in accordance 
with the ordinary governance set-up in danish 
companies where the board of directors and 
the executive board are responsible for the 
management of the company. the danish 
state exercises its interest at the general 
meeting, including through the appointment 
of professional board members. the danish 
state’s ownership policy is available here 
(only in danish): fm.dk/udgivelser/2015/april/
statens-ejerskabspolitik/.
all our shareholders may exercise their rights 
and vote at the general meeting through a 
one-share-one-vote principle. the general 
meeting adopts decisions, such as the election 
of the board of directors and the auditor, in 
accordance with the standard danish rules. 
due to our majority ownership by the danish 
state, we have a bespoke quorum require-
ment, as proposals to amend the articles of 
association or dissolve the company require 
that the danish state participates in the 
 general meeting and supports the proposals.
board of directors  
each year at the annual general meeting, the 
shareholders elect six to eight board  members. 
in addition, our employees may elect members 
corresponding to half of the board members 
elected by the general meeting  pursuant to 
danish mandatory rules.  employee elections 
are held every four years.
for the time being, our board of directors 
comprises nine members, six members elected 
by the general meeting and three members 
elected by the employees.
the board of directors is responsible for the 
overall management of the company. the 
board of directors lays down the company’s 
strategy and makes decisions concerning ma-
jor investments and divestments, the capital 
base, key policies, control and audit matters, 
risk management, and significant operational 
issues. you can see the most important tasks 
in 2020 on the next page.
the board monitors and oversees progress 
related to Ørsted’s climate change strategy, 
including our ambitious net-zero carbon reduc-
tion targets for scope 1-3 emissions. we rou-
tinely integrate climate change considerations 
when setting our strategic direction, reviewing 
sustainability risks, setting performance 
objectives, deciding on our capital allocation, 
and when approving and overseeing major 
investments, acquisitions, and divestments.
the board of directors conducted its annual 
board evaluation in november 2020. the basis 
for the evaluation was a questionnaire that the 
individual members of the board of directors 
and executive committee had been asked to 
complete, and individual interviews conducted 
by an external advisor. at the evaluation, all 
members of the board of directors and the 
executive board expressed that the board is 
strong, aligned, well-functioning, and possesses 
the right competencies to govern the company. 
moreover, all members found board discussions 
inclusive and open to the viewpoints of all 
members. as the company expands to new 
markets and technologies, there are some devel-
opment areas that need to be further explored 
and evaluated, e.g. ensuring that the board of 
directors has the right competency coverage 
in the long-term and prioritizing succession as a 
more important part of the board agenda.
the board of directors has prepared an 
overview of the competences required on the 
board. the list of required competences can be 
found at orsted.com/competences-overview.
our overall and strategic management of the 
company is anchored in a board of independent non-
executive directors appointed by the shareholders.

committees of the board of directors
the board of directors has appointed two
committees from among its members: an
audit & risk committee and a nomination &
remuneration committee which assist the
board of directors within selected areas.
audit & risk committee 
dieter wemmer (chairman), jørgen kildahl, 
and peter korsholm are the members of the 
audit & risk committee.
the committee assists the board of directors 
in overseeing the financial and esg reporting 
process (including key accounting estimates and 
judgements), the liquidity and capital structure 
development, financial and business-related 
risks, compliance with statutory and other 
requirements from public authorities, internal 
controls as well as it security in operational and 
administrative areas as well as cybersecurity.
moreover, the committee approves the frame-
work governing the work of the company’s 
external and internal auditors (including limits 
for non-audit services), evaluates the external 
auditors’ independence and qualifications, and 
monitors the company’s whistle-blower scheme.
in 2020, the committee approved an update 
of the internal control and wacc frameworks. 
the committee also reviewed the financial 
impact of covid-19 and the divestments of 
our danish power distribution, residential cus-
tomer, and city light businesses, and our lng 
activities. furthermore, it assessed the claim 
made by the danish tax agency requiring 
danish taxation of our british offshore wind 
farms walney extension and hornsea 1, and it 
reviewed the progress in it security. 
our internal audit function reports to the 
audit & risk committee and is independent 
of our administrative management structures. 
internal audit enhances and protects the 
organisational value by providing risk-based 
and objective assurance, advice, and insight. 
the focus for internal audit is auditing and 
advising on our core processes, governance, 
risk management, control processes, and it 
security.
the chairman of the audit & risk committee 
is responsible for managing our whistle-blower 
scheme. internal audit receives and handles 
any reports submitted. our employees and 
other associates may report serious offences, 
such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other 
inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistle-
blower scheme or through our management 
system. in 2020, four substantiated cases 
of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour 
were reported through our whistle-blower 
scheme. three cases concerned violation 
of good business conduct policies and one 
case concerned violation of administrative 
procedures. the four cases had  consequences 
for the individuals involved. none of the 
reported cases were critical to our business 
and caused no adjustments to our financial 
results. whistle-blower cases are taken very 
seriously, and we continuously enhance the 
awareness of good business conduct, e.g. 
through education as well as awareness 
campaigns, to minimise future similar cases.

nomination & remuneration committee
thomas thune andersen (chairman), lene 
skole, and lynda armstrong are the members 
of the nomination & remuneration committee.
the committee assists the board of directors in 
matters regarding the composition, remunera-
tion, and performance of the board of directors 
and the executive committee.
in 2020, the committee discussed, among other 
matters, our increasing global footprint and 
the impact on our pay mix. it was decided to 
introduce a higher level of variance within pay-
mix on different markets to be more in line with 
local market terms.
following the implementation of the eu 
shareholder rights directive ii in danish leg-
islation, the committee reviewed the remu-
neration policy for the board of directors and 
the executive board, and an updated version 
of the remuneration policy was subsequently 
approved by the annual general meeting in 
march 2020. the committee also spent time 
on the separate 2019 remuneration report 
covering the board of directors and the 
executive board as the company decided 
to reflect the new regulatory requirements, 
which apply from 2020, already in the 2019 
reporting.
additionally, the committee has reviewed 
changes in the peer group used for benchmark-
ing Ørsted’s relative tsr in the share-based 
long-term incentive programme. the changes 
were made to better match Ørsted’s current 
global footprint and business mix and to ad-
dress the changes in the peer group’s business 
mix and footprint.
finally, the committee has been engaged in 
the recruitment of mads nipper as new ceo 
as of 1 january 2021, following henrik poulsen’s 
resignation in june 2020.

risk and risk management
we are exposed to several risks in connection 
with our business activities. in addition to 
operational, business, and environmental risks, 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, 
inflation, exchange rates, and commodity 
prices as well as credit and insurance risks. the 
purpose of our risk management is to identify 
and quantify our risks and decide how best 
to manage and mitigate them. we assess the 
extent to which individual risks are acceptable 
or perhaps even desirable as well as the extent 
to which these risks can be reduced to ensure 
an optimum balance between risk and return.
a large part of our earnings is generated from 
offshore wind, with continental europe and the 
uk being the key contributors. however, with 
our expansions into the us and asia pacific,  
our future earnings will be spread across 
more geographical regions and technologies. 
therefore, political and other macroeconomic 
factors play an important role in our risk 
management. when we invest in new assets 
and activities or divest assets, the consolidat-
ed risks associated with our portfolio changes. 
therefore, we assess the impact of a given 
decision on the portfolio upfront.
 
we work systematically with risks. all business 
units and selected staff functions identify and 
prioritise business risks. an assessment is made 
of the potential financial impact of individual 
risks, and whether they are of a short-term 
(0-2 years), medium-term (2-5 years), long-term 
(5+ years), or of recurring nature. all our risks 
are then consolidated and evaluated at group 
level. the ultimate responsibility for all the 
individual risks rests with a member of the 
executive committee. as for business risks, 
similar processes are in place for identifying 
and prioritising risks related to sustainability 
and legal compliance.
the top five business risks identified during 
2020 are shown to the right where they are 
illustrated based on their potential impact 
(post-risk mitigation) on our value and credit 
metrics over the next years. you can read 
more about these risks on the following pages.
brexit is not in itself part of our top five busi-
ness risks as we do not believe the uk leaving 
the eu will result in fundamental changes to 
the uk’s energy policy. announcements by the 
uk government show that the uk is commit-
ted to a clean, renewable energy future, and 
offshore wind is the backbone of this green 
vision. as we have entered 2021 with a signed 
brexit agreement, the immediate short-term 
risk of a sharp gbp depreciation has vanished. 
however, given the uncertainty surrounding 
the remaining negotiations, gbp weakness 
cannot be ruled out over the coming years. 
such a scenario could result in lower uk  
power prices than currently observed, but the 
government-introduced carbon price floor 
(cpf) will prevent a dramatic decline. these  
effects are embedded in our second-largest 
risk in our top five business risks, namely 
currencies and commodity prices.

risks are a natural and integral part of our business 
activities, and risk diversification is an important part of 
Ørsted’s strategy. our risk profile changes continuously. 
our aim is to mitigate our risks and reduce them to 
an acceptable level through risk management.

the risks related to sustainability and legal 
compliance are assessed using different pa-
rameters. hence, we do not show a consolidat-
ed picture of our combined risks.
we are also exposed to risks which have a 
very small probability of occurring, but which 
could potentially impact our finances and/or 
reputation substantially. these risks include, 
but are not limited to:
–  fatal injuries
–  1,000-year storms, hurricanes, typhoons, 
or earthquakes, especially in taiwan, 
which may lead to the loss of offshore and 
onshore wind farms
–  broken pipes at the nybro gas treatment 
plant in denmark which may lead to per-
sonal injury and damage to the environment
–  breakdowns at power plants that may lead 
to personal injury and loss of assets.
after risk-reducing measures are implemented, 
the executive committee assess whether the 
level of each risk is appropriate, or if it is slightly 
or significantly higher than the desired level. if 
the risk level is still too high, further risk-reducing 
measures are initiated to the extent possible.
climate-related risks
we address climate-related risks and opportu-
nities as an integral part of our daily business, 
and we report as recommended by the task 
force on climate-related financial disclosures 
(tcfd). these risks and opportunities are directly 
linked to our green vision and strategy. we seek 
to exploit climate-related opportunities through 
our development and construction of renewable 
generation capacity and adjacent sustainable 
activities. at the same time, we seek to reduce 
both our transitional and physical climate-
related risks in the short, medium, and long 
term. we do that by, among other things:
–  encouraging regulators and other public 
authorities to set ambitious targets for the 
build-out of renewable capacity and regula-
tory frameworks which support this 
–  continuously working to improve the future 
competitiveness of green technologies, i.e. 
lowering the levelised cost of electricity 
(lcoe)
–  assessing acute and chronic weather 
development; especially wind speeds and 
patterns, but also the temperature and 
precipitation levels in general
–  taking extreme weather conditions and 
other relevant factors into account when 
we design and construct our assets.
in that way, we seek to avoid ending up with 
stranded assets or assets and activities with 
a significantly lower value than originally 
expected.
when we prepare business cases for invest-
ment in new assets or activities, we take 
climate-related risks and opportunities into 
account by assessing the expected changes in 
the green technology mix. on this basis, we as-
sess the expected derived impact on input and 
output prices of energy, including the price 
development of components and services to 
be used for the construction of these assets as 
part of our lcoe analysis. 
a description of the most significant sustain-
ability risks can be found in our sustainability 
report. 
in 2019, we concluded a climate scenario 
analysis, assessing the resilience of our 
offshore business in two potential scenarios 
of climate change: a 1.5-2 °c and 3-4 °c 
temperature rise by 2100, respectively. the 
study was conducted through research, 
interviews, and workshops and concluded 
that our offshore business is well positioned to 
manage climate-related risks of both transi-
tional and physical nature. please refer to our 
cdp climate change disclosure for detailed 
descriptions here.
development in risks in 2020
this year, cybersecurity risks have been ele-
vated into our top five business risks, which 
means that construction risks have been 
excluded as a top risk for Ørsted. additionally, 
we have seen relative changes between the 
risks compared to last year’s annual report.
inflation and interest rates are considered 
our number one risk. we have carved out 
currencies from inflation and interest rates 
and incorporated it into our second-largest 
risk alongside commodity prices. the change 
is motivated by the overlapping mitigation 
efforts in hedging currency and commodity 
price risks. 
as the offshore market continues to grow 
and mature, an increasing number of players 
have entered the market of renewable ener-
gy generation. this has put pressure on prices 
in auctions and tenders in excess of what 
can be explained by the lcoe development. 
therefore, the risk has been elevated to our 
third-largest risk.
we continue to see increased development 
and construction risks in our us offshore 
projects compared to projects in more ma-
ture markets. in 2020, the continued delays 
in the permitting process from the bureau of 
energy management (boem), the us federal 
regulator, had an adverse impact on our 
portfolio. the risk is our fourth-largest.
in this year’s annual report, cybersecurity 
risks have entered our top five business risks. 
major cyberattacks are becoming more 
frequent, and we see an increasing number 
of cybercriminals looking to financially harm 
companies. as we grow into an ever-larger 
global renewable energy player, the threat of 
cyberattacks has increased. 
covid-19
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has affected 
lives, livelihoods, and economies around the 
world. at Ørsted, we activated our corporate 
crisis management organisation (ccmo) on  
12 march 2020 to closely monitor develop-
ments in the pandemic, enabling us to  
respond in a timely manner, thereby mini-
mising health and safety risks and ensuring 
business continuity. 
despite an agile pandemic response system, 
we have seen adverse impacts of the pan-
demic, mainly related to our supply chain and 
the power prices in the markets where we 
operate. covid-19-related lockdowns during 
spring and summer led to risks of delays at 
some of our offshore construction sites. due to 
our experience and the flexibility in our time-
lines, we have been able to progress on some 
other project milestones. therefore, we assess 
the probability of covid-19-related risks 
materialising and causing significant negative 
impact on Ørsted to be low.
description
to a large extent, our medium- to long-term 
earnings can be expected to follow the 
development in consumer and market prices, 
thereby protecting the real value of our assets 
and equity. however, fixed nominal subsidies 
from wind assets in denmark, germany, and 
the netherlands and fixed-price power pur-
chase agreements (ppas) from assets in the us 
and taiwan are exceptions to this, as are fixed 
nominal cash flows related to debt. we are ex-
posed to inflation risks in these markets where 
an increase in inflation will adversely impact 
the expected real value of the revenue.
our farm-down model of funding future 
wind farms through divestments is exposed 
to interest rate risks as wind assets are more 
attractive to buyers when interest rates are 
low compared to other financial assets with 
similar risk profiles.
potential impact
fluctuations in interest rates and inflation may 
adversely impact our earnings and farm-down 
model, thereby affecting the value of our 
assets.
mitigating actions
our inflation and interest rate exposures are 
managed by matching assets and liabilities in 
the same currency and with similar payment 
structures. hence, our european fixed nominal 
subsidies are offset by eur-denominated 
fixed-rate debt. the risks that arise from taiwan 
and us onshore and offshore projects can be 
reduced by obtaining matching-duration fixed-
rate debt denominated in the same currency as 
the revenue.
description 
our main currency exposure relates to gbp due 
to our substantial investments in offshore wind 
farms in the uk. however, our recent interna-
tional expansion has increased our usd and 
ntd exposure.
we are primarily exposed to power price risks 
from the sale of our wind-based power genera-
tion in the us, the uk, and denmark. in addition, 
we are exposed to risks caused by differences in 
local node prices and market hub prices in our 
onshore business, which impact the realised 
revenue generation. 
to a lesser extent, we are exposed to oil and 
gas price risks related to sourcing contracts for 
gas to oil-indexed prices as well as the sale of 
gas at fixed prices. finally, power generation 
from our chp plants entails an exposure to 
power prices and fuel prices. as the green 
transformation in Ørsted advances, the main 
fuel at our chp plants is biomass. the market 
for biomass has less liquidity than e.g. gas and 
coal, adding a risk to which we are exposed. 
potential impact
fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity 
prices may adversely impact our earnings.
mitigating actions
we hedge currencies and commodity prices for 
up to five years, and in some cases longer, to 
reduce cash flow fluctuations. we hedge more 
of the risk in the first years and less in the later 
years. this is due to decreasing market liquidity 
and increasing uncertainty about generated 
volumes. 
on the medium- to long-term horizon, the 
currency risk is managed by matching income 
and liabilities in the same currencies. for our 
usd and ntd exposures from new markets, we 
do not have an existing portfolio against which 
we can net construction payments. therefore, 
we seek to hedge the price risk in the near term, 
while simultaneously hedging a similar, but 
opposite, exposure in the longer term. 
as an alternative to hedging power, we seek to 
enter into long-term corporate power purchase 
agreements (cppas), under which we sell power 
from our renewable assets. cppas or hedges 
with a duration of 10-15 years are often a pre-
requisite for obtaining tax equity partnerships 
in the us. in addition, cppas will be a means to 
mitigate merchant risk for offshore wind farms 
to be built without subsidies. our awarded off-
shore wind farms situated off the us east coast 
are guaranteed a fixed price for a period of 
approximately 20 years and thus, no additional 
merchant risk has been introduced.
inflation and interest rates
currencies and commodity prices
description 
as the offshore industry has become more 
mature and established, competition has 
increased with new market players entering. 
the industry is becoming more global, and 
diversification of developers is increasing. we 
expect a diversified competitive landscape 
going forward, including oil majors, utilities, 
institutional investors, and regional developers. 
in offshore wind, the competitive auction and 
tender mechanics being implemented across 
the various regions and markets are also 
becoming more diversified. while the mature 
european markets increasingly look to include 
innovation and system integration (e.g. storage 
and renewable hydrogen) to play an increas-
ingly important role in auctions and tenders, 
developing markets in both europe, the us, 
and asia pacific often emphasise costs and job 
creation as determination criteria. for offshore 
wind, this necessitates a flexible approach 
to remain competitive across the different 
markets and implies the need to retain strong 
supplier engagement and cost standardisation.
potential impact
there is a risk that we will not win the targeted 
capacity in the auctions and tenders in which 
we participate, or that our value creation from 
the projects we win ends up being lower than 
targeted. 
mitigating actions
we will continue to utilise portfolio-scale ad-
vantages and knowhow gained from previously 
executed projects to develop supply chain 
solutions and reduce costs and risks in order 
to maximise our ability to win future projects. 
furthermore, early commitments and both 
global and regional framework agreements are 
being made to secure capacity.

description 
our expanding pipeline of us offshore 
projects entails risks in the development and 
construction phases caused by the relatively 
immature us offshore wind market, including 
the federal permitting process, for which we are 
still awaiting clarification from boem. contrary 
to the eu markets, it is possible in the us to 
participate in auctions and be awarded pro-
jects where consent and/or grid connections 
are not yet secured. thus, following an award, 
project development entails regulatory risks in 
obtaining key consents as well as securing grid 
connection(s). 
furthermore, local content requirements and 
the immature us offshore wind market also 
lead to increased construction risks in the us, 
such as the availability of locally manufactured 
components and harbour facilities. 
potential impact
to maintain project schedules, permits, con-
sents, and approvals from federal, state-level, 
and local authorities must be obtained in 
due time. securing sufficient grid connection 
capacity on time is also key. delays within 
these areas can lead to project delays and/or 
cost overruns which may reduce the value of 
the projects.
mitigating actions
we mitigate the risks by having sufficient float 
in our project timelines and by proactively 
engaging with all stakeholders. furthermore, 
we secure grid connection capacity through 
an approach of having multiple points of 
interconnections available to us in due time 
relative to wind turbine commissioning. we 
fulfil part of the local content obligations by 
investing in harbour infrastructure, thereby also 
securing critical harbour capacity for staging 
and load-out of wind turbines. 
description 
in recent years, several major cyberattacks 
have been launched against companies around 
the world, and we see growth in serious cyber 
operations in closer proximity to our business 
presence. 
we assess cybersecurity risks by identifying:  
1) protection level and possible residual 
exploitation scenarios for our systems and 
processes, 2) threat intelligence on main types 
of actors and characteristics for intention and 
capabilities, and 3) financial impact.
correspondingly, we have a strong focus 
on it security. as we possess critical energy 
generation capacity and own various types of 
intellectual property rights, we are a potential 
target for cyberattacks or industrial espionage.
potential impact
minor digital risk events, such as viruses and 
attempted break-ins, are everyday risks 
without significant impact. however, major 
cyberattacks or events may impact all or part 
of our shared infrastructure for administrative 
systems or industrial control systems. for the 
latter, the impact could range from a single as-
set to potentially all assets and activities in the 
company. cyberattacks of a certain size can be 
costly if it forces us to shut down operations for 
a period of time.
mitigating initiatives
our mitigation effort towards cyberattacks is 
twofold. first, we continually improve our resil-
ience against cyberattacks and other threats 
across Ørsted through our security programme. 
this is carried out through workshops across 
business units to assess the cyber risks. this is 
combined with an advanced security architec-
ture, spanning the entire company. second, we 
are participating in relevant forums across the 
energy sector to harvest ideas and contribute 
with information and experience.
description 
risks associated with legal compliance are 
assessed based on financial and reputational 
significance and probability. our most signif-
icant risks are tax law, financial regulations, 
and tender law. we operate in tax regimes with 
different tax rules and rates, and our tax affairs 
span over corporate tax compliance, transfer 
pricing, and indirect taxes. we are subject to 
several financial regulations, such as remit, 
mar, emir, dodd frank, mifid, sftr, and aml1. 
the financial regulations are relevant for a 
large part of our activities. lastly, many of our 
purchases of goods, services, and work in the 
eu are subject to eu and local tender rules.
potential impact
failure to comply with the above-mentioned 
rules and regulations may result in severe legal 
sanctions, such as imprisonment, fines, and 
damage claims, but also in delays in sourcing 
processes and subsequent risk of delay of 
projects.
mitigating initiatives
we are well under way with the implementa-
tion of a comprehensive tax control framework 
and mandatory compliance, including transfer 
pricing documentation, in line with oecd 
recommendations and local requirements. this 
is being prepared on a contemporaneous basis 
to mitigate our tax risks. we have implemented 
comprehensive policies, procedures, training, 
and controls for relevant parts of our business 
to ensure compliance with financial regula-
tions. to ensure compliance with tender laws, 
our legal team carries out training courses for 
procurement teams in basic tender law and 
practical courses on how to apply the standard 
tender documents and works closely together 
with procurement on major tenders.

accounting policies
business performance
the business performance principle is our alternative 
performance measure. under business performance, 
the market value adjustment of our energy hedges 
where we do not apply ifrs hedge accounting are 
deferred and recognised in the profit (loss) in the year 
in which the hedged exposure materialises. energy 
hedges comprise hedging of energy and associated 
currency risks as well as fixed-price physical gas and 
power contracts. according to ifrs, the market value 
of energy hedges where we do not apply ifrs hedge 
accounting are recognised on an ongoing basis in the 
profit (loss) for the year. the  difference between ifrs 
and business performance is specified in the ‘adjust-
ments’ column. read more about the business per-
formance principle in note 1.6 ‘business performance’.
profit (loss) per share
diluted profit (loss) per share corresponds to profit (loss) 
per share, as the dilutive effect of the share incentive 
programme is less than 0.1 % of the share capital.

cash flow hedging:
value adjustments for the year for cash flow hedging 
according to ifrs amounting to dkk -270 million 
mainly consist of losses related to hedging of power 
partly countered by gains related to hedging of uk 
inflation. the loss of dkk 301 million transferred 
to the income statement mainly consist of early 
termination of interests rate swaps related to the 
 termination of the project financing of block island. 
value adjustments transferred to the income 
statement according to the adjustment column 
amounting to dkk 547 million mainly consist of 
losses on gas hedges that are recognised in the 
income statement under business performance, but 
where the losses under ifrs were recognised in 
previous periods, as the gains and losses under 
business performance are deferred to the period to 
which the hedged exposure relates. 
exchange rate adjustments:
foreign exchange losses relating to net investments 
in foreign enterprises amounting to dkk -5,104 
million were in 2020 primarily attributable to an 
decrease of 6 % in the gbp exchange rate and a 
decrease of 9 % in the usd exchange rate. a large 
part of the net investments were hedged.

accounting policies
‘cash flows from operating activities’ are determined 
using the indirect method as operating profit (loss) 
before depreciation, amortisation, and impairment 
losses adjusted for changes in operating items 
without cash flow effect. trade payables relating to 
purchases of intangible assets, and property, plant, 
and equipment are not recognised in change in net 
working capital.
‘change in work in progress’ consists of elements 
in contract assets, contract liabilities, construction 
management agreements related to construction of 
offshore wind farms, construction of offshore trans-
mission assets (inventory), and  related trade payables.
‘change in tax equity partner liabilities’ relates to cash 
contributions from tax equity partners and repayment 
hereof through production tax credits (ptcs) and 
other tax attributes to tax equity partners. see also 
note 4.5 ‘tax equity liabilities’.
‘cash flows from investing activities’ comprise 
payments in connection with the purchase and sale 
of non-current assets and enterprises as well as the 
purchase and sale of securities that are not 
recognised as cash and cash equivalents.
‘cash flows from financing activities’ comprise 
changes in the size or composition of equity and 
loans, including instalments on leases and net 
proceeds related to interest-bearing tax equity 
liabilities. proceeds from raising of short-term repo 
loans are presented net.
cash flows in currencies other than the functional 
currency are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the month in question, unless these differ 
significantly from the rates at the transaction date.

2020
the financial position and performance of 
the Ørsted group was particularly affected 
by the following events and transactions 
during 2020. 
1.1 significant changes in the current reporting period
for a detailed discussion about the Ørsted 
group’s performance and financial position, 
please refer to our management’s review on 
pages 4 to 60.
covid-19
covid-19
we have analysed the impacts that 
covid-19 had on our financial reporting. 
our operations and financial performance 
remains very solid despite the covid-19 
pandemic, and we identified no significant 
impact on our financial reporting in 2020. 
we did not receive any governmental 
support in relation to covid-19.
divestments/discontinued operations
danish power distribution, residential 
customers, and city light businesses
in august, we completed the divestment of 
our danish power distribution, residential 
customer, and city light businesses to 
seas-nve (now andel). the divestment 
marks an important strategic milestone 
for Ørsted and completes our portfolio 
transformation into a global renewable 
energy company. the transaction resulted 
in proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion and a gain 
of dkk 10.9 billion. see note 3.4 ‘divestment 
of enterprises’.
lng
in december, we completed the divestment 
of our lng business to glencore, resulting in 
a cash outflow of dkk 1.5 billion. see note 
3.4 ‘divestment of enterprises’.
uk b2b gas and power portfolio
in september, we signed an agreement 
to divest the vast majority of our uk b2b 
customer portfolio to total gas & power. 
we will keep some of our strategic long-term 
partners and customers to whom we deliver 
risk management products. we expect the 
transaction to close in q1 2021. 
discontinued operations
as the remaining selling price regarding 
the divestment of our oil & gas business 
back in 2017 was received in 2020 from 
ineos, we decided to end the reporting 
on discontinued operations as per 
31 december 2020. remaining provisions 
regarding tax indemnifications and payments 
related to the fredericia stabilisation 
plant has been transferred to continuing 
operations at 31 december 2020. see note 
3.7 ‘discontinued operations’.
accounting policy
cease the use of business performance  
as of 1 january 2021
with the implementation of ifrs 9 in 2018, 
it has become significantly easier to apply 
ifrs hedge accounting to our commodity 
hedges. we have concluded that ifrs 9 
can replace our business performance 
principle, and therefore, we will only be 
reporting based on ifrs from 1 january 
2021. thus, the business performance and 
adjustment columns will not be included in 
our financial reporting any more. this will 
simplify our reporting and avoid potential 
confilicts with future reporting requirements 
for alternative performance measures. 
see notes 1.4 ‘ implementation of new 
standards or changed accounting standards 
and interpretations’ and 1.6 ‘business 
performance’ for more information.

this section provides an overall description of 
the accounting policies applied in our consoli-
dated financial statements as well as the euro-
pean single electronic format (esef) reporting 
requirements. we provide a more detailed 
description of the accounting policies applied 
in the specific notes. key accounting estimates 
and judgements and new and  amended ifrs 
standards and interpretations are discussed in 
detail in notes 1.3 ‘key accounting estimates 
and judgements’ and 1.4 ‘implementation of 
new or changed accounting standards and 
interpretations’, respectively.
basis of preparation
the financial statements for the period 
1 january - 31 december 2020 comprise the 
consolidated financial statements of Ørsted 
a/s and its subsidiaries (the group) as well as 
separate financial statements for the parent 
company, Ørsted a/s. see page 178 for the 
parent company’s accounting policies. 
the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the inter-
national financial reporting standards (ifrs) 
as adopted by the eu and further require-
ments in the danish financial statements act 
(Årsregnskabsloven).
the financial statements are presented in 
million danish kroner (dkk), unless otherwise 
stated.
measurement basis
the consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on historical cost basis, except 
for derivatives, gas in non-danish storage 
facilities, financial instruments in the trading 
portfolio, and carbon emission allowances in 
the trading portfolio which are measured at 
market value.
the accounting policies have been applied 
consistently in the financial year and for the 
comparative figures. 
principles for consolidation
the consolidated financial statements 
 comprise the financial statements of 
Ørsted a/s (the parent company) and 
 subsidiaries controlled by Ørsted a/s.  
see more in note 8.5 ‘company overview’. 
the consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared as a consolidation of 
the  parent company’s and the individual 
 subsidiaries’ financial statements which have 
been prepared in accordance with the group’s 
accounting policies. 
intra- group income, expenses, shareholdings, 
balances, and dividends as well as realised 
and unrealised gains and losses arising from 
intra-group transactions are eliminated on 
consolidation. 
unrealised gains resulting from transactions 
with associates and joint ventures are elimi-
nated to the extent of our ownership interest. 
unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 
way as unrealised gains to the extent that 
there has been no impairment.
enterprises are accounted for as associates if 
we hold or have the ability to exercise, directly 
or indirectly, 20-50 % of the voting rights and 
do not exercise control. however, we carry out 
a specific assessment of our ability to exercise 
influence, including our ability to influence 
financial and operational decisions and thus 
our return. enterprises that satisfy the criteria 
for joint control are accounted for as invest-
ments in joint ventures, unless the nature of 
the joint arrangement is considered a joint 
operation, see our key accounting judgement 
for ‘consolidation method for partnerships’ in 
the next column. 
our shares in joint operations are recognised 
in the consolidated balance sheet through 
 recognition of the group’s own assets, liabili-
ties, income, and expenses. the proportionate 
share of realised and unrealised gains and 
losses arising from intra-group transactions 
between fully consolidated enterprises and 
joint operations is eliminated.
key accounting judgement
consolidation method for partnerships
on establishment of partnerships and in connection 
with any restructuring of existing partnerships, we 
assess whether the structure is a joint arrangement 
under shared control. for joint arrangements, we 
subsequently assess whether they are joint ventures 
or joint operations. 
in assessing joint operations, we look at: 
–  the corporate form of the operation
–  whether we are only entitled to the net profit 
(loss) or to income and expenses resulting from 
the operation.
in addition, the fact that the parties buy or are 
 assigned all output, for example the power generated, 
will lead to the structure being considered a joint 
operation if we have joint control.

foreign currency translation
for each reporting enterprise in the group, 
items are determined in the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which 
the  individual reporting enterprise operates 
(functional currency). transactions in curren-
cies other than the functional currency of 
each enterprise are accounted for as trans-
actions in foreign currencies and translated on 
initial recognition at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date. exchange differences arising 
between the exchange rate on the transaction 
date and on the date of payment are recog-
nised in profit (loss) for the year as financial 
income or expenses.
receivables, payables, and other monetary 
items in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. 
the difference between the exchange rate 
on the balance sheet date and on the date 
at which the receivable or payable arose 
is  recognised in profit (loss) for the year as 
financial income or expenses.
for foreign subsidiaries, joint operations, 
associates, and joint ventures, the statements 
of comprehensive income are translated at 
monthly average exchange rates insofar as 
these do not deviate materially from the 
 actual exchange rates at the transaction 
dates. balance sheet items are  translated at 
the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. 
all exchange differences are recognised in 
profit (loss) for the year, except for exchange 
differences arising on: 
–  translation of the opening equity of these 
entities at the exchange rates on the 
 balance sheet date
–  translation of the statements of compre-
hensive income of these enterprises from 
‘the average-for-the-month exchange rates’ 
to ‘the exchange rates on the balance 
sheet date’
–  translation of balances accounted for as 
part of the total net investment
–  translation of the portion of loans and 
 derivatives that has been entered into to 
hedge the net investment in these enter-
prises, and that provides an effective hedge 
against corresponding foreign exchange 
gains (losses) on the net investment in 
the enterprise.
the above types of exchange differences are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
such exchange rate adjustments are divided 
between the equity of the parent company 
and the equity of the non-controlling interests.
on full or partial divestment of the net 
investment, the accumulated exchange rate 
adjustments are recognised as follows:
–  disposal resulting in loss of control: 
the accumulated exchange rate adjust-
ments, including any associated hedges, are 
recognised in the profit (loss) for the year if 
a foreign exchange gain (loss) is realised by 
the selling enterprise. any foreign exchange 
gain (loss) is transferred to the item in 
which the gain (loss) from the disposal is 
recognised. the part of the foreign currency 
translation reserve that relates to non- 
controlling interests is not transferred to 
profit (loss) for the year.
–  disposal not resulting in loss of control: 
a proportionate share of the foreign currency 
translation reserve is transferred from the 
parent company shareholders’ share of equity 
to the minority shareholders’ share of equity.
repayment of balances that are considered 
part of the net investment does not constitute 
a partial disposal of the subsidiary. 
european single electronic format (esef)
as we are a group with securities listed on a 
regulated market within the eu, we are from 
2021 required to prepare our annual report 
using the xhtml format and to tag the  primary 
consolidated financial statements using inline 
extensible business reporting language 
(ixbrl). this ixbrl format makes the annual 
report readable for both human and machines.
the annual report we submitted to the danish 
financial supervisory authority consists of 
the xhtml document together with some 
technical files, all included in a zip file named 
orst-2020-12-31.zip. for convenience, a pdf 
version of the annual report is published in line 
with previous years.
key definitions: 
–  xhtml (extensible hypertext markup 
language) is a text-based markup language 
used to structure and mark up content such 
as text, images, and hyperlinks in documents 
that are displayed as web pages.
–  ixbrl tags (or inline xbrl tags) are hidden 
meta-information embedded in the source 
code of an xhtml document in accordance 
with the inline xbrl 1.1 specification, which 
enables the conversion of xhtml-formatted 
information into a machine-readable xbrl 
data record by appropriate software. ixbrl 
tags shall comply with the esef taxonomy, 
which is included in the esef regulation 
and developed based on the ifrs taxonomy 
published by the ifrs foundation.
–  the tagging process is a process where 
 ixbrl tags are applied to financial state-
ment line items, etc. if a financial statement 
line item is not defined in the esef taxono-
my, an extension to the taxonomy is created. 
extensions have to be anchored to elements 
in the esef taxonomy, except for extensions 
which are subtotals.
–  taxonomy is an electronic dictionary of 
business reporting elements used to report 
business data. a taxonomy element is an 
element defined in a taxonomy that is 
used for the machine-readable labeling of 
information in an xbrl data record.

the use of resonable estimates and judge-
ments is an essential part of the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements. 
given the uncertainties inherent in our 
business activities, we make a number of 
estimates and judgements. the estimates 
and judgements are based on assumptions 
concerning future developments which affect 
our application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, 
sales, costs, cash flows, and related disclosures. 
actual amounts may differ from the amounts 
 estimated and judgements made, as more 
detailed information becomes available.
we regularly reassess these estimates and 
judgements, based among other things on 
historical experience, the current situation 
in the financial markets, and a number of 
other relevant factors, ie. the update in the 
annual estimated production. 
accounting estimates, judgements and 
assump tions which may entail a risk of 
 material adjustments in subsequent years 
are listed in the table below. 
in addition, we make judgements when 
we  apply the accounting policies.
reference is made to the specific notes for 
further information on the key accounting 
estimates and judgements as well as 
the assumptions applied.

we regularly assess the impact of new ifrs 
standards and interpretations. we implement 
new ifrs standards and interpretations from 
their mandatory effective dates at the latest. 
effective from 1 january 2020, we have 
implemented the following amendments to 
standards (ias and ifrs) and interpretations: 
–  amendments to ias 1 and ias 8: definition 
of material.
–  amendments to ifrs 3: definition of a 
business. 
–  amendments to ifrs 9 and ifrs 7:  
interest rate benchmark reform.
the adoption of the new and amended 
standards has not impacted our consolidated 
financial statements for 2020. 
cease the use of business performance 
as of 1 january 2021
with the implementation of ifrs 9 in 2018, it has 
become significantly easier to apply ifrs hedge 
accounting to our commodity hedges. we have 
concluded that ifrs 9 can replace our business 
performance principle, for which reason we only 
will be reporting based on ifrs from 1 january 
2021. thus, the business performance and adjust-
ment columns will no longer be included. this 
will simplify our reporting and avoid  potential 
conflicts with future reporting requirements for 
alternative performance measures.
among other things, ifrs 9 has made it easier 
to apply hedge accounting by the removal of 
the 80-125 % effectiveness requirement which 
can be difficult to comply with at all times 
when we engage in proxy hedging. an  example 
of proxy hedging is when we hedge our power 
exposure 4-5 years into the future with gas 
hedges due to illiquidity in the market for 
power hedges with this time horison. 
at the end of 2020, the value of our business 
performance hedges deferred to a future 
period amounted to a loss of dkk 2,685 million. 
this loss has already been recognised in the 
income statement under ifrs, as we have 
not previously applied hedge accounting for 
these. consequently, for the period 2021-2025, 
 ebitda (according to ifrs) will be higher with a 
similar amount compared to what the business 
performance ebitda would have been in the 
same period, if we had continued to report 
based on this principle. see also note 1.6.
new standards and interpretations
iasb has issued amended standards which 
have not yet entered into force, and which 
have consequently not been incorporated 
into the consolidated financial statements 
for 2020. none of these amended standards 
and interpretations are expected to have any 
significant impact on our financial statements.

business performance
business performance is a supplement to our financial statements prepared in 
accordance with ifrs. under the business performance principle, the value of the 
hedging transaction is deferred and recognised for the period in which the hedged 
risk materialises. reference is made to note 1.6 ‘business performance’.
gross investments
gross investments reflect our total investments in assets and enterprises. 
it comprises cash flows from investing activities, excluding dividends received 
from associates, joint ventures and equity investments, purchase and sale of 
securities, loans to joint ventures and joint operations, and divestments of assets 
and enterprises. to this is added acquired debt and restricted cash in connection 
with acquisitions.
net investments
net investments are gross investments less divestments of assets and enterprises, 
the selling price for non-controlling interests, and subsequent capital injections 
from non-controlling interests. furthermore, interest-bearing debt transferred in 
connection with a divestment is deducted.
funds from operations 
(ffo)
funds from operations are a supplementary statement for cash flows from 
operating activities determined as business performance ebitda less the effect of 
gains on the divestments of assets, interest expenses (net) on interest-bearing net 
debt and hybrid capital (50 %) as well as interest elements of decommissioning 
obligations and current tax. 
adjusted interest-
bearing net debt
adjusted interest-bearing net debt is interest-bearing net debt plus 50 % of the 
hybrid capital, cash and securities not available for use (except for repo transactions), 
and the present value of decommissioning obligations less deferred tax.

cease the use of business performance  
as of 1 january 2021
the reason for abolishing business performance 
is described in note 1.4 section ‘cease the use 
of business performance as of 1 january 2021’. 
consequently as of 1 january 2021, we will ap-
ply hedge accounting to all commodity hedges 
and related currency hedges except for hedges 
related to our gas portfolio which account for 
approx. 14 % of our total commodity hedges. 
until we are ready to apply hedge accounting 
to these hedges, the change in fair value will

to implement hedge accounting to hedges in 
our gas portfolio during the first half of 2021.
description of business performance
in 2011, we introduced an alternative 
performance measure, business performance, 
as a supplement to the financial statements 
prepared in accordance with ifrs. the 
business performance results reflect our 
internal risk management and show the 
results for the period under review. under the 
business performance principle, the value 
of the hedging transaction is deferred and 
recognised for the period in which the hedged 
risk materialises. this is illustrated in the 
example overleaf. 
our reason for introducing the business 
per formance principle was that:
–  we could not achieve the same timing of 
recognition of our commercial exposure 
and hedging contracts in accordance with 
the ifrs rules, for example with respect to 
option premiums and certain commercial 
fixed-price contracts 
–  there was a high risk that the hedging 
contracts were not consistent with the 
ifrs hedge accounting rules, requiring us to 
recognise the hedging contracts at  market 
value with value adjustments via the 
income statement, whereas our commercial 
exposure is accrued.
recognition
in the income statement, the business 
performance results are shown alongside the 
ifrs results. the difference between the two 
performance measures is shown in a separate 
column, ‘adjustments’. 
two types of contracts are included in the 
business performance principle: 
–  hedging contracts concerning energy and 
related currencies. 
–  commercial contracts concerning energy 
recognised at market value (typically fixed-
price physical gas and power contracts).
when we use hedging instruments which do 
not fully correspond to the underlying risk, any 
difference between the hedging instruments 
and the underlying risk is recognised imme-
diately in the income statement. see note 7.3 
‘ energy trading portfolio’. the accounting treat-
ment under business performance is other wise 
identical to the accounting treatment under 
ifrs. our assets, liabilities, cash flows, and 
equity are consequently not  affected. the 
accounting treatment of our hedging contracts 
according to ifrs and business performance is 
summarised in the table below.

example of recognition of the market value  
of a hedging contract according to the  
business performance and ifrs principles  
in the income statement.
explanation of the business 
performance principle
in year 1, we enter into a contract hedging 
the price risk associated with offshore’s 
generation of 1,000gwh in year 5 at 
gbp 52,000 per gwh. this ensures a 
total  revenue of gbp 52 million. in year 
5, the cost of power has decreased to 
gbp 45,000 per gwh, which means that 
the hedging contract has a positive market 
value of gbp 7 million (a hedged price of 
gbp 52,000 per gwh minus the spot price 
of gbp 45,000 per gwh). this means that 
we ensure that the total income, including 
the hedging transaction, is still gbp 52 
million. the income of gbp 52 million con-
sists of a gain from the hedging contract 
of gbp 7 million and gbp 45 million from 
the sale of 1,000 gwh at a spot price of 
gbp 45,000 per gwh. the financial impact 
of the hedging transaction in years 1-5 is 
shown in the table. under the business 
performance principle, the hedging trans-
action is recognised in the income state-
ment in year 5, i.e. at the same time as the 
hedged contract with a positive market 
value of gbp 7 million. the value develop-
ment is, however, recognised continuously 
in the income statement according to 
ifrs. upon the expiry of the contract in 
year 5, the total effect on results over the 
period is the same under the ifrs and the 
business performance principle. only the 
timing differs.
expected impact on business performance 
ebitda from energy and currency hedging
at 31 december 2020, a loss of dkk 671 mil-
lion would have been deferred (2019: gain 
of dkk 1,434 million) and affected business 
performance  ebitda in subsequent years if we 
had continued with the business performance 
principle. of this, a gain of dkk 68 million is 
expected in ebitda in 2021.
power prices increased in 2020, which means 
that the market value of the hedges has de-
creased as we are selling power. the decrease 
in the deferred loss on currency hedging is 
primarily attributable to a decrease in the gbp/
dkk rate causing a gain as we are selling gbp.
the table shows when 
the deferred value ad-
justments are expected 
to be recognised in the 
ebitda. the business 
performance hedges 
does not impact the 
ifrs numbers as they 
have already been 
recognised under ifrs as 
they occurred. the ifrs 
ebitda for 2021 will 
therefore be dkk 1,112 
million higher than what 
the business perfor-
mance ebitda would 
have been. in total, 
business performance 
hedges of dkk -2,685 
million will not be recog-
nised in 2021 and after.

power prices combined with a selling position. 
this was partly countered by gains on curren-
cy hedges, mainly related to a decrease in the 
gbp/dkk rate as a result of a selling position.
deferred gains (losses) from previous periods 
in 2020, a gain of dkk 547 million was 
 recognised in business performance ebitda, 
but as the gain was recognised in ifrs ebitda 
in a previous period, the gain was reversed 
in the ‘adjustments’ column in the income 
statement. the gain was primarily attributable 
to the hedging of gas.
difference between ifrs and business 
performance for the year
the value adjustment in respect of future 
 periods totalled a loss of dkk 979 million 
(2019: dkk +141 million), and reversal of 
deferred gains (losses) recognised according 
to business performance in 2020 totalled 
dkk -547 million (2019: dkk 1,395 million).
market value adjustments for the year 
related to hedging contracts
2020 was mainly affected by losses on the 
hedging of power as a result of an increase in 
tugboat rovan 
mcallister working on 
the construction of 
coastal virginia wind, 
off the coast of  
virginia beach, the us.

2.1 segment information
segment structure
we run our business on an end-to-end value 
chain thinking. all activities and earnings that 
relate to offshore and onshore are reported in 
these segments, even if the daily activities are 
performed on behalf of the group in markets & 
bioenergy. therefore, revenue and earnings 
from trading related to hedging of our power 
exposures and power portfolio optimisation 
activities in relation to offshore and onshore 
are presented in these business units. 
in 2020, ebitda of dkk 236 million (2019:  
dkk 725 million) and dkk 48 million (2019: 
dkk -18 million) were transferred to offshore 
and onshore, respectively. 
accounting policies
our operating segments are consistent with our 
internal reporting to our chief operating decision 
maker, the executive committee.
we apply the business performance principle, 
as described in note 1.6 ‘business performance’, 
in connection with our internal management.
the operating segments are managed primarily on 
the basis of ebitda and investments. financial income, 
financial expenses, depreciation, and amortisations 
as well as tax are allocated to the operating segments, 
while we manage them at group level. 
segment income and segment expenses are those 
items that, in our internal management reporting, 
are directly attributable to individual segments or 
can be indirectly allocated to individual segments 
on a reliable basis.

2.2  revenue
 
the timing of transfer of goods or services 
to  customers is categorised as follows:
‘at a point in time’ mainly comprises:
–  sale of gas or power in the market, e.g. 
north pool, ttf, nbp
–  transmission assets for offshore wind 
farms at farm-down. 
‘over time’ mainly comprises:
–  construction agreements for offshore 
wind farms and transmission assets
–  long-term contracts with customers 
to deliver gas, heat, or power.
the divestment of the walney extension 
transmission asset and the increase in 
government grants, mainly due to receipt of 
cfds of another 400 mw related to hornsea 
1 from april 2020, ramp-up of  generation from 
hornsea 1 and  borssele 1 & 2 as well as higher 
wind speeds across the portfolio.
other revenue in offshore primarily related to 
operations and maintenance agreeements, 
which increased due to ramp-up of generation 
from hornsea 1 and borssele 1 & 2 in 2020. 
revenue for the year (business performance) 
decreased by 22 % to dkk 52,601 million 
in 2020. the decrease was mainly due to 
significantly lower gas and power prices 
relative to last year, lower gas volumes sold, 
limited construction work on wind farms for 
partners, and a decrease in thermal heat 
generation. this was only partly offset by

renegotiations are not included in revenue before we 
know the outcome of the individual renegotiations.
 
in most cases, the consideration for the gas is due 
when the gas is injected into the distribution system 
or delivered to the customer. the delivery of gas is 
invoiced on a monthly basis, and the payment is due 
within 10-30 days. 
sale of power
types of goods and services
revenue from the sale of power includes the sale of 
power sourced from other producers. 
 
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations 
and significant estimates
revenue is recognised when control of the goods is 
transferred to the buyer. transfer of control occurs 
when the actual power is delivered to the customer.
significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements
sales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a 
variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to 
the customer at a variable price, are considered one 
performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be 
satisfied over time. for such contracts and for long-
term agreements on selling power at a fixed price, 
we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we 
have a right to invoice.
in most cases, the consideration for the power is due 
when the actual power is delivered to the customer. 
the delivery of power is invoiced on a monthly basis, 
and the payment is due within 10-30 days.
generation of power
types of goods and services
revenue from generation of power is our sale of 
power produced at our own wind farms and power 
plant and the sale of ancillary services. 
 
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations, 
and significant estimates
revenue is recognised when control of the goods is 
transferred to the buyer. transfer of control occurs 
when the actual power is delivered to the customer, 
which for power generated by us occurs when it 
is produced. 
accounting policies
revenue is measured based on the consideration 
specified in a contract with a customer (transaction 
price) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties, i.e. vat. we recognise revenue when 
we transfer control over a product or service to 
a customer or a partner. 
 
if a part of the transaction price is variable, i.e. bonus 
payments, incentive payments for unmissed dead-
lines, etc., the variable consideration is recognised in 
revenue when it is highly probable that the revenue 
will not be reversed in subsequent periods.
 
we adjust the transaction price for the time value of 
money if the payments exceed twelve months.
sales agreements are divided into individually identi-
fiable performance obligations. if a sales agreement 
includes several performance obligations, the sales 
agreement’s transaction price is allocated to each 
performance obligation’s stand-alone selling price. 
 
sale of gas
types of goods and services
revenue from the sale of gas includes the sale of gas 
sourced from other producers. 
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations 
and significant estimates
revenue is recognised when control of the gas is 
transferred to the buyer. transfer of control occurs 
either when the gas is injected into the distribution 
system or physically delivered to the customer. 
 
significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements 
sales contracts for a fixed amount of gas at a 
variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to 
the customer at a variable price, are considered one 
performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be 
satisfied over time. for such contracts, we recognise 
revenue in the amount up to which we have a right 
to invoice.

the transaction price allocated to the remaining per-
formance obligation (unsatisfied or partially satisfied).
in accordance with ifrs 15, the overview does not 
include revenue from contracts with customers 
to deliver gas, heat, and power, or our operations 
and maintenance agreements. for these types of 
goods and services, we recognise the revenue that 
corresponds directly to the value transferred to 
the customer.
key accounting estimate
assumptions for the determination of the expected 
selling price and costs
we make estimates when determining the expected 
selling price of individual construction agreements.
these estimates are influenced by our assessment of:
–  the degree of completion of the individual off-
shore wind farm and offshore transmission assets
–  total expected costs for the individual contract
–  the value of the incentive agreements under 
which we may be paid a bonus for early delivery 
or have to pay compensation for late delivery
–  the guarantee commitments undertaken
–  the share of total costs associated with transmis-
sion assets which are expected to be covered upon 
handover, etc.
therefore, our determination of profit and the 
recognition of revenue and related contract assets 
are subject to significant uncertainty. we believe that 
our estimates are the likely outcome of future events.
unsatisfied long-term contracts
our remaining performance obligations 
expected to be recognised in more than one 
year relate to the construction of wind farms 
and offshore transmission assets. 
key accounting judgement
assumptions for recognition of revenue from the 
construction of offshore wind farms over time
we construct offshore wind farms with partners 
where we construct our partner’s share of the wind 
farm. we assess each construction agreements at 
the time of conclusion of the agreements. 
in our view, our partner assumes control of the 
offshore wind farm in step with construction.
this is supported by: 
–  the regular approval of part deliveries
–  the approval or rejection of significant variations 
to the construction
–  the partner’s takeover of work from the subcon-
tractors, both concerning risk and legal title to the 
wind farm on an on-going basis
–  the milestone payments from the partner.
therefore, revenue is recognised over time during the 
construction of the offshore wind farms.

significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements
revenue from ancillary services consists of fees for 
 having power plants on standby and/or immediately 
ready to increase or decrease the generation of 
power by an agreed amount to balance the demand 
and supply in the system. ancillary services are con-
sidered one performance obligation which is fulfilled 
over time when the power plants are on standby 
and/or immediately ready to increase or decrease 
the generation of power. 
sales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a 
variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to 
the customer at a variable price, are considered one 
performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be 
satisfied over time. for such contracts and for long-
term agreements on selling power at a fixed price, 
we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we 
have a right to invoice.
in most cases, the consideration for the power is due 
when the actual power is delivered to the customer. 
ancillary services are invoiced on a monthly basis, 
and consideration is payable when invoiced. 
revenue from construction of offshore wind farms
types of goods and services
revenue from construction of offshore wind farms 
includes development and construction.
 
the construction agreements cover the construction 
phase from design to delivery of an operational 
asset. the agreement consists of two performance 
obligations:
– offshore wind farms. 
– offshore transmission assets, if applicable. 
the construction agreements cover our partners’ 
shares of the construction of the wind farm and 
offshore transmission assets, if applicable. 
if the contracts include multiple performance obliga-
tions, the transaction price will be allocated to each 
performance obligation based on the stand-alone 
selling prices. where these are not directly observ-
able, they are estimated based on the expected 
cost-plus margin. 
 
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations, 
and significant estimates
we recognise revenue from the construction 
agreements over time, using an input method to 
measure progress towards complete satisfaction of 
the performance obligation because the customer 
gains control of the offshore wind farm during the 
construction process. the input method reflects our 
ongoing transfer of control to the customer. when 
the outcome of the performance obligation in the 
contract can be measured reasonably, the construc-
tion agreement is measured at the transaction price 
of the work performed less progress billings, based 
on the percentage of completion of the contract at 
balance sheet date and the total expected revenues 
from the individual contracts. 
 
we estimate the degree of completion on the basis of 
an assessment of the work performed, normally calcu-
lated as the ratio between the costs incurred and the 
total costs expected related to the contract in question.
the transaction price is based on the total expected 
income from individual contracts. estimates of 
revenues are based on the transaction price and the 
completion degree of the offshore wind farm or off-
shore transmission asset at the balance sheet date. 
estimates of revenues, costs, and percentage of 
completion are revised if circumstances change. any 
resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenue 
or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in 
which the circumstances that give rise to the revision 
come to our knowledge.
 
an expected loss is recognised when it is deemed 
probable that the total construction costs will ex-
ceed the total revenue from the individual contracts.
significant terms of payment and associated 
 estimates and judgements 
the consideration for the construction of an offshore 
wind farm consists of a fixed fee and a relatively 
minor variable fee, depending on when the wind farm 
can be put into operation.  
the consideration for an offshore transmission asset 
is a fixed fee. 
after signing the construction agreement, we carry 
out an assessment determining when the wind farm 
is expected to be completed, and calculate the 
size of the variable payment on this basis. we only 
recognise the variable fee when it is highly probable 
that a subsequent reversal will not take place. 
 
at each balance sheet date, an assessment is made of 
the size of the variable payment which can be included 
in the transaction price. revenue is adjusted accordingly. 
the customer pays the fixed consideration based on 
a payment schedule. the payment schedule is de-
termined and based on the expected progress of the 
construction and transfer of control to the customer. 
if the work we have performed exceeds invoicing 
on account, a contract asset is recognised. if the 
payments exceed the work we have performed, a 
contract liability is recognised.
generation and sale of heat
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and 
significant estimates
heat is sold under long-term heat contracts. 
 
revenue is recognised when control is transferred to 
the customer. transfer of control occurs when the 
heat is physically delivered to the customer. 
 
in connection with a biomass conversion of a chp 
plant, the heat customer makes a prepayment to 
finance the majority of our capex associated with the 
conversion. the prepayment is recognised as a contract 
liability. the contract liability is recognised as revenue 
in step with the transfer of heat to the customer. 
significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements
payment for the sale of heat consists of fixed costs 
associated with operations and maintenance of a 
chp plant, fuel costs for the generation of heat, and 
a financial return. 
the delivery of heat is invoiced on a monthly basis, 
and the payment is due within 10-30 days. 
distribution and transmission
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations and 
significant estimates
revenue from the distribution and transmission of 
gas and power is recognised when the gas or power 
is delivered to the buyer, or when the capacity is 
made available. 
significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements 
revenue is calculated as the amount to which we 
are entitled when the service is delivered to the 
customer and invoiced on a monthly basis, and 
consideration is payable when invoiced.
other revenue
types of goods and services
other revenue primarily includes operations and 
maintenance agreements and other services.
timing of satisfaction of delivery obligations 
and significant estimates
revenue from providing services is recognised in the 
accounting period in which the services are rendered. 
for fixed-priced contracts, revenue is recognised 
based on the actual service rendered at the end 
of the reporting period as a proportion of the total 
services to be rendered because the customer 
receives and uses the benefits simultaneously. this is 
determined based on the actual labour hours spent 
relative to the total labour hours expected.
significant terms of payment and associated 
estimates and judgements
the consideration for operations and maintenance 
agreements consists of a fixed fee and a minor 
variable fee, e.g. bonuses or compensation for wind 
farm availability. 
availability bonuses will be recognised on an ongoing 
basis when it is highly probable that a subsequent 
reversal will not take place. 
fixed-price contracts are invoiced on a monthly basis, 
and consideration is payable when invoiced. variable 
fee services are generally due after the services are 
rendered.
warranty obligations 
we typically have a five-year responsibility to 
 remedy defects that exist at the relevant  
takeover date when we construct offshore wind 
farms. these types of warranties are accounted 
for under ias 37 ‘provisions, contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets’. reference is made to the 
accounting policy on warranty provisions in note 
3.2 ‘provisions and contingent assets and liabilities’.

2.3  cost of sales
cost of sales according to business perfor-
mance decreased by 36 % to dkk 26,708 
million in 2020. 
the decrease was mainly due to lower gas 
prices relative to last year and lower gas 
volumes sold. furthermore, we had limited 
construction work on wind farms for partners. 
in 2020, ‘costs from construction of offshore 
wind farms and transmission assets’ primarily 
related to coastal virginia wind as well as 
the the divestment of the walney extension 
transmission asset.

energinet, the transmission system operator 
in denmark, administers subsidies for environ-
mentally sustainable power generation, 
including biomass and offshore wind farms. 
we regard the grant for  environmentally 
 sustainable power generation as a govern-
ment grant, as it is paid by the danish state.
in the uk, we receive subsidies under the 
following schemes:  contracts for difference 
(cfd) and the renewable  obligations scheme 
(rocs) for renewable energy  projects. the 
 burbo bank extension,  walney extension, 
and hornsea 1 offshore wind farms are under 
the cfd regime, while our other uk offshore 
wind farms as well as our renescience plant 
are under the roc regime. we treat the 
payments from the roc and cfd schemes 
as government grants.
fixed feed-in tariffs from our dutch and 
german wind farms are also recognised 
as government grants. 
accounting policies
government grants comprise grants for environ-
mentally sustainable power generation, grants for 
the funding of development projects as well as 
investment grants, etc. 
government grants are recognised when there 
is  reasonable assurance that the grants will be 
received. 
grants for the purchase of assets which we recognise 
in the balance sheet are recognised under deferred 
revenue and are transferred to other operating 
income in step with the depreciation of the assets 
to which the grants relate.
as grants for power generation are intended as a 
compensation for the price of power, we system-
atically recognise the grants under revenue in step 
with the power generation and thus the related 
revenue.
2.5  research and develop-
ment expenditures
accounting policies
research costs are costs incurred to analyse and 
optimise different aspects of offshore wind farm 
technology (e.g. improving offshore foundations and 
optimising blade stability and performance).
research costs are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred.
development costs primarly comprise salaries as 
well as internal and external costs which can be 
directly or indirectly attributed to design and devel-
opment of new offshore and onshore wind farms and 
the renescience northwich plant.
development costs are expensed until the capitalisa-
tion criteria are met.
when the capitalisation criteria are met, devel-
opment costs are capitalised as ‘assets under 
construction’.
during the year, we expensed research and 
development costs amounting to dkk 1,935 
million (2019: dkk 2,060 million).

key accounting estimate
estimates for the variable selling price related to 
divestments of offshore wind farms and offshore 
transmission assets
when we divest an ownership interest in an offshore 
wind farm and offshore transmission asset to a 
partner, we consider all terms and activities in the 
contracts in order to determine the transaction price. 
if the consideration includes a variable amount, we 
estimate the consideration to which we are entitled 
in exchange for transferring the assets, the wind farm, 
and the transmission assets to our partner.
the variable considerations are estimated at contract 
inception based on future outcome of events, e.g.: 
–  the divestment price of offshore transmission 
asset through competitive tender process
–  the impact on production from future wind farms
–  the winning bid of tender revenue stream through 
a competitive tender process.
we consider ‘the most likely amount’ to provide the 
most appropriate estimate of the expected variable 
consideration. 
accounting policies
in connection with the divestment of ownership in-
terests in offshore wind farms, the gain is recognised 
on the divestment date as other operating income in 
the income statement. 
gains for future construction of the partner’s share 
of the offshore wind farm are recognised over time in 
the income statement in step with the construction. 
see notes 2.2 ‘revenue’ and 4.2 ‘contract assets and 
liabilities’. 
the accounting policies for ‘us tax credits and tax 
attributes’ income is described in note 4.5 ‘tax equity 
liabilities’. 
divestment of ownership interests in our 
offshore wind farms 
when we divest an ownership interest in an offshore 
wind farm to a partner, we typically also enter into 
agreements on the future construction and  operation 
of the offshore wind farm. 
contracts in connection with a divestment are 
typically agreements on:
– the sale of shares (divestment of assets) (spa).
–  the future construction of the offshore wind farm 
(construction agreements).
–  the future operation of the offshore wind farm 
(o&m agreements).

other operating income
in 2020, other operating income was 
dkk 2,620 million, which was 47 % higher 
than in 2019. in 2020, ‘gains on divestment 
of assets’ mainly related to the hornsea 1 
transmission asset where we lowered our 
assumption regarding the preferred bidder’s 
expected return requirement. in 2019, we had 
no gains related to divestment of assets. 
‘other compensation’ is primarily related 
to compensations regarding outages and 
curtailments, mainly from tennet, the german 
grid operator.
the increase in ‘us tax credits and tax 
attributes’ income was mainly due to the 
 commissioning of three onshore wind farms 
in 2020. 
other operating expenses
‘loss on divestment of assets’ was primarily 
related to m&a transaction costs.

year costs to be reversed. this has reduced the 
remuneration by dkk 4.6 million.
employee costs 
‘employee costs before transfer to assets’ were 
3.5 % higher in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly 
reflecting the increase in fixed salary and 
slightly higher average number of employees. 
‘employee costs transferred to assets’ relate 
to investment projects which are capitalised in 
the balance sheet.
pension plans and number of employees 
pension plans are defined-contribution plans 
that do not commit Ørsted beyond the 
amounts contributed. 
in 2020, our average number of employees 
was 6,429 (2019: 6,329). the average number 
of employees in 2020 is impacted by the

the grant, this would correspond to 0-30 % or 
0-40 % (0-80 % in the us) of the fixed salary 
on the date of grant. the final number of 
shares for each participant will be determined 
on the basis of the total shareholder return 
delivered by Ørsted, benchmarked against ten 
comparable european energy companies. 
the highest rate (200 %) will be triggered if 
Ørsted’s results, measured as the total return 
to  shareholders, outperform those of the com-
parable companies. for each lower ranking,  
the number of shares granted will fall by
20 percentage points. if, for example, Ørsted 
ranks third, the participants will be entitled 
to 160 % of the target. 
if Ørsted ranks 11 in the comparison, no shares 
will be granted to the participants. the right 
to shares is conditional upon continued 
employment. 
retention share programme
the target group for the share-based reten-
tion agreements will typically be employees 
 responsible for vital, long-term projects. the 
use of these share-based retention agreements 
will be limited to 25 concurrent agreements 
with an individual time frame of up to five 
years. members of the executive board (ceo 
and cfo) cannot be granted such retention 
agreements. 
the number of retention share units (rsus) 
to be granted will be determined on the basis

of the price of Ørsted’s shares at the time of 
the grant and will be limited to an amount 
corresponding to a maximum of six months’ 
base pay for the employee in question. at 
vesting, each rsu will entitle the employee 
to one Ørsted share free of charge. however, 
the total value of the shares to be received 
at vesting will be capped at a maximum of 
twelve months’ base pay for the employee 
in question.
the figure shows the 
value of Ørsted shares 
in percent of the partici-
pants’ fixed salary which, 
at the time of granting, 
must be locked up for the 
duration of the executive 
share programme. 
accounting policies
the share programme is classified as an  equity-based 
programme as the programme is settled in shares. 
the market value of the psus/rsus and the  estimated 
number of psus granted are measured at the time of 
granting and recognised:
–  in the income statement under employee costs 
over the vesting period
–  as an offset in the balance sheet under equity over 
the vesting period.
the valuation of the psus/rsus and the estimate
of the number of psus/rsus expected to be granted 
are carried out as a probability simulation based on 
Ørsted’s expected total shareholder return relative 
to ten comparable european energy companies. 
the expect ations are factored into the market value 
and are not adjusted subsequently. the participants 
are compensated for any dividend payments by 
receiving additional psus/rsus.

executive share programme
the executive committee and a number of 
other senior executives participate in the share 
programme (approx. 100). as a condition for 
the granting of performance share units (psus), 
the participant must own a number of shares 
in Ørsted corresponding to a portion of the 
individual participant’s annual fixed salary. 
the portion depends on the employee category 
and, for our ceo, makes up 75 % of the fixed 
 salary; see the table above for more informa-
tion. the participants in the programme must 
invest in Ørsted shares prior to the first granting.
if the participants fulfil the shareholding 
requirement at the time of granting, they 
will be granted a number of psus each year, 
representing a value of 15-20 % (15-40 % in 
the us) of the annual fixed salary on the date 
of granting.
the granted psus have a vesting period of 
approximately three years, after which each 
psu entitles the holder, without payment, 
to receive a number of shares corresponding 
to 0-200 % of the number of psus granted.

closely, as a large part of our value is created 
in the development and construction phases.
investments and divestments in 2020
our gross investments amounted to 
dkk 27.0 billion in 2020, of which offshore 
accounted for 73 %.
investments were primarily related to: 
–  offshore wind farms (dkk 19.5 billion), 
including borssele 1 & 2 in the netherlands, 
greater changhua 1 & 2a in taiwan, hornsea 2 
in the uk, and ocean wind in the us. 
–  onshore wind and solar farms (dkk 6.6 
billion), including permian energy center, 
muscle shoals, western trail, sage draw, 
plum creek, willow creek, and haystack in 
the us.
–  markets & bioenergy (dkk 0.7 billion),  
mainly relating to the maintenance of the 
power distribution grid.  
divestments amounted to dkk 19.0 billion 
and were primarily related to the divestment 
of our danish power distribution, residential 
customer, and city light businesses. the trans-
action resulted in proceeds of dkk 20.5 billion. 
furthermore, we received minor proceeds 
regarding the divestment of our 10 mw solar 
farm oak solar in new jersey and our inbicon 
production facilities. this was partly offset

 cgus in offshore
the cash generating units (cgus) are made up 
of individual offshore wind farms, each of which 
generates cash flows for the segment independently 
of each other.
significant cgus

 cgus in markets & bioenergy 
the danish power plants constitute a single 
cgu, as overall production planning is for the 
entire danish portfolio of chp plants. in addition, 
the renescience plant in northwich in the uk is 
deemed to constitute an independent cgu.
the infrastructure assets, each of which generates 
cash flows for the segment independently of each 
other, also constitute cgus. 
significant cgus

key accounting estimates
key assumptions for value in use
cgus are tested for impairment if there is any indica-
tion of impairment. in performing an impairment test, 
we assess whether the recoverable amount exceeds 
the net book value of a cgu. when performing 
value-in-use tests, we see if the cgu will be able to 
generate positive net cash flows sufficient to support 
the net book values.
value-in-use calculations are based on expected 
future cash flows from financial budgets and 
forecasts and include a number of assumptions and 
estimates. these assumptions include future market 
conditions, market prices of power and biofuel,  
estimated discount rates, estimated useful lives 
of the projects, etc. the market prices applied are 
based on available forward prices for a period of 
up to five years and our best estimate of long-term 
prices for the remainder of the period.
when calculating the recoverable amount of 
property, plant, and equipment under construction, 
other material assumptions include the expected 
completion costs and the commissioning dates.
accounting policies
intangible assets
rights are measured at cost less accumulated 
amort isation and impairment losses. rights are 
 amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
 estimated future useful lives, which are 5-20 years.
property, plant, and equipment
property, plant, and equipment which is not a lease is 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. cost of property, plant, and 
equipment is depreciated by using the straight-line 
method, the diminishing-balance method, or the 
reducing -fraction method. the diminishing-balance 
method and the reducing-fraction method result 
in decreasing depreci ation over the useful life. 
these methods are used for some of our offshore 
wind farms.
cost comprises purchase price and any costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition until the date the 
asset is available for use. the cost of self-construct-
ed assets comprises direct and indirect costs of 
 materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. 
borrowing costs relating to both specific and general 
borrowing directly attributable to assets under 
construction with a lengthy construction period are 
recognised in cost during the construction period. 
cost is increased by the present value of the estimat-
ed obligations for demolition and decommissioning 
of assets to the extent that the obligations are 
recognised as a provision.
subsequent costs, for example in connection with 
 replacement of parts of an item of property, plant, 
and equipment, are recognised in the carrying 
amount of the asset in question when it is  probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the group 
from the expenses incurred. any residual value
of the replaced parts is recognised in the income 
statement as loss on disposal of non-current assets. 
other repair and  maintenance expenses are recog-
nised in profit (loss) for the year as incurred.
impairment losses
impairment losses relating to goodwill
we have not impaired goodwill or other 
intangible assets in 2020.
impairment losses relating to property,  
plant, and equipment
we have not impaired any property, plant, 
and equipment in 2020.
in 2019, property, plant, and equipment under 
construction related to the renescience  facility 
which was impaired by dkk 500 million. 
renescience is part of our markets & bioenergy 
segment. 
the impairment losses in 2019 related to 
renescience were primarily due to delays in 
commissioning, increases in capex as we were 
optimising the waste conversion technology, 
and changes in cost and price estimates. 
the recoverable amount of renescience 
was measured on the basis of its value in 
use and was based on internal budgets 
and forecasts. significant assumptions in 
the forecasts  included the facility capacity, 
the waste conversation ratios, and potential 
revenue streams from increased recycling. 
the estimated cash flows were discounted 
with a pre-tax rate of 7.5 %. 
in 2019, production assets related to the battery 
storage project carnegie road were fully 
impaired by dkk 68 million.
 cgus in onshore
the cgus are made up of individual onshore wind 
and solar farms, each of which generates cash 
flows for the segment independently of each other.
significant cgus
amazon, haystack, lockett, muscle shoals, permian 
energy center, plum creek, sage draw, tahoka, 
western trail, willow creek, and willow springs.

3.2  provisions and contingent assets and liabilities
decommissioning obligations
decommissioning obligations mainly 
comprise estimated expenses relating 
to decommissioning and disposal of our 
offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar 
farms, restoration of seabeds, and the 
decommissioning of our chp plants. 
as developers of offshore wind, onshore 
wind, and solar farms, we are obliged to 
decommission our wind and solar farms 
and restore the surroundings at our own 
expense. when we construct offshore wind 
farms in cooperation with partners, they 
are liable for their share of the decom-
missioning costs. therefore, we have only 
included the decommissioning  obligations 
associated with our  ownership interest in 
the offshore wind farms. 
decommissioning obligations increased 
by dkk 845 million from 2019 to 2020, 
primarily due to the construction of new 
wind farms.
onerous contracts
onerous contracts comprise primarily:
–  two contracts for gas storage  capacity in 
germany amounting to dkk 699 million 
(2019: dkk 814 million)
–  a contract for gas storage  capacity in 
denmark amounting to dkk 96 million 
(2019: dkk 164 million)
other provisions
other provisions comprise primarily:
–  offshore partnership provisions, including 
warranty obligations, wake-effect obliga-
tions and provisions related to offshore 
transmission assets
–  obligations in relation to the divestment 
of our oil & gas business in 2017
–  obligations in respect of our own carbon 
emissions
–  provisions for revisions of prices related 
to supply contracts
–  other contractual obligations.

key accounting estimates
assumptions for provisions 
we continually assess our provisions recognised 
to cover contractual obligations and claims raised 
against Ørsted. timing, probabilities, amounts, etc., 
which have a bearing on our provisions’ estimates 
are updated quarterly based on our expectations.
estimates of provisions are based on our 
 expectations of, for example:
–  timing and scope of obligation
–  future cost level
–  legal assessment.
if deemed material, non-current provisions are 
discounted using either the structural risk-free interest 
rate or the incremental borrowing rate. the structural 
risk-free interest rate is used for decommissioning 
liabilities and onerous contracts.
the outcome of our contractual obligations and 
claims may depend on future events which are 
uncertain by nature.
accounting policies
provisions are recognised when the following 
 criteria are fulfilled:
–  we have a legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of an earlier event.
–  the settlement of the obligation is expected 
to result in an outflow of resources.
–  the obligation can be measured reliably.
decommissioning obligations are measured at the 
present value of the future liability in respect of 
decommissioning as expected at the balance sheet 
date. the present value of the provision and changes 
in estimate are recognised as part of the cost of 
prop erty, plant, and equipment and depreciated 
together with the associated asset. the addition 
of interest on provisions is recognised in the income 
statement under financial expenses.
for onerous contracts, a provision is made when 
the expected income to be derived from a contract 
is lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting our 
obligations under the contract. 
provisions concerning carbon emissions are 
 recognised when our actual emissions exceed our 
holding of carbon emission allowances.

the east coast hub,

lincolnshire, the uk.
contingent liabilities
liability to pay compensation
in case of any environmental accidents or 
other types of damage caused by our gas and 
oil transport, the companies Ørsted salg & 
service a/s and danish oil pipe a/s are liable 
to pay compensation according to legisla-
tion. this also applies if there is no proof of 
negligence (strict liability). we have taken out 
insurance to cover any such claims.
secondary liability
as part of the divestment of our oil & gas 
business in 2017, we assumed a secondary 
liability regarding the decommissioning of 
offshore installations.
litigation
we are party to a number of court cases and 
legal disputes. in our assessment, none of these 
will significantly impact Ørsted’s financial 
position, neither individually nor collectively.
we have been party to actions relating to the 
danish competition authorities’ claim that the 
former elsam a/s and elsam kraft a/s (‘elsam’), 
now part of Ørsted, charged excessive prices 
in the danish wholesale power market in the 
period 1 july 2003 to 31 december 2006.
there are no longer any outstanding cases 
with the competition authorities claiming 
elsam infringed competition law, but in 
connection with the former cases, some 
 energy trading companies, some of their 
customers, and others have filed claims 
for damages which are still pending. the 
biggest claim was filed in 2007 before the 
 copenhagen maritime & commercial court, 
amounting to approx. dkk 4.4 billion with 
addition of litigation interest. in a ruling from 
march 2020, elsam was acquitted from the 
claim, but the plaintiffs have appealed the 
ruling, and it is now pending before the high 
court of western denmark.
Ørsted is involved in ongoing transfer pricing 
disputes. for further information, we refer to 
section 5.1 ‘approach to taxes’.
change of control
some of our activities are subject to con-
sents, permits, and licences granted by public 
authorities. we may be faced with a claim 
for acceptance of any transfer, possibly with 
additional terms and conditions, if the danish 
state holds less than 50 % of the share capital 
or voting rights in Ørsted a/s. read more in 
note 6.1 ‘interest-bearing debt’.

3.3  acquisition of enterprises
accounting policies
acquisition of enterprises are recognised using the 
acquisition method whereby assets and liabilities as 
well as contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprise 
are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition. 
the fair value of production assets and assets under 
construction are normally determined using an income 
approach where they are valued at present value 
based on the expected cash flows they can generate, 
including any non-separable power purchase agree-
ments, and on income, such as production tax credits.
the fair value of derivatives is determined using our 
normal approach for such items which is based on 
market prices or expectations for prices over the term 
of the derivatives.
the fair values of other assets and liabilities are 
valued using the approach we find most relevant 
for the individual item, which can be either a market 
approach, an income approach, or a cost approach.
an acquired enterprise is included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date of acquisition, 
which is the date when we obtain control.
when an acquired enterprise has entered into a 
power purchase agreement classified as a derivative, 
the fair value of the agreement will be included in 
the opening balance. post-acquisition, this fair value 
is recognised as an adjustment to revenue over the 
duration of the contract, based on the fair value 
calculation at the time of the acquisition.
we also paid dkk 148 million for the acquis-
tion of coronal energy’s development business 
(onshore) and recognised a contingent 
payment of dkk 50 million.

the gain on the divestment was dkk 10,900 
million, and the total cash flows amounted to 
dkk 20,447 million. transferred cash and cash 
equivalents totalled dkk 1,513 million.
further, we divested our loss-making lng 
business to glencore. the loss on the divest-
ment was dkk 42 million, and the cash flow

accounting policies
we recognise income from divested enterprises in the 
income statement up until the date of divestment.
the date of divestment is the date on which we 
relinquish control of the divested enterprise.
gains or losses on the divestment or discontinuation 
of subsidiaries and associates are determined as the 
difference between the selling price and the carrying 
amount of the net assets divested.
moreover, we deduct any provisions made for obli-
gations related to sales and purchase agreements 
and the fees of advisers, etc., in connection with the 
divestment or discontinuation of the enterprise.

3.6  assets classified  
as held for sale
at 31 december 2020, assets and related 
liabilities held for sale comprised our oil pipe 
system in denmark which is an activity in
markets & bioenergy.
assets classified as held for sale at  
31 december 2019 comprised our danish 
power distribution, residental customer, and 
city light businesses, our oil pipe system in 
denmark, and our lng business. the power 
distribution, residental customer, and city light 
businesses as well as the lng business were 
all divested in 2020. see note 3.4.
accounting policies
assets classified as held for sale comprise assets and 
liabilities, the values of which are highly probable to 
be recovered through a sale within 12 months rather 
than through continued use. 
assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are 
measured at the carrying amount at the time of 
classification as ‘held for sale’ or at market value less 
selling costs, whichever is lower. the carrying amount 
is measured in accordance with the group’s accounting 
policies. no depreciation or amortisation is effected 
on intangible assets, and prop er ty, plant, and equip-
ment from the time of classification as ‘held for sale’.
when we divest an offshore wind farm, the retaining 
interest typically represents a joint operation. since 
we retain a direct interest in the underlying assets and 
liabilities after the disposal, the assets and liabilities 
disposed off are not classified as held for sale. 
3.7 discontinued 
operations
discontinued operations related to our oil & 
gas business which was sold to ineos in 2017. 
as the remaining selling price was received in 
2020, we ended the reporting on discontinued 
operations per 31 december 2020. provisions 
regarding tax indemnifications and  payments 
related to the fredericia stabilisation plant 
(dkk 705 million) were transferred to 
 continuing operations at 31 december 2020.
financial results 
profit (loss) in 2020 amounted to dkk -11 
million (2019: dkk -56 million).
total cash flows in 2020 amounted to 
dkk 966 million (2019: dkk 174 million), of 
which dkk -76 million were from operating 
activities and primarily concerned payments 
related to the fredericia stabilisation plant. 
cash flows from investing activities amounted 
to dkk 1,042 million and primarily comprised 
the receipt of the remaining selling price 
receivables of dkk 1,001 million in total.

3.8  non-controlling interests
accounting policies
transactions with non-controlling interests are 
accounted for as transactions with the shareholder 
base.
gains and losses on the divestment of equity invest-
ments to non-controlling interests are recognised in 
equity when the divestment does not result in a loss 
of control. 
net assets acquired are not revalued on the acquisi-
tion of non-controlling interests. any difference 
between the carrying amount and the acquisition 
or selling price is recognised in equity.
in the table, we provide 
financial information for 
subsidiaries with signifi-
cant non-controlling 
interests. the amounts 
stated are the con-
solidated accounting 
figures of the individual 
enterprises or groups, 
determined according to 
our accounting policies. 
amounts are stated 
before intra-group 
eliminations.

our key working capital items consist of 
inventories, net contract assets, trade 
receivables and payables, and tax equity 
liabilities.
working capital items vary with the seasonal 
variations in our generation and sales  activities 
during the year. 
our net contract assets primarily relate to 
prepayments from heat customers in connec-
tion with bioconversions and construction of 
offshore wind farms for partners. 
the net contract assets vary within and 
across years, depending on the portfolio of 
offshore construction assets, and when we 
reach certain milestones and trigger pay-
ments from our partners.

‘work in progress and related trade payables’ 
consists of inventories related to transmission assets, 
construction agreements, and construction manage-
ment agreements in connection with the construc-
tion of transmission assets and offshore wind farms 
for partners as well as related trade payables. 
construction of offshore transmission assets in 
the uk, which are recognised as inventories, will 
continue to tie up cash until they are divested. 
tax equity liabilities also vary within and 
across years. this is due to the fact that we 
receive cash contributions from tax equity 
partners at the point in time when a us wind 
farm enters into operation.
trade payables relating to capital investments 
are not included in this section, as they are 
presented as part of the cash flows from 
investing activities.

offshore transmission assets are measured at 
cost. the costs comprise costs of materials used 
in construction, site labour costs, costs of renting 
 equipment as well as indirect production costs, 
such as employee costs.
 
gas storage in non-danish facilities are managed 
on a fair value basis, and therefore the gas in these 
storage facilities is recognised at fair value less costs 
to sell. changes in the fair value less costs to sell 
4.1 inventories
are recognised in cost of sales in the period of the 
change. 
gas in danish storage facilities are recognised at cost, 
determined as a weighted average of the previous 
months purchase price, including transportation costs.
purchased carbon emission allowances are  measured 
at market value.
green certificates, which we earn by generating 
 power using renewable energy sources, are recog-
nised in inventories in step with our generation. 
we measure green certificates (earned and bought) 
at cost using the first in, first out (fifo) principle. 
other inventories are measured at cost, determined 
on a first in, first out basis or net realisable value, 
if net realisable value is lower. 
inventories are written down to the lower of net 
realisable value and cost price. for offshore trans-
mission assets, it is the expected final transfer value 
announced by ofgem.
the net realisable value is the sum (discounted) 
which the inventories are expected to generate 
through a normal sale.
we use biomass, coal, gas, and, to a limited 
extent, oil as fuel at our chp plants. green 
certificates are primarily renewable obligation 
certificates (rocs) which are issued to power 
generators sourcing from renewable energy 
sources in the uk.
gas at storage primarily relates to our gas 
trade activities. 
4.2  contract assets 
and liabilities
contract assets and contract liabilities are 
primarily related to: 
–  the construction of offshore wind farms with 
partners, with each party usually owning 
 
50 % of the offshore wind farm 
–  prepayments from heat customers. 
at the end of 2020, contract assets relates to 
the coastal virginia wind project in the us.
at the end of 2019, contract assets and 
liabilities regarding construction agreements 
relates to our partners’ share of the offshore 
wind farm hornsea 1 and the coastal virginia 
wind project in the us.
non-current contract liabilities primarily relate 
to prepayments from heat customers.

the table shows the amount of our revenue relating 
to contract liabilities carried forward (as prepayments 
and deferred revenue) and the amount relating to 
performance obligations satisfied in a prior year 
(e.g. renegotiations or constraints on variable consider-
ations that are not recognised until they are highly 
probable). 
accounting policies
we recognise a contract asset when we perform 
a service or transfer goods in advance of receiving 
consideration, and the consideration is conditional. 
when the consideration is unconditional, and the 
goods or services are delivered, we recognise a receiv-
able. a right to consideration is unconditional if only 
the passage of time is required before the payment is 
due. contract assets are measured at the transac-
tion price of the good or services which we have 
performed less invoicing on account. we recognise a 
contract liability when the invoicing on account and 
expected losses exceed the transaction price of the 
goods or services transferred to our customer. 
inventories measured at 
fair value are disclosed 
in note 7.7 ‘fair value 
measurement’.

accounting policies
we keep our receivables until maturity, and therefore, 
they are measured at amortised cost.
write-downs are carried out from initial recognition 
of our receivables. the write-down is calculated as 
the difference between the carrying amount of the 
receivable and the net present value of expected 
future cash flows from the receivable. the discount 
rate used is the effective interest rate for the 
 individual receivable or the individual portfolio.
 
we apply the simplified approach to the write-down 
of trade receivables, which permits calculating the 
write-down as the full loss during the entire term of 
the receivable.
we continuously perform credit ratings of 
our customers, as described in note 7.5 ‘credit 
risks’. for  customers with a general credit 
risk, a write-down of 0-1 % is carried out on 
initial recognition. in 2020, write-downs of 
receivables and losses for the year were 
dkk 185 million (2019: dkk 33  million).

as at 31 december 
2020, we have seven 
onshore wind farms and 
one offshore wind farm 
in operation for which 
we have received tax 
equity contributions.
the partner’s agreed return is expensed as a financial 
expense and is recognised as an increase of the tax 
equity liability. ptcs and other tax attributes trans-
ferred to the tax equity partner are recognised as 
other operating income. tax attributes allocated to 
the tax equity partner are deferred and recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated contrac-
tual length of the partnership structure, while ptcs 
are recognised in the periods earned, similar to 
recognition of our own ptcs.
in addition to the above, we recognise a liability for 
the expected purchase price for the partner’s post-
flip rights to cash distributions. this liability is recog-
nised at fair value, and adjustments are expensed 
as a financial item. this recognition reflects the 
intention and high  likelihood that we will purchase 
the partner’s post-flip rights, and they are part of the 
financial costs of the arrangement. 
if we choose not to buy the partner’s post-flip rights, 
the tax equity partner will be entitled to part of the 
company’s returns in the post-flip period. at that 
point, the partner will share in the risks and rewards 
in the company as a shareholder and will be consid-
ered a non-controlling interest.
in the us, we have several wind farms with 
tax equity partners. during 2020, we commis-
sioned the onshore wind farms sage draw, 
plum creek, and willow creek and received 
tax equity contributions from our partner. 
in 2019, we commissioned the onshore wind 
farm lockett with a tax equity partner. 
description of tax equity partnerships
tax equity partnerships are characterised 
by a tax equity partner who contributes an 
upfront payment as part of the initial project 
investment and does not have an operational 
role in the project. the partner receives a 
contractually agreed return on the contribu-
tion. in order to ‘repay’ the initial contribution 
and the return, a disproportionate share of 
the production tax credits (ptcs) and other 
tax attributes (accelerated tax depreciation 
and other taxable results) are allocated to the 
partner during the first part of the project’s 
lifetime. the partner also receives some cash 
payment-based percentages specified in the 
partnership agreements. once the partner 
receives the agreed return, the agreement 
flips, and the partner is typically entitled to 
a minor part of the cash distributions from the 
project, unless we repurchase this right from 
them, which is highly likely.
accounting policies
when a tax equity partnership is formed, we evalu-
ate if the company should still be fully consolidated 
based on our right to variable returns as well as our 
ability to exercise influence on financial and opera-
tional  decisions impacting those returns. due to the 
operational and financial nature of the projects and 
the influence normally given to tax equity partners 
in such agreements, we normally have the influ-
ence to fully consolidate companies that have tax 
equity partners. 
the terms of the tax equity partner’s contribution are 
evaluated to determine the accounting treatment. 
the contribution generally has the characteristics 
of a liability as the initial contribution is repaid, 
including an agreed return, and the partner does not 
share in the risks of the project in the same way as a 
shareholder. as such, the contribution is accounted 
for as a liability and measured at amortised cost. 
the liability is based on the expected method of 
repayment and is divided into: 
–  a net working-capital element to be repaid 
through ptcs and other tax attributes
–  an interest-bearing debt element expected to be 
repaid through cash distributions.

supplier payments related to the construction 
of offshore wind farms for partners (hornsea 1) 
as well as offshore transmission assets in the 
uk (hornsea 2), partly offset by the divestment 
of the offshore transmission asset at walney

in Ørsted, we wish to provide user-friendly 
information about our tax positions. by 
drawing inspiration from the standard gri 
207: tax, we have increased the transparency 
of our reporting in a standardised manner. 
we believe that taxes are a core part of our 
corporate social responsibility. at Ørsted, we 
are committed to conducting our business in 
a way that contributes to the un sustainable 
development goals (sdgs). taxes are a key 
contribution to the sdgs, in particular target 
16.6 on the development of effective, account-
able, and transparent institutions. 
taxes are overseen by the board of directors 
who is accountable for the tax policy. the 
responsibility for tax risk management lies 
with the cfo and is overseen by the audit & 
risk committee. the day-to-day tax manage-
ment is handled by a centralised global tax 
team who is involved in all significant business 
developments. 
we have a clear responsibility to comply with 
the laws in the countries where we operate. 
we choose to do this by aiming to comply not 
only with the letter of the law, but also with 
the underlying tax policy intent.
5.1 approach to taxes
in december 2019, the gri 207: tax standard 
was adopted with effect for reports published 
after 1 january 2021. we have drawn inspira-
tion from the standard when presenting our 
approach to and reporting of tax.
management has been provided with a state-
ment (isrs 4400 - agreed upon procedures) from 
our auditors on our application of gri 207: tax.
tax stakeholder engagement 
in line with our tax policy, we engage construc-
tively in national and international dialogue 
with governments, business groups, and civil 
 society to support the development of effec-
tive tax systems, legislation, and administration.
during 2020, our engagement consisted 
mainly of the following: participation in a 
public hearing in the danish parliament on 
cfc taxation, participation in the tax dialogue 
project, meetings with ngos, submission of 
responses to oecd’s public consultations on 
cbc reporting, pillar i, and pillar ii, participa-
tion in the tax panel meetings of the danish 
confederation of enterprises, and participa-
tion in biac’s workgroup on oecd’s pillar ii.
the purpose of our engagement is to support 
the development of robust and sustainable 
tax legislation and practice by contributing to 
an informed discussion. by engaging with civil 
society and gathering input on, for example, 
how we share information, we believe we can 
contribute to rebuilding the public’s confidence 
in the corporate tax system. as an example, 
feedback received in the tax dialogue project 
aided our decision to update our 2020 tax 
reporting by drawing inspiration from the 
gri 207: tax standard.
tax risk management and controls
complying with tax rules can be complex as 
the interpretation of legislation and case law 
may not always be clear cut and may change 
over time, giving rise to tax risks. we manage 
our tax risks by the prevention of unnecessary 
disputes, which we strive to achieve through 
strong technical positions, clear explanations 
of our positions, thorough documentation, and 
strong compliance procedures.
we define a tax risk as any consequence relat-
ing to: the application of our tax policy, day-
to-day operations, compliance, or external 
reporting that impacts the business in form of 
cash liabilities, financial statement errors or 
misstatements, or reputational damage.
to ensure a coordinated assessment of tax 
risks, Ørsted’s tax function is involved in the 
planning and implementation as well as docu-
mentation of all significant new processes. 
our risk appetite is governed by the ‘more 
likely than not’ approach. 
for more details on our approach to taxes, 
we refer to our tax policy which can be found 
here: orsted.com/taxpolicy.

uncertain tax positions
our tax risk management work includes tak-
ing into account uncertain tax positions, e.g. 
when we have taken a position where there is 
an uncertainty created by a comparison of the 
wording of the law, the expressed policy intent 
or lack thereof, or fluctuating or divergent ap-
plication by tax authorities or judicial systems 
in countries where we operate.
tax controversies
in an administrative decision, the danish tax 
agency has concluded that Ørsted wind pow-
er a/s has not acted at arm’s length terms and 
conditions when charging fees for technical 
services provided to two project companies 
for the walney extension and hornsea 1 
offshore wind farms in the uk during the 
development phase.
the decision entails an additional tax payable 
of dkk 5.1 billion for the income years 2015 
and 2016 plus interest. we dispute the deci-
sion, and we have lodged an appeal with the 
danish national tax tribunal and also filed an 
application for mutual agreement procedure 
between the competent authorities of the 
danish tax agency and her majesty’s revenue 
& customs under both the eu arbitration 
convention and the relevant double tax 
agreement, including the multilateral instru-
ment. we have further requested a deferral of 
payment until the case is finally decided. our 
application for mutual agreement procedure 
under both instruments has been confirmed as 
admissible by the danish and uk competent 
authorities. our request for a deferral of pay-
ment until the case is finally decided has been 
accepted by the danish tax agency.
we seek to avoid unnecessary disputes, but 
recognise that in our business, which involves 
large amounts, cross-border payments, and 
activities in highly regulated sectors, there will 
inevitably be a number of claims from the na-
tional tax authorities in the markets where we 
operate that cannot be avoided. in response 
to these risks, including the current contro-
versy involving the development fees for the 
walney extension and hornsea 1 offshore wind 
farms, we have made tax-related provisions in 
accordance with ias 12, ias 37, and relevant 
interpretations, such as ifric 23. the provi-
sions have been calculated on the basis of 
differences in tax rates and statistical risks of 
suffering economic or legal double taxation.
tax controls
within Ørsted, the main control is our four-eye 
review principle. this means that all our work 
is reviewed by a colleague. tax decisions in 
relation to matters which are subjected to 
approval by management are approved by 
the head of tax.
tax planning and use of tax incentives
we only use business structures that are 
driven by commercial considerations, aligned 
with business activity. we do not use so-called 
secrecy jurisdictions or tax havens to avoid 
taxes. if we establish an entity in a low or nil-
rate jurisdiction, it will be for substantive and 
commercial reasons. we pay tax on profits ac-
cording to where value is created. in order to 
remain competitive, we make use of incentives 
and tax relief implemented by governments 
where we have commercial substance.
danish cfc taxation
denmark has proposed to introduce the cfc 
rules in the eu anti-tax avoidance directive. 
these rules have been proposed several times, 
most recently in november 2020, but have 
so far failed to secure a political majority in 
the danish parliament. it was announced in 
december 2020 that the latest draft bill would 
not be passed before the end of 2020, and 
that a public hearing will be conducted on the 
rules during 2021. we expect the revised cfc 
rules to enter into force during the course of 
2021, but the exact timing is unknown. 
the overarching purpose of the cfc rules is 
to prevent companies from undermining the 
domestic tax base by moving mobile income 
to low-tax jurisdictions. in such scenarios, the 
cfc rules will ensure that the income will still 
be subject to domestic taxation.
pursuant to the eu anti-tax avoidance 
 directive, a foreign subsidiary shall be 
considered to be a cfc company if more than 
one-third of its income consists of cfc income. 
‘other income from intangible property’ is now 
considered cfc income, but as of yet, there 
is very little guidance on how to calculate 
such income.
the eu directive exempts subsidiaries from 
the cfc rules if they have real commercial 
activity, or if they are not situated in a low-tax 
jurisdiction. in the latest published draft bill, 
denmark has chosen not to include any of 
these exceptions. unless such exemptions are 
included in a revised draft bill, operational for-
eign subsidiaries which have been established 
for commercial purposes can be considered to 
be cfc companies regardless of whether the 
corporate residential tax rate is lower, higher, 
or the same as in denmark. we see this as a 
risk and have, in public consultations, proposed 
that a substance exemption is included in the 
danish cfc rules in order to not place danish 
companies at a competitive disadvantage.

income tax 
tax on business performance profit (loss) was 
dkk 2,123 million in 2020 against dkk 2,756 
million in 2019. the effective tax rate was 11 % 
in 2020 against 31 % in 2019.
the effective tax rate for 2020 (11 %) was primar-
ily affected by the largely tax-exempt sale of our 
danish power distribution business and related 
activities as well as recognition of a tax liability 
in connection with tax equity partnerships relat-
ed to the onshore wind farms sage draw, plum 
creek, and willow creek (see more regarding 
tax equity partnerships in notes 4.5 ‘tax equity 
liabilities’ and 5.3 ‘deferred tax’). 
 accounting policies
tax for the year consists of current tax, changes in 
deferred tax, and adjustments in respect of previous 
years. tax on profit (loss) for the year is recognised in 
the income statement. tax relating to other items is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are 
measured as follows:
5.2 tax on profit (loss) for the year
non-taxable income and non-deductible 
expenses primarily relate to the divestment 
of the danish power distribution, residential 
customer, and city light businesses. see more 
in note 3.4 ‘divestment of enterprises’.
the movement in uncertain tax positions is a 
consequence of reassessment of a calculated 
uncertain tax position.
the adjustment of tax concerning previous 
years primarily relates to a realised discount 
on payment for utilisation of tax losses in
the uk.
the effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily 
affected by the sale of assets in certain wind 
farm projects to a partner in the us as well 
as the tax equity partnership related to the 
onshore wind farm lockett.
key accounting estimate
estimates regarding recognition of income taxes
Ørsted is subject to income taxes in all the coun-
tries where we operate. significant judgement and 
estimates are required in determining the wordwide 
income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, 
 including provisions for uncertain tax positions.
in the course of conducting business around the 
world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax 
authorities may occur due to the complex nature 
of the tax rules related to the business. judgement 
is applied to assess the possible outcome of such 
disputes. we apply the methods prescribed in ifric 
23 ‘uncertainty over income tax treatments’ when 
making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and the 
provisions made are based on different scenarios of 
possible outcomes. we consider the provisions made 
to be adequate. however, the actual obligation may 
deviate and might lead to additional tax in excess 
of provisions included as uncertain tax provisions 
 depending on the result of litigations and settlements 
with the relevant tax authorities. 
ongoing tax disputes, primarily related to transfer 
pricing cases, are included as part of ‘income tax’ and 
‘deferred tax’. estimates in respect of transfer pricing 
cases include among others whether corresponding 
adjustments can be obtained in the relevant juris-
dictions, and, in terms of disputes regarding project 
companies with partners, whether compensation 
can be obtained from these partners. any expected 
compensation from partners are included as part of 
‘other receivables’.
–  the most-likely-outcome method is applied in 
cases where there are only two possible outcomes.
–  the weighted-average method is used in cases 
where there are more than two possible outcomes. 
the liability is recognised under ‘income tax’ or 
‘ deferred tax’, depending on how the realisation of 
the tax position will affect the financial statement.

continuing operations. 
tax on hybrid capital 
was included in current 
tax in 2019.
tax on profit (loss) for the year and other 
comprehensive income 
in 2020, tax on ifrs profit (loss) for the year 
amounted to dkk 1,776 million, consisting of 
current tax expenses of dkk 2,735 million, 
changes in deferred tax of dkk 1,635 million, 
changes in tax rates of dkk 138 million, un-
certain tax positions of dkk 101 million, hybrid 
capital tax of dkk 107 million, tax equity 
of dkk 903 million, and adjustments of tax 
concerning previous years of dkk 83 million.
current tax 
current tax is the payable tax expense 
incurred in Ørsted on profit for the year. this 
differs from taxes paid as a result of payments 
or refunds regarding prior years and residual 
payments for the current year. 
because of the high level of investments and 
the subsequent deferrals of payable tax as a 
consequence of accelerated tax depreciation, 
our current tax is generally lower than the 
statutory corporate tax rates during construc-
tion and the initial years after first power from 
a wind farm. the current tax for 2020 has 
decreased compared to 2019 because there 
was no tax related to construction agree-
ments in 2020.
effective current tax rate (ifrs), 2020, %
the figure shows the

between deferred tax 
and current tax.

5.3 deferred tax
development in deferred tax
in 2020, net deferred tax assets increased. 
the effect primarily related to the update of 
the hornsea 1 transmission asset divestment 
assumptions, variance on long-term liabil-
ities, and financial instruments as well as 
adjustments to previous years’ deferred tax 
in the uk. the recognition of the deferred 
tax liability was increased because of our tax 
equity partnerships. in 2019, the net deferred 
tax assets were also impacted by hornsea 
1 since current tax on the deferred gain was 
triggered when construction was completed.
deferred tax by segment
net deferred tax in our segments primarily 
concerned the following:
–  offshore: a deferred tax asset is recognised 
related to tax loss carryforwards and 
internal gains on construction agreements. 
the deferred tax asset is partially offset 
by a  deferred tax liability as a result of 
accelerated tax depreciation compared to 
accounting depreciation regarding property, 
plant, and equipment.
–  onshore: a deferred tax liability is recog-
nised related to wind farm assets in tax 
equity structures.
–  markets & bioenergy: a deferred tax liability 
related to financial instruments and accel-
erated tax depreciation on property, plant, 
and equipment is recognised. 
–  other activities/eliminations comprised 
intra-group eliminations in the joint taxation 
across segments.

accounting policies
deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts. 
however, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of 
temporary differences relating to: 
–  the acquisition of joint operations, including 
licence interests
–  other items where differences arise at the time of 
acquisition, affecting neither the profit (loss) for 
the year nor the taxable income. however, this 
does not include differences arising in connection 
with company acquisitions.
deferred tax is measured depending on how we plan 
to use the assets and settle the liabilities. we set off 
tax assets and liabilities when the tax assets can be 
offset against tax liabilities in the year in which the 
deferred tax assets are expected to be used. 
deferred tax assets are recognised at the value at 
which they are expected to be used. they may be 
offset against future earnings. this is done within a 
joint taxation scheme. due to timing differences in re-
alisation and utilisation of losses, the uk consortium 
relief rules are not considered to be a joint taxation. 
this means that tax losses resulting from acceler-
ated tax depreciation are accounted for as tax loss 
carryforwards until they are used, instead of being 
used to offset taxable income in the same year in 
affiliated companies. the result is a disproportionate 
current tax on the overall profits. intra-group gains 
and losses are eliminated. tax losses carried forward 
in jurisdictions where we have a history of losses are 
recognised based on other convincing evidence of 
future profits. 
deferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and 
rates applying when the deferred tax becomes current 
tax. changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in 
tax rates are recognised in profit (loss) for the year. 
deferred tax (net liability) related to the tax equity 
structures is recognised as tax income in the income 
statement when we take over the agreements. the 
liability recognised is the amount that we expect 
to take over once the contribution from the equity 
partner is repaid, and the tax equity structure flips.
for tax purposes, depreciation on fixed assets is 
typically accelerated compared with accounting 
purposes. as the accelerated depreciation is larger 
than our taxable profits when we make large invest-
ments, our tax loss carryforwards increase when 
more wind farms enter into operation. the tax loss 
carryforwards are either offset against deferred tax 
liabilities on the same wind farm or jurisdiction or 
offset against expected future profits from the very 
same wind farm or jurisdiction. 
significant movements in deferred tax 
assets and liabilities
movements for the year primarily consist of an 
increase in tax loss carryforwards as a result of 
accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, an 
increase in deferred tax assets regarding the 
hornsea 1 transmission asset, and a prior year 
adjustment regarding the reclassification of 
losses in the uk in 2019.

5.4 our tax footprint
Ørsted’s tax footprint is an effect of how and 
where we conduct our business.
we have paid dkk 1,118 million in corporate in-
come taxes in 2020, of which dkk 412 million 
related to residual tax for 2019. at the end of 
the year, we expect to have a residual tax of 
dkk 109 million regarding 2020, primarily due 
to movement in financial instruments in the 
last quarter of 2020.
local taxes paid
we have made significant investments in 
offshore wind farms in the uk, germany, the 
netherlands, the us, and taiwan, resulting in 
the accumulation of large tax assets in recent 
years. accordingly, we have not paid signifi-
cant taxes in these countries historically. this is 
changing as the offshore wind farms are being 
commissioned and generating positive taxable 
income, resulting currently in paid taxes in the 
uk and taiwan. we expect to start paying 
corporate tax in the netherlands in 2021 and in 
germany in 2022.
we are also continuously investing in the us; 
however, we do expect to pay tax in the us in 
2022-2024, due to the commercial structural 
set-up in the us.
a wind farm life cycle
Ørsted operates in several countries (see our 
global footprint in the management’s review). 
the design of the individual tax regime in each 
jurisdiction impacts the tax over the life cycle 
of our investments and thereby the timing of 
when we pay tax.
a wind farm life cycle begins with the 
development phase. this includes opportu-
nity screening, if applicable, bid preparation, 
obtaining land rights, grid connection, and 
permits. the latter activities are further ma-
tured if an investment decision is made, and 
the construction phase commences, which 
includes construction of the wind farm. during 
both phases, product, people, and property 
taxes are borne or collected (see our total tax 
contribution section).
when the wind farm is commissioned and put 
into operation, income and positive cash flow 
are generated. in many cases, the effect of tax 
incentives results in a deferral of taxable income 
compared to profit before tax for accounting 
purposes. conversely, once the deferral ends, 
the taxable income related to the wind farm will 
exceed the accounting profit. for this reason, the 
applicable corporate tax rate and cash tax paid 
will always differ, but accumulated over the 
lifetime of the wind farm, they will be identical.

development activities results in negative cash 
flow in the beginning of the project life cycle. 
during construction, the capital employed 
accelerates materially. positive income begins 
when the project enters operation.
furthermore, in many of the jurisdictions 
where we operate, there are mandatory or 
voluntary tax groupings. this means that we 
will only pay tax on the consolidated result of 
all of our activities in that country. as a result, 
continued significant investments in such a 
country may further defer the time at which 
we pay taxes in that country.

taxes
total tax contribution
according to the oecd classification, tax is a 
compulsory unrequited payment to general 
government. this means a payment paid by 
Ørsted to the government, including amounts 
paid through an agent. tax does not result in 
a return of value to Ørsted for a right or asset 
used in the business.
taxes borne by Ørsted are those that rep-
resent a direct cost and are reflected in the 
financial result. taxes borne are charged to 
the profit and loss account.
taxes collected are those which are generated 
by Ørsted’s operations, but do not constitute 
a tax liability for Ørsted. Ørsted generates 
the commercial activity that gives rise to 
the  taxes and then collects and administers 
them on behalf of the tax authorities in the 
countries where we operate.
total tax contribution is highly impacted by 
collection of vat, sales taxes, duties as well 
as profit taxes.

country-by-country reporting
in order to increase transparency, we present 
key figures on tax jurisdiction levels below. 
Ørsted’s country-by-country reporting widely 
follows the gri 207: tax standard. corporate 
the table shows reporting of financial, economic, 
and tax-related information for each jurisdiction 
where we operate. this information can be compared 
with our total tax contribution. our tax contributions 
reflect that some of our development and construc-
tion activities have been based in denmark, and that 
our operations in the coming years are beginning to 
ramp up in markets that have been developed. also, 
our presence and the corresponding tax position 
is affected by hedging, which is primarily handled 
centrally in denmark
income tax is based on ifrs reporting stan-
dards instead of gri methodology to ensure 
internal coherence throughout the annual 
report. the tax incentives provided on green 
investments defer our tax payments, resulting 
in a difference between profit (loss) in the 
accounts and taxable income during the life 
cycle of a wind farm. this is applicable in most 
of the countries where we operate.

6. capital structure
an appropriate capital structure is important 
to ensure we have the ability to raise new 
debt at attractive terms. 
in 2020, we issued new green senior bonds 
with a total proceed of dkk 3,277 million, 
consisting of ntd 15 billion.
all new bonds were issued in accordance 
with our green finance framework. 
in the coming years, we expect to raise new 
debt to partly fund our dkk 200 billion 
investment programme covering the period 
2019-2025.
capital structure 
to ensure the financial strength to operate 
in the international energy and capital 
markets and secure financing on attractive 
terms, we have defined credit rating and 
capital  structure targets. the overarching 
capital structure targets are a credit rating 
of baa1/bbb+ and an ffo/adjusted net debt 
credit metric of around 30 %.
financing policy
the aim of our financing policy is to ensure 
that hedging needs and the best possible 
financing arrangements are taken into 
account, while also minimising financing costs, 
liquidity, and refinancing risks. 
the borrowing activities are diversified among 
various funding sources and maturities. in 
addition, we have robust financial resources. 
our borrowing activities are primarily 
consolidated in the parent company where 
cash resources are available to the group 
companies via an internal bank.

cash management
one of the most significant cash management 
objectives is to secure sufficient and flexible

to-day operations, investment programme,

therefore, we define minimum financial

we maintain robust financial resources to 
limit the company’s sensitivity to unrest in

respectively.
credit facilities
furthermore, we had non-cancellable credit 
facilities of dkk 15,758 million at 31 december 
2020 (2019: dkk 15,990 million) with a number 
of scandinavian, international, and local 
taiwanese banks. in connection with these 
credit facilities, we may be met with  demands 
for cancellation and repayment of any drawn 
amount in the event of shareholders other 
than a group consisting of the danish state 
and danish power distribution companies 
 controlling more than 50 % of the share 
capital or voting rights in Ørsted a/s or in the 
event of the danish state ceasing to hold at 
least 20 % of the share capital. our financing 
agreements are not subject to any other 
unusual terms or conditions. 
accounting policies
bond debt, bank debt, and other payables are 
recognised at inception at market value (typically 
proceeds received) net of transaction costs incurred. 
in subsequent periods, the liabilities are measured at 
amortised cost, so that the difference between the 
cost (proceeds) and the nominal value is recognised 
in profit (loss) for the year as interest expenses over 
the term of the loan, using the effective interest 
rate method.
financial liabilities are classified as current, unless 
the group has an unconditional right to defer settle-
ment of the liability to at least one year after the 
balance sheet date. 
the market value of issued bonds has been 
 determined as the market value at 31 december 
(level 1 – quoted prices).
the market value of bank loans has been determined 
as the present value of expected future instalments 
and interest payments using the group’s current 
interest rate on loans as the discount rate (level 2 
– observable inputs).
moody’s, and fitch, which is in line with our 
target. ffo/adjusted interest-bearing net debt 
was 48.3 % in 2020, in line with our target. 
loan arrangements
at 31 december 2020, we had loan obligations 
totalling dkk 1,642 million (2019: dkk 1,861 mil-
lion) to the european investment bank and the 
nordic investment bank. the loans are recog-
nised in the balance sheet under bank debt. 
the loans offered by these multilateral financial 
institutions include loans to co-fund infrastruc-
ture and energy projects on favourable terms 
and with maturities exceeding those normally 
available in the commercial banking market. in 
connection with these loans, the group may be 
met with demands for repayment or collateral 
in the event of the danish state holding less 
than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in 
Ørsted a/s (change of control) or for repayment 
in the event of moody’s or standard & poor’s 
interest-bearing net debt
interest-bearing net debt totalled dkk 12,343 
million at the end of 2020, a decrease of 
dkk 4,887 million relative to 2019. the de-
crease in interest-bearing net debt consists 
of a increase in interest-bearing debt of 
dkk 1,020 million and an increase in interest -
bearing assets of dkk 5,907 million.
in november, we issued a total of ntd 15 
billion (dkk 3,277 million) in new green bonds, 
split on 3 separate issues:
–  ntd 4 billion (dkk 874 million), 0.6 % 
 interest, maturing in november 2027.
–  ntd 3 billion (dkk 655 million), 0.70 % 
interest, maturing in november 2030.
–  ntd 8 billion (dkk 1,748 million), 0.98 %

foreign currency translation reserve 
the foreign currency translation reserve comprises:
–  exchange rate adjustments arising on translation 
of the financial statements of foreign entities 
with a currency that is not the group’s functional 
currency
–  exchange rate adjustments relating to loans that 
form part of our net investment in such entities 
–  exchange rate adjustments relating to hedging 
transactions on our net investment in such entities. 
on realisation or partial realisation of the net
investment, the exchange rate adjustments are 
recognised in profit (loss) for the year if a foreign 
exchange gain (loss) is realised by the divested entity. 
the foreign exchange gain (loss) is transferred to the 
item in which the gain (loss) is recognised.
hedging reserve
the hedging reserve covers:
–  hedging of net investments in foreign operations
–  cash flow hedging of currency risks, inflation risks 
associated with revenue, and power price risk
–  cash flow hedging of interest expenses and the 
currency risk associated with the construction of 
offshore wind farms. 
deferred costs of hedging
changes in the basic spread on currency swaps and 
time value of options are included in deferred costs 
of hedging.
share premium reserve
retained earnings include the share premium reserve 
of dkk 21,279 million (2019: 21,279 million), represent-
ing the excess of the amount of subscribed-for share 
capital over the nominal value of these shares in 
connection with capital injections.

we have issued hybrid capital which is sub-
ordinate to our other creditors. the purpose 
of issuing hybrid capital is to strengthen 
our  capital base and fund our investments. 
we have issued eur hybrid bonds with a 
total nominal value of eur 1,800 million, 
equivalent to dkk 13,398 million 
(2019: eur 1,876 million, equivalent to 
dkk 14,019 million). 
in 2020, we have redeemed the remaining 
outstanding eur 76 million on our 3015 bond.
for hybrid bonds, we may defer coupon pay-
ments to bond holders and ultimately decide 
not to pay them at maturity. deferred coupon 
payments become payable, however, if we 
decide to pay dividends to our shareholders or 
pay coupon payments on other hybrid bonds. 
as a consequence of the special terms 
regarding the hybrid bonds, these are classi-
fied as equity, and therefore coupon payments 
are recognised in equity.
accounting policies
hybrid capital comprises issued bonds that qualify for 
treatment in accordance with the rules on compound 
financial instruments due to the special characteristics 
of the bonds. the notional amount, which constitutes 
a liability, is recognised at present value, and equity 
has been increased by the difference between the net 
proceeds received and the present value of the dis-
counted liability. accordingly, any coupon payments 
are accounted for as dividends, which are recognised 
directly in equity at the time the payment obligation 
arises. this is because the coupon is discretionary, and 
therefore any deferred coupon lapses upon maturity 
of the hybrid capital. consequently, coupon payments 
do not have any effect on profit (loss) for the year.
the part of the hybrid capital that is accounted for 
as a liability is measured at amortised cost. however, 
as the carrying amount of this component amounted 
to nil on initial recognition and due to the 1,000-year 
term of the hybrid capital, amortisation charges 
will only have an impact on profit (loss) for the year 
towards the end of the 1,000-year term of the hybrid 
capital. coupon payments are recognised in the 
statement of cash flows in the same way as dividend 
payments within financing activities.
on redemption of hybrid capital, the payment will be 
distributed between liability and equity,  applying the 
same principles as used when the hybrid capital was 
issued. this means that the  difference between the 
payment on redemption and the net proceeds re-
ceived on issue is recognised directly in equity, as the 
debt portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil 
during the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.
on the date when the board of directors decides 
to exercise an option to redeem hybrid capital, the 
part of the hybrid capital that will be redeemed 
will be reclassified to loans and borrowings. the 
 reclassification will be made at the market value of 
the hybrid capital at the date the decision is made. 
coupon payments and exchange rate adjust-
ments following the reclassification to loans and 
 borrowings will be recognised in profit (loss) for the 
year as financial income or expenses.

financial resources at 31 december 2020 
amount to dkk 45,624 million 
(2019: dkk 38,244 million). the change in 
financial resources is due to an increase of 
dkk 8,629 million in securities, partially offset 
by a decrease in cash and undrawn credit 
facilities of dkk 1,017 million and dkk 232 
million, respectively. 
cash, cash equivalents, and securities
securities are a key element in our financial 
resources, and therefore investments are mainly 
made in liquid aaa-rated danish mortgage 
bonds and to a lesser extent in other bonds. 
most of the securities qualify for repo transac-
tions with the danish central bank, ‘danmarks 
nationalbank’.
securities not available for use comprise 
securities pledged as collateral for: 
–  insurance- related provisions: 
dkk 393 million at 31 december 2020  
(2019: dkk 397 million)
–  trading in financial instruments:  
dkk 356 million at 31 december 2020  
(2019: dkk 360 million).
at 31 december 2020, we had received cash 
collateral in the amount of dkk 12 million 
(2019: dkk 1,439 million) concerning the 
positive market value of derivatives.
cash not available for use comprises: 
–  collateral for insurance-related provisions: 
dkk 263 million (2019: dkk 277 million)
–  collateral for us power purchase agreements:

accounting policies
securities comprise bonds that are monitored, 
 measured, and reported at market value on an 
on going basis in conformity with the group’s 
investment policy. changes in market value are 
recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial 
income and expenses. purchase and sale of securities 
are recognised at the settlement date.
for listed securities, market value equals the market 
price, and for unlisted securities, market value is 
estimated based on generally accepted valuation 
methods and market data.
divested securities where repurchase agreements 
(repo transactions) have been made at the time 
of sale are recognised in the balance sheet at the 
settlement date as if the securities were still held. 
the amount received is recognised as a liability, 
and the difference between the selling price and 
the purchase price is recognised in profit (loss) for 
the year over the term as interest. the return on the 
securities is recognised in profit (loss) for the year.
the group’s cash needs in respect of its financial 
loans and borrowings are shown in the table 
above. the maturity analysis was determined on 
31 december. 
the maturity analysis is based on undiscounted cash 
flows, including estimated interest payments. interest 
payments are based on market conditions and 
interest -rate hedging entered into on 31 december.
the maturity analysis does not include hybrid capital 
classified as equity. at 31 december 2020, we had 
 issued hybrid capital with a notional amount totalling 
dkk 13,398 million due in 3013 (dkk 5,210 million), 
3017 (dkk 3,722 million), and 3019 (dkk 4,466 
million), respectively.
the maturity analysis for leasing is part of note

exchange rate adjustments and hedging contracts 
entered into to hedge currency risks are presented 
net under the item ‘exchange rate adjustments, net’.
exchange rate adjust ments of currency hedging are 
recognised in revenue and cost of sales with a gain of 
dkk 1,059 million (2019: a loss of dkk 1,943 million).
borrowing costs transferred to property, plant, and 
equipment under construction are calculated at the 
weighted average effective interest rate for general 
borrowing. this amounted to 3.3 % in 2020 
(2019: 4.0 %). the reduction is due to new bonds being 
issued at a lower interest rate.

7. risk management
market and credit risks are a natural part 
of our business activities and a precondition 
for being able to create value. through 
risk  management, risks are reduced to an 
 acceptable level.
currency and energy exposures
our forward-looking energy and currency 
exposures from produc tion, sales, investments, 
and divestments are presented in the figures 
to the right.
 
trading portfolio
we have a limited trading portfolio, the main 
purpose of which is to optimise the execution 
of hedging contracts and gains from short-term 
energy price fluctuations. 
the trading  activities comply with the man-
dates approved by the board of  directors.

and long-end revenue between 2021-2036.
we do not deem eur to constitute a risk, as we 
expect denmark to maintain its fixed exchange-
rate policy.
our energy exposures are significantly reduced 
due to hedging.
our main energy exposure is towards uk power 
as the uk is offshore’s largest market.

as of 1 january 2021, we will cease to use the 
business performance principle and instead begin to 
apply ifrs hedge accounting on all commodity and 
related currency hedges. as of 31 december 2020, 
we had a loss of dkk 2,685 million on our business 
performance hedges deferred to a later period. 
this amount will not impact the ifrs number, as we 
have already recognised the loss under ifrs in the 
income statement.
+1.3 bn
the value of hedging instruments (mainly inflation, 
power, and currency) that will impact the ifrs 
ebitda in the future amounts to a gain of 
dkk 1,278 million at 31 december 2020.
+0.7 bn
the deferred gains from us power purchase 
agreements (ppas) amount to dkk 736 million that 
will be recognised as revenue over the remaining life 
of the ppas.

market risks and market risk management
our most significant market risks relate to:
– energy prices
– foreign exchange rates 
– interest and inflation. 
we manage market risks to protect Ørsted 
against market price volatility and ensure 
stable and robust financial ratios that support 
our growth strategy as well as protect the 
value of our assets. 
in the short- to medium-term horizon, we 
primarily hedge future prices using derivatives 
to reduce cash flow fluctuations after tax. 
minimum hedging levels are determined by 
the board of directors. in the first two years, 
we are almost fully hedged. the degree of 
 hedging declines in subsequent years due to: 
–  reduced certainty about long-term 
 production volumes 
–  increasing hedging costs in the medium 
to long term, both spread costs and costs 
of collateral
–  adverse impacts from collateral, potentially 
tying up large amounts of capital if hedging 
contracts become unfavourable.
our long-term market risk picture is deter-
mined by our strategic asset portfolio. our 
power exposure is partly mitigated through 
long-term power purchasing agreements 
(ppas), and we use debt to manage currency, 
interest rate, and inflation risks. 
energy price risks
our consolidated energy exposure for the 
years 2021-2025 after hedging can be summa-
rised as shown in the table.

our main currency exposure stems from 
offshore wind farms in the uk, but activities 
in the us and taiwan have increased our usd 
and ntd exposures.
in general, highly certain cash flows in a 
foreign currency are hedged within the first 
five years. 
exchange rates related to energy prices in 
foreign currencies are not hedged until 
the energy price is hedged. hence, the 
gbp exchange rate associated with power 
 generation in the uk is not hedged until the 
gbp power price is hedged.
cash flows that relate to fixed tariffs and 
guaranteed minimum prices from offshore 
wind farms in the uk deviate from the main 
principle. hedging of these, less operating 
expenses, is based on a declining level of 
hedging over the five-year risk management 
horizon. the target is to hedge 100 % of the 
risk in year 1, declining by 20 percentage 
points each year, to 20 % in year 5. 
7.1 market risks 
our gbp exposure amounted to dkk 19.1 billion 
after hedging for the years 2021-2025. this 
unhedged gbp exposure stems from subsidised 
gbp income less operational expenditures.
the gbp exchange rate for hedges impacting 
ebitda in 2021 and 2022 is hedged at an 
average exchange rate of gbp/dkk 8.3 and 
8.1, respectively.
for our usd and ntd exposures from new 
 markets, we have limited existing portfolio 
against which we can net construction 
payments. therefore, we seek to hedge the 
price risk in the near term, while simultaneously 
hedging a similar, but opposite, exposure in the 
longer term. our eur risk is subject to contin-
uous assessment, but is generally not hedged, 
as we believe that denmark will maintain its 
fixed exchange-rate policy.
gbp exposures, dkkbn

the graph shows our gbp 
exposure before and after

the divestment proceeds 
from the hornsea 2 transmis-
sion asset were  previously 
expected in 2022, but are 
now expected in 2023. the 
related hedges will remain in 
2022 until we know the final 
timing of the divestment.

interest and inflation risk
to a certain extent, our medium- to long-
term earnings can be expected to follow the 
development in consumer and market prices, 
thereby protecting the real value of our assets 
and equity. this is the case for earnings related 
to our uk wind farms.
however, we are exposed to inflation risk on 
projects with fixed nominal cash flows, as an 
increase in inflation will erode the expected 
real value of the revenue. this is the case for:
–  fixed nominal subsidies from offshore 
wind assets in denmark, germany, the 
 netherlands, taiwan, and the us
–  fixed nominal power purchase agreements 
related to onshore wind assets in the us and 
offshore wind assets in europe and taiwan.
the close relationship between inflation and 
interest rates protects our equity value against 
changes in interest rates to some extent. 
we manage interest rate and inflation risk by 
matching the sensitivity of our assets with the 
sensitivity of our debt. 
the share of our debt which is fixed in nominal 
terms partially offsets the inflation risk. we 
have fixed the inflation for part of the future 
revenue from our uk offshore wind farms at an 
average retail price index (rpi) rate of 3.6 % for 
the period 2024-2037 and an average consum-
er price index (cpi) rate of 2.7 % for the period 
2030-2032. this will create a better match with 
our fixed-rate uk debt.
offshore 
earnings from power generation from offshore 
wind farms mainly comprise: 
–  fixed tariffs in denmark, germany, the 
 netherlands, the uk (cfd wind farms), 
the us, and taiwan 
–  guaranteed minimum prices for green 
 certificates in the uk (roc wind farms)
– long-term power purchase agreements 
–  sale of power at market price from our 
wind farms with market price risk. 
at the end of 2020, such fixed tariffs and 
 guaranteed minimum prices cover approx. 
86 % of the expected income from offshore 
wind farms for the period 2021-2025. the 
remaining price exposure concerns sales of 
power at market price in the uk, denmark, 
and the netherlands.
onshore
earnings from power generation from onshore 
wind farms in the us comprise tax incentives, 
such as ptcs or itcs, and power. the tax 
incentives have a fixed value. however, there 
is a price risk associated with the power which 
is reduced by entering into power purchase 
agreements (ppas). the current ppas cover 
approx. 65 % of the expected generation, 
spanning 12-15 years from the commissioning 
of the wind farm. the ppas are entered into 
with large corporates or financial institutions.
markets & bioenergy
our combined heat and power plants 
consists of biomass- and fossil-fuelled plants 
in denmark. heat generation accounts for a 
larger share of the earnings and does not give 
rise to price risks, as the associated costs are 
covered by the heat customers. however, heat 
generation often entails a price risk for power, 
as heat and power are generated simulta-
neously to a large extent. the profitability 
of power generation is determined by the 
difference between the selling price of power 
and the purchase price of fuel and carbon 
emission allowances. for our biomass-based 
power generation, we secure profitability by 
buying biomass at fixed prices and hedging the 
associated power generation. at the end of 
2020, 36 % of the expected power generation 
from our power plants in 2021 was hedged. 
the total net risk associated with the power 
plants’ power generation for the 2021-2025 
period is dkk 0.7 billion after hedging.
our price risks in markets arise from the 
purchase and sale of power and gas. the price 
risks associated with the purchase and sale 
of gas result from differences in the indexing 
of sales and purchase prices. our largest gas 
purchase contracts are mainly indexed to pure 
gas prices and thus no longer constitute a 
significant risk. 
the price risks associated with power purchases 
and sales are given by the difference between 
the purchase and sales prices. the price risk 
relates primarily to timing differences between 
purchases and sales and the related hedges 
and is therefore considered to be limited.

 generation of power before and after hedges.

economic hedging and commercial 
contracts
the purpose of economic hedging is to reduce 
our risk from generation and sale of energy. 
fluctuations in value are expected to be offset 
by the underlying exposure.
economic hedging is accounted for under the 
 business performance principle, see description 
above. 
the market value of dkk -2,216 million (2019: 
dkk -892 million) will be recognised in business 
performance profit or loss in a future period.
accounting policies
economic hedging and commercial contracts 
market value adjustments of financial contracts 
 offered to customers with a view to price hedging 
and financial instruments that have been entered 
into to hedge the group’s principal operating
activities are recognised as revenue or cost of sales.
under the business performance principle, economic 
hedging is accounted for as effective hedging. the 
 resulting market value adjustment is consequently 
deferred to the period when the hedged transaction 
affects results. see note 1.6 ‘business performance’ for 
further information. 
the contractual principal amount has been
determined as net position per derivative type.

cash flow and fair value hedging
our cash-flow hedges consist of inflation, 
power, currency, interest rate, and oil hedges.
our fair hedges consist of currency and  interest 
rate hedges.
ineffectiveness 
ineffectiveness of cash flow and fair 
 value hedging totalled dkk 0 million 
(2019: dkk 0 million). we do not experience 
 ineffectiveness on our cashflow or fair value 
accounting policies
we primarily use hedge accounting for currency, 
interest, and inflation where it is possible to use 
hedging instruments which hedge the desired 
risk one-to-one. the gbp exposure, for example, is 
hedged using gbp forward exchange contracts, gbp 
swaps, or gbp loans. thus, there are no significant 
sources of ineffectiveness. for currency swaps, the 
basic spread is accounted for according to the cost 
of the hedging model. 
to the extent that a risk needs to be hedged, and 
if there is no fully effective instrument available in 
the market, analyses are performed of the expected 
effectiveness of the hedging instrument before the 
hedging transaction is concluded. in this case, the 
ratio between the hedged risk and the hedging instru-
ment may deviate from the one-to-one  principle and 
will be determined as the ratio which most effectively 
hedges the desired risk. 
we recognise changes to the market value of 
hedging instruments that qualify for recognition as 
a hedge of future cash flows in other comprehensive 
income in the hedging reserve. on realisation of the 
hedged cash flow, the resulting gains or losses are 
transferred from equity and recognised in the same 
item as the hedged item. however, on hedging of 
proceeds from future loans, the resulting gain or loss 
is transferred from equity over the term of the loan.
when we conclude a hedging transaction, and each 
time we present financial statements thereafter, 
we assess whether the hedged exposure and the 
hedging instrument are still financially correlated. 
if the hedged cash flows are no longer expected 
to be realised, the accumulated value change is 
transferred to profit (loss) for the year.
changes in the market value of derivatives that are 
classified as hedges of the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability are recognised in profit (loss) for the 
year together with changes in the value of the hedged

our foreign activities entail currency risk. we  
hedge this currency risk by raising loans in for-
eign currencies and by entering into forward ex-
change contracts, currency swaps and options.

accounting policies
hedging of net investments in foreign subsidiaries
changes in the market value of derivatives and loans 
that are classified as net investment hedges in for-
eign  subsidiaries or associates are recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements directly in equity 
within a separate foreign currency translation reserve.
the net position 
 expresses the 
 accounting exposure. 
if, for example, the gbp/
dkk exchange rate
increased by 10 % 
on 31  december 
2020,  equity would 
have increased by 
dkk 2,017 million, 
corresponding to 10 % 
of dkk 20,172 million.

trading portfolio
the purpose of our trading portfolio is to: 
–  optimise hedging contracts
–  contribute to increased market insight
–  profit from short-term fluctuations in 
energy prices.
the trading portfolio consists primarily of 
positions in power and gas.
the trading portfolio constitutes a smaller 
part of our total portfolio of derivatives, 
and the associated risk is limited. 
when an economic hedging instrument 
(business performance hedge) does not fully 
correspond to the hedged risk, any difference 
between the hedging contract entered into 
and the hedged exposure is recognised in the 
income statement as part of the gain (loss) 
from the trading portfolio.

the contractual

the risk associated with 
our options is smaller 
than for our swaps.
trading activities are 
carried out within 
mandates approved by 
the board of directors. 
the mandates comprise 
a value-at-risk (var) 
mandate and a stress 
mandate as well as a

the graph shows the daily value-at-risk position for 
the period 2019-2020. var reached dkk 56 million 
on 8 january 2020, causing a passive breach of the 
executive committee mandate of dkk 50 million. 
this was due to increased volatility as a conse-
quence of the russian/ukraine conflict and the 
iranian attack on us bases on 8 january. the risk 
was brought back within the limit the next day.

the sensitivity analysis in the table shows the 
effect of market value changes, assuming a 
relative price change at 31 december 2020. 
the effect on profit (loss) before tax com-
prises  financial instruments that remained 
open at the balance sheet date, and which 
have an  effect on profit (loss) in the current 
 financial year. the effect is broken down by:
–  trading portfolio: these contracts will 
affect profit
–  other financial instruments, including 
 economic hedging and commercial 
contracts: the market value changes of 
contracts allocated as economic hedges 
will be offset, in full or in part, by a change 
in the hedged risk.
effect on equity before tax comprises finan-
cial instruments that remained open at the 
 balance sheet date, and which are value- 
adjusted directly in equity. 
financial instruments include derivatives as 
well as receivables and payables in foreign 
currencies.
the illustrated sensitivities only comprise the 
impacts from our financial instruments. 
if the hedged exposure had been included in the 
sensitivity analysis, the effect of a price change 
would have been reduced or offset entirely.
net investments and associated hedging of 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries are 
not included in the table, as the effect of 
the sum of the investment and the hedging 
are  considered to be neutral to changes 
in currencies. 
a 10 % increase in the currencies hedged 
in connection with net investments would 
 reduce equity by dkk 4,796 million 
(2019: dkk 4,672 million).
1  other financial 
instruments, including 
derivatives classified 
as economic hedging, 
comprise derivatives 
entered into to hedge 
future financial risks. 
the market value 
changes of these con-
tracts will be offset, 
in full or in part, by a 
change in the hedged 
risk. also included 
are commercial 
contracts recognised 
at market value.

covers our position in

ernment and mortgage

category primarily con-
sists of trade receivables 
from customers, such as 
end-users.
we are exposed to credit risks from our trading 
partners and customers. a large part of our 
counterparty risks concerns major  international 
energy companies and banks. such trading is 
regulated under standard agreements, such as 
efet and isda agreements, which feature, for 
instance, credit rating and netting provisions. 
our credit exposure is mainly concentrated on 
counterparties in denmark, the uk, germany, 
and the us. 
we limit our credit risks by:
–  systematically rating significant 
counterparties
–  granting credit limits
–  demanding that collateral be furnished, 
or credit insurance put in place.
the counterparties and credit limits  granted 
are monitored on an ongoing basis. the 
 monitoring is based on the framework 
 established by our board of directors and the 
executive committee. for the most significant 
counterparties, an internal rating is required 
to determine credit limits. the rating is based 
on information from  external credit rating 
agencies, publicly  available information, and 
our own analyses.
we have not suffered losses from any single 
major counterparty in 2019 or 2020.
the credit risks from our financial assets prima-
rily concern derivatives, cash, securities, and 
receivables. the assessment is based on the 
individual counterparty’s ratings with standard 
& poor’s, moody’s, and fitch. the  figures do 
not reflect our actual credit  exposure, as the 
positions are calculated  before offsetting our 
debt to such counterparties.

significant non-observable inputs 
market values based on non-observable input 
comprise primarily long-term contracts on 
the purchase or sale of power and gas. since 
there are no active markets for the long-term 
prices of power and gas, the market values 
have been determined through an estimate 
of the future prices. normally, the price can be 
observed for a maximum of four to six years 
in the power market, after which an active 
market no longer exists.
accounting policies
market values based on quoted prices comprise 
quoted securities and derivatives that are traded 
in active markets. the market value of derivatives 
traded in an active market are often settled on a 
daily basis, thereby minimising the market value 
presented on the balance sheet.
market values based on observable inputs comprise 
derivatives where valuation models with observable 
inputs are used to measure fair value.
all assets and liabilities measured at market value 
are measured on a recurring basis.
in business combinations, gain (loss) at initial 
recognition on derivatives whose values are based 
on non-observable inputs are deferred and recog-
nised in the period to which the value relates.

us power prices (ercot)
the us power purchase agreements give 
exposure to the long-term us power prices 
in the ercot region. the price is observable 
for the first four to six years. for the following 
four to six years, the power price is estimated 
based on observable inputs (gas prices 
and heat rates). for the short subsequent 
period, the power price is non-observable 
and estimated by extrapolating the power 
price towards the u.s. energy information 
administration’s long-term power price 
forecast, assuming similar seasonality as in 
previous periods. as only a minor part of the 
contract period is within the period where 
power prices are non- observable, we classify 
the contracts as based on  observable input.
we measure our securities and derivatives at 
fair value. a number of our derivatives, mainly 
power purchase agreements, are measured 
based on non-observable inputs. the most 
significant non-observable input is the long-
term us power price, due to the long duration 
of the contracts. 
valuation principles and key assumptions
in order to minimise the use of subjective esti-
mates or modifications of parameters and cal-
culation models, it is our policy to determine 
fair values based on the external information 
that most accurately reflects the market 
values. we use pricing services and benchmark 
services to increase the data quality. market 
values are determined by the treasury & risk 
management function which reports to the 
cfo. the development in market values is 
monitored on a continuing basis and reported 
to the executive committee.
deferred gain/losses from us power 
purchase agreements
the deferred gains from us ppas consist of 
the market value of ppas recocognised in 
the opening balance when lincoln clean 
energy was purchased in 2018. the ppas 
lock the  power price of the expected power 
in generation over a period of 13-15 years. 
these contracts are accounted for at fair 
value. due to the long duration of these ppas, 
power prices are not observable for the last 
part of the duration. the deferred revenue is 
recognised in profit or loss in the future period 
to which the market value relates. in 2020, 
we have recognised an  income of dkk 184 
million (2019: dkk 216 million) related to 
the deferred fair value of ppas not recog-
nised in profit or loss at initial recognition. 
the total amount of deferred revenue as 
of 31  december 2020 amounts to dkk 736 
million (2019: dkk 995 million).

the main non-observable input is german power 
prices in the period 2025-2034. the average power 
price for the period is estimated at eur 54 per 
mwh, based on an inflation-adjusted extrapolation 
of the observable price. an increase or decrease 
in the german power prices of 10 % would impact 
the fair value by +/- dkk 400 million.

related parties that have control over the 
group comprise the danish state, represented 
by the danish ministry of finance.
other related parties are the group’s associ-
ates and joint ventures, members of the board 
of directors and the executive board as well 
as other senior executives.
see note 8.5 ‘company overview’ for an over-
view of our joint ventures and associates.
related-party transactions are made on 
arm’s length terms. intra-group transactions 
have been eliminated in the consolidated 
financial statements.
8.1  related-party transactions
the remuneration and share programmes for 
the executive committee and the board of 
directors are described in notes 2.7 ‘ employee 
costs’ and 2.8 ‘share-based payment’.
through a directly owned company, peter 
korsholm, board member, has had  ordin ary 
transactions with danish oil pipe a/s, a  
wholly-owned subsidiary in the Ørsted group.
we use the exemption set out in ias 24.25 
concerning entities in which the danish state is 
a related party, and therefore transactions with 
 government-related companies are not disclosed. 
there were no other related-party trans-
actions during the period.

we have entered into leases of dkk 368 
million which are not commenced and 
consequently not included in our lease 
liabilities.
accounting policies
our lease liabilities are initially measured at the net 
present value of the in-substance fixed lease payments 
for the use of a lease asset. if, at inception of the lease, 
we are reasonably certain about exercising an option 
to extend a lease, we will include the lease payments 
in the option period when calculating the lease liability. 
we measure the lease asset to the value of the lease 
liability at initial recognition.
our lease assets are classified alongside our owned 
assets of similar type under property, plant, and 
equipment. we depreciate our lease assets during 
the lease term. the depreciation method used is the 
straight-line method for all our lease assets, except 
for seabed leases where the depreciation method is 
aligned with the depreciation method for the related 
offshore wind farm. therefore, seabed lease assets are 
depreciated by using either the straight-line method or 
the reducing-fraction method.
contracts may contain both lease and non-lease com-
ponents. we allocate the consideration in a contract 
to the lease and non-lease components based on their 
relative stand-alone prices. we account for non-lease 
components in accordance with the accounting policy 
applicable for such items. non-lease components 
comprise building services and operating costs of 
leased vessels, etc.
variable lease expenses are recognised in other 
external expenses in the period when the condition 
triggering those payments occurs. interests of lease 
liabilities are recognised in financial expenses.
each lease payment is separated into repayment of 
the lease liability and payment of interests of the lease 
liability. debt repayments are classified as cash flows 
from financing activities, and payment of interests are 
classified as cash flows from operating activities.

our lease liabilities decreased by dkk 278 
million relative to 31 december 2019. additions 
primarily related to commenced leases of 
plots of land related to development and 
construction projects in onshore.
offshore’s leases mainly comprise seabeds 
related to the offshore wind farms in the uk 
and us and service  vessels. onshore’s leases 
comprise plots of land related to onshore wind 
farms. markets & bioenergy mainly lease gas 
storage facilities in germany.
leased assets recognised under ‘other activ i-
ties’ mainly comprise our two office premises 
in gentofte and london. the premises are used 
by employees from all of our business units.
seabed leases include variable lease pay-
ments which depend on the number of mega-
watt hours generated. however, we have 
typically agreed on minimum lease payments 
for the seabeds, and these minimum pay-
ments are included in the lease liabilities.
expenses for the year relating to variable 
lease payments not included in lease liabil-
ities amounted to dkk 411 million in 2020 
(2019: dkk 311 million). interests on lease debt 
expensed in profit (loss) were dkk 177 million 
in 2020 (2019: dkk 171 million).
total cash outflows for leases were dkk 1,129 
million in 2020 (2019: dkk 1,147 million).

esg performance 
report 2020
consolidated environmental, social, and 
 governance (esg) statements
in the consolidated esg statements, we 
present our results, objectives, and account-
ing policies for the esg data included in the 
management’s review in this report.
our full esg data set can be seen in the 
independent publication ‘esg performance 
report 2020’. the esg performance report 
also includes additional information, such 
as selected esg indicators by country and 
all esg accounting policies, including a list 
of  references for conversion factors used 
in calculations.
scope and consolidation
unless otherwise stated, esg data is reported 
on the basis of the same principles as the 
financial statements. thus, the  consolidated 
esg statements include consolidated data 
from the parent company, Ørsted a/s, 
and subsidiaries controlled by Ørsted a/s. 
data from associates and joint ventures are 
not included.
the consolidation of safety data deviates 
from the above-described principles. safety 
data is collected using an operational scope. 
this means that irrespective of our ownership 
share, we include 100 % of injuries and hours 
worked, etc., arising from all operations where 
Ørsted is responsible for safety, including 
safety related to external suppliers.
11.3 gw
our installed renewable capacity increased  
by 14 % from 2019 to 2020. we have a target of  
+30 gw installed renewable capacity in 2030.
90 %
the green share of our heat and power  
generation increased from 86 % in 2019 to 90 %  
in 2020. we have a target of 99 % in 2025.

kwh
our greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by  
11 % to 58 g co2e/kwh in 2020. our target is to  
reach 10 g co2e/kwh in 2025.
100 %
we reached our target for sourced certified sustainable 
wooden biomass as the share of certified sustainable 
biomass is now 100 %.

1 additional target is 95 % (2023).
2 additional target is 20 (2023).
3 primary source of emission: wind farm suppliers.
4 primary source of emission: regular power sales.
5 primary source of emission: natural gas sales.
6  remaining categories of the 15 defined scope 3 ghg  categories according  
to the greenhouse gas protocol.
7  we have adjusted the 2018 base year emissions after the divestement of the  
lng business which accounted for 20 % in 2018.
8 the 5 gw target (2025) is for onshore wind and solar pv combined.
the green (renewable) share of our heat and power 
generation amounted to 90 % in 2020, up 4 percent-
age points relative to 2019. the increase was  primarily 
due to higher generation from wind farms. our target 
is 99 % green energy generation in 2025. 
our greenhouse gas intensity was reduced by 11 % for 
the same reasons as for the increase in the renewable 
energy share. we are well on track to meeting our 
target of a greenhouse gas emission intensity of no 
more than 10 g co2e/kwh in 2025. we will continue 
to investigate solutions for the remaining emissions, 
which could include investing in certified carbon- 
removal projects.
we have updated our 2018 base year scope 3 
 emissions in accordance with our policy for baseline 
adjustments for scope 3. we divested the lng busi-
ness in 2020. the lng bussiness accounted for 20 % 
of the 2018 base year scope 3 emissions. therefore, 
we have reduced the scope 3 base year emissions 
and target emissions in 2032 by 20 %.
our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions were reduced 
by 27 % from 2019 to 2020. the main driver for 
this reduction was the 28 % decrease in gas sales 
( category 11). our second-largest source of scope 3 
emissions (category 3) was reduced by 24 % from 
2019 to 2020, primarily due to reduced sale of regular 
power to end-customers. our third-largest source of 
scope 3 emissions (category 2) includes greenhouse 
gas emissions from the supply chain and the instal-
lation of new assets, such as the offshore wind farm 
borssele 1 & 2 and the three onshore wind farms sage 
draw, plum creek, and willow creek. 
the installed renewable capacity increased by 14 % 
in 2020 due to the commisioning of the offshore wind 
farm borssele 1 & 2 (752 mw) and the onshore wind 
farms sage draw (338 mw), plum creek (230 mw), 
and willow creek (184 mw).

the increase in offshore wind capacity contributed 
to a 27 % increase in offshore wind-based generation 
in 2020. the increase was primarily due to full-year 
generation from hornsea 1 (commissioned in q4 
2019), generation from borssele 1 & 2 (commisioned in 
q4 2020), and higher wind speeds.
onshore wind-based generation increased by 64 % in 
2020 relative to 2019. the increase was primarily due 
to additional generation from lockett (commissioned 
in q3 2019), sage draw (commissioned in q1 2020), 
plum creek (commissioned in q2 2020), and willow 
creek (commissioned in q3 2020).
thermal power generation was 4 % lower in 2020 
compared with 2019 due to lower combined heat 
and power generation, partly offset by increased 
power generation due to ancillary services.
thermal heat generation decreased by 20 %, 
primarily due to the warm weather in q1 2020, 
leading to a lower demand for heat, which was 
partly offset by colder weather and higher heat 
generation in h2 2020.
the coal share of fuels in our thermal heat and 
power generation increased by 5 percentage points 
due to generation at esbjerg and studstrup power 
 stations, associated with additional ancillary services. 
the green share of energy in markets & bioenergy 
increased by 3 percentage points in 2020, primarily 
due to the bioconversion of asnæs power station in 
late 2019.
we reached our target to source all wooden biomass 
as certified sustainable biomass in 2020.
due to the increase in renewable energy generation, 
the amount of avoided carbon emissions increased 
by 16 % from 2019 to 2020. in 2020, our renewable 
 energy generation avoided the emission of 13.1 million 
tonnes carbon dioxide.

1  our target from 2020 and onward is an employee satisfaction survey result in the top 10 % compared with an external benchmark group.
the number of employees decreased by 5 % from 
2019 to 2020, primarily due to the divestments of 
the danish power distribution, residential customer, 
and city light businesses, partly offset by growth in 
existing and new markets. 
employee satisfaction continued to be high. with 
a satisfaction and motivation score of 78 in 2020, 
our target of being in the top 10 % compared to our 
external benchmark group was met.
our total recordable injury rate (trir) decreased 
from 4.9 in 2019 to 3.6 in 2020. we registered
77 total recordable injuries (tris), of which 58 
involved employees working for our suppliers. 
we continue to have a strong focus on safety. 
our target is a trir of 2.9 or below in 2025.
our employees and other associates may report 
serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, 
and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our 
whistle-blower scheme or through our manage-
ment system. in 2020, four substantiated cases of 
inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported 
through our whistle-blower scheme. a total of three 
cases concerned violation of our good business 
conduct policy, and one case concerned violation 
of administrative procedures. the four cases had 
consequences for the individuals involved. none of 
the reported cases were critical to our business or 
impacted our financial results.

accounting policies – environment
green share of heat and power generation
the green (renewable energy) share of our heat 
and power generation and the distribution of the 
 generation from the individual energy sources and 
fuels are calculated on the basis of the energy 
 sources used and the energy generated at the 
different energy plants. 
wind and solar pv-based generation is computed as 
the input from the individual plant (wind and solar 
pv), as there is only one source of power for each 
plant. for combined heat and power (chp) plants, 
the share of the specific fuel (e.g. biomass) is calculated 
relative to the total fuel consumption for a given 
plant or unit within a given time period. the specific 
fuel share is then multiplied with the total heat and 
power generation for the specific unit in the specific 
period. the result is the fuel-based generation for 
the individual unit – for example the biomass-based 
generation of heat and power from the chp unit 
within a given time period.
the percentage shares of the individual energy 
sources are calculated by dividing generation from 
individual energy source with the total generation. 
the following energy sources and fuels are con-
sidered renewable energy: wind, solar pv, biomass, 
biogas, and power sourced with green certificates. 
the following energy sources are considered fossil 
energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.
greenhouse gas (ghg) intensity
greenhouse gas intensity is defined as the scope 
1 and 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions 
divided by the total heat and power generation. 
scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions
scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated based on the 
greenhouse gas protocol. scope 1 covers all direct 
emissions of greenhouse gases from Ørsted. the 
direct carbon emissions from the combined heat 
and power plants are determined on the basis of 
the fuel quantities used in accordance with the eu 
ets scheme. carbon dioxide and other greenhouse 
gas emissions outside the eu ets scheme are for 
the most part calculated as energy consumptions 
multiplied by emission factors. 
scope 2 emissions are primarily calculated as 
the power volumes  purchased multiplied by 
country-specific emission factors. location-based 
emissions are calculated based on average emission 
factors for each country, whereas market-based 
emissions take account for green power purchased 
and assume the regular power is delivered as residu-
al power where the green part has been taken out.
scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions
scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are reported 
based on the greenhouse gas protocol which divides 
the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories.
ghg emissions from capital goods include 
 upstream ghg emissions from installed wind farms. 
we calculate the emissions based on ghg life-cycle 
data from one of our wind turbine suppliers. carbon 
emissions are included from cradle to operation and 
maintenance for single wind turbines. wind farms are 
included from the month where the wind farm has 
achieved commercial operation date (cod).
ghg emissions from fuel- and energy-related activi-
ties are calculated based on actual fuel consumption 
and power sales as reported in our esg consolida-
tion system. the fuel consumption is multiplied by 
emission factors to calculate the upstream ghg 
emissions from extraction, mining, forestry, transpor-
tation, etc., for the fuels. we include all power sales 
to end-customers and use separate emission factors 
for green sales (with certificates) and regular sales 
(without certificates). 
ghg emissions from use of sold products are calcu-
lated based on actual sales of gas (to both end-users 
and wholesale) as reported in our esg consolidation 
system. the total gas sale is divided into natural gas, 
lng, and biogas which have specific upstream and 
downstream emission factors.
‘other’ includes ghg emissions from:
–  purchased goods and services, calculated based 
on spend reports from our sap system. all spends 
are divided into categories where relevant emission 
factors are used to calculate the ghg emissions 
from each spend category
–  upstream transportation and distribution which 
are included in the emission factors we use 
for purchases and sale and are therefore not 
reported separately
–  waste generated in operations, calculated based on 
actual waste volumes multiplied with the relevant 
emission factors
–  business travel, calculated based on mileage allow-
ances for employee travel in own car. ghg emissions 
from plane travel is provided by our travel agent
–  employee commuting, calculated based on 
estimates for distance travelled and travel type 
(e.g. car and train)
–  downstream transportation and distribution, calcu-
lated based on actual volumes of residual products 
generated from our chp plants multiplied by 
relevant ghg emission factors for transportation.
installed, decided (fid), and awarded or contracted 
renewable energy capacity
installed renewable capacity is calculated as 
the cumulative renewable gross capacity installed 
by Ørsted before divestments. for installed renew-
able thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity, 
as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy 
generation, and as bioconversions of the combined 
heat and power plants are driven by heat contracts. 
decided (fid) capacity is the renewable capacity 
for which a final investment decision (fid) has been 
made. the awarded renewable capacity is based on 
the capacities which have been awarded to Ørsted 
in auctions and tenders. the contracted capacity is 
the capacity for which Ørsted has signed a contract 
or power purchase agreement (ppa) concerning a 
new renewable energy plant. typically, offshore wind 
farms are awarded, whereas onshore wind farms are 
contracted. we include the full capacity if more than 
50 % of ppas or offtake are secured.
heat and power generation
power generation from wind is calculated as sold 
generation. the gunfleet sands and walney 1 and 2 
offshore wind farms have been consolidated accord-
ing to ownership interest. the other wind farms are 
financially consolidated. 
thermal power generation is determined as net gen-
eration sold, based on settlements from the official 
danish production database. data for generation 
from foreign facilities are provided by the operators. 
thermal heat (including steam) generation is 
 measured as net output sold to heat customers.
heat and power generation capacity
power generation capacity from offshore wind farms 
is included from the time when the individual wind 
turbine has passed a 240-hour test. for onshore wind 
and solar pv farms, the whole farm is included after 
cod. the gunfleet sands and walney 1 and 2 off-
shore wind farms have been consolidated according 
to ownership interest. other wind farms, solar farms, 
and chp plants are financially consolidated.
the thermal heat and power generation capacity is 
a measure of the maximum capability to generate 
heat and power. the capacity can change over time 
with plant modifications. for each chp plant, the 
capacity is given for generation with the primary fuel 
mix. overload is not included.
availability 
availability is calculated as the ratio of actual 
production to the possible production, which is the 
sum of lost production and actual production in a 
given period. the production-based availability (pba) 
is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which 
are technical production losses. pba is not impacted 
by market requested shutdowns and wind farm 
curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of 
site performance, but due to external factors. total 
availability is determined by weighting the individual 
wind farm’s availability against the capacity of the 
wind farm.
load factor
the load factor is calculated as the ratio between 
actual generation over a period relative to potential 
generation, which is possible by continuously exploit- 
ing the maximum capacity over the same period. the 
load factor is commercially adjusted. commercially 
adjusted means that, for danish and german offshore 
wind farms, the load factor is adjusted if the offshore 
wind farm has been financially compensated by the 
transmission system operators in situations where 
the offshore wind farm is available for generation, 
but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to 
maintenance or grid interruptions. wind farms in other 
countries are not compensated for non-access to the 
grid. new wind turbines are included in the calcula-
tion of availability and load factor once they have 
passed a 240-hour test for offshore wind turbines and 
commercial operation date (cod) for onshore wind 
turbines.
wind speed
wind speeds for the areas where Ørsted’s offshore 
and onshore wind farms are located are provided 
to Ørsted by an external supplier. wind speeds 
are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the 
 individual wind farms and consolidated to an 
Ørsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 
‘normal wind speed’ is a 20-year historical wind 
speed average.

degree days
degree days are a measure of how cold it has been 
and thus indicate the amount of energy needed to 
heat a building. the number of degree days helps to 
compare the heat demand for a given year with a 
normal year. the number of degree days expresses 
the difference between an average indoor tempera-
ture of 17 °c and the outside mean temperature for 
a given period. the need for heat increases with the 
number of degree days.
coal share of fuels used for thermal heat  
and power generation
the coal share is calculated as the coal consumption 
in gigajoule (gj) relative to the total fuel volume in 
gigajoule. 
certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced
certified biomass is defined as wooden biomass, i.e. 
wood pellets and wood chips. biomass is measured 
as sourced wooden biomass delivered to individual 
combined heat and power plants within the report-
ing period. 
certified sustainable wooden biomass sourced must 
be certified within at least one of the claim catego-
ries accepted by the danish industry agreement on 
certified biomass. accepted claim categories are: 
fsc 100 %, fsc mix, pefc 100 %, and sbp compliant. 
certified biomass is calculated as the amount of 
sourced wooden biomass compared to the total 
amount of sourced wooden biomass delivered to 
individual chp plants within the reporting period.
green share of generation, markets & bioenergy
this is calculated as the green share of heat and 
power generation, but is only shown for the business 
unit markets & bioenergy.
avoided carbon emissions
avoided carbon emissions due to generation from 
offshore and onshore wind farms are calculated 
under the assumption that the generation from wind 
farms replace an equal quantity of power generated 
using fossil fuels.
the carbon emissions avoided due to conversions of 
combined heat and power plants and subsequent 
switch from fossil fuels to biomass is calculated on 
the basis of the energy content of the fuel used 
at chp plants. it is assumed that the use of 1 gj of 
biomass fuel avoids the use of 1 gj of fossil fuels. the 
upstream emissions (from production, manufacture, 
and transport of biomass) are included.
sales
sales of power and gas are calculated as physical 
sales to retail customers, wholesale customers, and 
exchanges. sales are based on readings from Ørsted’s 
trading systems. internal sales to bioenergy are not 
included in the statement. 
accounting policies – social
employees
our reporting covers contractually employed 
employees in all Ørsted companies in which Ørsted 
holds an ownership interest of more than 50 %. 
employees in associates are not included.
employee data are recognised based on records 
from the group’s ordinary registration systems. 
the  number of employees is determined as the 
number of employees at the end of each month 
converted to full-time equivalents (ftes).
employees who have been made redundant are 
recognised until the expiry of their notice period, 
regardless of whether they have been released from 
all or some of their duties during their notice period.
employee satisfaction
Ørsted conducts a comprehensive employee satis-
faction survey once a year. with a few exceptions, 
all Ørsted employees are invited to participate in 
the survey. 
the following employees are not invited to 
 participate: employees who joined the company 
shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, 
employees who resigned shortly after the employee 
satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisers, and 
external temporary workers who do not have an 
employment contract with Ørsted. 
in the survey, a number of questions are asked. 
the answers are given on a scale from 1 to 10 and 
are subsequently converted to index figures on a 
scale from 0 to 100.
safety
occupational injuries are calculated according to 
operational scope. data from companies wholly- 
or partly-owned by Ørsted, and where Ørsted is 
 responsible for safety, is included. occupational 
 injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both 
our own employees and suppliers. data from all 
Ørsted locations is recognised.
the total recordable injury rate (trir) is calculated 
as the number of total recordable injuries per one 
million hours worked. the number of hours worked is 
based on 1,667 working hours annually per full-time 
employee and monthly records of the number of 
employees converted into full-time employees. 
for suppliers, the actual number of hours worked 
is recognised on the basis of data provided by the 
supplier, access control systems at locations, or 
estimates.
fatalities are the number of employees who lost 
their lives as a result of a work-related incident. 
accounting policies – governance
board of directors of Ørsted a/s
the employee representatives on the board of 
directors are not included in the data for the board 
of directors. 
executive committee
the executive committee consists of the executive 
board (our ceo and cfo) and five additional mem-
bers who undertake the day-to-day management of 
Ørsted.
substantiated whistle-blower cases
Ørsted’s whistle-blower hotline is available for
internal and external reporting of suspected cases
of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. whistle-blower
cases are received and handled by the internal audit
function which also receives similar reports through
the management system and from compliance 
officers. 
all reports are managed in accordance with the
guidelines for the handling of whistle-blower reports
approved by the audit & risk committee, which is
ultimately responsible for the whistle-blower scheme. 
only cases which are closed during the financial
year, and which have been reported to the audit &
risk committee as fully or partially substantiated
are reported in the esg statements.
cases transferred to the police
cases transferred to the police are defined as the 
number of cases reported in accordance with the 
above which have been transferred to the police.

part of joint taxation with the parent company 
as the management company.
subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation 
from the date they are consolidated in the con-
solidated financial statements and up to the 
date on which they are no longer consolidated. 
current tax for 2020 is recognised by the 
individual, jointly taxed companies.
statement of cash flows
we do not prepare a separate statement of 
cash flows for the parent company. reference 
is made to the consolidated statement of 
cash flows on page 81.
accounting policies
the parent company financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the danish financial statements 
act (‘Årsregnskabsloven’) (reporting class d).
the danish financial statements act allows us 
to use certain ifrs standards to interpret the 
act. previously, we have therefore implemented 
ifrs 15 ‘revenue’ and ifrs 16 ‘leases’.
the accounting policies remain unchanged 
from the previous year.
unless otherwise stated, the financial 
 statements are presented in danish kroner 
(dkk) rounded to the nearest million.
the parent company accounting policies 
are consistent with the accounting policies 
described for the consolidated financial 
 statements, with the following exceptions.
foreign currency translation
we recognise exchange rate adjustments 
of receivables from and payables to sub-
sidiaries as financial income and expenses 
in the income statement when the balances 
are accounted for as part of the total net 
investment in foreign enterprises. likewise, 
we recognise foreign exchange gains and 
losses on loans and derivatives in the income 
 statement as financial income and expenses 
when they have been entered into to hedge 
the net investment in the foreign enterprises.
revenue
rental income comprises income from 
 commercial leases and is recognised over 
the term of the lease. income from services is 
 recognised when delivery has taken place.
dividends from investments
dividends from subsidiaries and associates 
are recognised in the income statement for 
the financial year in which the dividends are 
 approved at the annual general meeting. 
if the dividends exceed the total income 
after takeover, the dividends are recognised 
as a reduction of the cost of the investment 
under assets. 
investments
we measure our investments in  subsidiaries 
and associates at cost. if there is any 
 indication that the value of a company is 
lower than our future earnings in the company, 
impairment testing of the company is carried 
out as described in the consolidated financial 
statements. the carrying amount is written 
down to the recoverable amount whenever 
the carrying amount exceeds the future earn-
ings in the company (recoverable amount).
if we have a legal or constructive obligation 
to cover a deficit in subsidiaries and  associates, 
we recognise a provision for this.
tax
Ørsted a/s is taxed jointly with its danish 
 subsidiaries. the jointly taxed companies are

key accounting estimates
in connection with the preparation of the financial 
statements, a number of accounting estimates 
have been made that affect the profit (loss) and 
balance sheet. estimates are regularly reassessed by 
management on the basis of historical experience 
and other relevant factors.
impairment test
if there is any indication that the carrying amount 
is lower than our future earnings in a company, we 
test for impairment as described in the consolidated 
financial statements. the future earnings of the 
company (recoverable amount) are calculated based 
on assumptions concerning significant estimates.

and the additional requirements applicable 
in denmark. our responsibilities under those 
standards and requirements are further 
described in the auditor’s responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report.
we believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
independence
we are independent of the group in accord-
ance with the international ethics standards 
board for accountants’ code of ethics for 
professional accountants (iesba code) and the 
additional requirements applicable in denmark. 
we have also fulfilled our other ethical respon-
sibilities in accordance with the iesba code.
to the best of our knowledge and belief, prohib-
ited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of 
regulation (eu) no 537/2014 were not provided.
appointment
we were first appointed auditors of Ørsted 
a/s on 19 april 2010 for the financial year 
2010 and have been reappointed annually by 
shareholder resolution for a total period of 
engagement of 11 years including the financial 
year 2020. we were reappointed following a 
tendering procedure at the general meeting 
on 2 march 2020.
key audit matters
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most signifi-
cance in our audit of the financial  statements 
for 2020. these matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the  financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.

key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
partnership agreements 
divestment of ownership interests in an offshore 
wind farm (farm-downs) to a partner in a joint 
operation, including calculating the divestment 
gains and subsequent recognition of construction 
agreements and assessment of consolidation 
method for the retained interests, are considered 
non-routine transactions.
as part of farm-downs, compensation mechanisms 
are often agreed with the partners, e.g. regarding 
sales price, cost of subsequent use of the offshore 
transmission asset constructed for the wind 
farm, potential wake effect compensations and 
warranties. 
we focused on this area because farm-downs and 
the related matters are considered non-routine 
transactions and because the recognition and 
measurement of the divestment gain, assessment 
of consolidation method, subsequent construction 
agreements with the partners, compensation 
mechanisms and warranties are based on signifi-
cant judgements and estimates.
on this basis, partnership agreements were a 
matter of most significance in our audit.
refer to notes 1.2, 2.6, and 3.2 in the consolidated 
financial statements.
during 2020, Ørsted did not perform any new 
farm-downs, but completed the construction 
agreements with partners from previous years’ 
farm-downs and divested the offshore transmission 
asset related to the walney extension wind farm. 
as part of our audit we read the sales agreements 
and the construction agreements and challenged 
the accounting treatment applied by manage-
ment, including the consolidation method.
we furthermore obtained an understanding of the 
compensation mechanisms and warranties agreed 
in farm-downs from previous years. we challenged 
the estimates prepared by management for 
recognition and measurement of these compen-
sation mechanisms and warranties, hereunder by 
assessing and testing the data, assumptions and 
models applied, and by evaluating the outcome of 
previous estimates prepared by management. 
key audit matter
how our audit addressed the key audit matter
income taxes
Ørsted is subject to income taxes in all the coun-
tries where they operate. significant judgements 
and estimates are required in determining the 
income taxes, and the measurement of income 
tax assets and liabilities including uncertain 
tax positions. 
management makes significant judgements and 
estimates when calculating and assessing the 
income taxes due to the complex nature of the tax 
rules related to the business activities conducted 
in different tax jurisdictions. furthermore, manage-
ment makes estimates, when measuring the tax 
assets, including when and to which extent these 
can be utilised in the future, and when measuring 
tax liabilities including assessing deferred taxes in 
tax equity partnerships. 
additionally, Ørsted is party in tax and transfer 
pricing disputes, where management assesses the 
possible outcomes and consequently recognise 
provisions to cover for these uncertain tax positions. 
in 2020, Ørsted received an administrative decision 
from the danish tax agency entailing an additional 
tax payable and related interests, which manage-
ment disputes and has appealed to the relevant 
authorities. 
on this basis, income taxes were a matter of most 
significance in our audit. 
refer to notes 1.2, 5.2, and 5.3 in the consolidated 
financial statements.
our procedures in relation to income taxes, income 
tax assets and liabilities included evaluating the 
assumptions applied by management in determin-
ing the recognition and measurement of income 
taxes and deferred taxes, including those related to 
tax equity partnerships, while taking into account 
relevant correspondence with tax authorities and 
external advisors. in our audit of income taxes, we 
involved our tax specialists. 
our procedures covered assessing management’s 
judgements and estimates of tax balances and 
carrying amounts as well as the related applied tax 
rates when calculating these, including the deferred 
tax liabilities in tax equity partnerships. 
our procedures also covered evaluating and 
 testing Ørsted’s processes for recording, assessing 
and continually reassessing provisions for uncertain 
tax positions.
in our audit of uncertain tax positions, we obtained 
and reviewed the correspondence with relevant tax 
authorities in order to consider the completeness 
of the tax disputes and the related provisions. 
when assessing the measurement of the provisions, 
we challenged the assumptions used, including 
the possibility of obtaining corresponding tax 
adjustments, compensations from partners and the 
likelihood of different outcomes. in addition, we as-
sessed relevant opinions obtained by management 
from third parties related to the tax disputes, and 
we evaluated the disclosures provided by manage-
ment in the consolidated financial statements.

and maintain professional scepticism through-
out the audit. we also:
–  identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
–  obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the group’s and the parent company’s 
internal control.
–  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
 accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
–  conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. if we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. however, future events 
or conditions may cause the group or the 
parent company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
–  evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the under-
lying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
–  obtain sufficient appropriate audit  evidence 
regarding the financial information of the en-
tities or business activities within the group 
to express an opinion on the  consolidated 
financial statements. we are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance 
of the group audit. we remain solely respon-
sible for our audit opinion.
we communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
we also provide those charged with govern-
ance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
statement on management’s review
management is responsible for the manage-
ment’s review, pp 4-75.
our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover management’s review, and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
in connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read man-
agement’s review and, in doing so, consider 
whether management’s review is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit, or other-
wise appears to be materially misstated.
moreover, we considered whether manage-
ment’s review includes the disclosures required 
by the danish financial statements act.
based on the work we have performed, in our 
view, management’s review is in accordance 
with the consolidated financial statements 
and the parent company financial state-
ments and has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the danish financial 
statements act. we did not identify any mate-
rial misstatement in management’s review.
management’s responsibilities for the 
financial statements
management is responsible for the prepara-
tion of consolidated financial statements that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards 
as adopted by the eu and further require-
ments in the danish financial statements act 
and for the preparation of parent company 
financial statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with the danish financial 
statements act, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial state-
ments that are free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud or error.  
in preparing the financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
 applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of account-
ing unless management either intends to 
liquidate the group or the parent company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark will always detect a material mis-
statement when it exists. misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influ-
ence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements.
as part of an audit in accordance with isas 
and the additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement

from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. we describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be com-
municated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
report on compliance with the 
esef regulation
as part of our audit of the financial state-
ments we performed procedures to express 
an opinion on whether the annual report of 
Ørsted a/s for the financial year 1 january 
to 31 december 2020 with the file name 
orst-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material 
respects, in compliance with the commission 
delegated regulation (eu) 2019/815 on the 
european  single electronic format (esef 
 regulation) which includes requirements 
 related to the preparation of the annual 
report in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging 
of the  consolidated  financial statements.
management is responsible for preparing 
an annual report that complies with the 
esef regulation. this responsibility includes:
–  the preparing of the annual report in 
xhtml format;
–  the selection and application of  appropriate 
ixbrl tags, including extensions to the esef 
taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to 
elements in the taxonomy, for all financial 
information required to be tagged using 
judgement where necessary;
–  ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged 
data and the consolidated financial state-
ments presented in human-readable format; 
and
–  for such internal control as management 
determines necessary to enable the prepa-
ration of an annual report that is compliant 
with the esef regulation.
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assur-
ance on whether the annual report is prepared, 
in all material respects, in compliance with 
the esef regulation based on the evidence 
we have obtained, and to issue a report that 
includes our opinion. the nature, timing and 
extent of procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material departures from the 
requirements set out in the esef regulation, 
whether due to fraud or error. the procedures 
include:
–  testing whether the annual report is 
 prepared in xhtml format;
–  obtaining an understanding of the 
 company’s ixbrl tagging process and of 
internal control over the tagging process; 
–  evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl 
tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements;
–  evaluating the appropriateness of the com-
pany’s use of ixbrl elements selected from 
the esef taxonomy and the creation of exten-
sion elements where no suitable element in 
the esef taxonomy has been identified; 
–  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension 
elements to elements in the esef taxonomy; 
and
–  reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the 
audited consolidated financial statements.
in our opinion, the annual report of Ørsted a/s 
for the financial year 1 january to 31  december 
2020 with the file name orst-2020-12-31.zip
is prepared, in all material respects, in compli-
ance with the esef regulation.

to the stakeholders of Ørsted a/s
Ørsted a/s engaged us to provide limited 
assurance on the data described below and 
set out in the consolidated environment, social, 
and governance statements for the period 
1 january - 31 december 2020 (consolidated 
esg  statements) as included on pages 168-174 
in the annual report of Ørsted a/s for 2020.
our conclusion
based on the procedures we performed and 
the evidence we obtained, nothing came to 
our attention that causes us not to believe that 
the consolidated esg statements are free of 
material misstatements and are prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the 
accounting policies as stated on pages 168-174.
this conclusion is to be read in the context of 
what we say in the remainder of our report.
what we are assuring 
the scope of our work was limited to assurance 
over data in the consolidated esg statements 
for the period 1 january - 31 december 2020 on 
pages 168-174.
professional standards applied and level  
of assurance
we performed a limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with the international standard 
on  assurance engagements 3000 (revised) 
‘assurance engagements other than audits 
and  reviews of historical financial information’, 
and, in respect of the reported greenhouse gas 
emissions, in accordance with international stand-
ard on assurance engagements 3410 ‘assurance 
engagements on greenhouse gas statements’. 
a limited assurance engagement is  substantially 
limited assurance report on the  
consolidated esg statements
less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assess-
ment procedures, including an understanding of 
internal control, and the  procedures performed in 
response to the assessed risks; consequently, the 
level of assurance obtained in a limited  assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assur-
ance that would have been  obtained had a rea-
sonable assurance engagement been performed.
our independence and quality control
we have complied with the code of ethics 
for professional accountants issued by the 
 international ethics standards board for 
 accountants, which includes independence and 
other ethical requirements founded on funda-
mental principles of integrity,  objectivity, profes-
sional competence and due care,  confidentiality 
and professional behaviour. the firm applies 
 international standard on quality control 1 and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system 
of quality control, including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
our work was carried out by an independent 
multi -disciplinary team with  experience in 
sustain ability reporting and assurance.
understanding reporting and measurement 
methodologies
data and information need to be read and 
 understood together with the accounting 
 policies on pages 168-174, which management 
are solely responsible for selecting and applying. 
the  absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure esg information allows for  different, 
but acceptable, measurement techniques and 
can affect comparability between entities and 
over time. the quantification of greenhouse gas 
emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty be-
cause of incomplete scientific knowledge used to 
determine the emissions factors and the values 
needed to combine emissions of different gasses.
work performed
we are required to plan and perform our work 
in order to consider the risk of material misstate-
ment of the data. in doing so and based on our 
professional judgment, we:
–  conducted interviews with group functions 
to assess consolidation processes, use 
of company -wide systems, and controls 
 performed at group level;
–  performed an assessment of materiality and 
the selection of topics for the consolidated 
esg statements for the period 1 january - 
31 december 2020;
–  conducted an analytical review of the data 
and trend explanations submitted by all 
business units for consolidation at group level; 
and
–  evaluated the evidence obtained.
management’s responsibilities
management of Ørsted a/s is responsible for:
–  designing, implementing and maintaining 
internal control over information relevant to 
the preparation of data in the consolidated 
esg statements on pages 168-174 that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error; 
–  establishing objective accounting policies for 
preparing data;
–  measuring and reporting data in the con-
solidated esg statements based on the 
accounting policies; and
–  the content of the  consolidated 
esg statements for the period 
1 january - 31 december 2020.
our responsibility
we are responsible for:
–  planning and performing the engagement to 
obtain limited assurance about whether the 
consolidated esg statements for the period 
1 january - 31 december 2020 on pages  
168-174 are free from material misstatements 
and are prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the accounting policies;
–  forming an independent conclusion, based on 
the procedures performed and the evidence 
obtained; and
–  reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders 
of Ørsted a/s.
