management review           highlights  
  
highlights 2020 
2020 was impacted operationally and fi-
nancially by the pandemic, which has pre-
sented both challenges and opportunities 
for flsmidth. our financial results were 
negatively impacted by the rapidly deteri-
orating business environment which af-
fected order intake, revenue and ebita. 
still, we secured four large orders and a 
book-to-bill of 113% for the year, represent-
ing an organic order intake on par with 
2019. as a result of our strong cash focus, 
the net working capital ratio decreased 
from 13.3% to 10.7% and free cash flow 
more than doubled to dkk 1bn in 2020. 
the board of directors proposes a divi-
dend of dkk 2 per share for the year. 
 
our group business improvement pro-
gramme was completed by the end of the 
third quarter with an ebita improvement 
run-rate of dkk 150m annually, and we 
are taking additional steps to improve ce-
ment profitability. 
 
we entered into several strategic partner-
ships and received a range of orders di-
rectly related to sustainability improve-
ments and digital optimisation for our 
customers. to support our ambition to de-
carbonise the cement and mining indus-
tries and put flsmidth on the path to car-
bon neutrality, we have also committed to 
set science-based targets (see page 20). 
highlights q4 2020  
group order intake grew 15% organically 
with growth in both mining and cement. 
cement order intake included the book-
ing of a large project. group revenue de-
clined 24% organically related to both 
mining and cement. 
 
gross margin improved due to a higher 
share from service during the quarter but 
earnings were impacted by the sharp de-
cline in revenue. the ebita margin de-
creased to 5.5% from 8.1% in q4 last year. 
this decrease was entirely related to ce-
ment, while mining ebita margin was up 
slightly year on year. net working capital 
decreased for the third consecutive quar-
ter. free cash flow was dkk 232m, on par 
with q4 last year. net debt to ebitda in-
creased to 1.6x due to lower 12 months’ 
trailing ebitda. 
 
in q4, we acquired knowledgescape, a 
global leader in digital optimisation solu-
tions for the mineral processing industry, 
and we announced two divestments in 
cement as part of the ongoing process to 
simplify and prune flsmidth’s cement 
business. in january 2021, we announced 
that we are in negotiations with 
thyssenkrupp concerning an acquisition 
of their mining business. there can be no 
assurances as to whether and when a 
transaction will transpire.
guidance 2021 
flsmidth guides for group revenue of 
dkk 15.5-17.0bn and a group ebita mar-
gin of 5-6%. the guidance is based on ex-
pected different developments in the two 
individual businesses, mining and ce-
ment, and continued impact from the pan-
demic in the first half of 2021. 
 
mid- and long-term financial 
targets 
the structural changes in the cement in-
dustry and the pandemic have increased 
uncertainty around our mid- and long-term 
target levels and the timing for achieving 
these targets. consequently, it has been 
decided to withdraw the mid- and long- 
term financial targets. targets for capital 
structure, including financial gearing, eq-
uity ratio and dividend policy remain un-
changed. 
 
we will resume communication on the 
longer-term prospects for our mining and 
cement businesses when we have suffi-
cient visibility.

organic order intake was on par with last year, comprising 
growth in mining and a decrease in cement. book-to-bill 
was 112.7% 
 
 
revenue declined 16% organically due to a severe pan-
demic impact and a low cement backlog entering the 
year  
 
 
earnings were impacted by the pandemic and the sharp 
decline in revenue. profitability in mining was quite resili-
ent, whereas cement was loss-making

despite the pandemic causing a reduction in adjusted 
ebitda, cash flow from operating activities increased with 
the cash inflow from net working capital as the key con-
tributor 
 
 
profit for the year decreased as a result of the lower oper-
ating income and, in particular, a challenging cement mar-
ket 
 
 
a strong cash focus led to a significant reduction in net 
working capital and net debt in 2020 – not least due to a 
32% (dkk 1.6bn) decline in trade receivables

safety has top priority at flsmidth and in 2020 our safety 
kpi improved for the 7th consecutive year in a row to a 
record low  
 
 
despite the pandemic making planning and logistics ex-
traordinarily challenging, we improved our quality kpi, 
difot (delivery in full on time) marginally in 2020 
 
 
the reduction in our carbon intensity was a reflection  
of our strong focus on minimising emissions combined 
with the global lockdown of facilities and offices due  
to covid-19

we continually strive to reduce our in-house water con-
sumption, however we have the biggest impact with our 
customers. in 2020, we successfully installed a tailing 
management system which re-circulates over 86% of the 
process water at a zinc mine in india 
 
 
travel restrictions and lockdowns related to the pandemic 
unfortunately reduced our ability to visit suppliers and 
conduct sustainability screenings since march 2020 
 
 
at the end of the year, we set a new long-term target for 
gender equality in our workforce. by 2030, we want 30% 
of our entire white-collar workforce and 25% of our peo-
ple managers to be women.

letter to our shareholders
we help our customers to increase their 
production, lower their operating costs and 
reduce their environmental footprint. our 
business model is anchored around a unique 
combination of projects, products and services. 
however, we have a strategic focus to expand 
the share of services and standardised products 
relative to the share of large projects which 
represent our process competence. this focus 
will help us obtain a more profitable business 
mix and a less cyclical business with a lower 
level of risk.
we established crisis management teams in the 
company headquarters as well as in our regions 
with the main priority to secure the health and 
safety of our employees through a reorganised 
business setup, but also to monitor cash flow, 
secure credit lines, ensure our global supply 
chain and help our customers sustain production. 
our employees have done a tremendous job 
adapting to the changed situation.
the year began with good market outlook 
for mining and stable for cement. we proved 
our increased customer focus by booking 
three large orders in mining. faced with 
high uncertainty from the pandemic and low 
visibility in global conditions, we suspended 
our financial guidance and withdrew our 
dividend. during april and may, a growing 
share of customers temporarily shut down 
or restricted access to their sites following 
guidelines from local authorities or through 
their own safety precautions. global and local 
mobility restrictions also affected our supply 
chain, access to customer sites as well our own 
operations. during the summer, the situation 
improved in some regions but deteriorated 
elsewhere. despite ongoing uncertainty, we 
reinstated our financial guidance in august and 
made the working assumption that business 
sentiment would improve gradually throughout 
the remainder of the year. as business 
sentiment failed to improve, we unfortunately 
had to let go of more than 1,700 colleagues 
during the year to adjust for a weaker outlook in 
cement and a changed way of doing business 
due to the pandemic. we ended the year within 
our reinstated 2020 guidance.
flsmidth strives to be the leading 
supplier of sustainable productivity 
to the global mining and cement 
industries, and we are already 
well-positioned in this endeavour
the pandemic presented a number of 
opportunities for flsmidth. the demand for 
minerals increased significantly resulting in 
increasing commodity prices. especially copper 
and gold, which are traditional flsmidth 
strongholds, enjoy favourable market conditions. 
faced with a low activity level in cement, our 
cement business has refocused its efforts 
on sustainability and digitalisation to be well

another outcome of the pandemic has 
been the increased global awareness 
of health, safety and the environment.
with around 96% of our overall 
emissions derived from customers’ 
use of our sold products (scope 3), 
missionzero is where we can have 
the greatest positive impact on 
emissions reduction. 
2020 was impacted operationally and financially 
by the pandemic, which has presented both 
challenges and opportunities for flsmidth. 
our company has operated globally for around 
140 years and has a vast experience with crisis 
management which was proven in the year 2020. 
in january, we assembled teams to cope with the 
supply chain situation in china, and subsequently

positioned for multiple future infrastructure 
projects, resulting from government’s stimulus 
programmes. another outcome of the pandemic 
has been the increased global awareness of 
health, safety and the environment. some of 
the world’s largest, most densely populated and 
most polluted cities have experienced weeks 
or months with closed factories, car-free streets 
and, for the first time in years, fresh air and clear 
blue skies. this has sparked fresh momentum 
in the battle against climate change. it has 
accelerated the green energy transition and 
industrial decarbonisation, both of which favour 
flsmidth as a premium supplier to the mining 
and cement industries with huge potential to 
reduce their environmental footprint. combined, 
cement and minerals production currently 
account for approximately 10% of all global co2 
emissions. with growing populations, a larger 
middle class, and a transition to greener energy, 
the demand for cement and minerals – and thus 
the environmental impact - will only increase 
in the next decade. a more sustainable future 
requires action from the industries. we will lead 
this action towards zero emissions in mining and 
cement, without compromising quality or our 
customers' commercial competitiveness.
the pandemic has also underscored the 
importance of our agile supply chain, and it has 
proven the strengths of our regional business 
structure that was implemented in 2018. today, 
letter to our shareholders
we have a higher share of local sales and 
service staff close to our customers which 
has served us well through the lockdowns. 
another cornerstone in our 2018 reorganisation 
was an improved focus on digitalisation. over 
the past year we have seen a step-change in 
customers’ willingness to adopt our remote 
support solutions and digitalised optimisation of 
operations.
strong in-house sustainability performance
emissions from flsmidth’s own operations 
(scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) account for 
less than 1% of our overall emissions, while 
scope 3 emissions from our supply chain and 
customers’ use of our equipment represent 
the vast majority. therefore, our approach to 
sustainability is to take responsibility for our 
own environmental footprint while helping 
our customers reduce theirs through our 
missionzero programme (covered in the next 
section).
in 2020, we delivered a strong in-house 
sustainability performance. the carbon intensity 
of flsmidth’s operations declined from 2.6 
to 2.2 tonnes/dkkm revenue. our water 
withdrawal declined from 222 to 197 thousand 
m3. our share of women in management 
positions increased from 11% to 13%, and our 
safety kpi improved for the 7th consecutive year 
in a row.

towards zero emissions in mining and 
cement
in november 2019, we announced our 
sustainability programme, missionzero, to 
enable our customers in cement and mining to 
move towards zero emissions by 2030. with 
around 96% of our overall emissions derived 
from customers’ use of our sold products (scope 
3), missionzero is where we can have the 
greatest positive impact on emissions reduction. 
in 2020, we reached significant milestones for 
missionzero. amongst others, we launched an 
innovative clay calciner system which reduces 
co2 emissions in cement production by up to 
40% compared to traditional clinker production. 
we signed a contract to substitute coal with 
our alternative fuels solution, the flsmidth 
hotdisc®, for two cement production lines 
in korea, and in turkey we are building a 
hotdisc® solution for a new cement production 
line which will achieve 86% substitution of fossil 
fuels. additionally, we started a cooperation 
with the vietnam national cement corporation 
with the goal of implementing technologies that 
radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
and developing pioneering solutions for the use 
of alternative fuels and the improvement of air 
quality.
in support of our ambition to reduce energy 
usage and increase resource efficiency in the 
mining industry,  flsmidth is driving a number 
of research and development partnerships 
with customers, third parties and academic 
institutions around the world. one of the most 
promising joint projects led by flsmidth recently 
received a eur 5.4m grant from the european 
letter to our shareholders
institute of innovation and technology to help 
accelerate innovation. on a separate track, we 
have seen increasing demand for our water 
recycling solutions from the global mining 
industry. following flsmidth’s successful 
installation of a tailing management system 
which recirculates over 86% of the process water 
at hindustan zinc limited’s mine in rajasthan, 
india, we were awarded an additional contract to 
deliver an integrated dry stack tailings solution to 
recover the process water at one of their other 
mines in rajasthan. 
to further our ambition to decarbonise the 
cement and mining industries and put flsmidth 
on the path to carbon neutrality, in early january 
2021 we committed to set science-based targets 
according to the science based targets initiative. 
we are also aligning our practices and reporting 
of climate-related financial risk with the tcfd 
recommendations. as part of this, we conducted 
a climate risk and opportunities analysis in late 
2020 facilitated by an external advisor.
step change in digitalisation
digitalisation is an important lever to accelerate 
the journey towards zero emissions in cement 
and mining and the pandemic has accelerated 
customer adoption of digitalised operations and 
remote support. a good example of this is our 
new partnership with titan cement group to 
increase digitalisation and sustainability across 
the full flowsheet of all of their 17 cement plants. 
earlier in 2020, we received an order for our 
bulkexpert™ digital solution from a customer 
in brazil. the solution will fully automate the 
stockyard operation of two large iron ore 
shipping export terminals in the south of the 
country, improving the throughput, quality and 
safety of the customer’s operations. on the 
innovation front, we launched the world’s most 
opex- and capex-efficient digitally-enabled 
gyratory crusher, and we took a major step in 
our artificial intelligence journey with the launch 
of our latest processexpert system applicable 
for both mining and cement. furthermore, we 
supplemented our in-house innovation through 
the acquisition of knowledgescape, a global 
leader in digital optimisation solutions for the 
mineral processing industry.
market developments in 2020
although demand for more digitalised and 
sustainable mine sites and cement plants is 
rising, the pandemic severely impacted our 
end markets in 2020. in particular, the cement 
industry was marked by travel restrictions and 
restricted site access. customers deferred non-
critical investments due to uncertainty and lower 
production rates which also caused reduced 
demand for spare and wear parts. following the 
shutdown of about 20% of the world’s cement 
plants outside of china in april, the share of 
cement plants in operation has since climbed 
back up above 95%. however, many plants 
continue to run at reduced capacity and cement 
customers will need to see improved cash 
generation before they ramp up investments.
the mining industry has been more resilient 
– albeit not immune – to the pandemic. after 
approximately 10% of the world’s mine sites 
were shut down in april, nearly all sites have 
since restarted production and most are 
throughout the year we have been 
executing our group business 
improvement programme, including 
site consolidation, an improved 
logistical setup and headcount 
reductions. the programme was 
completed by the end of the third 
quarter with an ebita improvement 
run-rate of dkk 150m annually. 
running at high production rates. under normal 
circumstances this would mean good conditions 
for our service business but travel restrictions 
and limited site access have continued to 
impact on-site technical services, resulting 
in reduced demand. on the positive side, 
commodity prices have rebounded strongly 
following their sharp decline earlier in the year. 
miners are generating good cash flows, but 
despite the healthy industry fundamentals, 
they have continued to defer large capital 
investments due to pandemic-induced 
uncertainty and delays related to prolonged 
environmental and other regulatory approval 
processes.
financial performance
our financial results in 2020 were negatively 
impacted by the pandemic and the rapidly 
deteriorating business environment which 
affected order intake, revenue and ebita. 
still, we achieved an organic order intake on 
par with 2019, comprising growth in mining

letter to our shareholders
including site consolidation, improved 
logistical setup and headcount reductions. the 
programme was completed by the end of the 
third quarter with an ebita improvement run-
rate of dkk 150m annually. to further address 
the challenging cement market, we have taken 
additional steps to increase outsourcing, simplify 
the cement business and adjust the cost 
structure to improve profitability. in december, 
we divested our non-core fabric filter and 
pneumatic conveying systems businesses as a 
step towards simplifying our cement business. 
effective 1 january 2021, two of our smaller 
regions, sub-saharan africa and middle east 
(ssame) and sub-continental india (scindia), 
have been merged to further reduce costs and 
complexity.
looking ahead
with continued high covid-19 infection rates 
and lockdowns in many parts of the world, 
market uncertainty remains high. the ongoing 
vaccination programmes provide a likely path 
towards  normalisation but it is difficult to predict 
when and how fast this will support our business. 
at present, our working assumption is that market 
conditions in the first half of 2021 will be similar to 
that of the second half of 2020. from the summer 
of 2021, we expect a gradual improvement in 
business sentiment and increasing access to 
customer sites, returning to a more normalised 
situation by the end of the year. the market 
outlook is, however, very different for our two end 
markets, mining and cement.
we are positive on the outlook for mining. most 
commodities have seen a strong rebound in 
prices, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. mine 
sites, overall, are running at high production 
rates and industry fundamentals are healthy. 
in the longer term, the switch to green energy 
and electric-powered transportation will create 
increasing demand for copper and battery 
metals for which the mining industry will need to 
scale up investments in order to meet.
the cement market, on the other hand, is faced 
with ongoing overcapacity and we see no short- 
to medium-term recovery. thus we continue 
activities to reshape our cement business. large 
economic stimulus programmes, combined with 
an increasing focus on lower-carbon cement, 
will create good opportunities in the medium- to 
long-term but the timing and extent of an overall 
rebound in the cement market remain uncertain. 
it is, however, clear that the cement industry 
will need substantial investments to meet the 
emissions reduction targets set by a growing 
number of cement producers as well as the 
recent commitments to carbon neutrality made 
by the global cement and concrete association 
and the european cement association. based 
on the need to decarbonise, we foresee 
a multi-commodity cement industry in the 
future, utilising a range of cement production 
processes and a variety of raw materials. as the 
industry’s leading and most innovative premium 
supplier with strong process know-how, we 
are strongly positioned to benefit from this 
development.
in the short- to medium-term, we are 
nevertheless faced with the challenge of 
managing two industries, mining and cement, 
every crisis presents challenges as 
well as opportunities. the current 
health (and economic) crisis is no 
different and we will seek to capture 
those opportunities, whether they 
entail organic or acquisitive growth. 
with diverging end markets. consequently, we 
are further strengthening our two industries 
setup, while keeping focus on leveraging 
synergies and ensuring clear capital allocation 
to capture growth opportunities and maximise 
value creation within both businesses. in 
parallel, we are considering acquisitions to 
strengthen our offerings, particularly in mining 
and within the areas of sustainability and 
digitalisation. it is highly uncertain as to whether 
and when acquisitions will materialise.

and a decline in cement. the contraction in 
cement revenue was both a consequence of 
the pandemic and the low backlog entering the 
year. we have carried out activities to adjust the 
cost base accordingly but in some countries we 
were constrained from doing so by local labour 
restrictions related to covid-19. also, mobility 
restrictions related to the pandemic affected 
the utilisation of our global service technicians 
and resulted in more complex and costly 
logistics. though not immune to the pandemic, 
our mining business was relatively resilient 
whereas the sharp decline in revenue had a 
severe impact on the profitability in our cement 
business.
in spite of the difficult business environment, we 
secured four large orders and a book-to-bill of 
113% for the year. as a result of our strong cash 
focus, the net working capital ratio decreased 
from 13.3% to 10.7% and free cash flow more 
than doubled to dkk 1bn in 2020.

flsmidth guides for group reve-
nue of dkk 15.5-17.0bn and a 
group ebita-margin of 5-6%. the 
guidance is based on expected 
different developments in the two 
individual businesses, mining and 
cement, and continued impact 
from the pandemic in the first half 
of 2021. 
 
guidance 2021 
the guidance for 2021 is subject to uncertainty 
due to the covid-19 pandemic. lockdowns and 
mobility restrictions continue to impact suppliers, 
customers and our workforce. restricted access 
to customer sites, in particular, is creating uncer-
tainty around the timing of our order backlog 
conversion and the activity level for our service 
business. a gradual improvement in business 
sentiment and access to customer sites is, how-
ever, expected in the second half of the year. 
 
the outlook for the mining industry remains posi-
tive. for 2021, the mining business revenue and 
ebita are expected to grow in the second half of 
the year as covid-19 restrictions are expected 
to ease. ebita-margin for mining is expected to 
be high-single digit. 
 
the outlook for the cement industry remains im-
pacted by overcapacity and slow recovery. the 
cement business revenue is expected to decline 
further in 2021, and as a consequence, initiatives 
to reshape the cement business will continue 
during the year. the cement business is not ex-
pected to be ebita positive in 2021 due to con-
tinued cement reshaping costs and low capacity 
utilisation in the service business until the pan-
demic eases. 
 
cash flow from investments (excluding acquisi-
tions and divestments) is expected to be largely 
in line with 2020. 
 
mid- and long-term financial 
targets 
in recent years, cement industry dynamics have 
diverged from those of the mining industry. 
whereas fundamentals for the mining industry re-
main positive, overcapacity in the cement indus-
try has put pressure on the returns of the cement 
producers, a development which has been fur-
ther accelerated by the ongoing pandemic.  
 
the structural changes in the cement industry 
and the pandemic have increased uncertainty 
around our mid- and long-term target levels and 
the timing for achieving these targets. conse-
quently, it has been decided to withdraw the mid- 
and long- term financial targets. targets for capi-
tal structure, including financial gearing, equity 
ratio and dividend policy remain unchanged. 
 
we will resume communication on the longer-
term prospects for our mining and cement busi-
nesses when we have sufficient visibility.

  an investment in the green transition  
with economic growth and urbanisation comes 
the demand for infrastructure and modern con-
veniences, such as consumer electronics. re-
newable energy, electric cars, wind and solar en-
ergy all require cement and minerals. 
 
the transitions of the mining and cement indus-
tries to sustainable forms of production are criti-
cal to solving the challenges of climate change. 
energy-intensive industries, such as mining and 
cement, are indispensable to the global econ-
omy and essential to making the green transition 
a reality. that is why it is critical to de-carbonise 
and modernise these sectors. the transition to-
wards sustainable production requires innovative 
solutions and both regulators as well as custom-
ers are increasingly setting new or stricter emis-
sions-reduction targets. as a technology leader 
in the mining and cement industries, we already 
have a strong portfolio of sustainable solutions 
and we recognise our role to lead these indus-

the covid-19 pandemic had a 
significant impact on our industries, 
customers, company and 
employees. we continue to 
monitor the situation and take swift 
action where necessary to ensure 
the safety of our employees, 
protect the interests of our 
customers and secure our supply 
chain. 
 
customer impact 
most of our customers have maintained business 
continuity during the pandemic. however, in or-
der to reduce the risk of covid-19 transmission 
within their workforces, many of them have cho-
sen to run their operations with minimal staff on-
site, and several have closed site access to sup-
pliers. roughly 97% of mine sites and 95% of ce-
ment plants are currently back in operation, but 
many cement plants run at reduced capacity utili-
sation and access to sites remains difficult for 
suppliers.  
 
the pandemic has accelerated customer de-
mand for digital optimisation, with the number of 
hours spent on digital troubleshooting for cus-
tomers doubling since the beginning of the year. 
a growing number of customers are now enjoy-
ing the benefits of our remote condition monitor-
ing tools and services and are in regular contact 
with our 24/7 remote technical support staff. our 
on-site solutions have also proved their value to 
customers during the pandemic. for example, 
with our siteconnect mobile app, customers are 
able to monitor asset performance and health 
data without having to be on site or in the control 
room. though restricted site access has made it 
challenging to install new digital solutions on-site, 
we have successfully implemented remote soft-
ware upgrades and plant improvements. 
 
supply chain impact 
as a global business, the timing and extent of the 
pandemic’s impact on our operations has varied 
across our locations. in response, we have en-
deavoured to maintain resilience and flexibility 
within our global supply chain and the ability to 
source from suppliers across all regions. as a re-
sult, while we have incurred some additional 
costs, there has been very little disruption within 
our global supply chain during the pandemic. 
where sub-suppliers have struggled to deliver, 
we have been able to successfully switch to sup-
pliers in other parts of the world. 
 
to simplify and focus the supply base, we have 
been steadily reducing the number of suppliers 
we work with. in total, we have halved our num-
ber of suppliers over the past few years to 7,500. 
of these, fewer than 1,500 suppliers now collec-
tively account for 90% of our global supplies. 
these suppliers are evenly split among geogra-
phies to reduce transportation, lead-time and im-
prove agility with stronger delivery capability. 
two thirds of the suppliers are based in low-mid-
dle income countries. along with the partnership 
approach, this allows for better screening of sup-
pliers and improved customer experience.  
internal operational impact 
ensuring the safety of our employees has always 
been our most important priority. following the 
outbreak and spread of the pandemic, we estab-
lished crisis management teams at group and re-
gional levels and undertook continuous risk as-
sessments in order to ensure that actions taken 
were proving effective in minimising infection 
rates. these measures included providing per-
sonal protective equipment, ensuring safe em-
ployee transportation and implementing travel 
bans, contact tracing programmes, temperature 
screenings and entrance testing, depending on 
location.  
 
as of end-2020, almost 100% of our blue-collar 
employees where on-site at our manufacturing, 
assembly and warehouse sites, while around 
50% of our global office employees were work-
ing from home. we have unfortunately had to re-
duce our workforce significantly during the year. 
in light of the pandemic, the increased degree of 
flexible working arrangements and an expected 
slow recovery within cement, we have decided 
to revisit our plans for building a new campus in 
copenhagen, valby. 
 
travel restrictions continue to impact the capac-
ity utilisation for our global service technicians, 
and the lockdowns and travel restrictions put in 
place as a result of the latest wave of covid-19 
cases will continue to impact our business during

while the global economy was impacted by the 
covid-19 pandemic, the mining industry has re-
mained relatively resilient during the course of 
2020 with the majority of mines operational 
across regions. roughly 10% of the world’s mine 
sites were shut down in april, but nearly all sites 
have since restarted production and most are 
running with high production rates. under normal 
circumstances this would stimulate investments 
and deliver good conditions for our service busi-
ness, but travel restrictions and limited site ac-
cess have continued to impact on-site technical 
services, resulting in reduced demand. mines are 
often remotely located and many customers are 
still enforcing safety protocols and restricting site 
access to external service providers in order to 
protect employees and safeguard production, 
which impacts their equipment and service 
spend. 
 
 
on the positive side, commodity prices have re-
bounded strongly from the spring when the first 
pandemic wave hit, and the industry is expected 
to recover to pre-pandemic activity levels within 
a relatively short time. in december, copper 
prices reached a seven-year high of usd 8,000 
per tonne, which represents a 70% increase 
compared to the low point in march 2020. min-
ers are generating good cash flows, but despite 
the healthy industry fundamentals, they have 
continued to defer large capital investments due 
to pandemic-induced uncertainty and delays re-
lated to prolonged environmental and other reg-
ulatory approval processes. in many of our re-
gions, refurbishment and maintenance has been 
postponed, which is expected to translate into 
new opportunities when the market comes back. 
however, the timing of converting opportunities 
to orders remains unpredictable and with infec-
tion cases currently surging in many parts of the 
world, it is still difficult to predict the shape of the 
recovery curve. it is, however, expected that the 
pandemic will continue to impact the industry in 
the first half of 2021. 
 
the second wave that is currently sweeping 
across the globe is impacting regions at different 
times and to varying extent. national lockdowns 
continue to reduce activity in many south ameri-
can countries, where quarantines have halted or 
slowed numerous mines and development pro-
jects. in north america, the pandemic led to a 
sharp drop in business activity in the spring, and 
while the situation improved over the summer, it 
deteriorated again towards the end of the year 
as infection rates increased and caused renewed 
uncertainty. despite high infection rates, the ac-
tivity level in eastern europe has held up well, 
whereas the second wave has triggered new site 
closures and very restricted access to mines in 
sub-saharan africa and the middle east. in india, 
market activity has improved compared to the 
low levels in previous quarters and we are see-
ing an increase in demand for solutions within 
tailings management and water recovery. iron 
ore and gold production remain strong in aus-
tralia, supported by record-high production vol-
umes. 
 
all things considered, the pandemic has dis-
rupted the mining industry to a lesser degree 
than many other industries. the outlook for in-
vestments in mining remains positive, and we 
have a healthy pipeline of both small and large 
opportunities. further, the switch to green en-
ergy and electric-powered transportation will re-
quire a massive increase in infrastructure and the 
mining industry will need to scale up investments 
in copper, battery metals and other minerals to 
meet this growing demand.

management review           business  
  
the cement market entered 2020 with substan-
tial overcapacity and has been severely im-
pacted by the pandemic and we do not antici-
pate a recovery in the short- to medium-term. 
large economic stimulus programmes, com-
bined with an increasing focus on lower-carbon 
cement, are expected to create good opportuni-
ties in the medium- to long-term but the timing 
and extent of an overall rebound in the cement 
market remain uncertain. 
 
following the shutdown of about 20% of the 
world’s cement plants outside of china in april, 
the share of cement plants in operation has since 
climbed back up above 95% at year-end. how-
ever, many plants continue to run at reduced ca-
pacity and sites remain difficult to access due to 
restrictions and preventative measurements 
taken by authorities and plant operators. this has 
affected service activity and curbed investments. 
as economic growth is one of the most important 
drivers for cement demand, our customers are 
sensitive to market fluctuations and typically re-
spond through cash preservation. cement con-
sumption continues to be impacted by reduced 
construction activity, and across regions most 
large investments have been suspended pend-
ing an improvement in the business outlook. op-
erating expenditures have also declined as ce-
ment companies endeavour to stay profitable 
during a period of reduced demand and high un-
certainty. 
in north america, the outcome of the us presi-
dential election should help remove the uncer-
tainty that has held back investments, allowing 
the industry to begin planning ahead again. the 
us government’s large infrastructure spending 
bill, which earmarks more than usd 1 trillion to 
upgrade national infrastructure, could be passed 
in the first half of 2021 which would help to boost 
optimism among cement producers and increase 
confidence in the market. in india, market activity 
has improved compared to the low levels seen in 
previous quarters and the indian government is 
pushing for infrastructure investments and hous-
ing. the chinese economy is nearly back to nor-
mal but most other asian countries continue to 
be severely impacted by covid-19 from either a 
health or economic perspective. market activity 
in africa and the middle east remains significantly 
lower and lockdowns continue to reduce activity 
at cement plants across south america. most of 
our cement customers in europe, north-africa 
and russia will need to see improved cash gen-
eration before they ramp up investments. any 
capital investments in the foreseeable future are 
anticipated to be allocated towards more sustain-
able cement production. 
during the last weeks of 2020, the eu commis-
sion agreed on a 55% reduction target for green-
house gas emissions by 2030, and a budget that 
allows for a green recovery following covid-19 
restrictions. the green recovery will fuel demand 
for emissions-reducing technologies and the ce-
ment industry will need to undertake substantial 
investments to meet recent commitments to car-
bon neutrality by the global cement and con-
crete association and the european cement as-
sociation. the us re-joining the paris climate 
accord and the coming implementation of phase 
iv of the eu emissions trading system (ets) are 
other factors likely to encourage cement produc-
ers to invest in emissions-reducing technologies 
such as flsmidth’s recently announced calci-
nated clay system.

the road to 
zero emissions 
combined, cement and minerals production 
currently account for approximately 10% of all 
global co2 emissions. with growing populations, 
a larger middle class, and a transition to greener 
energy, the demand for cement and minerals 
- and thus the environmental impact - will only 
increase in the next decade. 
a more sustainable future requires action 
from the industries. we will lead this action 
towards zero emissions in mining and cement, 
without compromising quality or our customers' 
commercial competitiveness. flsmidth 
already offers many solutions to reduce the 
environmental footprint but more work, often in 
partnership is needed to ensure the right pathway 
for decarbonisation. our missionzero programme 
is aimed to deliver and implement these solutions.
the goals that underpin the missionzero 
programme are inspired by and contribute directly 
to some of the un sustainable development 
goals (sdgs), including those related to water, 
affordable and clean energy, industry and 
innovation, responsible consumption and climate 
action. further, we have set targets specifically 
to our own operations and for our suppliers 
including targets on gender equality that are in 
support of specific sdgs. to further our ambition 
to decarbonise the cement and mining industries 
and put flsmidth on the path to carbon neutrality, 
in early 2021 we committed to set science-based 
targets according to the science based targets 
initiative. in addition to targets for our suppliers 
and our own operations, we have committed 
to a 7% year-on-year reduction in downstream 
(customer) emissions relative to revenue from 
2019 to 2030. this is pivotal as around 96% of our 
overall emissions are derived from customers’ use 
of our sold products (scope 3).
we are also aligning our practices and reporting 
of climate-related financial risk with the task force 
for climate related financial disclosure (tcfd) 
recommendations. as part of this, we conducted 
a climate risk and opportunities analysis in late 
2020 facilitated by an external advisor.
concurrently with the annual report, flsmidth 
has published its annual sustainability report, 
covering non-financial performance related to 
environmental and socio-economic impacts. the 
2020 sustainability report is in full compliance
with both sections 99a, 99b and 107d of 
the danish financial statements act and in 
accordance to the global reporting initiative 
(gri) core requirements, and also serves as the 
advanced communication on progress to the 
united nations global compact. the report has 
been subject to limited assurance performed by 
ernst & young. the report is available at
www.flsmidth.com/sustainabilityreport2020
with missionzero, we aim to deliver solutions that make 
it possible to operate zero-emissions cement plants and 
manage zero-emissions mining processes by 2030. 
cement
the three main levers to reduce a cement 
plant’s environmental footprint are calcination, 
fuel for heating, and electric power 
consumption. with existing solutions and our 
current technology roadmap, we are already 
capable of reducing emissions by 70 percent.
mining
challenges such as water use, emissions, 
and energy waste are at the top of the 
mining agenda. if these issues are not 
addressed, access to investment, regulatory 
compliance, license to operate and the 
industry's own reputation are all at risk.
zero emissions
reduce emissions from fuel 
burning and reduce process 
emissions from calcination.
100% fuel substitutions 
eliminate the need for fossil fuels 
and deliver solutions for 100 
percent alternative fuel.
zero waste
no waste heat, use of waste 
streams as raw material and 
circular processes.
zero water waste
enable zero discharge
and 100% re-use.
zero emissions
eliminate emissions from use of 
fossil fuels in transportation and 
minerals processing.
zero energy waste
reduce energy costs and energy 
waste, especially from energy 
intensive mills.

generally, calculating ghg impacts from scope 3 depends on a number of estimates and 
assumptions. examples include the expected utilisation and lifetime of sold products, and as such 
scope 3 emissions are subject to more uncertainty than scope 1 and 2 impacts. in 2020, we 
completed a first iteration of our scope 3 ghg impact mapping. in accordance with the 
greenhouse gas protocol, we intend to validate our data as an iterative process ongoingly.
we calculate our ghg emissions based on the 
standards of the greenhouse gas protocol, which 
provides a standardised framework to measure 
greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, both for direct 
emissions from our own company and from our entire 
value chain.
 
the ghg protocol includes impacts for a number of 
ghgs, expressed as co2-equivalents (co2e). this 
means they are expressed as the amount of co2 that 
would give the same ghg impact.
 
in short, the ghg protocol divides a company’s value 
chain ghg emissions into three scopes: 
 
1. direct ghg emissions from own facilities and 
vehicles
2. indirect ghg emissions from purchased electricity, 
steam, heating and cooling
3. indirect ghg emissions from the value chain, 
including both upstream emissions (e.g. purchased 
goods and services, upstream transportation and 
distribution, and business travel) and downstream 
emissions (e.g. downstream transportation and 
distribution, use of sold products and end-of-life 
treatment of sold products)
customers use of our products make up around
96% of our total scope 1-3 emissions.
our impact across 
the value chain
as a leading supplier of equipment and
service solutions to the mining and cement
industries, we have a substantial influence 
on our value chain.

n early 2021, we committed to and 
submitted science-based global 
carbon reduction targets which are 
now pending validation by the science based 
targets initiative. having an independent body 
validate our targets reinforces our long-term 
commitment and our determination to reach our 
targets. the systematic approach helps us break 
the main target into tangible, yet ambitious 
steps. 
targets across the value chain
downstream is where we have our largest 
impact. that is why with missionzero, our target 
is to enable our customers to produce cement 
and minerals with zero emissions. 
however, we are including science-based 
targets for the entire value chain.
i
what are science-based targets
science-based targets provide a clearly defined pathway for companies to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. targets are considered science-based if 
they are in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet 
the goals of the 2015 paris agreement. the science based targets initiative is a 
partnership between cdp disclosure insight action, the united nations global 
compact, the world resources institute and world wildlife fund (wwf).
upstream
we work with our suppliers to move towards 
greenhouse gas emission reductions by 
2030. by 2025, 30% of our suppliers, based 
on spend, need to have set their own targets 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
downstream
our downstream target is a 7% year-on-year 
reduction in carbon emissions per unit of 
revenue from a 2019 baseline until 2030. it 
is calculated as tonnes of co2-equivalents
divided by revenue in dkk. 
by far our largest environmental impact stems 
from the use of our products by our customers. 
at the time of reporting, our targets have been submitted for validation and are 
pending approval from the science based targets initiative.
own operations
from our own direct emissions, 
we have set a target to reduce our 
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 
to 0 and be carbon-neutral by 2030. those 
emissions stem from our manufacturing 
and transportation, and the energy we 
use in our offices and production.
science-based targets 
and how they will lead 
us towards zero
with missionzero, we have a clear ambition to do our part 
in limiting global warming to 1.5°c. fulfilling this ambition 
requires a systematic approach to reducing greenhouse 
gases. we are now setting science-based targets.

flsmidth strives to be the leading supplier 
of sustainable productivity to the global 
mining and cement industries, and we are 
already well-positioned in this endeavour. we 
help our customers to increase their production, 
lower their operating costs and reduce their envi-
ronmental footprint.  
 
with a local presence in more than 60 countries 
and customers in more than 150 countries,  
flsmidth is truly a global company. the geo-
graphical footprint reflects our diverse customer 
base, composed primarily of global and regional 
mining and cement companies which invest in 
new capacity or in expanding, upgrading, main-
taining and servicing existing production facili-
ties.  
 
our business model is anchored around a 
unique combination of projects, products and 
services. however, we have a strategic focus to 
expand the share of services and standardised 
products relative to the share of large projects. 
this focus will help us obtain a more profitable 
business mix and a less cyclical business with a 
lower level of risk. while the process expertise 
we gain from projects is key to delivering produc-
tivity improvements to our customers, we remain 
selective in taking on large projects to ensure 
that terms and conditions support our profitability 
targets.  
 
to further strengthen our position as sustaina-
ble productivity provider #1, we have iden-
tified five key strategic focus areas (illustrated on 
next page). 
 
customers 
flsmidth has vast experience in working with a 
broad range of customers around the world. our 
customers consist of both global majors and mid-
sized regional players. the latter account for a 
relatively large amount of our project sales, 
whereas the global majors account for a consid-
erable share of our service business.  
 
being close to our customers is key. combining 
local presence with global support and expertise 
makes it possible to deliver premium solutions 
where our customers need them. our large num-
ber of local sales and service offices ensures fre-
quent customer interaction and high speed of 
delivery, and we continue to open sales and ser-
vice offices around the world to cover new geo-
graphical regions and overcome the increasing 
challenge of trade barriers. while expanding and 
localising our service footprint, we have pursued 
a strategy of consolidating our supply chain and  
strategy

management review           business  
  
project centres to ensure the leanest possible or-
ganisation. 
 
despite cyclical end markets, we consistently pri-
oritise maintaining and developing a strong and 
competent sales force, ever aware that the 
strength of our customer relationships during the 
downturn will help to define our success in the 
industry upturn. we constantly seek to minimise 
administrative functions and allocate resources 
to sales and service.  
 
as a result, a large proportion of our employees 
has direct contact with customers. our customers 
recognise us for our high quality and reliability, 
which is also reflected in our quality kpi, difot 
(delivery in full on time). difot has risen from 
84% in 2016 to 88% in 2020. 
 
sustainability 
flsmidth's relatively asset-light business model 
means that the environmental footprint from our 
own operations is very modest compared to that 
of our customers. a large cement producer has a 
carbon footprint about 4,000 times that of fl-
smidth, and our annual water consumption 
equals roughly two weeks of water consumed by 
a copper mine (100,000 tpy). therefore, our ap-
proach to sustainability is to take responsibility 
for our own environmental footprint while helping 
our customers reduce theirs, where we can have 
a much greater positive impact on emissions re-
duction. for this reason, we launched mission-
zero in 2019, which is an integral part of our busi-
ness strategy and explained in more detail on 
page 18-20. 
innovation & digitalisation 
our efforts in innovation and digitalisation are an 
important sustainability enabler. greater scarcity 
of resources such as energy, water and raw ma-
terials leads to more complex and costly opera-
tions that challenges the performance of mining 
and cement companies. this calls for innovation, 
digitalisation and high-end technical solutions, 
which is where flsmidth has a leading position 
and a competitive edge. our strong digital capa-
bilities are founded on our extensive experience 
in automating plants, which positions us as a 
market leader in analysing and understanding 
performance data. an increasing share of our 
products and solutions offered to the cement 
and mining industries is becoming intelligent and 
self-learning. mining and cement have historically 
been conservative industries but the needs of 
our customers are changing more rapidly today. 
their constant hunt for productivity, reduced en-
vironmental footprint and higher returns makes 
them more receptive to innovation and new ways 
of working, which is fuelling a growing interest in 
digitalisation.  
 
digitalisation offers huge potential but first and 
foremost we see it as an enabler. it has become 
a natural and integral part of our product portfolio 
and the benefits to our customers are clear: in-
creased productivity through optimisation, more 
reliable operations, increased uptime as well as 
proactive, predictive and increasingly prescrip-
tive maintenance. our ability to deliver productiv-
ity improvements is anchored in a full flowsheet 
of premium sustainable technologies (see page 
24-25), combined with strong process knowhow 
and a broad range of services.

life cycle approach 
to achieve a sustainable productivity improve-
ment, companies need to adopt an end-to-end 
process and integrate the whole value chain. 
forces must be activated simultaneously from 
multiple directions and across the organisation to 
create the kind of momentum that leads to sus-
tainable change. through a life cycle approach, 
we enable our customers to lower their total cost 
of ownership. 
 
our digitalisation efforts will help pave the way 
for growing our spare and wear parts business in 
the years to come, as customers increasingly buy 
solutions rather than single parts and equipment. 
over the years, we have successfully built a large 
service business focusing on spare parts, up-
grades and maintenance. our customers benefit 
from the most comprehensive product portfolio 
in the industry, allowing them to increase the 
productivity of their complete value chain. a full 
flowsheet facilitates digital access to all key pro-
cesses and equipment. to be able to address is-
sues before equipment breaks down, we create 
powerful connections between physical and digi-
tal systems which lay the foundation for analytics-
driven predictive maintenance. we can then digi-
talise the entire supply chain to provide proactive 
condition monitoring and data collection, identify-
ing damage or wear ahead of any failure. 
 
standardisation 
through value engineering and modularisation, 
we re-think the designs of our products to in-
crease reliability and reduce cost and complexity 
without compromising on quality and functional-
ity.  
 
our standardisation programme has yielded sub-
stantial results. we have, in recent years, stand-
ardised products such as our vertical roller mills, 
coolers, burners, feeders and concentrators al-
lowing for a higher degree of configuration and 
less customisation. we will continue standardis-
ing more products.  
 
reducing our procurement costs through stand-
ardisation represents a huge potential. produc-
tion costs account for about 75% of our overall 
revenue, of which 70-80% relates to procure-
ment from sub-contractors. smarter product de-
sign enables us to significantly reduce our pro-
curement costs, and we achieve other benefits 
such as reduced engineering hours, enhanced 
product reliability and simpler maintenance pro-
cedures – to the benefit of our customers and 
ourselves. 
 
our values 
based on our values – competence, co-op-
eration and responsibility – we earn the 
trust and respect of our customers, business 
partners, suppliers, employees and shareholders 
in the communities in which we live and operate.

 mining 
 
we are one of the market leaders 
in mining with one of the strongest 
brands and broadest offerings. 
 
flsmidth is a supplier of premium technology to 
the global mining industry. we offer a complete 
array of products, systems and services, ranging 
from single engineered or standardised equip-
ment, such as crushers, ball mills, pumps, gravity 
concentrators, thickeners, flotation cells and au-
tomated laboratories to bundled equipment, full 
production plants and maintenance solutions. 
 
we increase the productivity of our customers’ 
complete "pit to plant" operation by integrating 
upstream mining with downstream processing. 
our broad offering ranges all the way from 'in-pit-
crushing-and-conveying' (ipcc) to recovery and 
refining of minerals and tailings management. in 
salt lake city, usa, we have a laboratory with 
state-of-the-art materials testing capabilities to 
analyse ore samples from our customers’ mines. 
this ensures an early dialogue with the customer 
and, not least, an in-depth knowledge of their 
material, including material hardness and the  
minerals concentration which is used to deter-
mine the optimal grinding and separation pro-
cess. 
 
the current mining cycle is a productivity cycle 
which clearly favours premium suppliers that 
have the flowsheet, process knowledge and ser-
vice skills to help customers optimise existing 
production facilities and minimise their environ-
mental footprint. 
 
 
1. extraction and size control 
ore is defined as materials that con-
tain minerals financially viable to ex-
tract. ore is extracted through meth-
ods such as drilling and blasting and 
transported to a crusher or crushed 
in-pit and conveyed out, a method 
usually more energy efficient.  
 
the ore is crushed to reduce the par-
ticle size. 
  2. comminution 
crushed ore is fed into a mill and 
ground to a powder. most often a wet 
process that facilitates transportation 
as a slurry. once milled, the material 
goes through screens and cyclones 
that separate the coarse and fine ma-
terial. coarse material is sent back to 
the mill. mills are highly energy-inten-
sive, representing about half of the 
energy consumed by an entire mine 
and estimated to account for 3% of all 
global electricity use. 
 
novel comminution such as fls-
midth's hpgrs can reduce water and 
energy consumption. 
  3. beneficiation and recovery 
the valuable minerals are then sepa-
rated and concentrated. this involves 
flotation, concentration, clarification, 
and thickening. a flotation cell re-
moves impurities, producing a more 
concentrated product. chemicals and 
oils coat the mineral content so it 
sticks to air bubbles. the bubbles 
form froth containing the concentrate, 
which is skimmed off the top. the 
concentrate is sent for further upgra-
ding. 
  4. thickening and filtration 
the left-over materials called tailings 
accumulate at the bottom, and it is 
separated to recover the water. tail-
ings are moved to clarifiers and thick-
eners, where the particles settle at 
the bottom and the water can be re-
covered and re-used. filter presses 
remove additional water, leaving filter 
cake. recycled water is re-used mini-
mising fresh water intake. 
  5. tailings management 
in the most environmentally sound 
method of managing tailings, the filter 
cake is mixed with waste rock and 
stored as “dry stack tailings.” 
 
this solution with filtered tailings 
removes the risk of dam failures.

 cement 
 
we are the market leader in the 
premium segment of the cement 
industry with the most complete 
offering and the strongest brand. 
we supply the widest array of products, systems 
and services, ranging from single engineered 
and customised equipment, such as mills, kiln 
systems and clinker coolers, to more standard-
ised products such as feeding and packaging 
machines as well as complete cement plants, 
maintenance and remote online support. 
 
years ago, the cement market divided into a pre-
mium market and a mid-market. the premium  
market consists of customers valuing lower total 
cost of ownership, more flexible and environ-
mentally friendly cement plants and local con-
struction. flsmidth caters to the premium market 
with equipment, services and complete plants 
and is the clear market leader in this segment. 
 
the mid-market is dominated by asian suppliers 
and is characterised by customers preferring the 
lowest initial investment. however, customers of- 
ten require a combination of low cost (mid-mar-
ket) construction combined with premium engi-
neering and procurement. flsmidth has part-
nered with asian suppliers to accommodate such 
customer requests and most asian suppliers are, 
in reality, partners as well as good customers of 
flsmidth. therefore, we are working to offer not 
only the best complete cement plants but to be-
come the preferred brand for all key equipment 
in a cement plant. 
 
 
1. quarrying and crushing 
the main raw materials needed to 
make cement are limestone and clay. 
limestone is calcium carbonate, 
caco3, and is 44% co2 by weight. 
deposits are drilled, blasted or ripped 
using heavy machinery, and the mate-
rials are then transported to the 
crusher to reduce the size of the 
rocks. this is the first step where  
flsmidth equipment is involved. 
  2. drying and raw grinding 
the materials are fed to the raw mill, 
ground to the right particle size and 
dried to the right moisture content. 
the outcome, raw meal, is stored in a 
silo and further mixed to ensure a 
consistent chemical composition. this 
is a main driver for better perfor-
mance of the kiln system and final 
clinker quality. the process requires a 
lot of power. 
  3. pyro-processing 
when the raw meal reaches the cal-
ciner at the bottom of the pre-heater 
tower, it has a temperature of 1000°c. 
heating the materials releases the 
co2 contained in the limestone. 
these are inevitable calcination emis-
sions. the material then enters the  
rotary kiln and is heated to 1450°c. 
the heating melts the rocks to form 
clinker, the main component of  
cement. 
  4. clinker and cement grinding 
the clinker is ground in a mill to re-
duce its particle size. clinker has a 
high carbon footprint, and a focus 
area is to reduce the amount of 
clinker in the final product. this can 
be achieved by mixing it with addi-
tives. different cements are used for 
different applications, so clinker and 
additives are mixed in the right quan-
tities to get the right type and quality. 
  5. dispatching 
the cement is then ready to be dis-
patched. it can be packed in 50 kg 
bags and loaded onto trucks, or it 
can be shipped by 25t bulk tankers. 
it is shipped by rail or ship. ultimately 
it is mixed with water, sand and 
gravel to form concrete, which is 
used to build the infrastructure 
around us. 
digitalisation is a major driver for change that is
accelerating the pace of sustainable productivity
improvements. our strong focus on sustainable
innovations enables our customers to improve
their operations and helps us to expand the gap
to mid-market and single equipment suppliers. at
flsmidth, we leverage digital technologies to
empower our business strategy, and our digital
premium offering will enable us to capture a larger
share of the market for services.
innovation & 
digitalisation
digital and innovative solutions are the levers 
to deliver on our missionzero commitment to 
offer our customers the technology required 
to operate zero-emissions cement plants and 
mining processes by 2030. by utilising the 
power of digitalisation we can increase our 
customers’ productivity and at the same time 
lead these industries into a sustainable future. 
achieving this goal requires a paradigm shift 
in collaboration, innovation and adoption 
of new technology. innovation at flsmidth 
takes place at three levels: in-house in our 
technology centres, on-site with customers and 
through partnerships with third parties. looking 
back on the first year of the missionzero 
programme, we have received strong interest 
from several parties to co-create solutions and 
we will continue to co-develop technology with 
customers, universities and other partners. 
an example of partnership innovation is our 
cooperation with vicem, the leading cement 
producer in vietnam. in february 2020, we 
jointly announced a partnership with the goal of 
developing breakthrough innovations that will 
significantly increase the sustainability of the 
vietnamese cement industry. a key focus will be 
on the utilisation of municipal and other waste 
streams as alternative fuel sources, thereby 
reducing air pollution by replacing the burning 
of fossil fuels. while management of waste is 
a growing concern in vietnam, flsmidth is 
flsmidth ■ annual report 2020
          business

innovation & digitalisation
developing solutions that enable a 100% switch 
to alternative fuels, which can reduce about 
one-third of carbon emissions. other areas of 
the partnership will focus on solutions related to 
energy efficiency and waste-heat recovery. this 
partnership is an important step for the sector 
and the people of vietnam. 
in addition to innovation and partnerships, 
we consider acquisitions to supplement 
our missionzero offering. in october 2020, 
flsmidth announced the acquisition of 
knowledgescape, a global leader in digital 
optimisation solutions for the mineral processing 
industry. the addition of knowledgescape’s 
advanced solutions will deliver an expanded 
range of benefits to our customers within 
expert control solutions and advanced sensor 
technologies for automating, optimising and 
increasing the reliability of minerals processing 
circuits. these solutions are leading-edge 
technologies that serve as an important 
differentiating market factor within productivity 
upgrades, retrofits and new installations, all 
in line with our focus on creating sustainable 
and environmentally friendly solutions to 
our customers in mining and cement. seen 
from a pure digital offering perspective, the 
combination of our two digital portfolios means 
that flsmidth is now one of the few suppliers 
in the market able to offer a plant-wide digital 
optimisation solution that enables our customers 
to reduce costs and environmental impact.
the range of benefits delivered by digitalisation 
has become even more apparent during the 
covid-19 pandemic. given current priorities, the 
advantages of remotely controlled operations 
and predictive maintenance have been highly 
appreciated by customers. we have hundreds 
of sites connected to an online network and the 
number of measurements received per day has 
significantly increased in 2020. we now receive 
around 105 million data measurements per day 
with a range of benefits: safety, productivity, 
cost savings, sustainability and increased 
uptime. the data is analysed to provide detailed 
information on our customers’ equipment, 
allowing us to suggest optimisations and 
efficiency improvements. the method covers 
the full spectrum from running an analysis 
all the way to artificial intelligence providing 
guidance on a specific part that is developing a 
weakness and is about to break. this allows it 
to be replaced before it causes more problems, 
extending downtime and potentially impacting 
machinery downstream. 
in addition to the productivity improvements, 
safety is also an area that is significantly 
strengthened by digitalised solutions. remote 
operating centres mean fewer employees on 
site that are exposed to potentially hazardous 
situations. when logistics are severely 
challenged, when it becomes difficult or even 
impossible to be on site, suddenly all the value 
of digitalisation becomes crystal clear. during 
covid-19, digital sceptics have been forced 
to work through online platforms and software 
solutions have gained more acceptance. 2020 
has clearly seen a digital breakthrough and 
the ongoing growth of digitalised solutions will 
unquestionably outlast the global pandemic.

service orders accounted for 49% of the total 
order intake.  
 
mining order intake increased 2% organically 
thanks to higher capital order intake, whereas 
service order intake continued to be negatively 
impacted by restricted access to mine sites. ser-
vice orders accounted for 59% of the mining or-

order intake in cement increased 39% organi-
cally and included a large contract for engineer-
ing, procurement and supervision on a greenfield 
cement plant in ethiopia valued at around dkk 
750m. excluding this contract, cement order in-
take declined on q4 last year, due to the contin-
ued impact of the pandemic and a generally sub-
dued market which resulted in lower activity 
levels for service and equipment. 
 
order backlog and maturity 
despite a book-to-bill of 111% in q4, the order 
backlog was largely unchanged from the previ-
ous quarter at dkk 14,874m (q3 2020: dkk 
14,839m, as foreign exchange and divestments 
led to a reduction of the backlog. 64% of the 
backlog is expected to be converted to revenue 
in 2021, 29% in 2022, and 7% in 2023 and be-
yond. the large cement project booked in q4 
2020 is scheduled for delivery mainly in 2022-
2023. 
 
revenue 
revenue declined 30% to dkk 4,236m in q4 
2020 (q4 2019: dkk 6,022m) and declined 24% 
organically, comprising a 15% decrease in mining 
and a 37% decline in cement. the decline in rev-
enue was explained by an exceptionally strong 
comparison quarter, a low cement backlog en-
tering the year and restricted access to customer 
sites because of the pandemic. consequently, 
we did not see the usual seasonality during 
which q4 is typically the strongest quarter by far 
in the year, although revenue did pick up 10% 
quarter on quarter thanks to slightly higher year-
end activity.

profit 
 
gross margin improved due to a 
higher share from service during 
the quarter but earnings were im-
pacted by the sharp decline in rev-
enue. the ebita margin de-
creased to 5.5% from 8.1% in q4 
last year, entirely related to ce-
ment, whereas mining ebita mar-
gin was up slightly year on year. 
group ebita increased by 33% 
compared to q3 2020. 
 
 
gross profit and margin
gross profit declined 23% to dkk 1,022m (q4 
2019: dkk 1,327m), explained entirely by the 30% 
decline in revenue. gross margin improved to 
24.1% (q4 2019: 22.0%) due to a higher share 
from service in both mining and cement. 
 
in q4 2020, total research and development 
costs (r&d) amounted to dkk 115m (q4 2019: 
dkk 93m), representing 2.7% of revenue (q4 
2019: 1.6%), of which dkk 67m was capitalised 
(q4 2019: dkk 59m) and the balance of dkk 
48m expensed as production costs (q4 2019: 
dkk 34m). r&d costs in q4 related to several 
projects, including new sustainable cement tech-
nologies and mining equipment within various 
parts of the value chain. in addition, project-fi-
nanced developments are taking place in coop-
eration with customers. 
 
sg&a costs 
sales, general and administrative costs (sg&a) 
and other operating items decreased 8% to dkk 
685m (q4 2019: dkk 747m), explained by busi-
ness improvement savings and foreign ex-
change. despite the reduction in sg&a, costs in-
creased to 16.2% of revenue (q4 2019: 12.4%), 
due to the sharp decline in revenue.  
 
we manage and adjust the cost base against the 
level of business we see ahead of us, and our 
practice is not to make significant cost reductions 
in areas where we expect activity to return in the 
very short term. since there is no recovery in 
sight for the cement market, we continue to right-
size our cement business (please refer to page 
37). 
 
ebita and margin 
ebita decreased by 52% to dkk 235m com-
pared to the same quarter last year (q4 2019: 
dkk 487m), but increased by 33% compared to 
q3 2020. the year-on-year decrease was a re-
sult of the sharp decline in revenue which could 
not be offset by the higher gross margin and 
lower sg&a costs. the year-on-year decrease in 
q4 ebita margin to 5.5% (q4 2019: 8.1%), was 
due entirely to cement and included dkk 19m 
costs related to cement reshaping. there was a 
slight increase in mining ebita margin year-on-
year. 
 
amortisation of intangible assets amounted to 
dkk 90m (q4 2019: dkk 94m). the effect of pur-
chase price allocations amounted to dkk 24m 
(q4 2019: dkk 36m) and other amortisation to 
dkk 66m (q4 2019: dkk 58m).  
 
earnings before interest and tax (ebit) de-
creased 63% to dkk 145m (q4 2019: 393m). 
 
financial items 
net financial items amounted to dkk 6m (q4 
2019: dkk -71m), of which foreign exchange and 
fair value adjustments amounted to dkk 18m (q4 
2019: dkk -43m) and net interest amounted to 
dkk -12m (q4 2019: dkk -28m). 
 
tax 
tax for q4 2020 totalled dkk -65m (q4 2019: 
dkk -94m), corresponding to an effective tax rate 
of 43.6% (q4 2019: 29%). impairment of deferred 
tax assets has caused the increase in the effec-
tive tax rate in q4. 
 
profit for the period 
because of the lower ebit, profit for the period 
decreased to dkk 78m (q4 2019: dkk 227m), 
equivalent to dkk 1.7 per share (diluted) (q4 
2019: dkk 4.5). discontinued activities had a dkk 
-6m impact on profit and loss in q4 2020 (q4 
2019: dkk -2m). 
 
employees 
the number of employees decreased by 307 to 
10,639 at the end of 2020 (end of q3 2020: 
10,946). the decrease mainly related to right-siz-
ing activities in cement and divestment of the 
möller business (60 people).

management review           financial performance  
  
capital 
 
net working capital decreased for 
the third consecutive quarter. free 
cash flow was dkk 232m, on par 
with q4 last year. net debt to 
ebitda increased to 1.6 due to 
lower 12 months’ trailing ebitda. 
q4 included the acquisition of 
knowledgescape and two an-
nounced divestments in cement. 
 
net working capital 
net working capital decreased for the third con-
secutive quarter and amounted to dkk 1,752m at 
the end of q4 2020 (end of q3 2020: dkk 
1,981m). the reduction related mainly to invento-
ries and a dkk 71m reduction from divestments. 
the net working capital ratio was 10.7% of reve-
nue (q3 2020: 10.9% of revenue). 
 
in line with previous quarters, utilisation of supply 
chain financing decreased in q4, driven by a 
lower activity level and a lower share of cement 
business relative to mining (see note 3.6). 
 
cash flow from operations 
despite a reduction in adjusted ebitda of more 
than 40%, cash flow from operating activities 
(cffo) was on par with q4 last year and 
amounted to dkk 329m (q4 2019: dkk 327m). in 
addition to ebitda, the main positive contributor 
to cffo was the net working capital inflow of 
dkk 161m as compared to a net working capital 
outflow of dkk 138m in q4 2019.  
 
discontinued activities amounted to dkk -32m in 
q4 2020 (q4 2019: dkk -42m) due to timing dif-
ference between cash paid and cash received  
related to the net working capital and provision 
balances (see note 2.11). 
 
cash effect from provisions was dkk 66m inflow 
in q4 2020 (q4 2019: dkk 55m inflow). the 
change related to recognition of additional un-
certainties in the execution of the project portfo-
lio and provisions for reshaping cement. the im-
pact on provisions from discontinued activities 
was negative dkk 5m in q4. 
 
cash flow from investments 
cash flow from investing activities amounted to 
dkk -97m (q4 2019: dkk -92m), of which acquisi-
tions and disposals amounted to dkk 12m (q4 
2019: dkk 18m). 
 
free cash flow 
free cash flow (cash flow from operating and in-
vesting activities) amounted to dkk 232m in q4 
(q4 2019: dkk 235m). 
 
net interest-bearing debt 
due to a positive free cash flow, net interest-
bearing debt (nibd) decreased to dkk 1,808m 
(end of q3 2020: dkk 1,936m). financial gearing, 
however, increased to 1.6 (end of q3 2020: 1.4) 
due to lower trailing 12 months ebitda. gearing 
remains below our internal long term maximum 
threshold of two times nibd to ebitda. 
 
financial position 
by the end of 2020, flsmidth had dkk 7.0bn of 
available committed credit facilities of which dkk 
4.8bn was undrawn. the committed credit facili-
ties have a weighted average time to maturity of 
4.2 years.  
dkk 1.7bn of credit facilities will mature in 2022 
and the majority, dkk 5.0bn, will mature in 2026. 
the remaining dkk 0.3bn matures in later years. 
 
equity ratio 
equity at the end of q4 2020 decreased slightly 
to dkk 8,130m (end of q3 2020: dkk 8,237m), 
due to currency adjustments regarding transla-
tion of entities that more than offset the profit for 
q4 2020. the equity ratio was 39.7% (end of q3 
2020: 40.0%), well above the long-term target of 
minimum 30%. 
 
acquisitions and divestments 
on 2 october 2020, flsmidth signed the acqui-
sition of knowledgescape, a global leader in dig-
ital optimisation solutions for the mineral pro-
cessing industry. 
 
on 23 december 2020, flsmidth announced 
the sale of its fabric filter technology, a non-core 
business of flsmidth’s advanced filter technol-
ogy (aft).  
 
on 30 december 2020, flsmidth announced 
the sale of its möller pneumatic conveying sys-
tems business, which has been serving mainly 
adjacent industries. both divestments were part 
of the ongoing process to simplify and prune 
flsmidth’s cement business. 
 
on 15 january 2021, flsmidth announced that it 
is in negotiations with thyssenkrupp concerning 
an acquisition of thyssenkrupp's mining busi-
ness. the negotiations are at a non-binding 
stage. accordingly, there can be no assurances 
as to whether and when a transaction will tran-
spire.

growth 
 
organic order intake was on par 
with last year, comprising growth in 
mining and a decrease in cement. 
book-to-bill was 113%. revenue de-
clined 16% organically due to a se-
vere impact from the pandemic 
and a low cement backlog enter-
ing the year. 
 
order intake 
organically, the order intake in 2020 was on par 
with last year, comprising a 13% growth in mining 
and a 22% decline in cement. including currency 
effects and acquisitions, order intake decreased 
by 5% to dkk 18,524m (2019: dkk 19,554m). 
capital order intake increased by 5%, whereas 
service orders decreased by 13%. service ac-
counted for 53% of the order intake.  
 
mining order intake increased by 13% organically 
and by 6% including currency effects and acqui-
sitions. mining capital orders increased by 31% 
due to the booking of three large mining con-
tracts in the first quarter of the year. the three or-
ders had a combined value of around dkk 2.4bn 
and were awarded in russia and belarus, a re-
gion where we have successfully expanded our 
presence in recent years. following a double 
digit growth in the first quarter of the year, mining 
service orders decreased 9% for the full year, ex-
plained by currency headwind and restricted ac-
cess to customers sites due to the pandemic. 
 
cement order intake declined 22% organically 
and by 24% including currency effects. service 
accounted for 51% of cement order intake. capi-
tal orders contracted by 26%. the cement indus-
try has seen a prolonged period of subdued pro-
ject activity and along with the severe impact 
from the pandemic, there are no signs of a recov-
ery for new cement capacity in the short- to me-
dium-term. cement service orders declined 21% 
as the pandemic led to the shutdown of up to 
20% of the world’s cement plants (excl. china) 
earlier in the year. many cement plants continue 
to operate at reduced production rates, which re-
duces the need for technical services and parts.

order backlog 
in 2020, the order backlog increased by 5% to 
dkk 14,874m (2019: dkk 14,192m), comprising an 
18% increase in mining and an 11% contraction in 
cement. the book-to-bill was 113% but currency 
effects had a dkk 1bn negative impact on the 
backlog. 
 
revenue 
organic revenue declined 16% in 2020, compris-
ing a 7% decrease in mining and a 30% fall in 
cement. including currency effects, revenue de-
creased by 20% to dkk 16,441m (2019: dkk 
20,646m). service revenue accounted for 60% of 
total revenue (2019: 52%). 
 
the sharp decline in cement revenue related 
mainly to the capital business and was due to a 
low backlog entering the year and the severe im-
pact of the pandemic on the cement industry. 
the decline in mining revenue related to both 
the capital and service businesses. despite 
healthy industry fundamentals, project and ser-
vice activity were both impacted by restricted ac-
cess to mine sites due to pandemic related pre-
cautions.

profit 
 
earnings were impacted by the 
pandemic and the sharp decline in 
revenue. the ebita margin de-
creased to 4.7% from 8.1% last 
year. cement was loss-making, 
whereas profitability in mining was 
quite resilient. the group business 
improvement programme was 
completed and additional activities 
to improve profitability in cement 
are ongoing. 
 
business improvement programme  
at the end of 2019, we announced business im-
provement initiatives that include site consolida-
tion, an improved logistical setup, and headcount 
reductions. in april 2020, we extended these ac-
tivities to accommodate a more challenging mar-
ket environment due to the pandemic. 
 
the group business improvement programme 
was completed at the end of q3 2020 with an 
annual ebita improvement run-rate of dkk 
150m. the realised ebita improvement in 2020 
was dkk 110m and an incremental improvement 
of around dkk 40m is expected to be realised in 
2021. the implementation costs amounted to 
dkk 192m, of which dkk 40m were incurred in 
2019 and dkk 152m were incurred in 2020. 
 
the programme included improvements that are 
expected to be sustained. it did not include any 
temporary covid-19 related savings, such as 
employees on furlough and reduced travel ex-
penses.

cement reshaping 
in addition to the group business improvement 
programme, we took additional steps during the 
year to simplify our cement business and adjust 
its cost structure. these activities included re-
duced in-house manufacturing and increased 
sourcing from local suppliers and reducing the 
size of the project organisation. as part of this 
ongoing process to simplify our cement busi-
ness, two businesses were sold in december 
2020 (see page 33).  
 
the implementation cost related to the additional 
activities in cement amounted to dkk 40m in 
2020 (previously estimated around dkk 70m).  
 
the activities will mitigate underabsorption due 
to the lower level of cement business which we 
see ahead, and consequently, we will not report 
an ebita improvement from these measures. 
further activities to right-size and simplify our ce-
ment business are expected during 2021. timing 
and costs related to this is under evaluation. 
 
taking both the completed group business im-
provement programme and the additional 
measures in cement into account, total imple-
mentation costs in 2020 were dkk 192m (previ-
ously estimated around dkk 220m). in total, the 
group workforce was reduced by 1,707 employ-
ees in 2020, of which the majority related to ce-
ment. 
 
the workforce adjustment has not impaired our 
ability to capture future growth. 
 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit decreased 20% in 2020 to dkk 
3,865m (2019: dkk 4,849m), in line with the 20% 
decline in revenue. gross margin remained at 
23.5% (2019: 23.5%). the positive impact on 
gross margin from a higher service share of 60% 
(2019: 52%) was offset by business improvement 
costs, low capacity utilisation and the higher 
costs of doing business during the pandemic. 
mobility restrictions continue to affect the utilisa-
tion of our global service technicians, resulting in 
more complex and costly logistics and increased 
costs related to quality control. 
 
in 2020, research and development costs were 
dkk 310m (2019: dkk 302m), of which dkk 150m 
were capitalised (2019: dkk 142m) and the bal-
ance of dkk 160m reported as production costs. 
the r&d costs related to several innovations, in-
cluding new sustainable cement technologies, 
tailings management, digital solutions, and vari-
ous equipment across the mining value chain. 
 
sg&a costs 
sales, general and administrative costs and other 
operating items declined by 4% in 2020, repre-
senting a cost percentage (sg&a ratio) of 16.6% 
of revenue (2019: 13.8%). sg&a was negatively 
impacted by business improvement implementa-
tion costs of dkk 89m and additional cost relat-
ing to reshaping in cement.

ebita and margin 
despite the stable gross margin and lower sg&a 
costs, ebita decreased by 54% to dkk 771m in 
2020 (2019: dkk 1,663m), as a result of the sharp 
decline in revenue. the ebita margin declined 
to 4.7% (2019: 8.1%). cement was loss-making, 
whereas profitability in mining was quite resilient. 
 
ebita included implementation costs related to 
the group business improvement programme of 
dkk 152m and costs related to additional ce-
ment reshaping of dkk 40m. 
 
financial items 
net financial items amounted to dkk -47m (2019: 
dkk -118m), of which net interest cost including 
interest from leasing amounted to dkk -59m 
(2019: dkk -65m) and foreign exchange and fair 
value adjustments accounted for the remaining 
balance. 
 
tax 
tax for the year amounted to dkk -155m (2019: 
dkk -373m), corresponding to an effective tax 
rate of 40.7% (2019: 31.9%). the higher effective 
tax-rate was due to impairment of deferred tax 
assets, in particular related to the weaker outlook 
for the cement market. 
 
profit for the year 
profit for the year decreased to dkk 205m (2019: 
776m) as a result of the lower earnings and 
higher effective tax rate. 
 
profit from continuing activities decreased to 
dkk 226m (2019: dkk 798m). 
 
loss from discontinued activities amounted to 
dkk -21m (2019: dkk -22m), related to adminis-
tering legacy projects in our non-mining bulk ma-
terial handling business. the projects were from 
a revenue perspective completed at year end 
2018. subsequent handling of claims and collec-
tion of receivables is ongoing (refer to note 2.11). 
 
return on capital employed 
roce decreased to 5.1% (2019: 10.9%) as a result 
of the lower ebita for the year. average capital 
employed was slightly below last year’s level.

management review           financial performance  
  
capital 
 
a strong cash focus led to a signifi-
cant reduction in net working capi-
tal and net debt.  
financial gearing increased to 1.6 
from 1.2 in 2019 due to lower 
ebitda for the year. free cash 
flow more than doubled to dkk 
1bn. 
 
balance sheet 
total assets decreased to dkk 20,456m at the 
end of 2020 (2019: dkk 23,532m), mainly due to 
currency effects and a reduction in activity and 
net working capital. 
 
assets and liabilities held for sale at the end of 
2020 amounted to dkk 33m. 
 
capital employed 
average capital employed decreased slightly to 
dkk 15,195m (2019: dkk 15,251m) as a result of 
the decrease in working capital. 
 
at the end of 2020, capital employed amounted 
to dkk 14,520m, consisting primarily of intangible 
assets of dkk 10,447m, which is mostly historical 
goodwill as well as patents and rights and cus-
tomer relations. property, plant and equipment 
amounted to dkk 2,009m, lease assets were 
dkk 312m and net working capital was dkk 
1,752m at the end of 2020. 
 
net working capital 
net working capital decreased to dkk 1,752m at 
the end of 2020 (2019: dkk 2,739m), represent-
ing 10.7% of revenue (2019: 13.3% of revenue). 
the decrease related mainly to a lower activity 
level and strong cash collection from accounts 
receivables, which declined by dkk 1.6bn. the 
strong underlying improvement was partly coun-
terbalanced by a dkk 0.5bn reduction in prepay-
ments from customers due to the low level of 
large capital orders, as well as reduced utilisation 
of supply chain finance. dkk 158m of the de-
crease in net working capital related to currency. 
 
supply chain financing  
as communicated in previous quarters, utilisation 
of supply chain financing has decreased during 
2020, driven by a lower level of activity and, in 
particular, by a lower share of cement business 
relative to mining. consequently, the trade paya-
bles covered by the supply chain financing pro-
gramme amounted to dkk 273m at the end of 
2020 (2019: dkk 1,083m). 
 
net interest-bearing debt 
net interest-bearing debt decreased to dkk 
1,808m at the end of 2020 (2019: dkk 2,492m) 
as a consequence of a strong positive free cash 
flow. 
 
despite the reduction in net debt, the financial 
gearing (nibd/ ebitda) increased to 1.6 (2019: 
1.2), due to lower ebitda for the year. the gear-
ing remains below our internal long-term maxi-
mum target of two times nibd to ebitda. 
 
equity 
despite the positive profit for the year, equity at 
the end of 2020 decreased to dkk 8,130m 
(2019: dkk 8,793m) as a result of currency ad-
justments regarding translation of foreign enti-
ties. the equity ratio was 39.7% (2019: 37.4%), 
well above the long-term target of minimum 30%. 
 
treasury shares 
the holding of treasury shares was 1,097,718 
shares at the end of 2020 (2019: 1,193,538 
shares), representing 2.1% of the total share capi-
tal (2019: 2.3%). treasury shares are used to 
hedge our share-based incentive programmes. 
 
dividend 
given the global uncertainty caused by the 
covid-19 pandemic, the board of directors of 
flsmidth & co. a/s decided to withdraw the pro-
posal to pay a dividend of dkk 8 per share in 
2020 to ensure resilience in a period of market 
uncertainty and to further strengthen flsmidth’s 
financial position. 
 
based on the financial results for 2020, the 
current financial situation and ongoing negotia-
tions regarding potential acquisitions, the board 
of directors will propose at the upcoming annual 
general meeting that a dividend of dkk 2 per 
share corresponding to a dividend yield of 0.9% 
and a pay-out ratio of 50%, in line with our tar-
geted pay-out ratio, will be distributed for 2020. 
the total dividend proposed amounts to dkk 
103m.

-661m). cffi in 2019 was impacted by the acqui-
sition of imp automation group, whereas cffi in 
2020 included the acquisition of knowledge-
scape as well as divestments in the cement 
business. excluding acquisitions and disposals, 
cffi was dkk -339m in 2020 (2019: dkk -374m). 
 
free cash flow 
free cash flow increased to dkk 1,045m (2019: 
dkk 287m) as a result of the higher cash flow 
from operating activities and the lower level of in-
vestments. free cash flow adjusted for business 
acquisitions and disposals was dkk 1,082m com-
pared to dkk 574m in 2019.  
 
cash flow from financing activities 
cash flow from financing activities was dkk  
-956m (2019: dkk -156m), primarily related to re-
payment of debt and to a lesser extent due to re-
payment of lease liabilities. 
 
cash position 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to dkk 
976m, a small decrease from dkk 1,001m in 
2019. 
 
restricted cash 
cash and cash equivalents included cash with 
currency restrictions amounting to dkk 781m 
(2019: dkk 824m). the reduction in restricted 
cash compared to 2019 related mainly to brazil. 
the cash and cash equivalents with currency re-
strictions were primarily related to bank deposits 
located in countries with currency restrictions. 
the deposits are part of local daily cash manage-
ment in countries where we have operating activ-
ities. 
 
 
 
acquisitions 
on 31 january 2020, flsmidth acquired the 
business mill-ore group, an eastern canadian 
provider of equipment and services to the mining 
industry. the acquisition was part of our long-
term commitment to increase the level of local 
service and support for our customers. 
 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, flsmidth acquired 
an additional company, knowledgescape, and 
announced the sale of two cement businesses 
(please refer to page 33). 
 
on 15 january 2021, flsmidth announced that it 
is in negotiations with thyssenkrupp concerning 
an acquisition of thyssenkrupp's mining busi-
ness. the negotiations are at a non-binding 
stage. accordingly, there can be no assurances 
as to whether and when a transaction will tran-
spire. 2020 included costs related to the ongo-
ing due diligence process, and additional costs 
are expected in 2021.

financial performance  
in q4 2020 
organic mining order intake increased 2% com-
pared to q4 2019. including effects from cur-
rency and acquisitions the order intake in q4 
2020 decreased by 8% to dkk 2,608m (q4 
2019: dkk 2,833m), comprising 5% growth in 
capital orders and a 15% decrease in service or-
ders. travel restrictions and limited site access 
have continued to impact on-site technical ser-
vices, resulting in reduced service demand. the 
5% increase in capital order intake is a result of a 
number of medium-sized capital orders that are 
proceeding based on the healthy industry funda-
mentals. during the quarter, currency had an 11% 
negative impact on order intake and acquisitions 
had a 1% positive impact on order intake. 
revenue decreased 15% organically and by 22% 
including the effects of currency and acquisitions, 
to dkk 2,749m in q4 2019 (q4 2019: dkk 
3,537m). capital revenue decreased by 37% as a 
result of the lumpiness of the capital business 
with fluctuating revenue recognition, and due to 
restricted site access which impacts progress on 
projects. service revenue decreased by 10%, ex-
plained by restricted access to mine sites and 
currency effects. currency effects had a 7% neg-
ative impact on revenue in the quarter. 
 
gross profit, before allocation of shared cost de-
creased by 17% to dkk 689m (q4 2019: dkk 
829m), largely in line with the decline in revenue.  
the corresponding gross margin increased to 
25.1% (q4 2019: 23.4%) due to a higher service 
share as well as a positive effect from the busi-
ness improvement programme. 
 
ebita decreased by 21% to dkk 256m (q4 2019: 
dkk 323m) due to the lower revenue in the quar-
ter, while the ebita margin increased to 9.3% 
(q4 2019: 9.1%). 
 
financial performance in 2020 
in 2020, mining order intake increased 13% or-
ganically, mainly due to the exceptionally strong 
capital order intake in the first quarter of 2020 
which was related to the three large orders re-
ceived in russia and belarus, with a combined 
value of around dkk 2.4bn. during the year, cur-
rency had an 8% negative impact on order intake 
and acquisitions had a 1% positive impact on or-
der intake. accordingly, order intake increased 
by 6% to dkk 12,811m (2019: dkk 12,064m) 
 
the organic decrease in revenue was 7% in 
2020. revenue decreased by 13% to dkk 
10,620m (2019: dkk 12,169m), mainly due to capi-
tal revenue which decreased by 18%. ebita de-
creased by 24% to dkk 888m (2019: dkk 
1,166m), and the corresponding ebita margin de-
creased to 8.4% (2019: 9.6%). ebita included im-
plementation costs of dkk 91m related to the 
group business improvement programme.

management review           financial performance  
  
financial performance  
in q4 2020 
the order intake in q4 2020 increased by 34% 
to dkk 2,087m (q4 2019: dkk 1,556m), driven by 
the large ethiopian order, valued at around dkk 
750 million, that became effective in the quarter. 
service order intake decreased by 28% to dkk 
780m compared to the same quarter last year 
(q4 2019: dkk 1,083m), but increased by 13% 
compared to the previous quarter (q3 2020: 
dkk 688m). service order intake is still impacted 
by restricted site access and reduced demand 
for spare parts as a result of plant shutdowns and 
cement plants operating at reduced capacity. 
currency effects had a 5% negative impact on 
the order intake compared to the same quarter 
last year. accordingly, the organic increase in the 
order intake was 39%. 
 
revenue decreased by 40% to dkk 1,487m in q4 
2020 (q4 2019: dkk 2,485m), due to the contin-
ued impact of the pandemic and a low backlog 
entering the year. service revenue decreased by 
13% while capital revenue declined by 57%. cur-
rency effects had a 3% negative impact on reve-
nue, which meant the organic decrease in reve-
nue was 37%. 
 
gross profit, before allocation of shared cost, de-
creased by 36% to dkk 347m (q4 2019: dkk 
543m), largely in line with the decline in revenue, 
but increased by 46% compared to the previous 
quarter (q3 2020: dkk 238m). the correspond-
ing gross margin increased to 23.3% (q4 2019: 
21.9%) due to a higher share from service. ce-
ment profitability is, however, still affected by the 
large decline in revenue, and increased costs re-
lated to the pandemic and ongoing reshaping. 
consequently, ebita amounted to dkk -28m 
(q4 2019: dkk 163m) and the corresponding 
ebita margin was -1.9% (q4 2019: 6.6%). 
 
financial performance in 2020 
the order intake decreased 24% to dkk 5,713m 
in 2020 (2019: dkk 7,490m), due to a continua-
tion in the subdued market conditions for new 
cement capacity and customers postponing in-
vestments, but also due to lower service activity 
as a result of the pandemic. currency had a 2% 
negative impact on order intake. 
 
revenue in 2020 decreased by 31% to dkk 
5,821m (2019: dkk 8,477m), mainly due to the 
lower capital revenue during the year. currency 
effects had a 1% negative impact on revenue. 
 
earnings were severely impacted by the pan-
demic and the sharp decline in revenue as well 
as costs of dkk 61m related to the group busi-
ness improvement programme and additional 
costs of dkk 40m specifically related to reshap-
ing the cement business. ebita came in at dkk -
118m (2019: dkk 486m). the corresponding 
ebita margin was -2.0% (2019: 5.7%). activities 
to restore profitability in cement have been in-
tensified during 2020 and are ongoing.

risk is an inherent part of our busi-
ness and managing risks is a top prior-
ity at flsmidth. our approach to risk 
is aligned with our strategy and finan-
cial targets and managing potential 
impacts has high priority across the 
organisation. 
risk management framework 
our risk management framework consists of a 
simple enterprise risk management practice with 
annual top-down and bottom-up risk mapping to 
identify the group's key risks across the organi-
sation. we assess the risks based on the poten-
tial impact on our reputation, values, integrity, 
and our short- and long-term strategic goals. 
 
our enterprise risk management practice aims 
to identify, monitor, assess and mitigate risks as 
early as possible to manage the likelihood and 
potential impact. the most significant risks are 
reviewed by the risk committee, group execu-
tive management and the board of directors. 
the industries and regions own their respective 
risk management process and are responsible 
for the identification and mitigation of the key 
risks that pose potential threats to their opera-
tions. 
 
risk assessment 
the annual assessment was primarily dominated 
by discussion surrounding the covid-19 pan-
demic. however, as operations continued in var-
ying degrees for the industries and each region, 
this year’s workshops resulted in the identifica-
tion of the following key risks and/or opportuni-
ties: 
 
■ safety – mitigate severe impact on health and 
safety of our employees, further complicated 
by the pandemic. 
■ compliance – importance of compliance with a 
wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws 
and regulations. 
■ workplace engagement – ability to keep the 
workforce engaged to adapt to constant 
change. 
■ cement market conditions – lack of global 
growth and decreasing general consumption. 
■ sustainability – leverage the opportunity for 
development and adoption of sustainable solu-
tions. for more information, please refer to our 
sustainability report. 
■ projects – ability to deliver on time and as 
promised to our customers. 
■ digitalisation – create value and optimise pro-
cesses that drive productivity. 
■ geopolitical – tensions between key nations 
and volatile risk environments could lead to in-
creased costs or disruptions in operations. 
■ cyber threats – as technology advances, com-
puter crime is becoming increasingly sophisti-
cated. 
■ supply chain – pandemic lockdown and result-
ing decline in on-site activities has increased 
concerns regarding supply chain reliability 
when demand to deliver increases. 
■ financial risk – liquidity, credit and fluctuation 
in foreign exchange rates. for more infor-
mation on the financial risks and mitigation ac-
tivities, please refer to note 5.3.

 digitalisation 
 
 
digital transformation is necessary to ensure customer expec-
tations for innovative and value added services are met. keep-
ing up with the speed of change presents both challenges in 
maintaining cutting edge solutions as well as opportunities for 
optimising growth through innovative digital offerings and ser-
vices. 
 
 
the group has invested heavily in mitigation efforts, leading to a positive impact on the company's internal 
productivity as well as with customers. the company has continued to improve sustainable productivity 
through the launch of digitally-enabled products and digital offerings aimed at increasing productivity at cus-
tomer sites, the appointment of regional product line managers and the implementation of ai in parts of pro-
curement, finance and other group functions. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 sustainability 
 
 
the success of our business depends on our ability to develop 
sustainable products and solutions. failure to take advantage 
of the opportunity to help drive this change in the cement and 
mining industries will have a detrimental effect on our organisa-
tion. 
 
 
sustainability is an integrated part of flsmidth’s vision and strategy, and we see the need for sustainable so-
lutions in the cement and mining industries as a significant business opportunity for flsmidth. for more infor-
mation on our missionzero sustainability programme and product innovation, please refer to pages 18-20 and 
26-29 in this report and our sustainability report at www.flsmidth.com/sustainabilityreport2020.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 geopolitical risks  
 
increasing instability and polarisation in many countries as well 
as tensions between major world economies pose a threat to 
the company's ability to carry out projects in some jurisdictions, 
increasing risk of delays and disruptions. 
 
 
the company's local footprint continues to expand with strategic investments placing flsmidth closer to cus-
tomers around the world. group procurement optimisation continues to focus on strategic, global sourcing 
and building relationships with multiple suppliers to protect supply chain and logistics operations. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 safety 
 
 
the risk of serious injury or death due to failure to ensure 
healthy and safe working conditions for employees and con-
tractors at a customer site is a serious issue that could result in 
a loss of trust with customers and long-term impact on the well-
being of our employees. the domino effect that such an event 
would have on the organisation's reputation as a premium sup-
plier and trustworthy employer would be catastrophic. this risk 
has been further complicated by the current pandemic which 
has created significant turbulence for our employees all over 
the world. 
 
 
the group has zero tolerance for safety risks, whether at third party sites or in its own. safety is a high priority 
for everyone. our focus remains on improving ltifr/trifr, and the last seven years in a row, we have im-
proved our safety performance. safety audits are conducted by top management, all employees are required 
to participate in safety training annually, safety shares and recording of near-misses are mandatory and the 
president's safety award is granted annually to those demonstrating great safety practices. a covid-19 se-
curity team meets regularly to review the latest developments and each region is following the guidance as 
defined by the local health and government authorities. internal communication has top priority as we contin-
ual evaluate and navigate around the pandemic as it evolves. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 projects 
 
 
the company continuously execute a multitude of projects 
across the world, and in some cases face challenges in the ex-
ecution. 
 
 
with ownership anchored in the industries, project management is now managed from hubs where expertise 
and experience has been consolidated to make the most of our capabilities.

lack of global growth, decreasing consumption and overca-

change our cement business. 
 
 
during 2020, we have executed our group business improvement initiatives that include site consolidation, 
an improved logistical setup, and headcount reductions. in addition to the group business improvement pro-
gramme, we took additional steps during the year to simplify our cement business and adjust its cost struc-
ture. these activities included reduced in-house manufacturing and increased sourcing from local suppliers 
and reducing the size of the project organisation. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 cyber threats 
 
 
the constantly evolving threat of cyber security, data leakage 
and data security is a key area of focus.  a sophisticated cyber-
attack could result in an extended period of down-time result-
ing in delays to customers and additional costs for the organi-
sation. 
 
 
the group is focused on it security and awareness; conducting regular audits, analysis of current controls 
and security updates.  migration to cloud-based solutions, cyber awareness training across the organisation 
and an it security committee all help to mitigate the potential impact of this risk. we are also taking steps to 
increase cybersecurity of the delivered equipment. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 supply chain 
 
 
high demands on internal and external trusted supply chains 
could result in delays in deliveries to customers which could 
lead to penalties and disruptions in executing projects – this 
threat has been further complicated by the impact of the pan-
demic. 
 
 
group procurement is on a strong path towards increased operational efficiencies through new tools and 
more uniform processes. the group's global sourcing strategy allows for more flexibility and agility in working 
with external supply chains to help alleviate potential disruptions. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 compliance 
 
 
compliance is a top-priority in flsmidth with zero tolerance for 
violation that could impact the flsmidth brand and reputation 
with customers. as the company continues to expand through 
acquisitions and the establishment of local offices in challeng-
ing environments, the focus on mitigating compliance risks re-
mains high. 
 
 
the group has a dedicated compliance department that has established rules and procedures to ensure a 
common understanding of ethical behaviour. there are policies in place to support the organisation with 
day-to-day compliance issues such as the code of business conduct and anti-bribery policy, as well as tools 
and procedures to identify individual issues that may pose a threat including the whistleblower hotline, 
screening of third party agents and sign-off protocols. new online training was added to the current cata-
logue of compliance training this year and is compulsory for all employees. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 workplace 
engagement 
 
 
the demands of a fast-changing world put pressure on our 
workforce to stay agile and adapt to new challenges faster than 
ever. the collective ability to keep our employees motivated 
and engaged has been further complicated by the global pan-
demic which has forced many of our employees to work re-
motely and virtually. 
 
 
in response to the pandemic, the company has established flexible work arrangement guidelines and is in 
the process of conducting engagement surveys to ensure our employees have a platform to voice their con-
cerns and ideas. initiatives and processes are also in place to promote productivity at work.

management review           governance  
  
  
the following statutory statement (including the 
corporate governance section, the remunera-
tion section, as well as the overview of the board 
of directors and group executive management) 
is provided pursuant to the danish financial 
statements act sections 107a and 107b. 
 
in the board of directors’ opinion, flsmidth fully 
complies with all recommendations on corporate 
governance applicable to danish listed compa-
nies, except for one. 
 
 
 
 
capital and share structure  
flsmidth & co. a/s is listed on nasdaq copen-
hagen. at the end of 2020, flsmidth had ap-
proximately 46,000 registered shareholders and 
a free-float of around 90%. one shareholder had 
flagged a major shareholding in flsmidth & co. 
a/s at the end of 2020. lundbeckfond invest 
a/s' investment exceeded 10%. flsmidth's hold-
ing of treasury shares at the end of 2020 ac-
counted for 2.1% of the share capital. 
 
the board of directors is authorised until the 
next annual general meeting to let the company 
acquire treasury shares up to a total nominal 
value of 10% of the company’s share capital in 
accordance with section 12 of the danish com-
panies act. 
 
the adoption of a resolution to amend the com-
pany’s articles of association or to wind up the 
company requires that the resolution is passed 
by not less than two thirds of the votes cast as 
well as of the share capital represented at the 
general meeting. 
management structure  
according to general practice in denmark,  
flsmidth maintains a clear division of responsi-
bility and separation between the board of direc-
tors and the group executive management. the 
group executive management is responsible for 
the day-to-day business of the company, and the 
board of directors oversees the group executive 
management and handles overall managerial is-
sues of a strategic nature. for additional infor-
mation please refer to: 
 
https://www.flsmidth.com/en-gb/company/inves-
tors/governance. 
the board of directors  
composition of the board of directors  
the board of directors is elected at the annual 
general meeting apart from those board mem-
bers who are elected pursuant to the provisions 
of the danish companies act on employee rep-
resentation.  
 
board members elected at the annual general 
meeting constitute not less than five and not 
more than eight members, currently six mem-
bers, in order to maintain a small, competent and 
quorate board. the members of the board 
elected at the annual general meeting retire at 
each annual general meeting. re-election may 
take place. the nomination committee identifies 
and recommends candidates to the board of di-
rectors. 
 
pursuant to the provisions of the danish compa-
nies act regarding employee representation, 
flsmidth’s employees are currently represented 
on the board by three members who are elected 
for terms of four years. the next election will take 
place in the near future. 
 
immediately after the annual general meeting, 
the board of directors elects, among its own 
members, a chairman and a vice chairman. a job 
and task description has been created and out-
lines the duties and responsibilities of the chair-
man and the vice chairman.

management review           governance  
  
board meetings are called and held in accord-
ance with the board rules of procedure and its 
annual plan. in general, between six and eight or-
dinary board meetings are held every year. how-
ever, when deemed necessary, additional meet-
ings may be held, and due to the covid-19 
situation the meeting frequency was higher in 
2020. 
 
to enhance board meeting efficiency, the chair-
man conducts a planning meeting with the ceo 
and cfo prior to each board meeting.  
 
seventeen board meetings were held in 2020. 
apart from contemporary business issues, the 
most important issues dealt with in 2020 were: 
the impact of covid-19 on our business, cash 
flow, capital structure, financial risks, sustainabil-
ity, reshaping of our cement business, diversity 
and acquisitions. all members of the board of di-
rectors participated, physically or virtually, in all 
relevant board and committee meetings in 2020, 
except one member who was unable to attend 
one of the 17 board meetings due to a conflicting 
appointment. 
 
to achieve a highly informed debate with the 
group executive management, the company 
strives for a board membership profile reflecting 
substantial managerial experience from interna-
tionally operating industrial companies.  
 
at least one member of the board must have 
cfo experience from a major listed company 
and all other members must preferably have 
ceo experience from a major internationally op-
erating and preferably listed company. to the ex-
tent possible, all members elected at the annual 
general meeting hold competencies in the acqui-
sition and sale of companies, financing and stock 
market issues, international contracts and ac-
counting. in addition, a majority of the board 
members should preferably possess technical 
expertise on process plants and process technol-
ogy, including from the minerals industries and/or 
the cement industry. 
all members of the board elected at the annual 
general meeting are independent as defined by 
the committee on corporate governance, which 
is an independent danish body promoting corpo-
rate governance best practice in danish listed 
companies.  
 
as part of its annual plan, the board of directors 
performs an annual self-evaluation to evaluate 
the contribution, engagement and competencies 
of its individual members. the chairman is re-
sponsible for the evaluation. 
 
the nomination committee  
the nomination committee consists of mr. vagn 
ove sørensen, mr. tom knutzen and mr. thra-
syvoulos moraitis. in 2020, the committee met 
three times. its main activities in 2020 were re-
lated to assessing the composition and compe-
tencies of the board of directors. 
 
the compensation committee  
the compensation committee consists of mr. 
vagn ove sørensen, mr. tom knutzen and mr. 
thrasyvoulos moraitis. the compensation com-
mittee met five times in 2020 and the commit-
tee’s main activities in 2020 were related to the 
approval of incentive plans and overall remuner-
ation schemes for group executive management 
and the management layer reporting to the 
group executive management.

management review           governance  
  
the audit committee  
the audit committee consists of mr. tom 
knutzen (chairman), ms. anne louise eberhard 
and ms. gillian dawn winckler who are all inde-
pendent and have considerable insight and  
experience in financial matters, accounting and 
auditing in listed companies.  
 
in 2020, the audit committee met seven times 
and the committee’s main activities were to con-
sider specific financial risk, including tax risk, ac-
counting and auditing matters, as well as paying 
special attention to financial processes, internal 
control environment and cyber security. a partic-
ular focus area in 2020 has been to assess the fi-
nancial risks associated with the covid-19 pan-
demic and the related impact on liquidity and 
cash flow. 
 
the technology committee  
the technology committee consists of three 
board members, mr. richard robinson smith 
(chairman), mr. thrasyvoulos moraitis and mr. 
søren dickow quistgaard. the technology com-
mittee met three times in 2020. the main tasks 
in 2020 were to monitor the major development 
projects across the two industries, to ensure the 
right and appropriate kpis are set for r&d across 
both industries and to approve the strategic fo-
cus areas for the coming years.  
 
group executive management  
composition of the management  
the officially registered executive management 
of flsmidth consists of the group ceo and the 
group cfo. in the first half year our head of 
group legal and strategy was registered as part 
of executive management on an interim basis. 
group executive management holds overall 
responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the 
group and consists of nine group executive vice 
presidents, including the ceo. the members of 
the group executive management are all 
experienced business executives, each 
possessing insights and hands-on experience 
that match the practical issues and challenges 
currently facing flsmidth.  
 
effective june 2020, mikko tepponen joined 
flsmidth as chief digital officer and a member 
of the group executive management. tepponen 
arrives with proven experience in driving trans-
formation journeys in other large industries, in-
cluding wärtsilä and outotec. he has a track rec-
ord of employing digital solutions as an enabler 
for more sustainable and resource-efficient prac-
tices. 
 
in july 2020, roland m. andersen joined fls-
midth as group cfo and a member of the group 
executive management. roland brings 25 years 
of solid experience and competences through 
his time as cfo with public as well as private eq-
uity owned companies, including torm, telenor, 
a.p. moller maersk and most recently nkt where 
he played a key role in leading the company 
through strategic transformation and acted as 
ceo for a period of time. 
 
in august 2020, chief procurement officer, as-
ger lauritsen, became part of flsmidth’s group 
executive management team. for the past four 
years, asger has been responsible for our global 
supply chain, which includes both our own facto-
ries and external suppliers. 
prior to joining flsmidth in 2016, asger had an 
accomplished international career within opera-
tions, procurement and supply chain in senior 
leadership roles at norden, maersk line, disa 
and rosti. 
 
due to family reasons jan kjaersgaard has de-
cided to leave flsmidth. jan joined flsmidth in 
march 2018 as president of the product com-
pany division. in july 2018, he was appointed as 
president of the cement industry, where he had 
an instrumental role in establishing the operating 
model for our cement business. 
 
effective november 2020, carsten riisberg lund 
has been appointed as the new cement industry 
president and member of group executive man-
agement. carsten has been with flsmidth for 33 
years in various roles, most recently as the presi-
dent for region europe, north africa and russia 
(enar). carsten has also headed flsmidth’s for-
mer material handling division and spent three 
years as managing director in india. 
 
effective january 2021, mikko keto joined fls-
midth as president, mining industry and member 
of group executive management. mikko joins 
flsmidth from metso, where he has  worked for 
10 years of which the last two years as president, 
minerals services and pumps, where he deliv-
ered growth in services along with profitability 
improvement. he also served as a member of 
the company’s executive team. 
the appointment follows manfred schaffer’s de-
cision to retire, having contributed strongly to 
flsmidth's mining business since 2014. to en-
sure a smooth transition, manfred has kindly of-
fered to stay with flsmidth as an advisor for a 
period of time.  
 
diversity in board and 
management  
the board of directors of flsmidth continually 
evaluates the diversity of the board and the 
group executive management as well as among 
managers and employees. in connection with 
recommendations and appointments, diversity is 
deliberately taken into account when considering 
the profiles and qualifications of potential candi-
dates. 
 
at the end of 2020, women accounted for 33% 
(end 2019: 33%) of the shareholder-elected 
board members, fulfilling the target that a mini-
mum of 25% of the members elected at the an-
nual general meeting should be women.  
 
at the end of 2020, women accounted for 16% 
(end 2019: 16%) of the total workforce, while 13% 
of all managers were women (end 2019: 11%). at 
the end of the year, we set a new long-term tar-
get for gender equality in our workforce. by 
2030, we want 30% of our entire white-collar 
workforce and 25% of our people managers to 
be women. when filling management vacancies 
externally, at least one female candidate must be 
in the short list. 
 
due to flsmidth’s global presence in over 60 
countries, the overall workforce naturally reflects 
a multitude of cultures and nationalities. the 
board of directors has set a long-term goal ac-
cording to which global managers (top 70) 
should to a greater extent reflect the representa-
tion of nationalities among all employees and the 
geographical location of flsmidth’s technology 
centres in denmark (9% of the total workforce), 
the usa (15% of the total workforce) and india 
(24% of the total workforce).

management review           governance  
  
today 56% (2019: 67%) of group executive man-
agement and 90% (end 2019: 91%) of the total 
number of employees have a nationality other 
than danish.  
 
flsmidth is a learning organisation, and our peo-
ple are our most valuable resource. 50% of the 
workforce is below the age of 40. 43% have less 
than 5 years seniority, which is a reflection of the 
transition flsmidth has gone through over the 
past several years. 
 
presentation of financial 
statements and internal controls  
to ensure the high quality of the group’s finan-
cial reporting, the board of directors and the 
group executive management have adopted a 
number of policies, procedures and guidelines 
for the presentation of the financial statements 
and internal controls which can be found on fl-
smidth’s website: https://www.flsmidth.com/en-
gb/company/investors/governance. 
  
compliance with 
recommendations for  
corporate governance 
pursuant to section 4.3 of the rules for issuers of 
shares listed on nasdaq copenhagen, danish 
companies must provide a statement on how 
they address the recommendations on corpo-
rate governance issued by the committee on 
corporate governance in november 2017 based 
on the ‘comply or explain’ principle (https://corpo-
rategovernance.dk/english).  
 
flsmidth’s position on each specific recommen-
dation is summarised in the corporate govern-
ance statement available at:  
https://www.flsmidth.com/en-gb/company/inves-
tors/governance/governance-reports. 
 
in the board’s opinion, flsmidth complies with 
all recommendations on corporate governance 
applicable to danish listed companies, except 
3.5.1 related to external assistance in connection 
with evaluation of the performance of the board 
of directors, where the company only complies 
partially. 
 
on 2 december 2020, the committee on corpo-
rate governance issued updated recommenda-
tions for corporate governance, which will enter 
into force for the financial year starting january 1, 
2021. flsmidth’s corporate governance state-
ment includes comments to some of the updated 
recommendations.

management review           governance  
  
 
the pandemic severely impacted 
our financial performance and 
target fulfilment in 2020. as a 
result, total management 
remuneration decreased 
significantly compared to 2019. 
 
 
base salary 
due to the challenging situation no annual ad-
justment to management’s base salary was made 
in 2020, which was voluntarily decided by the 
members of the group executive management. 
 
short-term incentive programme 
there will be no pay-out on any of the financial 
kpis (order intake, ebita margin and cffo)1) re-
lated to the 2020 short-term incentive plan (80% 
of stip)1). any pay-out on individual kpis (20% of 
stip)1) will be reduced by 50% due to a stip 
modifier. 
 
long-term incentive programme 
in 2020, management received pay-out for the 
2017-2019 long-term incentive plan (ltip) slightly 
above target level (75%). it is expected that pay-
out for two of the three active ltip programmes 
will be unachievable.  
 
the kpis planned for the 2021 ltip grant are: 
ebita-margin, total shareholder return and a sus-
tainability-linked kpi, which is a change to the 
years before. 
 
1) kpis and thresholds applicable for the group ceo and group cfo 
remuneration of executive 
management  
the board has adopted overall guidelines for in-
centive pay for the group executive manage-
ment establishing a framework for variable salary 
components in order to support the company’s 
short- and long-term goals. the purpose is to en-
sure that the remuneration structure does not 
lead to imprudence, short-term behaviour or un-
reasonable risk acceptance on the part of the 
group executive management. 
 
the board’s compensation committee considers 
on a regular basis the group executive manage-
ment’s remuneration.  
  
the total remuneration of the group executive 
management consists of the following compo-
nents:  
 
■ base salary  
■ short-term incentives in the form of a cash bo-
nus (up to 75% of annual base salary) 
■ long-term incentives in the form of perfor-
mance shares (up to 100% of base salary) 
■ other incentives up to 150% of the annual base 
salary in cash and/or in shares 
■ severance payment, if any, corresponding to 
the relevant member’s base salary for a maxi-
mum period of 24 months 
■ customary benefits such as company car, tele-
phone, etc.  
 
remuneration of the  
board of directors 
the board of directors’ total remuneration con-
sists of an annual cash payment for the current fi-
nancial year, which is submitted for approval at 
the annual general meeting. the board of direc-
tors’ fees are normally pre-approved by the gen-
eral meeting for the year in question and then fi-
nally approved by the shareholders at the 
following year's general meeting. in approving 
the final fees, shareholders may take unexpected 
workload into consideration and increase the 
preliminarily approved fees for all or some mem-
bers of the board of directors. the board of di-
rectors’ fees do not include incentive-based re-
muneration. 
 
cash payment currently consists of a base fee of  
dkk 450,000 to each board member, graded in 
line with additional tasks and responsibilities as 
follows: 
 
■ ordinary board members 100% of the base fee  
■ board vice chairman 200% of the base fee  
■ board chairman 300% of the base fee  
■ committee chairman fee dkk 225,000  
■ committee members fee dkk 125,000  
 
the chairman and vice chairman do not receive 
payment for committee work.  
 
the fee structure was last adjusted in 2017.

total shareholder return was 
negative 12% in 2020, impacted by 
the pandemic which has presented 
both challenges and opportunities 
for flsmidth. 
 
capital and share structure 
flsmidth & co. a/s is listed on nasdaq copen-
hagen. the share capital is dkk 1,025,000,000 
(end of 2019: dkk 1,025,000,000) and the total 
number of issued shares is 51,250,000 (end of 
2019: 51,250,000). each share entitles the holder 
to 20 votes. the flsmidth & co. a/s share is in-
cluded in roughly 150 danish, nordic, european 
and global share indices, including the leading 
danish stock index c25.  
 
the company had approximately 46,000 share-
holders at the end of 2020 (end of 2019: approxi-
mately 38,000). in addition, roughly 1,750 pre-
sent and former employees hold shares in the 
company (end of 2019: approximately 2,000). 
the flsmidth & co. a/s share has a free float of 
around 90%. lundbeckfond invest a/s' invest-
ment exceeded 10% in flsmidth & co. a/s at the 
end of 2020. as of end-2019, the investments of 
novo holding a/s and bestinver gestión s.a 
sgiic both exceeded 5%, but in 2020 both of 
these investors reduced their positions to below 
5%.  
 
2020 saw an increase in the share of danish pri-
vate investors to approximately 28% (2019: 21%). 
the share of danish institutional investors, in-
cluding lundbeckfond invest a/s, decreased to 
17% (2019: 23%). flsmidth’s holding of treasury 
shares declined to 2.1% (2019: 2.3%). 
 
return on the flsmidth share in 
2020 
the total return on the flsmidth & co. a/s share 
in 2020 was -12% (2019: -6%), calculated as share 
price appreciation and dividend paid. given the 
global uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pan-
demic, the board of directors of flsmidth & co. 
a/s decided on 23 march 2020 to withdraw the 
previous proposal to pay a dividend of dkk 8 per 
share to ensure resilience in a period of market 
uncertainty and to further strengthen flsmidth’s 
financial position.  
 
the share price ended 2020 at 232.8 compared 
to 265.4 at the end of 2019, having ranged be-
tween 134.3 and 274.8 during the year. total 
shareholder return will be one of the financial 
kpis for the planned 2021 long-term incentive 
plan.

management review           governance  
  
capital structure and dividend 
for 2020 
flsmidth takes a conservative approach to capi-
tal structure, with the emphasis on relatively low 
debt, gearing and financial risk. the board of di-
rectors’ priority for capital structure and capital al-
location is as follows: 
 
■ well-capitalised (nibd/ebitda < 2) 
■ stable dividends (30-50% of net profit) 
■ invest in organic growth 
■ value adding m&as 
■ share buyback or special dividend 
 
as announced on 15 january 2021, flsmidth is 
currently in negotiations concerning an acquisi-
tion of thyssenkrupp’s mining business. the ne-
gotiations are at a non-binding stage. accord-
ingly, there can be no assurances as to whether 
and when a transaction will transpire. 
 
the board of directors will propose at the annual 
general meeting that a dividend of dkk 2 per 
share (2019: no dividend), corresponding to a 
dividend yield of 0.9% and a pay-out ratio of 
50%, in line with our targeted pay-out ratio, to be 
distributed in 2021. 
 
given the global uncertainty caused by the 
covid-19 pandemic, the board of directors of 
flsmidth & co. a/s decided to withdraw the pro-
posal to pay a dividend of dkk 8 per share in 
2020 to ensure resilience in a period of market 
uncertainty and to further strengthen flsmidth’s 
financial position. 
 
flsmidth investor relations 
through the investor relations function, the 
board of directors maintains an ongoing dia-
logue between the company and the stock mar-
ket and ensures that the positions and views of 
the shareholders are reported back to the board. 
 
the purpose of flsmidth's investor relations 
function is to contribute to ensuring and facilitat-
ing that: 
 
■ all shareholders have equal and sufficient ac-
cess to timely, relevant and price-sensitive in-
formation 
■ the share price reflects flsmidth’s underlying 
financial results and a fair market value 
■ the liquidity and the day-to-day trading turno-
ver of the flsmidth share is sufficiently attrac-
tive for both short- and long-term investors 
■ the shareholder structure is appropriately di-
versified in terms of geography, investment 
profile and time horizon. 
 
to achieve these goals, an open and active dia-
logue is maintained with the stock market both 
through flsmidth’s website and electronic com-
munication services and via investor presenta-
tions, investor meetings, webcasts, teleconfer-
ences, roadshows, the annual general meeting 
and capital markets days. 
 
 
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic changed the 
way investor relations and management inter-
acted with the financial markets, as restrictions 
and travel bans limited the usual travel activity. 
since march, nearly all investor and analyst meet-
ings have been conducted virtually. we have re-
mained connected and engaged with investors 
through high-definition video and audio. we plan 
to resume travel activity when the pandemic al-
lows for it but virtual meetings will remain an inte-
grated part of how we will engage with the finan-
cial markets in future. 
 
flsmidth & co. a/s is generally categorised as a 
capital goods or industrial company and is cur-
rently being covered by 17 equity analysts, 10 of 
which are based outside denmark.

cash flow divided into operating, investing and fi-
nancing activities for both continued and discon-
tinued activity and the changes in cash and cash 
equivalents during the year.  
 
cash flow from operating activities consists of 
earnings before special non-recurring items, de-
preciation, amortisation and impairment (ebitda) 
adjusted for non-cash operating items, changes 
in provisions and net working capital, financial 
items as interests paid from the lease liabilities 
and taxes paid. 
 
cash flow from investing activities comprises 
payments made in connection with the acquisi-
tion and disposal of businesses and non-current 
assets. 
 
cash flow from financing activities comprises 
changes in the size or composition of equity and 
loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt includ-
ing lease liabilities, acquisitions and disposal of 
non-controlling interests, movements in shares 
and payment of dividend to shareholders. 
 
cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of 
bank deposits.

consolidated financial statements           consolidated financial statements  
  
when preparing the financial statements we are 
required to make several estimates and judge-
ments. this note includes the areas that involve a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity and 
where changes in assumptions and estimates will 
likely have a significant impact on the financial 
statements. these areas are categorised as key 
accounting estimates and judgements. the sig-
nificance of these material implications is catego-
rised into three levels: 
 
 
 
 
key accounting estimate  
key accounting estimates are expectations of the 
future based on assumptions, that we to the ex-
tent possible support by historical trends or rea-
sonable expectations. our assumptions may 
change to adapt to the market conditions and 
changes in political and economic factors. we 
believe that our estimates are the most likely out-
come of future events. 
 
key accounting judgements 
key accounting judgements are made when  
applying accounting policies. key accounting 
judgements are the judgements made, that can 
have a significant impact on the amounts recog-
nised in the financial statements. 
 
the covid-19 pandemic has imposed significant 
uncertainty to the financial statements.  
 
the pandemic has changed our reality and we 
have continuously adapted to new ways of doing 
business. navigating in a market environment 
that has continuously changed to adapt to gov-
ernment imposed restrictions, new customary 
business practices etc., has had an impact not 
only on us but on our entire value chain.  
 
one of the uncertainties in the early phase of the 
pandemic was related to the liquidity position. 
looking ahead was with poor visibility and the 
length and magnitude of the impact was hard to 
predict. to mitigate the potential liquidity risk we 
decided early in the pandemic to bolster our li-
quidity position by adding an additional dkk 
500m credit facility. 
 
during the year we have monitored our activity 
closely and the uncertainties have impacted our 
key accounting estimates and judgements as fol-
lows: 
 
valuation of inventories 
the unstable market conditions and complex lo-
gistics have made it more difficult to get orders 
shipped in to and out from our warehouses, with 
a risk of increase in slow-moving items. other 
than the risk of slow-moving items, uncertainties 
have related to the building up for an increased 
service activity and customers not being able to 
receive the goods as agreed. 
 
as part of managing the more complex setup we 
took the following actions during the year: 
 
■ ensuring a sound inventory turn with a strict fo-
cus on inventory ageing 
■ clear split between inventory specifically dedi-
cated for orders and inventory available for 
sale 
 
the active measures taken during 2020 have re-
duced the inventory level by the end of the year 
and the levels of impairments have also been re-
duced. 
 
for additional description of the estimates, 
please refer to note 3.2 inventories. 
 
valuation of receivables 
the increased market uncertainty has increased 
the counterparty risk, and deterioration in credit 
quality of receivables has led to a risk adjustment  
of our expected credit loss (ecl) measurement.  
 
for additional description of the estimates, 
please refer to note 3.3 trade receivables. 
 
as part of managing the increased credit risk we 
took the following actions during the year: 
 
■ reassessment of customer payment terms  
■ renegotiation of payment terms with our large 
project customers and suppliers where the 
cash flows were imbalanced 
■ increased focus on cash collection 
 
the active measures taken throughout 2020 
have reduced the trade receivables balance by 
the end of 2020 and contributed to strong cash 
collection. 
 
estimate total cost to complete  
our cost forecasts on projects have been more 
uncertain due to the unpredictable development 
in logistics and execution. the project planning 
has been more difficult, due to especially the im-
posed restrictions and the adaption to global and 
local changes in the restrictions.  
 
further the cost forecasts have also been im-
pacted by increased costs to cover a challenged 
supply chain. this has led to more frequent reas-
sessments of cost to complete our projects, as 
our execution of projects has been impacted by 
the disruptions.  
 
the prolonging of project completion and 
changes in the project plans have had a negative 
effect on the total project costs. the lack of visi-
bility and unpredictable project planning has im-
posed increased uncertainty to the cost fore-
casts.  
 
estimate variable transaction price 
site restrictions and operations running at re-
duced capacity has imposed uncertainty to the 
estimate on operation and maintenance con-
tracts where the transaction price varies partly 
with the production.

additionally, the site and travel restrictions com-
bined with a more difficult supply chain has im-
posed uncertainty to meeting of our contractual 
obligations in a timely manner which has caused 
a risk of penalties. 
 
for additional description of the estimates, 
please refer to note 3.4 work in progress. 
 
deferred tax assets 
the uncertain market situation and development 
has made it more difficult to predict the level of 
business activity and earnings in the future.  
 
the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is 
dependent on the generation of sufficient future 
taxable income to utilise tax losses. covid-19 
has increased the uncertainty. the changing lo-
cal and regional restrictions has made it difficult 
to predict the levels for the jurisdictions and the 
expected utilisation of deferred tax assets 
against future taxable income. 
 
for additional description of the estimates, 
please refer to note 4.3 deferred tax. 
 
the financial impact of covid-19 requires signifi-
cant judgement and is included in the estimates 
of the activity of the group.  
 
the financial impact of covid-19 is embedded 
into the valuation of our entire balance sheet and

1.1 income statement  
by function   
it is our policy to prepare the income statement 
based on an adjusted classification of the cost by 
function in order to show the earnings before 
special non-recurring items, depreciation, amorti-
sation and impairment (ebitda). depreciation, 
amortisation, and impairment are therefore sepa-
rated from the individual functions and presented 
in separated lines. 
 
amortisation of patent and rights is presented as 
production costs and the comparative figures 
have been adjusted as the amortisation was in-
cluded in administrative costs in previous years.  
1.2 segment information   
 
mining and cement industries are our operating 
and reporting segments. our industries have 
technology ownership and develop and drive the 
life cycle offering and product portfolio. this is 
supported by a seven region structure driving 
customer relations, sales and service for both in-
dustries. 
 
the organisational structure helps create a 
productivity-driven organisation with a strong, 
unified digital approach and fewer touchpoints 
strengthening our local presence, customer ori-
entation, and life cycle offering in order to cap-
ture growth. 
 
the mining and cement industries front our cus-
tomers in the global industries with all the 
knowhow technologies, products, processes and 
systems used to separate commercially viable 
minerals from their ores and to cement produc-
tion. 
 
with the responsibility of our total life cycle offer-
ings firmly anchored in the mining and cement 
industries, we are capable of improving our cus-
tomer specific offerings. offerings range from 
first time sale of single products to turn-key pro-
jects, subsequent services, operation & mainte-
nance, upgrades and rebuilds of existing equip-
ment, plants and sale of spare parts and wear 
parts. 
the segmentation reflects the internal reporting 
and management structure applied. the seg-
ments are primarily managed on ebita before al-
location of shared costs. 
 
accounting policy 
segment income and costs include transactions 
between divisions. such transactions are carried 
out on market terms. the transactions are elimi-
nated upon consolidation. 
 
administrative functions such as finance, hr, it 
and legal are shared by the divisions. 
 
additionally, the divisions are supported by 
group functions related to procurement, logis-
tics and marketing. 
 
shared costs are allocated to business segments 
based on assessment of usage. 
 
other companies consist of eliminations, compa-
nies with no activities, real estate and the parent 
company, while discontinued activities consist of 
bulk material handling activities and run-off on 
activities sold in previous years. 
 
geographical information is based on the seven 
regions that support the industries. revenue is 
presented in the region in which delivery takes 
place. non-current assets and employees are 
presented in the region in which they belong.

1.4 revenue   
revenue arises from sale of life cycle offerings to 
our customers. we sell a broad range of goods 
and services within the mining and cement in-
dustries split into the main categories projects, 
products and services. 
 
products 
the sale of products comprise sale of standard-
ised and customised equipment, such as pre-
heaters, cyclones, mills and kilns. products will 
usually have a lead time of less than one year. 
 
each product is considered as one performance 
obligation. most of the products are sold at a 
fixed price and revenue is usually recognised 
over time, applying the cost-to-cost method. 
 
products that are standardised or customised to 
a low degree are recognised at the point in time 
when control of the products transfers to the cus-
tomers, usually upon delivery. 
 
a highly customised product sale will often enti-
tle us to receive a down payment from the cus-
tomer, followed by several progress payments 
linked to our performance progress. upon com-
pletion or delivery we will usually be entitled to 
the final payment. to the extent possible we ob-
tain payment guarantees to minimise our risk 
during execution. 
 
for standardised products we will usually be en-
titled to payment upon delivery. 
 
projects 
the sale of projects comprise sale of plants, plant 
extensions, process systems and process system 
extensions.  
 
projects are usually significant in amount, have a 
long lead time affecting the financial statements 
of more than one financial year, have a high de-
gree of project management and involve more 
than one flsmidth entity in the delivery to the 
customer. 
 
a project is usually considered one performance 
obligation as a project typically includes highly in-
terrelated and interdependent physical assets 
and services, like engineering, installation and 
supervision. dependent on the contract structure 
one performance obligation can consist of more 
than one contract. 
 
most of the projects are sold as fixed price con-
tracts and revenue from projects is usually recog-
nised over time; applying the percentage of com-
pletion cost-to-cost method. 
a project contract will often entitle us to receive a 
down payment from the customer, followed by 
several progress payments linked to our perfor-
mance progress. upon completion and customer 
acceptance we will usually be entitled to the final 
payment. to the extent possible we obtain pay-
ment guarantees to minimise our risk during exe-
cution. 
 
services  
services comprise various service elements to 
support the life cycle offerings portfolio. the sale 
can consist of spare parts, wear parts, service 
hours, long-term maintenance contracts, opera-
tion & maintenance contracts and sale of up-
grades and retrofits. 
 
the sale of service hours includes amongst oth-
ers sale of supervision, electronic or mechanical 
service of equipment or plants. 
 
each spare part and wear part is considered one 
performance obligation. the sale is usually 
agreed at a fixed price and revenue is usually 
recognised at the point of delivery. we are nor-
mally entitled to payment once we have deliv-
ered the parts. 
 
the performance obligation for service sales and 
maintenance contracts is either each service 
hour or the full contract, depending on the con-
tract wording. most service contracts are fixed 
price contracts, if not for the full service, then for 
the hourly rate. service sales are recognised 
over time as the services are provided to the cus-
tomer based on the cost-to-cost method. we are 
normally entitled to payment once the service 
has been provided or on a monthly basis.

1.4 revenue - continued 
each operation & maintenance contract is deter-
mined as one performance obligation. the trans-
action price is usually variable, depending on the 
produced output, and revenue is recognised 
over time, using the cost-to-cost method. in 
cases of significant uncertainties with measuring 
the revenue reliably we recognise revenue upon 
cash receipt. we are usually entitled to payment 
on a monthly basis. 
 
service projects, such as upgrades and retrofits 
are defined as one performance obligation. the 
transaction price is usually fixed and revenue is 
typically recognised over time using the cost-to-
cost method. the payment pattern for upgrades 
and retrofits are very similar to the pattern for 
projects and products. 
 
backlog 
the order backlog at 31 december 2020 
amounts to dkk 14,874m (2019: dkk 14,192m) 
and represents the value of outstanding perfor-
mance obligations on current contracts, com-
bined of contracts where we will transfer control 
at a future point in time and the remaining perfor-
mance obligations on contracts where we trans-
fer control over time.  
 
based on the order backlog maturity profile, the 
majority, 64% (2019: 73%) of the order backlog is 
expected to be converted into revenue in 2021, 
while 36% (2019: 27%) is expected to be con-
verted to revenue in subsequent years. 
 
accounting policy 
revenue comprises sale of projects, products 
and service within the mining and cement indus-
tries. 
 
revenue from contracts with customers is recog-
nised when control of the goods or services are 
transferred to our customers at an amount that 
reflects the transaction price to which we expect

services. 
 
revenue from projects, products, and services 
(with the exception of sale of service hours) is 
recognised over time, using the cost-to-cost 
method, when we have no alternative use for the 
goods or services to be delivered and we have 
an enforceable right to payment for work com-
pleted. 
 
if we do have an alternative use for the goods or 
services to be delivered, e.g. products with a low

key accounting judgements 
judgement regarding performance obli-
gations 
judgement is performed when determin-
ing if a contract for sale of projects, prod-
ucts or services, or a combination hereof, 
involves one or more performance obliga-
tions.  
 
the complexity arises when selling bun-
dled goods and services, and the conse-
quence of the key accounting judgement 
is related to the timing of revenue recog-
nition, especially for point in time sales. 
 
judgement regarding recognition 
method 
judgements are made when determining 
if a project, product or service is recog-
nised as revenue over time or at a point in 
time.  
 
the judgements relate to if we have an al-
ternative use of the assets sold and if we 
have an enforceable right to payment 
throughout the contractual term. 
 
when assessing if an asset has no alter-
native use we estimate the alternative use 
cost amount. we have limited historical 
data as we rarely redirect our assets. the 
estimate is based on the specifics of each 
contract. 
 
when assessing if we are entitled to pay-
ment throughout the contract term, a 
judgement is made based on the contract 
wording, legal entitlement and profit esti-
mates.

1.4 revenue - continued 
additionally, if we do not have an enforceable 
right to payment for work completed through-out 
the contract term, such sales will also be recog-
nised at the point in time when the control trans-
fers to the customer, usually upon customer ac-
ceptance. in the case of significant uncertainties 
with the collectability of contract consideration, 
revenue is recognised upon cash receipt. 
 
service sales (sale of service hours) are recog-
nised over time, using the cost-to-cost method, 
as the customer receives and consumes the ben-
efits as we perform the services. 
 
in determining the transaction price revenue is 
reduced by probable penalties, payment of liqui-
dated damages and any other claims that are 
payments to our customers. the transaction 
price is also adjusted for any variable elements, 
where we estimate the amount of the variable 
transaction price. 
 
the variable amount is estimated at contract in-
ception and re-estimated periodically throughout 
the contract term. the variable amount is recog-
nised as revenue when it is highly probable that 
reversal will not occur.  
 
warranties are granted in connection with the 
sale of equipment and systems and are classified 
as assurance-type warranties that are not ac-
counted for as separate performance obligations. 
please refer to section 2.7, provisions, for ac-
counting policy on warranties provisions. 
 
revenue is recognised less rebates, cash dis-
counts, value added tax and duties and gross of 
foreign withholding taxes. 
1.5 staff costs  
the average number of employees in 2020 in 
the continuing activities was 11,567 (2019: 11,669). 
 
staff costs consist of direct wages and salaries, 
remuneration, pension cost, share-based pay-
ments, training, etc., related to the continuing ac-
tivities.  
 
the decrease in staff costs are positively af-
fected by decrease in currencies of approxi-
mately dkk 200m.

1.6 government grants  
governments in many countries have introduced 
measures to support entities during the pan-
demic. during 2020 we have been entitled to the 
following government grants and fulfilled the 
conditions attached to receiving the grants. the 
grants have primarily been received to compen-
sate for salary expenses and the majority of the 
grants have been received in switzerland, den-
mark, germany and italy. 
 
the covid-19 related government grants have 
been included in the following line items in the

accounting policy 
government grants are recognised when there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be re-
ceived and all attaching conditions will be com-
plied with. the government grants will be recog-
nised according to their purpose. 
 
government grants intended to compensate for 
costs are recognised in the income statement 
over the periods in which the entity recognises 
the related costs. the government grant is de-
ducted in the related expense.

and the average capital employed has followed. 
the decrease was related to lower net working 
capital as well as investments in intangible as-
sets, including goodwill, research and develop-
ment projects and software. assets classified as 
held for sale had an effect of dkk 71m decrease 
in net working capital and from that a dkk 35m

our return on capital employed is calculated 
based on average capital employed to reflect the

ing the year, driven by the decreased ebita.  
2.2 intangible assets   
goodwill arising from business acquisitions is 
recognised in the financial statements. carrying 
amount of goodwill decreased during 2020, de-
spite the acquisitions of mill-ore group and 
knowledgescape llp. the decline is due to 
translation effects of foreign currencies. 
 
patents and rights acquired through business ac-
quisitions is recognised in the financial state-
ments. the patents and rights include patents, 
trademarks, technology and other rights. 
 
our intangible assets under development consist 
of research and development (r&d) projects and 
software. the transfer from intangible assets un-
der development to completed development 
projects primarily relates to r&d projects final-
ised in 2020. 
 
much of the knowhow we generate originates 
from work performed for customers. in 2020, 
r&d costs totalled dkk 310m (2019: dkk 302m). 
the addition of intangible assets under develop-
ment amounts to dkk 177m (2019: dkk 242m), 
where capitalised development cost accounts for 
dkk 150m (2019: dkk 142m). r&d costs not capi-
talised are included in production costs. the re-
maining capitalisation relates to it related pro-
jects. internally generated cost capitalised 
amounts to dkk 115m (2019: dkk 98m). 
 
other intangible assets consist of software and 
completed software implementation projects, 
whereas completed development projects pri-
marily consist of r&d. 
goodwill is considered to have an indefinite use-
ful life. the carrying amount of goodwill per seg-
ment is shown in note 2.3. 
 
accounting policy 
goodwill 
goodwill is measured in the balance sheet at 
cost in connection with initial recognition. subse-
quently, goodwill is measured at cost less accu-
mulated impairment losses. goodwill is allocated 
to the cash generating units as defined by the 
management. the determination of cash gener-
ating units complies with the managerial struc-
ture and the internal financial reporting in the 
group. goodwill is not amortised but is tested for 
impairment at least once a year or sooner if im-
pairment indication arises. 
 
intangible assets other than goodwill 
patents and rights including trademarks, cus-
tomer relations, and other intangible assets with 
a finite useful life are measured at cost less accu-
mulated amortisation and impairment losses.  
 
development projects, for which the technical 
rate of utilisation, sufficient resources and a po-
tential future market or application in the group, 
can be demonstrated and which are intended to 
be manufactured, marketed or used, are recog-
nised as completed development projects. this 
requires that the cost can be determined and it is 
sufficiently certain that the future earnings or the 
net selling price will cover production, sales and 
administrative costs plus development costs. 
other development costs are recognised in the 
income statement when costs are incurred. de-
velopment costs consist of salaries and other 
costs that are directly attributable to develop-
ment activities. 
 
amortisation of completed development projects 
is charged on a straight line basis during their es-
timated useful life. development projects are 
written down for impairment to recoverable 
amount if lower. development projects in pro-
gress are not amortised but are tested for impair-
ment at least once a year. 
 
goodwill is considered to have indefinite useful 
life and is not amortised. 
 
for other intangible assets amortisation takes 
place systematically over the estimated useful 
life of the assets which is as follows: 
 
■ patents and rights, including trademarks, up to 
30 years 
■ customer relations up to 30 years 
■ other intangible assets up to 20 years 
■ software applications up to 5 years 
■ development costs up to 8 years 
 
change in accounting estimate 
in prior years trademarks, which are part of pa-
tents and rights, were considered to have indefi-
nite useful life. as part of our periodic reassess-
ment of useful lives we have in 2020 estimated 
that the useful life for trademarks is not indefinite, 
but up to 30 years, as this better reflects the pe-
riod in which we expect to gain benefits from the 
assets when considering all relevant factors. the 
change in accounting estimate has increased the 
amortisation in 2020 by 26m, which is largely the 
level expected going forward. 
 
trademarks are tested for impairment as part of  
the cgus to which they belong, refer to note 2.3.

2.3 impairment of assets   
result of annual impairment test 
we perform an annual impairment test of our in-
tangible assets with indefinite useful life. in 2020 
the test showed no impairment need (2019: dkk 
0m). intangible assets are primarily related to ac-
quisition of enterprises and activities, software 
and research and development projects. when 
performing the annual impairment test of assets, 
an assessment is made as to whether the cash 
generating units to which assets are allocated 
will be able to generate sufficient positive net 
cash flow in the future to support the value of the 
assets. 
 
management believes that no changes in the key 
assumptions are likely to reduce the headroom 
in any of the cash generating units to zero or 
less. 
 
carrying amounts of intangible assets included in 
the impairment test are specified below:

cash generating units 
the cash generating units equal our operating 
and reportable segments, mining and cement, 
these being the smallest group of assets which 
together generate incoming cash flow from con-
tinued use of the assets and which are independ-
ent of cash flow from other assets or groups of 
assets. the definition of the cash generating 
units is reconsidered once a year, and the defini-
tion is unchanged compared to last year. 
 
key assumptions 
an estimate is made of the present value of the 
future free net cash flow based on budgets and 
strategy for the coming eight years as well as 
projections for the terminal period. the eight 
year period is used to better reflect the business 
cycle. significant parameters in these estimates 
are discount rate, revenue growth, ebita margin, 
expected investments and growth expectations 
for the terminal period. 
 
the discount rate applied reflects the latest mar-
ket assumptions for the risk-free rate based on a 
10-year danish government bond, the equity risk 
premium and the cost of debt. 
 
the expected annual growth rate and the ex-
pected margins in the budget period are based 
on historical experience and the assumptions 
about expected market developments as de-
tailed above. from 2028 and onwards, the long-
term growth rate for the terminal period is based 
on the expected growth in the world economy, 
specifically for the industries. 
 
due to the current negative interest rate environ-
ment, a conservative approach regarding the 
long-term growth rate for the terminal period has 
been applied. this methodology has been ap-
plied to ensure consistency with the level of the 
risk-free rate applied as a basis for the estimation 
of discount rate (wacc) and the long-term 
growth rate. based on these factors, a long term 
annual growth rate for the terminal period of 1.5% 
has been applied. 
 
investments reflect both maintenance and ex-
pectations of organic growth.

2.3 impairment of assets - 
continued 
mining 
the covid-19 pandemic has impacted the global 
economy across industries, but the mining indus-
try has remained relatively resilient during the 
course of 2020 with the majority of mines opera-
tional across regions. roughly 10% of the world’s 
mine sites were shut down in april, but nearly all 
sites have restarted production and most sites 
run with high production rates. mines are, how-
ever, often remotely located and to protect em-
ployees and safeguard production, many cus-
tomers are still enforcing safety protocols and do 
not permit site access to external service provid-
ers, which impacts their equipment and service 
spend. with infection cases currently surging in 
many parts of the world, it is still difficult to pre-
dict the shape of the recovery curve. it is, how-
ever, expected that the pandemic will continue to 
impact the industry in the first half of 2021. 
 
on the positive side, commodity prices have re-
bounded strongly from the spring when the first 
pandemic wave hit, and the industry is expected 
to recover to pre-pandemic activity levels within 
a relatively short time horizon. all things consid-
ered, the pandemic has disrupted the mining in-
dustry to a lesser degree than many other indus-
tries. for 2021, the mining business revenue and 
ebita are expected to grow in the second half of 
the year as covid-19 restrictions are expected 
to ease. 
 
the outlook for investments in mining remains 
positive, and we have a healthy pipeline of both 
larger and smaller opportunities. further, the 
switch to green energy and electric powered 
transportation will require a massive increase in 
infrastructure and the mining industry will need to 
scale up investments in copper, battery metals 
and other minerals to meet this growing demand. 
 
cement 
the cement market was subdued already enter-
ing 2020 and has been severely impacted by the 
pandemic in 2020. following shutdown of about 
20% of the world’s cement plants outside of 
china in april, the share of cement plants in  
operation has climbed back up above 95% at the 
end of the year. however, many plants continue 
to run at reduced capacity and sites are often dif-
ficult to access due to restrictions and preventa-
tive measurements taken by authorities and plant 
operators. the cement business revenue is ex-
pected to decline further in 2021, and as a con-
sequence, initiatives to reshape the cement 
business will continue during the year. the ce-
ment business is not expected to be ebita posi-
tive in 2021 due to continued cement reshaping 
costs and low capacity utilisation in the service 
business until the pandemic eases. 
 
we do not anticipate a recovery in the short- to 
medium-term but the large economic stimulus 
programmes that have been announced in parts 
of the world, combined with an increasing focus 
on lower-carbon cement production, is expected 
to create good opportunities in the mid- to long-
term. the timing and extent of such rebound re-
main uncertain but during the last weeks of 
2020, the eu commission agreed on a 55% re-
duction target of greenhouse gas emissions by 
2030, and a budget that allows for a green re-
covery following covid-19 restrictions. the 
green recovery will fuel demand for emission-re-
ducing technologies and the cement industry will 
need to undertake substantial investments to 
meet recent commitments to carbon neutrality by 
the global cement and concrete association 
and the european cement association. 
 
sensitivity analysis 
based on current assumptions we see no impair-
ment indications, and our key assumptions are 
not sensitive to reasonable changes to an extent 
that will result in an impairment loss neither indi-
vidually nor in combination. 
 
accounting policy 
goodwill and intangible assets not yet available 
for use are tested for impairment at least once a 
year, irrespective of whether there is any indica-
tion that they may be impaired. 
 
assets that are subject to amortisation, such as 
intangible assets in use with deﬁnite useful life, 
and other non-current assets are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in cir-
cumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.  
 
factors that could trigger an impairment test in-
clude the following: 
 
■ changes of r&d project expectations 
■ lower than predicted sales related to particular 
technologies 
■ changes in the economic lives of similar assets 
■ relationship with other intangible assets or 
property, plant and equipment 
 
for impairment testing, assets are grouped into 
the smallest group of assets that generates 
largely independent cash inflows (cash generat-
ing unit) as determined based on the manage-
ment structure and the internal financial report-
ing. 
 
if the carrying amount of intangible assets ex-
ceeds the recoverable amount based on the ex-
istence of one or more of the above indicators of 
impairment, any impairment is measured based 
on discounted projected cash ﬂows. impairments 
are reviewed at each reporting date for possible 
reversal. 
 
impairment of goodwill is not reversed. recogni-
tion of impairment of other assets is reversed to 
the extent that changes have taken place in the 
assumptions and estimates that led to the recog-
nition of impairment.

2.4 property, plant and 
equipment  
land and buildings with a carrying amount of 
dkk 48m (2019: dkk 48m) are pledged against 
mortgage debt of dkk 256m (2019: dkk 273m). 
 
 
accounting policy 
property, plant and equipment are measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impair-
ment losses. the cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour 
costs. 
 
depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life of the assets until 
they reach the estimated residual value. 
estimated useful life is as follows: 
 
■ buildings, 20-40 years 
■ plant and machinery, 3-15 years 
■ operating equipment and fixtures and fittings, 
3-15 years 
■ leasehold improvements, mainly related to 
land and buildings, up to 5 years or following 
the corresponding lease agreement 
 
land is not depreciated. 
 
newly acquired assets and assets of own con-
struction are depreciated from the time they are 
available for use. 
 
where acquisition or use of the asset places the 
group under an obligation to incur the costs of 
re-establishing the asset, the estimated costs for 
this purpose are recognised as part of the cost of 
the asset, and are depreciated during the asset’s 
useful life.

2.5 leases  
we are party to several lease contracts as les-
see, by which we lease offices, warehouses, 
manufacturing facilities and vehicles. we enter 
into lease contracts due to the flexibility it pro-
vides as it may ease the scalability to always 
adapt the asset base to the operational activity. 
 
the majority of the lease assets relate to land 
and buildings and the lease contracts are typi-
cally made for fixed periods of 1 to 10 years, with 
a weighted average lease term of 5 years. the 
average discount rate applied for land and build-
ings is 3.13% at the end of 2020 (2019: 3.66%). 
 
in some property lease contracts extension and 
termination options are included. these are used 
to maximise operational flexibility in terms of 
managing the assets used in the group’s opera-
tions. 
 
the amounts included in the income statement 
related to expensed leases are presented at the 
bottom of the page. 
 
depreciation on lease assets amounted to dkk 
124m (2019: dkk 112m) and write downs on as-
sets held for sale dkk 4m (2019: dkk 0m). inter-
est on lease debt was dkk 11m (2019: dkk 12m), 
see note 5.4. 
 
during 2020 we have had total cash outflow for 
leases of dkk 131m (2019: dkk 118m), of which 
dkk 11m (2019: dkk 12m) was interest related to 
leases (included in cffo) and dkk 120m (2019: 
dkk 106m) repayment of lease debt (included in 
cfff). please refer to note 5.8 financial assets 
and liabilities for maturity analysis of lease liabili-
ties. 
 
further to the above cash outflow dkk 11m (2019: 
dkk 15m) was included in cffo for costs relating 
to short term, low-value and variable lease pay-
ments not recorded on the balance sheet. 
 
during 2019, we entered into a contingent sale 
and leaseback transaction of the headquarters in 
valby, denmark. in light of the covid-19 pan-
demic, plans are being revisited, please refer to 
note 2.9 contractual obligation for further infor-
mation. 
 
we are not party to any significant lease con-
tracts as lessor.

2.5 leases - continued 
accounting policy 
assets and liabilities arising from a lease are ini-
tially measured on a present value basis. lease 
liabilities include the net present value of the 
payments, which are fixed or variable dependent 
on an index or a rate. when adjustments to lease 
payments based on an index or rate take effect, 
the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted 
against the lease asset. service components are 
excluded from the lease liability. 
 
the lease payments are discounted using an in-
cremental country specific borrowing rate, based 
on a government bond plus the group’s credit 
margin. 
 
the lease payments have been split into an inter-
est cost and a repayment of the lease liability. 
lease assets are measured at cost comprising 
the following: 
 
■ the amount of the initial measurement of lease 
liability 
■ any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives 
received 
■ any initial direct costs, and 
■ restoration costs 
 
the lease assets are depreciated over the term 
of the lease contract on a straight-line basis.  
 
extension options (or periods after termination 
options) are only included in the lease term if the 
lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or 
not terminated).  
 
the following factors are normally the most rele-
vant: 
 
■ how the asset supports the direction of the 
group, from a strategic standpoint, location of 
the asset, timing of the option being exercisa-
ble 
■ if there are significant penalties to terminate (or 
not extend), the group is typically reasonably 
certain to extend (or not terminate) 
■ if any leasehold improvements are expected to 
have a significant remaining value, the group is 
typically reasonably certain to extend (or not 
terminate) 
 
payments associated with short-term and low 
value leases are recognised on a straight-line ba-
sis as an expense in profit or loss. short-term 
leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months 
or less. low-value assets comprise it equipment 
and small items of office furniture at a low value. 
2.6 investments in 
associates  
investments in associates includes investment in 
intertek robotic laboratories pty ltd, australia, 
with a 50% share.  
 
the investment is accounted for in accordance 
with the equity method. although we hold 50% of 
the shares and voting rights, we do not share the 
control, hence the investment is not treated as a 
joint venture. as we do have significant influence 
the investment is treated as an investment in as-
sociates.

2.7 provisions  
provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or 
amount. our provisions consist of: 
 
■ provision for warranty claims in respect of 
goods or services already delivered 
■ provisions for cost related to restructuring 
■ provisions for loss-making contracts (included 
in other provisions) 
■ provisions for losses resulting from disputes 
and lawsuits (included in other provisions) 
■ provisions for indirect tax risks (included in 
other provisions) 
 
total provisions are at the same level as last 
year. 
 
warranty provisions have decreased to dkk 
496m at 31 december 2020. the decrease is 
mainly a result of the lower activity and products 
running out of the warranty period, resulting in a 
reversal of the unused warranty provision.  
 
restructuring provisions have increased slightly 
to dkk 60m due to the continued restructuring 
measures in right-sizing the organisation. 
other provisions have increased to dkk 459m 
due to additional uncertainties in the execution 
of the project portfolio. the uncertainties have in-
creased the expected cost level, hence an in-
creased level of loss-making contracts. addition-
ally, the provisions relate to ongoing legal 
disputes, including provisions related to discon-
tinued activities. the level of used and reversed 
provision is largely unchanged from last year. 
 
continued activities’ share of group provisions is 
shown below. the provisions from continued and 
discontinued activities add up to our total provi-
sions. 
in cash flow the changes in provisions are com-
bined with the changes in pensions and em-
ployee benefits. the changes in provisions, pen-
sions and employee benefits have the following 
cash flow effect as an adjustment-amount to re-
ported profit in the income statement:

key accounting estimates 
estimated warranty provision 
when estimating the warranty provision 
we take into consideration several years 
of warranty cost information, any spe-
cific project related risks, knowledge 
about defects and functional errors in 
the product portfolio, risks associated 
with newly launched products as well as 
customer losses in connection with sus-
pension of operation. we include all of 
these factors as relevant, to estimate a 
warranty provision that to the best of 
our knowledge reflects our responsibil-
ity towards our customers in the future.

2.7 provisions  
– continued 
accounting policy 
provisions are recognised when we, due to an 
event occurring before or at the balance sheet 
date, have a legal or constructive obligation and 
outflow of resources is expected to settle the ob-
ligation. 
 
provisions for warranty claims are estimated on a 
project-by-project basis based on historical real-
ised cost related costs of completion, subse-
quent warranty supplies and unsettled claims 
from customers or subcontractors. 
 
provisions for restructuring costs are made only if 
the restructuring has been decided at the bal-
ance sheet date in accordance with a specific 
plan, and only provided that the parties involved 
have been informed about the overall plan. 
 
the cost of loss-making projects covering pro-
jects expected to result in a loss, is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. losses not 
yet incurred are provided for as other provisions. 
provisions regarding disputes and lawsuits are 
based on management’s assessment of the likely 
outcome settling the cases based on the infor-
mation at hand at the balance sheet date. 
 
2.8 pension obligations   
defined contribution plans 
the majority of our pension plans are defined 
contribution plans and we have no further pay-
ment obligations once the contributions are paid. 
under these pension plans, we recognise regular 
payments, e.g. a fixed amount or a fixed percent-
age of the salary. pension costs related to de-
fined contribution plans are recognised in staff 
costs (note 1.5) and amounted to dkk 439m 
(2019: dkk 596m). 
 
defined benefit plans 
we also have defined benefit plans where the re-
sponsibility for the pension obligation towards 
the employees rests with us. under a defined 
benefit plan, we have an obligation to pay a spe-
cific benefit, e.g. retirement pension in the form 
of a fixed proportion of the exit salary. under 
these plans, we carry the risk in relation to future 
developments in interest rates, inflation, mortal-
ity, etc. a change in the assumptions upon which 
the calculation is based results in a change in the 
actuarial present value. in the event of changes 
in the assumptions used in the calculation of de-
fined benefit plans for existing and former em-
ployees, actuarial gains and losses are recog-
nised in other comprehensive income. 
 
the majority of the total pension obligations are 
partially funded with assets placed in pension 
funds and through insurance. in 2021 we expect 
to make a contribution to the defined benefit 
plans of dkk 8.5m (2020: 4.6m). the weighted 
average duration of the obligations is 13 years 
(2019: 13 years).

accounting policy 
contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised in staff costs when the related ser-
vice is provided. any contributions outstanding 
are recognised in the balance sheet as other lia-
bilities. 
 
for defined benefit plans, annual actuarial calcu-
lations are made of the present value of future 
benefits payable under the pension plan using 
the projected unit credit method. 
 
the present value is calculated based on as-
sumptions about future developments in varia-
bles such as salary levels, interest, inflation and 
mortality rates. the present value is only calcu-
lated for benefits earned by the employees 
through their employment with the group to 
date. the actuarial calculation of present value 
less the fair value of any plan assets is recog-
nised in the balance sheet as pension obliga-
tions. 
 
the pension costs for the year, based on actuar-
ial estimates and financial forecasts at the begin-
ning of the year, are recognised in the income 
statement. the difference between the forecast 
development in pension assets and liabilities and 
the realised values is called actuarial gains or 
losses and is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income through other compre-
hensive income. 
 
if a pension plan constitutes a net asset, the as-
set is recognised only to the extent that it equals 
the value of future repayments under the plan or 
it leads to a reduction of future contributions to 
the plan.

2.9 contractual 
obligations and 
contingent assets and 
liabilities   
sale and leaseback of 
headquarters 
flsmidth has entered into a conditional agree-
ment to sell all and lease back part of its head-
quarters in valby, denmark. in light of the 
covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 business adjust-
ments, the increased degree of flexible working 
arrangements and an expected slow recovery 
within cement, it has been decided to revisit the 
plans for the headquarter in valby. all possibili-
ties will be revisited, including amongst others 
whether to sell part of the property and renovate 
the existing buildings or look to find a headquar-
ter somewhere else in the copenhagen area. 
the parties involved in the conditional agree-
ment are currently exploring the possibilities, and 
the timing and outcome of the agreement is 
therefore uncertain. 
 
contractual commitments 
as part of our digital strategy, flsmidth has 
made a fund investment in chrysalix, a venture 
capital firm that specialises in transformational in-
dustrial innovation.  
  
our participation provides priority access, builds 
capabilities and shares risk when working with 
early stage start-ups across the globe. our objec-
tive of engaging with disruptive and deep tech-
nology start-ups is to create differentiated value 
propositions and accelerate being productivity 
provider #1, while delivering strategic and finan-
cial returns. 
we have made a capital commitment of usd 
10m. the capital can be called up until 2029, in-
vestment period being the first 5 years. the tim-
ing and amounts of each capital call are uncer-
tain. the undrawn part of the capital commitment 
at 31 december 2020 amounted to dkk 52m 
(2019: dkk: 62m). 
 
contingent assets 
in a customer contract, our customer failed to 
meet its obligations to an extent that has caused 
material breach of the contract. an arbitration 
case has been settled in our favour in 2020 and 
during 2020 we have received payments ac-
cording to the settlement agreement and have 
recognised dkk 34m in the income statement. 
 
guarantees 
to cover project-related risks, such as perfor-
mance, payment, quality and delay, we issue 
usual security in the form of performance and 
payment guarantees for projects and supplies to-
wards our customers. at 31 december 2020, the 
value of issued guarantees amounted to dkk 
2,376m (2019: dkk: 2,474m). in the event a guar-
antee is expected to materialise, a provision is 
recognised to cover the risk. 
 
other contingent liabilities 
we are involved in legal disputes, certain of 
which are already pending with courts or other 
authorities and others of which some may or may 
not lead to formal legal proceedings being insti-
gated against us, including by public authorities. 
the outcome of such proceedings and disputes 
is by nature unknown, but is not expected to 
have significant impact on our financial position. 
other contingent liabilities amount to dkk 284m 
(2019: dkk 333m). 
2.10 business 
acquisitions   
on 31 january 2020, flsmidth acquired the 
business mill-ore group, an eastern canadian 
provider of equipment and aftermarket services 
to the mining industry. the acquisition is part of 
our long-term commitment to increase the level 
of service and support to our customers in east-
ern canada. 
 
on 30 october 2020, flsmidth acquired the 
business knowledgescape llc, a us-based de-
veloper of software, smart sensors and real time 
image analysis. knowledgescape develops digi-
tal solutions aimed at increasing the efficiency of 
mining processing plants. this transaction allows 
flsmidth to deliver a wider range of benefits to 
its mining customers. these benefits include in-
creased productivity in processing plants and re-
duced consumption of power, water and rea-
gents.  
 
following the acquisitions of the mill-ore and 
knowledgescape businesses we are working on 
realising the synergies between the aftermarket 
and digital initiatives of flsmidth and the mill-
ore aftermarket footprint and the knowledge-
scape digital solutions to further enhance mining 
processing efficiency. all enabling a greater 
value to our customers.

2.10 business 
acquisitions – continued 
acquisition related costs amounted to dkk 1m 
(2019: dkk 5m) and are recognised in the in-
come statement as administrative cost. 
 
had the acquired activities been included in the 
consolidated financial statements from 1 january 
2020, the revenue and net profit would have 
been positively impacted by dkk 75m (2019: 
dkk 182m) and 25m (2019: dkk 13m), respec-
tively, for the full year. 
 
the assets and liabilities in the opening balance 
are measured using the information available at 
the date for issuing the annual report. the pur-
chase price allocations have not been finalised 
due to possible reassessment within 12 months 
of the acquisition. if new information becomes 
available this could affect the calculated values.  
 
we expect the total amount of goodwill to be de-
ductible for tax purposes. 
 
accounting policy 
newly acquired or newly established businesses 
are included in the consolidated financial state-
ments from the acquisition date or formation. the 
acquisition date is the date when control of the 
business is transferred to the group.  
 
upon acquisition of the business of which we ob-
tain control, the acquisition method is applied, 
according to which the identified assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities are measured at their 
fair values.  
 
the acquisition cost/income of an enterprise con-
sists of the fair value of the consideration paya-
ble/receivable. this includes the fair value of the 
consideration already paid/received, the de-
ferred consideration and the contingent consid-
eration. 
 
any subsequent adjustment of contingent con-
sideration is recognised directly in the income 
statement, unless the adjustment is the result of 
new information about conditions prevailing at 
the acquisition date, and this information be-
comes available up to 12 months after the acqui-
sition date. 
 
transaction costs are recognised directly in the 
income statement when incurred as administra-
tive costs. 
 
when acquisition costs differ from the fair values 
of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
identified on acquisition, any positive differences 
(goodwill) are recognised in the balance sheet 
under intangible assets and any negative differ-
ences (negative goodwill) are recognised in the 
income statement as a special non-recurring 
item. 
 
if, on the acquisition date, there are any uncer-
tainties with respect to identifying or measuring 
acquired assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities 
or uncertainty with respect to determining their 
cost, initial recognition will be made on the basis 
of estimated values. such estimated values may 
be adjusted, or additional assets or liabilities may 
be recognised up to 12 months after the acquisi-
tion date, if new information becomes available 
about conditions prevailing on the acquisition 
date, which would have affected the calculation 
of values on that day, had such information been 
known.

2.11 discontinued 
activities  
on 9 january 2019, we announced an agree-
ment to sell the non-mining bulk material han-
dling business to rainbow heavy machineries. 
the agreement closed and became effective  
31 january 2019. 
 
the transaction included transfer of employees, 
brand, intellectual property rights and order 
pipeline. 
 
under the sales agreement we retain the respon-
sibility to finalise legacy projects. the projects 
were from a revenue perspective completed at 
year end 2018. subsequent handling of claims 
and collection activities are expected to be final-
ised during 2021.  
 
accordingly, the discontinued activities reported 
include the ceased non-mining bulk material han-
dling business.  
 
discontinued activities effect on cash flow from 
operating activities is presented below. 
 
please refer to segment note 1.2 for full disclo-
sure of income statement including loss for the 
year for discontinued activities. 
 
discontinued activities are not expected to gen-
erate any significant net cash flow in 2021. the 
expectations are based on a net working capital 
balance of dkk 220m (2019: dkk 227m), provi-
sions of dkk 182m (2019: dkk 211m) and moder-
ate sg&a cost. there can, however, be a timing 
difference between cash paid and cash received 
related to the outstanding net working capital 
and provision balances. 
 
cash flow from discontinued operating activities 
totalled dkk -52m (2019: dkk -191m).  
 
cash flow from net working capital from discon-
tinued activities amounted to dkk -18m (2019: -
58m), as net working capital related to discontin-
ued business decreased from dkk 227m end of 
2019 to dkk 220m end of 2020. 
loss for the period from discontinued activities 
total dkk -21m (2019: dkk -22m), primarily con-
sisting of sg&a cost.

2.12 assets and liabilities 
classified as held for 
sale   
during december 2020, we entered into agree-
ments to sell our fabric filter business and our 
möller pneumatic conveying systems business. 
consequently, the assets and liabilities related to 
the activities are reclassified as held for sale. all 
impacted activities will continue to be included in 
our continued activities, until the transactions 
close. the sale of möller pneumatic conveying 
systems business will close 1 january 2021, 
whereas the fabric filters business is expected to 
close during the first half of 2021. 
 
upon reclassifying the assets and liabilities to 
held for sale we have revalued the net assets 
held for sale at fair value less cost to sell. 
 
the impairment loss amounts to dkk 4m and is 
recognised in continued business as an impair-
ment of lease assets. 
 
 
we have in 2020 received prepayment related 
to the disposal of the möller pneumatic convey-
ing systems business of dkk 62m.

accounting policy 
non-current assets as well as assets and liabili-
ties expected to be sold as a group in a single 
transaction are classified as held for sale, if their 
carrying value is likely to be recovered by sale 
within 12 months in accordance with a formal 
plan.  
 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of 
the carrying value and the fair value less costs to 
sell. assets are not depreciated from the time 
they are reclassified as held for sale.

net working capital at 31 december 2020 de-
creased due to decreasing activity in 2020, sig-
nificant reduction in trade receivables and lower 
level of net work in progress. the reductions 
were partially offset by a lower level of trade pay-
ables including supply chain finance (refer to 
note 3.6) and prepayments from customers. 
 
as part of managing the challenges during 2020 
we took the following actions during the year re-
lated to the managing of inventories: 
 
■ ensuring a sound inventory turn with a strict fo-
cus on inventory ageing 
■ clear split between inventory specifically dedi-
cated for orders and inventory available for 
sale 
 
the active measures taken during 2020 reduced 
the inventory level by the end of the year. 
 
on the trade receivables we managed the in-
creased credit risk by taking the following actions 
during the year, which all contributed to a strong 
cash collection during 2020 and a reduced trade 
receivables balance by the end of 2020: 
 
■ reassessment of customer payment terms 
■ renegotiation of payment terms with our large 
project customers and suppliers where the 
cash flows were imbalanced 
■ increased focus on cash collection 
 
currency impacts reduced the net working capi-
tal balance at 31 december 2020 by dkk 158m. 
 
the reclassification of assets and liabilities to 
held for sale has reduced the net working capital 
by dkk 71m (2019: dkk 0m).

inventory level has decreased 14% in 2020 due 
to high focus on cash management and less pro-
duction to orders at year-end compared to last 
year.  
 
accounting policy 
inventories are measured at cost based on 
weighted average cost prices. 
 
in the event that cost of inventories exceeds the 
expected selling price less cost of completion 
and selling costs, the inventories are impaired to 
the lower net realisable value. the net realisable 
value of inventories is measured as the expected 
sales price less costs of completion and costs to 
finalise the sale. 
 
 
 
key accounting estimates 
estimated valuation of inventories 
when assessing the net realisable value of inventories we take marketability, obsolescence 
and development in expected selling prices into account. also inventory turnover, quantities 
and the nature and condition of the inventory items including the classification as strategic in-
ventory are considered in the assessment. we include all of these factors as relevant, to en-
sure that our inventory is reflected at the value to which we expect to realise it to in the future, 
if lower than cost. 
 
during 2020 we have applied a consistent methodology to assess the need for any inventory 
impairments. the covid-19 disruptions to the value chain have been considered in the valua-
tion of inventories.

3.2 inventories – continued 
impairment assessment of the inventory is per-
formed item by item including: 
 
■ test for slow moving stock 
■ test for aging of inventory 
■ assessment of expected market (pricing and 
market potential) 
■ assessment of strategic inventory items 
 
obsolete items are impaired to the value of zero. 
management considers part of the inventories as 
strategic. strategic items are held in inventory, 
even if slow moving, because they are consid-
ered key equipment to the customers, that we 
need to be able to deliver with very short notice. 
 
raw materials and consumables include pur-
chase costs of materials and consumables, du-
ties and freight. work in progress, finished goods 
and goods for resale include cost of manufactur-
ing including materials consumed and labour 
costs plus an allowance for production over-
heads. production overheads include operating 
costs, maintenance of production facilities as well 
as administration and factory management di-
rectly related to manufacturing. 
3.3 trade receivables  
our trade receivables relate to the sale of both 
service and capital business. 
 
trade receivables net of impairment are speci-
fied according to ageing as follows:

accounting policy 
trade receivables are initially measured at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. 
 
a credit loss allowance is made upon initial 
recognition based on historical observed default 
rates adjusted for forward looking estimates. the 
cost of the credit loss allowances is included in 
administration costs. a loss is considered real-
ised when it is certain that we will not recover the 
receivable, e.g. in case of bankruptcy or similar. 
 
 
key accounting estimates 
estimated level of expected losses 
when estimating the level of receivables 
that in the future is expected not to be 
collected we take the following infor-
mation into account; historical losses on 
receivables, ageing of the receivables, 
access to payment securities and possi-
bilities to off-set assets against claims. 
when doing the assessment we also 
evaluate the expected development in 
macro-economic and political environ-
ments that could impact the recoverabil-
ity. 
 
with the uncertainties in 2020 we have 
made estimates of our expectation to the 
future losses on receivables by applying 
a consistent methodology. the calcula-
tion of expected credit losses (ecl) incor-
porate forward-looking estimates. these 
estimates are mainly based on historical 
input, but due to the current unprecedent 
situation the forward-looking estimate in-
cludes more uncertainty as no objective 
data exists.  
 
the forward-looking estimate has in-
creased compared to the end of 2019. 
the increase is based on an assessment 
of a deterioration in credit risk in an un-
certain global market due to the length 
and magnitude of the pandemic.

the work in progress balance can change from 
being presented as an asset in one period to be-
ing presented as a liability in the next period de-
pending on the project execution plan and in-
voicing structure for each transaction. 
 
in addition to the invoicing on account to custom-
ers we have received prepayments from custom-
ers of dkk 1,266m (2019: dkk 1,768m), which are 
recognised separately in the balance sheet as 
current and non-current liabilities. 
 
when assessing impairment on the work in pro-
gress net balances we evaluate on a project by 
project basis. if an impairment on a project is 
probable we recognise the expected loss and a 
related provision. 
accounting policy 
work in progress consists of contract assets and 
contract liabilities for contracts with customers 
where revenue is recognised over time.  
 
the contracts recognised as work in progress 
are recognised as revenue when the outcome of 
the contracts can be estimated reliably. 
 
the percentage of completion is calculated 
based on a cost-to-cost basis (input method) and 
is the ratio between the cost incurred and the to-
tal estimated cost. 
 
the contracts are measured at the selling price 
of the work performed less progress billings and 
expected losses. 
 
the selling price is the total expected income 
from the individual contracts. if variability is in-
cluded in the selling price we use the most likely 
amount method. 
 
an expected loss is recognised when it is 
deemed probable that the total contract costs 
will exceed the total revenue from individual con-
tracts. the expected loss is recognised immedi-
ately as a cost and a provision. 
 
when the selling price of the work performed ex-
ceeds progress billings and expected losses, 
work in progress is presented as an asset. 
 
when progress billings and expected losses ex-
ceed the selling price of the work performed, 
work in progress is presented as a liability. 
 
prepayments from customers are recognised as 
a liability. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
key accounting estimates 
estimated total cost to complete 
we estimate the total expected costs for our contracts. the estimates primarily relate to the 
level of contingencies to cover unforeseen costs, such as cost changes due to changes in fu-
ture supplies of raw materials, subcontractor products and services as well as unforeseen 
costs related to execution and hand-over. 
 
the estimates are based on the specifics for each contract while taking historical data into ac-
count. for contracts sold to customers in politically and economically unstable countries, the 
estimates include additional risk coverage due to a higher level of uncertainty. 
 
with the added complexity to project management and project execution during 2020, the un-
predictable development in the imposed restrictions and the challenges throughout the value 
chain has made the cost forecasts more uncertain as we haven’t been able to rely on historical 
data to the same extent as usual. we have based on a project by project review assessed in-
creases in expected cost as well as additional risk contingencies to cover the higher uncer-
tainty. 
 
estimated variable transaction price 
the selling price in operation & maintenance contracts is usually dependent on the productiv-
ity of the plant. we estimate the productivity of the plant and the estimates are based on the 
specific conditions of the individual contract as well as historical levels of productivity. 
 
during 2020 the site restrictions and operations running at reduced capacity has imposed un-
certainty to the estimate of the variable transaction price and the historical levels of productiv-
ity has been used as basis to a lower extent than usual. instead estimates have been based on 
most likely scenarios for site accessibility and productivity levels, while ensuring safety precau-
tions are met. 
 
the site and travel restrictions combined with a more difficult supply chain has also imposed 
uncertainty to meeting contractual obligations in a timely manner which has caused a risk of 
penalties. we have based on a project by project review assessed the risk of penalties and 
means to reduce the risk.

3.6 trade payables  
to improve the relationship with our suppliers 
and minimise the finance cost in the value chain, 
we facilitate a supply chain financing programme 
hosted by a credit institute. when participating in 
this programme, the supplier has the option to 
receive early payment from the credit institution 
based on the invoices approved by us through a 
factoring arrangement between the supplier and 
the credit institution, where the invoices are 
transferred to the credit institution without re-
course. 
 
the amounts payable to suppliers included in the 
supply chain financing programme are classified 
as trade payables in the balance sheet as well as 
in the cash flow statement (working capital within 
cash flow from operations). the trade payables 
covered by the supply chain financing pro-
gramme arise in the ordinary course of business 
from supply of goods and services and 
amounted to dkk 273m at 31 december 2020 
(2019: dkk 1,083m). utilisation of supply chain fi-
nancing decreased during 2020, driven by a 
combination of the lower level of activity and by 
a lower share of cement business relative to 
mining.

4.1 income tax  
 
the income tax expense for the year amounted 
to dkk 155m (2019: dkk 373m), corresponding 
to an effective tax rate of 40.7% (2019: 31.9%). 
the increase in the effective tax rate was related 
to additional beat tax in the us, reduced credit 
relief for paid withholding taxes and impairment 
of deferred tax assets. 
 
uncertain tax positions reflect the annual assess-
ment by management of the risk of a position 
taken by the group being disputed by a tax au-
thority. the assessment considers the inherent 
risk and uncertainty of undertaking complex pro-
jects and operating in a variety of developed and 
developing countries. the assessment includes 
the most likely outcome of both ongoing and po-
tential future tax audits. 
 
accounting policy 
tax for the year comprises current tax and 
changes in deferred tax including valuation of 
deferred tax assets, adjustments to previous 
years, foreign paid withholding taxes including 
available credit relief and changes in provisions 
for uncertain tax positions. 
 
tax is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement with the share attributable to the 
profit/loss of the year, and in other comprehen-
sive income with the share attributable to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income.  
exchange rate adjustments of deferred tax are 
included as part of the year's adjustments to  
deferred tax. 
 
current tax comprises tax calculated on the basis 
of the expected taxable income for the year, us-
ing the applicable tax rates for the financial year. 
 
uncertain tax positions are measured at the 
amount estimated to be required to settle such 
potential future obligations. we measure these 
uncertain tax positions on a yearly basis through 
interviews with key stakeholders in the main 
group entities. 
 
the measurement addresses the accounting for 
income taxes when tax treatments involve uncer-
tainty that affects the application of ias 12 and 
ifric 23.  
 
we will determine whether to consider each un-
certain tax treatment separately or together with 
one or more other uncertain tax treatments. the 
approach that better predicts the resolution of 
the uncertainty will be followed. uncertain tax po-
sitions are measured at the most likely outcome 
method. 
 
the liability is recognised under income tax liabil-
ities or deferred tax liabilities, depending in how 
the realisation of the tax position will affect the fi-
nancial statements. 
 
tax receivables and tax liabilities comprise tax on 
expected taxable income less tax paid on ac-
count in the year and previous years taxes. cur-
rent tax is recognised in the balance sheet as ei-
ther a receivable or a liability.  
4.2 paid income tax  
income tax paid in 2020 amounted to dkk 368m 
(2019: dkk 311m). most of these payments are at-
tributable to group enterprises in the countries 
shown in the graph on page 95. 
 
besides income tax, group activities generate 
sales taxes, customs duties, personal income 
taxes paid by the employees, etc. which are ex-
cluded from income tax.

4.3 deferred tax  
deferred tax assets end of 2020 amount to dkk 
1,248m (2019: dkk 1,246m) and deferred tax lia-
bilities amount to dkk 200m (2019: dkk 352m). 
the net deferred tax assets amount to dkk 
1,048m (2019: dkk 894m). 
 
deferred tax assets valued at nil amounting to 
dkk 189m (2019: dkk 165m) relate to tax losses 
and tax assets mainly in discontinued and 
dormant entities.  
temporary differences regarding future repatria-
tion of profit from entities in foreign countries are 
estimated at dkk 300-350m in 2020 (2019: dkk

these liabilities are not recognised because the

the deferred tax assets in germany and den-
mark are not fully recognized as, based on man-
agement’s forecast earnings, the tax assets are 
not likely to be fully utilized within the next five 
years. 
the impairment of tax asset in germany amounts 
to dkk 105m (2019: dkk 99m) and relates to dis-
continued activities and dormant entities. the im-
pairment of tax asset in denmark amounts to 
dkk 25m (2019: dkk 3m) and relates to the ex-
pected slow recovery in cement from the pan-
demic. the impairment of tax assets is a key ac-
counting estimate and is based on manage-
ment’s forecast earnings incorporating cost sav-
ings and the recovery of the market. 
 
accounting policy 
deferred tax is calculated using the balance 
sheet liability method on all temporary differ-
ences between the carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes, except differences relating to 
initial recognition of goodwill. deferred tax is cal-
culated based on the applicable tax rates for the 
individual financial years. 
 
the effect of changes in the tax rates is stated in 
the income statement unless they are items pre-
viously entered in the statement of other com-
prehensive income. 
the tax value of losses that are more likely than 
not to be available for utilisation against future 
taxable income in the same legal tax unit and ju-
risdiction is included in the measurement of de-
ferred tax. 
 
if companies in the group have deferred tax lia-
bilities, they are valued independently of the time 
when the tax, if any, becomes payable. 
 
a deferred tax liability is recognised to cover re-
taxation of losses in foreign enterprises if shares 
in the enterprises concerned are likely to be sold 
and to cover expected additional future tax liabili-
ties related to the financial year or previous 
years. no deferred tax liabilities regarding invest-
ments in subsidiaries are recognised if the 
shares are unlikely to be sold in the short-term. 
 
deferred tax assets/liabilities and tax receiva-
bles/payables are offset if the group: has a legal 
right to offset these, intends to settle these on a 
net basis or to realise the assets and settle the li-
abilities simultaneously. 
 
4.4 tax on other 
comprehensive income  
deferred tax of other comprehensive income 
dkk -6m (2019: dkk 29m) includes assets held 
for sale of dkk 0m (2019:dkk 0m). 
4.5 our approach to tax 
and tax risk  
being a responsible taxpayer is important to us, 
and this means that we will pay the correct 
amount of taxes at the right time in all countries 
where we do business. we strive to accomplish 
this by having a strong focus on compliance with 
applicable tax laws as well as generally agreed 
principles of international taxation. we are a 
global company undertaking complex projects 
and operating in a variety of developed and de-
veloping economies. inherent risk and uncer-
tainty in regards to compliance requirements and 
double taxation are common issues faced by our 
business. we actively work to identify and miti-
gate tax risk and uncertainties. 
 
our group tax policy, which has been approved 
by the board of directors of flsmidth, is availa-
ble on: 
https://www.flsmidth.com/en-gb/company/sus-
tainability/policies-and-priorities 
 
 
key accounting estimates 
estimated value of deferred tax assets 
the value of deferred tax assets is recognised to the extent that it is deemed likely that taxable 
income in the future can utilise the tax losses. for this purpose the income from the coming 
five years is estimated, based on budgets.  
 
in assessing the probability of the future realisation of deferred tax assets, we have considered 
the deterioration of the economic outlook in our budgets of taxable profits and reversals of 
taxable temporary differences. with the changing regional restrictions it has been more diffi-
cult to predict the level of business activity and earnings in the jurisdictions and the expected 
utilization of deferred tax assets against future taxable income.

shares 
share capital is dkk 1,025m and the total num-
ber of authorised and issued shares is 
51,250,000, which is unchanged from last year. 
each share entitles the holder to 20 votes and no 
shares have special rights attached to it.

terest above 10%:  
 
■ lundbeckfond invest a/s, denmark. 
 
no shareholders have reported a participating in-
terest above 5%.  
 
capital structure 
we take a conservative approach to capital struc-
ture, with the emphasis on relatively low debt, 
gearing and financial risk. 
 
the board of directors’ priority for capital struc-
ture and capital allocation is as follows: 
 
■ well-capitalised (nibd/ebitda < two) 
■ stable dividends (30-50% of net profit) 
■ invest in organic growth 
■ value adding mergers and acquisitions 
■ share buyback or special dividend 
 
for further information please refer to share-
holder information section page 56. 
 
treasury shares 
our holding of treasury shares at the end of 
2020 accounted for 2.1% of the share capital 
(2019: 2.3%). 
 
the board of directors is authorised until the 
next annual general meeting to let the company 
acquire treasury shares up to a total nominal 
value of 10% of the company’s share capital in 
accordance with section 12 of the danish com-
panies act. 
 
the treasury shares are used to hedge employ-
ees’ exercise of share-based incentive pro-
grammes, and are recognised directly in equity in 
retained earnings (zero value in the balance 
sheet). 
 
dividend per share  
the board of directors will propose at the annual 
general meeting that a dividend of dkk 2 per 
share (2019: dkk 0) corresponding to a dividend 
yield of 0.9% (2019: 0%) and a pay-out ratio of 
50% (2019: 0%) be distributed for 2020. 
 
due to the uncertain market and financial condi-
tions in the first half year of 2020, last year’s pro-
posed dividend of dkk 8 per share was with-
drawn before the annual general meeting held 
on 26 june 2020. no dividend was paid in 2020.

earnings per share from continuing activities de-
creased to dkk 5.1 in 2020 (2019: dkk 15.9) pri-
marily driven by reduced profit for the year. earn-
ings per share from discontinued activities 
remained at dkk -0.4 in 2020 (2019: dkk -0.4). 
there is no dilutive effect of share options in the 
money in 2020 (2019: 0.2%). 
 
as of 31 december 2020 number of share op-
tions in-the money totalled zero (2019: 98,545). 
5.3 financial risks  
due to the international activities and the indus-
try characteristics, risks are an embedded part of 
doing business. we are exposed to financial 
risks, that can have a material impact to the finan-
cial statements of the group. 
 
the financial risks are to the extent possible 
managed centrally for the group and are gov-
erned by the treasury policy, which is approved 
by the board of directors. the treasury policy is 
updated on an annual basis to address  
any changes in the risk picture. 
 
the main financial risks that we are exposed to 
include currency, credit, interest and liquidity 
risks. 
 
financial markets risks increased for a few 
months in the beginning of 2020. however, 
when considering currency and interest rate risks 
we are back to normal levels, and our hedging 
models have been resilient throughout covid-
19. 
 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risks arise from interest-bearing as-
sets and liabilities. interest-bearing items consist 
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, bank 
loans and mortgage debt.  
 
according to the treasury policy, hedging of in-
terest rates is governed by a duration range and 
is managed by using derivatives such as interest 
rate swaps. no interest derivatives have been 
used during 2019 or 2020. 
as of 31 december 2020, the majority of our in-
terest-bearing debt is carrying a floating rate. 
 
all other things being equal, a 1% point increase 
in the interest rate will increase our interest cost 
by dkk 18m (2019: dkk 25m), calculated as 1% of 
the net interest bearing debt as of 31 december 
2020. 
 
the reduction is directly related to our increased 
focus on operational cashflow during 2020, 
where we have been able to reduce net interest-
bearing debt by dkk 684m. 
 
currency risk 
the objective of the treasury policy is to reduce 
the most significant currency risks to better pre-
dict the impact to the income statement as well 
as the cash flows to be paid or received. the 
risks are managed through hedging activities by 
entering into commonly used derivatives such as 
forward contracts. the currency risks arise pri-
marily from purchase and sale in foreign curren-
cies compared to the functional currency of each 
of the group entities. 
 
the treasury policy sets forth thresholds and re-
quirements for the hedging strategy to be ap-
plied. hedge accounting is applied for the largest 
project transactions. for other project transac-
tions the currency risk is either not hedged or 
economically hedged, dependent on the signifi-
cance of the risk. 
 
we are, to a large extent, carrying out transac-
tions in eur and usd as these hard currencies 
are preferred in the mining and cement indus-
tries. eur against dkk is currently not consid-
ered an exposure due to the danish kroner be-
ing pegged to the euro.

the project nature of the business changes the 
foreign currency risk picture towards and against 
specific currencies from one year to another, de-
pending on the area in which we have activities.

bles, exposures and interest rates in particular, 
remain constant.

the sensitivity analysis shows the gain/loss on 
net profit for the year and other comprehensive 
income of a 5% percent increase in the specified 
currencies towards dkk. the analysis includes 
the transactional impact from monetary items 
and derivatives. 
 
the impact on net profit for the year includes fi-
nancial instruments in foreign currencies that are 
currency adjusted through the income statement 
as well as any derivatives used for economic 
hedging. 
 
the impact on other comprehensive income in-
cludes the value adjustment on derivatives des-
ignated as hedge accounting. 
 
in addition to the transactional effects, in the 
event of currency developments, we will also be 
impacted by translation effects from the group 
entities with net assets in functional currencies 
other than danish kroner and euro. a 5 % in-
crease in the specified currencies towards dan-
ish kroner will have the following effect on other 
comprehensive income. 
 
the emergence of the covid-19 virus as it 
spread across the world has increased exchange 
rate volatility during 2020 by disrupting capital 
flows. this has had an negative impact on many 
emerging market currencies and countries more 
adversely affected by the pandemic. in a number 
of cases, the sensitivity analysis defined has ma-
terialised as the relative strength of the eur has 
seen the currency appreciate over 5% against a 
number of currencies in countries flsmidth op-
erate in. this has resulted in a large fx transla-
tion loss on equity of dkk 832m. 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risks arising from cash 
and cash equivalents, derivatives and receiva-
bles including work in progress. 
 
the treasury policy sets forth authority limits for 
the credit risk exposure related to cash and cash 
equivalents as well as derivatives. the limits are 
based on the counterparty credit rating. we have 
entered into netting agreements with the coun-
terparties used for trading of derivatives, which 
means that the credit risk for derivatives is limited 
to the net assets per counterparty. 
 
we aim at using banks of high quality in the 
countries we operate in. however, due to the na-
ture of our business and operations in emerging 
markets, we are sometimes exposed to banks 
where the credit rating and quality can be lower 
than what we typically see in developed coun-
tries. 
 
for commercial risks the credit risks are gov-
erned by credit risk policy. for receivables the 
credit risk is managed by continuous risk assess-
ments and credit evaluations of customers and 
trading partners; having country specific risk fac-
tors in mind. to the extent possible, the credit 
risks are mitigated through use of payment secu-
rities, such as letters of credit and guarantees is-
sued by first class rated banks, or by securing 
positive cash flow throughout the project execu-
tion. at the end of 2020, 17% (2019: 26%) of our 
work in progress asset and 6% (2019: 7%) of our 
trade receivables balance were covered by pay-
ment securities. 
 
our customers and trading partners mainly con-
sists of companies within the cement and mining 
industry. credit risk is among other things de-
pendent on the development in these industries. 
given our diverse global footprint and the ongo-
ing covid-19 situation, it is difficult to fully deter-
mine the exposure to increasing credit risk re-
lated to our receivables and work in progress. 
the varying responses, mitigations and contain-
ment of the pandemic across governments has 
increased volatility and uncertainty. our focus on 
processes related to invoicing and cash collec-
tion during 2020, which will continue in 2021, has 
mitigated some of the credit risk. for the ex-
pected credit loss refer to note 3.3 trade receiv-
ables. 
 
at 31 december 2020 total credit risk was meas-
ured as dkk 7,455m (2019: dkk 9,596m). 
 
we consider the maximum credit risk to financial 
counterparties to be dkk 981m (2019: dkk 
1,003m). all financial assets, excluding other se-
curities and investments, are expected to be set-
tled during 2021.

they become due.  
 
the financial resources are continuously moni-
tored and consist of cash and cash equivalents 
and undrawn committed facilities. 
 
during 2019, our dkk 5bn club deal was re-
financed, and in 2020 a 1-year extension-option 
within was exercised, extending the expiry to 
2026. in 2020, a new facility of dkk 500m was 
established to ensure sufficient funds as a pre-
caution to the covid-19 situation. however, a 
strong cashflow focus by the business has meant 
that at the end of 2020, none of the dkk 500m 
was utilised. total committed facilities by the end 
of 2020 was dkk 6,970m (2019: dkk 6,486m), of 
which dkk 2,251m (2019: dkk 2,893m) was uti-
lised. the committed facilities will mature during 
the years 2022-2026. short-term liquidity risks 
are managed through a cash pool in various cur-
rencies and by having short-term overdraft facili-
ties in place with various financial institutions, 
mainly on a committed basis, but also through 
uncommitted facilities.  
 
according to the treasury policy the available fi-
nancial resources must not be lower than dkk 
2bn at any point. the liquidity position is moni-
tored daily. as of 31 december 2020, the finan-
cial resources are well above the threshold. 
 
the committed facilities contain standard clauses 
such as pari passu, negative pledge, change of 
control and a leverage financial covenant. the 
group did not default or fail to fulfil any of its fi-
nancial covenants, in neither 2019 nor 2020. 
 
having activities in various emerging markets im-
plies additional risks due to specific restrictions 
and requirements. mitigating actions are there-
fore considered on a case-by-case basis. it re-
quires thorough dedicated efforts to reduce re-
lated risks to an acceptable level. 
 
restricted cash  
cash and cash equivalents included cash with 
currency restrictions. the cash, amounting to 
dkk 781m (2019: dkk 824m), is part of the daily 
operations and is not restricted to flsmidth.

foreign exchange adjustments, net of hedging 
effect, amounted to dkk 11m (2019: dkk -43m), 
primarily related to the cost of hedging the loan 
portfolio to the functional currency of the borrow-
ing entity (forward points) and exposures in non-
hedgeable emerging market currencies, as well 
as timing differences between cash flows and 
hedges. 
 
the net interest cost totalled dkk 48m (2019: 
dkk 53m) related to loans and deposits. 
lease interest cost amounted to dkk 11m (2019: 
dkk 12m). 
 
fair value adjustment of shares of net dkk 1m 
(2019: dkk -10m) relates to shareholdings in ce-
ment companies. 
 
accounting policy 
financial income and costs comprise interest in-
come and costs, realised and unrealised foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising from mone-
tary items, and fair value adjustments of shares 
and derivatives where hedge accounting is not 
applied. 
 
5.5 derivatives  
economic hedge 
we use derivatives to hedge currency risks aris-
ing from monetary items recognised in the bal-
ance sheet. 
 
fair value adjustments recognised in financial 
items in the income statement amounted to dkk 
-48m (2019: dkk 28m). at 31 december 2020 the  
fair value of our hedge agreements that are not 
recognised as hedge accounting amounted to 
dkk 1m (2019: dkk -11m).  
 
cash flow hedge 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge 
currency risks regarding expected future cash 
flows that meet the criteria for cash flow hedging.

5.5 derivatives  
– continued 
the fair value reserve of the derivatives is recog-
nised in other comprehensive income until the 
hedged items are included in work in progress. 
the fair value of derivatives is recognised in 
other receivables and other liabilities. the major-
ity of the cash flow hedge instruments are ex-
pected to settle and affect the income statement 
within one year. 
 
at 31 december 2020, the fair value of our cash 
flow hedge instruments amounted to dkk 29m 
(2019: dkk -7m).

accounting policy 
derivatives are initially recognised in the balance 
sheet at fair value and subsequently measured at 
fair value. fair value of derivatives is included in 
other receivables or other liabilities respectively. 
 
fair value changes of derivatives used for cash 
flow hedging are recognised in other compre-
hensive income. 
 
any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges 
are recognised as a financial item. upon settle-
ment of the cash flow hedges, the fair value is 
transferred from other comprehensive income 
into the line item of the hedged item. 
 
any changes in the fair value of derivatives not 
used for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as financial items. 
 
certain contracts contain conditions that corre-
spond to derivatives. in case the embedded de-
rivatives deviate significantly from the overall 
contract, they are recognised and measured as 
separate instruments at fair value. that is unless 
the contract concerned as a whole is recognised 
and measured at fair value.  
 
5.6 fair value 
measurement  
financial instruments measured at fair value are 
measured on a recurring basis and categorised 
into the following levels of the fair value hierar-
chy: 
 
■ level 1: observable market prices for identical 
instruments 
■ level 2: valuation techniques primarily based 
on observable prices or traded prices for com-
parable instruments 
■ level 3: valuation techniques primarily based 
on unobservable prices 
 
securities and investments measured at fair 
value through profit/loss are either measured at 
quoted prices in an active market for the same 
type of instrument (level 1) or at fair value based 
on available data (level 3).  
 
hedging instruments are not traded on an active 
market based on quoted prices. measured in-
stead using a valuation technique, where all sig-
nificant inputs are based on observable market 
data; such as exchange rates, interest rates, 
credit risk and volatilities (level 2).  
 
there have been no transfers between the levels 
in 2020 or 2019.

5.8 financial assets  
and liabilities 
all financial assets and liabilities, except for 
hedging instruments, securities and investments, 
are measured at cost and amortised cost. the 
carrying amount for these is an approximation of 
fair value. 
 
the financial assets are classified based on the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the finan-
cial asset as well as our intention with the finan-
cial asset according to our business model. 
 
if cash flows from a financial asset are solely pay-
ments of principal and interests the classification 
is either: 
 
■ amortised cost, for financial assets, where the 
objective is to hold the financial asset to collect 
the contractual cash flows 
■ fair value through profit/loss, for other financial 
assets 
 
hedging instruments designated as hedge ac-
counting are classified separately and are meas-
ured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income.

6.1 share-based payment  
accounting policy 
we have established two different share-based 
incentive schemes; a share option programme 
and a performance share programme. both of 
the share-incentive schemes are classified as eq-
uity based, as the schemes settle in shares. 
 
the value of the services received in exchange 
for the granting of options and performance 
share units is measured as the fair value of the 
option and performance share unit, respectively. 
 
the share options and performance share units 
(psus) are measured at fair value at granting and 
are recognised in staff cost in the income state-
ment and in equity over the vesting period. 
 
on initial recognition of the share options/psus, 
the number of options/psus expected to vest are 
estimated. subsequently, the estimate is revised 
so that the total cost recognised is based on the 
actual number of options/psus expected to vest. 
the fair value of the share options is estimated 
using an option pricing model (black-scholes). in 
determining the fair value, the terms and condi-
tions related to the share options granted are 
taken into account. the fair value of the psus is 
determined based on the quoted share price. 
 
share options 
executive management and a number of key em-
ployees in the group have been granted options 
to purchase 544,246 shares in the company at a 
set price (strike price). 
 
the calculated fair values in connection with allo-
cation are based on the black & scholes model 
for valuation of options. the calculation takes 
into account the terms and conditions under 
which the share options are allocated. year of al-
location, strike price and exercise period for the 
individual allocations are shown in the table. 
 
in 2020, the recognised fair value of share op-
tions in the consolidated income statement 
amounts to dkk 0m (2019: dkk 0m). the calcula-
tion of average weighted fair value and strike 
prices per option is based on a dividend of dkk 
0 (2019: dkk 9) in the exercise period.

6.1 share-based payment 
– continued 
performance-shares 
in march 2016, the share-based programmes 
were revised. the share options programme was 
replaced by a long-term incentive programme. 
 
the long term incentive programme is based on 
a three year performance period and perfor-
mance measurement based on key financial per- 
formance indicators as ebita and net working 
capital as well as continued employment. the 
purpose of introducing the performance share 
programme is to ensure common goals for 
group executive management, key employees 
and shareholders. 
 
fair value is based on the market price. market 
price is not adjusted for dividend as participants 
of the programme will be compensated for any 
dividend pay-outs in the performance period. 
 
for the 2020 plan, 52,242 shares (2019: 36,640 
shares) pertain to executive management at the 
grant date. 
 
in 2020, the recognised fair value of perfor-
mance shares in the consolidated income state-
ment amounted to an income of dkk 21m (2019: 
dkk -13m). 
 
an income is recognised as it is expected that fi-
nancial kpis will not be achieved for two of the 
share incentive programmes related to perfor-
mance share units, hence the costs previously 
recognised have been reversed. 
 
the total number of outstanding performance 
shares at 31 december 2020 was 478,038 of 
which 114,174 performance shares are expected 
to vest.

ance services to the group, dkk 1m (2019: dkk

6.4 events after the 
balance sheet date  
effective 1 january 2021, we have divested our 
möller pneumatic conveying systems business. 
the divestment is part of the ongoing process to 
simplify flsmidth’s cement business. as per 31 
december 2020 the balances related to the di-
vestment was classified as held for sale in the 
balance sheet. a revaluation of the balances was 
made in december 2020 to reflect the net assets 
held for sale at fair value less cost to sell and, 
therefore, the loss arising from the sale was al-
ready recognised in 2020. 
 
on 15 january 2021, flsmidth announced that 
we are in negotiations with thyssenkrupp con-
cerning an acquisition of thyssenkrupp's mining 
business. the negotiations are at a non-binding 
stage. accordingly, there can be no assurances 
as to whether and when a transaction will tran-
spire. 
 
we are not aware of any other subsequent mat-
ters, that could be of material importance to the 
group’s financial position.

7.1 introduction  
this section provides an overview of our princi-
pal accounting policies, key accounting esti-
mates and judgements as well as new and 
amended ifrs standards and interpretations.  
 
the following sections provide an overall de-
scription of the accounting policies applied to the 
consolidated financial statements. we provide a 
more detailed description of the accounting poli-
cies and key estimates and judgements in the 
notes.  
 
the descriptions of accounting policies in the 
statements and notes form part of the overall de-
scription of accounting policies. 
 
the annual report has been approved by the 
board of directors at its meeting 10 february 
2021. the annual report will be presented to the 
shareholders of flsmidth & co. a/s for approval 
at the annual general meeting. 
 
 
7.2 basis of preparation  
the consolidated financial statements of fls-
midth group have been prepared in accordance 
with ifrs as adopted by the eu and further re-
quirements in the danish financial statements 
act. we have prepared the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with all the ifrs stand-
ards effective at 31 december 2020. the finan-
cial year for the group is january 1 – december 
31. 
 
the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis and under 
the historical cost convention, except for deriva-
tives and securities, which are measured at fair 
value. the accounting policies are unchanged 
from last year except from changes included in 
note 7.6. 
 
 
7.3 defining materiality  
our annual report is based on the concept of ma-
teriality, to ensure that the content is material and 
relevant to the readers. the consolidated finan-
cial statements consist of many transactions. 
these transactions are aggregated into classes 
according to their nature or function, and pre-
sented in classes of similar items in the financial 
statements and in the notes as required by ifrs. 
if items are individually immaterial, they are ag-
gregated with other items of a similar nature in 
the statements or in the notes.  
 
the disclosure requirements throughout ifrs are 
substantial, and we provide the specific disclo-
sures required by ifrs unless the information is 
considered immaterial to the economic decision-
making of the readers of these financial state-
ments. 
 
 
7.4 alternative 
performance measures  
we present financial measures in the consoli-
dated financial statements which are not defined 
according to ifrs. we use these alternative per-
formance measures (apm) as we believe that 
these financial measures provide valuable infor-
mation to our stakeholders and management. 
the financial measures should not be considered 
as a replacement for performance measures as 
defined under ifrs, but rather as supplementary 
information.  
 
the alternative performance measures may not 
be comparable to similarly titled measures pre-
sented by other companies, as the definitions 
and calculations may be different. our definitions 
of the financial measures are included in note 7.8 
definition of terms. 
 
we use several alternative performance 
measures throughout the report. the most com-
monly used are: 
 
growth 
we use different alternative performance 
measures related to growth, such as order in-
take, order backlog and growth. we use these 
measures in the daily management of our busi-
ness, as order intake and order backlog are part 
of the main indicators of our future activity level.  
 
profit 
we use different alternative performance 
measures related to profit, such as ebit, ebita 
and ebitda. ebita is a measure which is com-
monly used within the industry and included in 
our calculation of return of capital employed.  
 
cash flow 
we use different alternative performance 
measures related to cash flow, such as free cash 
flow. we use free cash flow to measure how 
much cash we generate from our operations af-
ter maintaining our capital employed.  
 
financial position 
we use different alternative performance 
measures related to the financial position, such 
as capital employed, net working capital and net 
interest-bearing debt. capital employed and net 
working capital are included in our calculation of 
return of capital employed. net working capital is 
also a measure we use in the daily management 
of our business, as it is closely related to the ac-
tivity. 
 
 
7.5 accounting policies  
the descriptions of accounting policies in the 
notes form part of the overall description of ac-
counting policies. 
 
consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements comprise 
the financial statements of flsmidth & co. a/s 
(the parent company) and subsidiaries controlled 
by flsmidth & co. a/s, prepared in accordance 
with group accounting policies. the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared by combining 
items of a uniform nature and subsequently elimi-
nating intercompany transactions, internal share-
holdings and balances and unrealised intercom-
pany profits and losses. 
 
foreign currencies 
the consolidated financial statements are pre-
sented in danish kroner (dkk). 
 
foreign currency transactions are translated into 
the functional currency defined for each com-
pany using the prevailing exchange rates at the 
transaction date. monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into the func-
tional currency at the prevailing exchange rates 
at the reporting date. 
 
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into danish kroner at the prevailing 
 
flsmidth  ■  annual report 2020 
114 
 
consolidated financial statements           consolidated financial statements  
  
exchange rates at the reporting date for assets 
and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for 
income statement items. 
 
all exchange rate differences are recognised as 
financial income or financial costs, except for the 
following, that are recognised in other compre-
hensive income, translated at the prevailing ex-
change rates at the reporting date: 
 
■ translation of foreign subsidiaries’ net assets 
at the beginning of the year 
■ translation of foreign subsidiaries’ income 
statements from average exchange rates to 
the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date 
■ translation of long-term intercompany bal-
ances, which are considered to be an addition 
to net assets in subsidiaries. 
 
goodwill arising from the acquisition of new com-
panies is treated as an asset belonging to the 
new foreign subsidiaries and translated into dan-
ish kroner at prevailing exchange rates at the re-
porting date. 
 
unrealised gain/loss relating to hedging of future 
cash flow is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. 
 
 
7.6 impact from new ifrs  
we have implemented all new or amended ac-
counting standards and interpretations as 
adopted by the eu and applicable for the 2020 
financial year, including: 
 
■ amendments to references to the conceptual 
framework in ifrs standards (issued 2018, ef-
fective date 1 january 2020) 
■ amendments to ifrs 3, business combina-
tions (issued 2018, effective date 1 january 
2020) 
■ amendments to ias 1 and ias 8, definition of 
material (issued 2018, effective date 1 january 
2020) 
■ interest rate benchmark reform - amend-
ments to ifrs 9, ias 39 and ifrs 7 (issued 
2019, effective date 1 january 2020) 
■ amendment to ifrs 16, leases covid 19-re-
lated rent concessions (issued may 2020, ef-
fective date 1 june 2020) 
 
none of these have had a significant impact on 
the financial statements. 
7.7 new ifrs not yet 
adopted  
generally, we expect to implement all new or 
amended accounting standards and interpreta-
tions when they become mandatory and have 
been endorsed by the eu. iasb has issued new 
or amended accounting standards, which be-
come effective after 31 december 2020. the fol-
lowing amendments are relevant for flsmidth, 
but none of these are expected to have a signifi-
cant impact on the financial statements:

management review 
parent company flsmidth & co. a/s’ activities 
include holding of shares in group enterprises 
and the group’s treasury function. 
 
dividend from group enterprises to the parent 
company, flsmidth & co. a/s, was dkk 0m in 
2020 (2019: dkk 0m) and the profit for the year 
was dkk -6m (2019: dkk -42m).  
 
increase in financial income and cost is related 
to foreign exchange gains and losses. net fi-
nancial income is dkk 79m (2019: dkk 63m). 
 
the result is significantly impacted by write 
downs of investments in group enterprises. 
 
total assets at year-end amounted to dkk 
8,445m (2019: dkk 8,854m) and the equity was 
dkk 2,516m (2019: dkk 2,522m). management 
consider the result to be lower than expected.

result of annual impairment test 
as of 31 december 2020, the cost price of the in-
vestments in subsidiaries was tested for impair-
ment. the impairment test identified impairment 
charges for 2020 amounting to dkk 54m (2019: 
dkk 90m). the impairment was related to the 
subsidiary flsmidth global services a/s based 
on value in use. reversal of prior year’s impair-
ment amounted to dkk 7m (2019: dkk 0m). 
 
key assumptions 
the impairment test has been based on a five 
year forecast for flsmidth global services a/s. 
the applied discount rate after tax is 7.5% and 
reflects the latest market assumptions for the risk 
free rate based on a 10-year danish government 
bond, the equity risk premium and the cost of 
debt. 
the long-term growth rate for the terminal period 
is based on the expected growth in the world 
economy as well as input from current long-term 
swaps. based on these factors, a long-term an-
nual growth rate for the terminal period of 1.5% 
has been applied.

19. accounting policies  
– parent company  
accounting policy 
the financial statements of the parent company 
(flsmidth & co. a/s) are presented in conformity 
with the provisions of the danish financial state-
ments act for reporting class d enterprises. 
 
to ensure uniform presentation, the terminology 
used in the consolidated financial statements has 
as far as possible been applied in the parent 
company’s financial statements. the parent com-
pany’s accounting policies on recognition and 
measurement are generally consistent with those 
of the group. the instances in which the parent 
company’s accounting policies deviate from 
those of the group have been described below. 
 
the accounting policies for the parent company 
are unchanged from 2019. 
 
the company’s main activity, dividend income 
from group enterprises, is presented first in the 
income statement. 
 
dividend from group enterprises 
dividend from investments in subsidiaries is rec-
ognised as income in the parent company’s in-
come statement in the financial year in which the 
dividend is declared. this will typically be at the 
time of the approval by the annual general 
meeting of distribution from the company con-
cerned. when the dividend distributed exceeds 
the accumulated earnings after the date of acqui-
sition, the dividend is recognised in the income 
statement, however, this will trigger an impair-
ment test of the investment. 
 
 
property, plant and equipment 
depreciation is charged on a straight line basis 
over the estimated useful life of the assets until 
they reach the estimated residual value. in the 
parent company’s financial statements, the de-
preciation period and the residual value are de-
termined at the time of acquisition and are reas-
sessed every year. 
 
financial assets 
investments in group enterprises are measured 
at cost less impairment. where the cost exceeds 
the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised to this lower value. to the extent the 
distributed dividend exceeds the accumulated 
earnings after the date of acquisition, an impair-
ment test of the investment is triggered. 
 
 
other securities and investments 
other securities and investments consist of 
shares in cement plants that are acquired in con-
nection with the signing of contracts and are 
measured at fair value. value adjustments are 
recognised in the income statement as financial 
items. 
 
 
cash flow statement 
as the consolidated financial statements include 
a cash flow statement for the whole group, no in-
dividual statement for the parent company has 
been included, see the exemption provision, sec-
tion 86 of the danish financial statements act.

flows and financial position as well as a descrip-
tion of material risks and uncertainties that the

to the shareholders of  
flsmidth & co. a/s 
 
report on the audit of the 
consolidated financial 
statements and parent company 
financial statements 
 
opinion 
we have audited the consolidated financial state-
ments and the parent company financial state-
ments of flsmidth & co. a/s for the financial 
year 1 january – 31 december 2020, which com-
prise income statement, balance sheet, state-
ment of changes in equity and notes, including 
accounting policies, for the group and the parent 
company, and a consolidated statement of com-
prehensive income and a consolidated cash flow 
statement. the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with international fi-
nancial reporting standards as adopted by the 
eu and additional requirements of the danish fi-
nancial statements act, and the parent company 
financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with the danish financial statements act. 
 
in our opinion, the consolidated financial state-
ments give a true and fair view of the financial 
position of the group at 31 december 2020 and 
of the results of the group's operations and cash 
flows for the financial year 1 january – 31 decem-
ber 2020 in accordance with international finan-
cial reporting standards as adopted by the eu 
and additional requirements of the danish finan-
cial statements act. 
 
further, in our opinion the parent company finan-
cial statements give a true and fair view of the fi-
nancial position of the parent company at 31 de-
cember 2020 and of the results of the parent 
company's operations for the financial year 1 
january – 31 december 2020 in accordance with 
the danish financial statements act. 
 
our opinion is consistent with our long-form audit 
report to the audit committee and the board of 
directors. 
 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with inter-
national standards on auditing (isas) and addi-
tional requirements applicable in denmark. our 
responsibilities under those standards and re-
quirements are further described in the "auditor's 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements and the parent company fi-
nancial statements" (hereinafter collectively re-
ferred to as "the financial statements") section of 
our report. we believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
independence 
we are independent of the group in accordance 
with the international ethics standards board for 
accountants' code of ethics for professional ac-
countants (iesba code) and additional require-
ments applicable in denmark, and we have ful-
filled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these rules and requirements.  
to the best of our knowledge, we have not pro-
vided any prohibited non-audit services as de-
scribed in article 5(1) of regulation (eu) no. 
537/2014. 
 
appointment of auditor  
we were initially appointed as auditor of fls-
midth & co. a/s on 30 march 2017 for the finan-
cial year 2017. we have been reappointed annu-
ally by resolution of the general meeting for a 
total consecutive period of 4 years including the 
financial year 2020. 
 
key audit matters 
key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most signifi-
cance in our audit of the financial statements for 
the financial year 2020. these matters were ad-
dressed during our audit of the financial state-
ments as a whole and in forming our opinion 
thereon. we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. for each matter below, our de-
scription of how our audit addressed the matter 
is provided in that context. 
 
we have fulfilled our responsibilities described in 
the "auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements" section, including in relation 
to the key audit matters below. our audit in-
cluded the design and performance of proce-
dures to respond to our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the financial state-
ments. the results of our audit procedures, in-
cluding the procedures performed to address the 
matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the financial statements. 
 
accounting for projects 
the accounting principles and disclosures about 
revenue recognition related to projects are in-
cluded in notes 1.4, 2.7 and 3.4 to the consoli-
dated financial statements.  
 
flsmidth’s cement and mining industries deliver 
long term projects, which typically extends over 
more than one financial year. due to the nature 
of these projects and in accordance with the ac-
counting principles, flsmidth recognises and 
measures revenue from such long term projects 
over time based on the cost-to-cost method. 
 
accounting for projects involve significant man-
agement judgments in respect of estimating the 
cost to complete the projects, including risk con-
tingencies, warranties, liquidated damages, 
claims and the expected time to completion as 
well as the risk of credit losses. together with the 
impact from executing projects in parts of the 
world where macro-economic and political fac-
tors as well as covid-19 related challenges may 
have an adverse effect, changes in these esti-
mates during the execution of projects can signif-
icantly impact the revenue, cost and contribution 
recognised. accordingly, we considered the ac-
counting for projects to be a key audit matter for 
the consolidated financial statements. 
 
as part of our procedures, we obtained an un-
derstanding of the process for how project cost 
are estimated and risk evaluated. further, we 
evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of selected controls in this area. 
we evaluated the judgments made by manage-
ment regarding the estimated costs to complete

and the assumptions made in assessment of war-
ranty provisions. we evaluated the changes in 
estimated project cost and risk contingencies, 
and discussed these with project accounting, 
project management and group management. 
we evaluated management’s assessments re-
garding exposures related to claims and liqui-
dated damages for projects and provisions to 
mitigate contract-specific financial risks as well as 
the risk of credit losses. for those balances sub-
ject to claims, we made inquiries of external and 
internal legal counsel. we also assessed whether 
policies and processes for making these esti-
mates have been applied consistently to all con-
tracts of a similar nature. 
 
valuation of inventory 
the accounting principles and disclosures about 
inventory are included in note 3.2 to the consoli-
dated financial statements.  
 
flsmidth carries inventory in the balance sheet 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the 
inventory includes strategic items, which are held 
in inventory, even if slow moving, because they 
are considered key equipment for the customers 
that flsmidth needs to be able to deliver with 
very short notice. the valuation of inventory in-
volves significant management judgements to 
determine whether inventory is still technical rel-
evant when demand for the inventory items is ex-
pected. the current market conditions are also 
considered. accordingly, we considered this to 
be a key audit matter for the consolidated finan-
cial statements. 
 
as part of our procedures, we obtained an un-
derstanding of flsmidth's process for monitoring 
inventory and recording write-down for obsolete 
items. we analysed the inventory recorded in the 
balance sheet and obtained evidence regarding 
valuation of slow moving items. further, we eval-
uated management’s assessment of the ex-
pected market demand and expected sales price 
for significant aged items. 
 
valuation of trade receivables 
the accounting principles and disclosures about 
trade receivables are included in note 3.3 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
flsmidth carries trade receivables in the balance 
sheet at the amortised costs net of impairment 
losses, which is the original invoice amount less 
an estimated loss allowance for lifetime expected 
credit losses. flsmidth has significant trade re-
ceivables from a wide range of customers across 
the world. trade receivables include inherent risk 
of credit losses influenced by specific character-
istics and circumstances of the customer, e.g. the 
customer’s ability to pay, access to securities and 
payment guarantees, as well as the ageing of the 
receivable. the current market conditions and 
any country specific matters are also considered. 
accordingly, we considered this to be a key audit 
matter for the consolidated financial statements. 
 
as part of our procedures, we obtained an un-
derstanding of flsmidth's process for monitoring 
receivables and recording allowances for lifetime 
expected credit losses. we analysed the trade 
receivables recorded in the balance sheet and 
obtained evidence regarding the expected credit 
losses from items with particular risk characteris-
tics. we evaluated management’s assessment of 
recoverability particularly for significant aged 
items by corroborating them against internal and 
external evidence regarding the likelihood of 
payment and assessed flsmidth’s ability to 
make reliable estimates by performing retrospec-
tive analysis of past estimates. 
 
statement on the management's 
review  
management is responsible for the manage-
ment's review. 
 
our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the management's review, and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. 
 
in connection with our audit of the financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read the manage-
ment's review and, in doing so, consider whether 
the management's review is materially incon-
sistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the audit, or other-
wise appears to be materially misstated.  
 
moreover, it is our responsibility to consider 
whether the management's review provides the 
information required under the danish financial 
statements act.  
 
based on the work we have performed, we con-
clude that the management's review is in accord-
ance with the financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the danish financial statements act. we did not 
identify any material misstatement of the man-
agement's review. 
 
management's responsibilities 
for the financial statements 
management is responsible for the preparation 
of consolidated financial statements that give a 
true and fair view in accordance with interna-
tional financial reporting standards as adopted 
by the eu and additional requirements of the 
danish financial statements act and for the 
preparation of parent company financial state-
ments that give a true and fair view in accord-
ance with the danish financial statements act.  
 
moreover, management is responsible for such 
internal control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
in preparing the financial statements, manage-
ment is responsible for assessing the group's 
and the parent company's ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, mat-
ters related to going concern and using the go-
ing concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements unless management either 
intends to liquidate the group or the parent com-
pany or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

parent company financial statements           independent auditor’s report  
  
auditor's responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assur-
ance as to whether the financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an au-
ditor's report that includes our opinion. reasona-
ble assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in ac-
cordance with isas and additional requirements 
applicable in denmark will always detect a mate-
rial misstatement when it exists. misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements. 
 
as part of an audit conducted in accordance with 
isas and additional requirements applicable in 
denmark, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. we also: 
 
■ identify and assess the risks of material mis-
statement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks and ob-
tain audit evidence that is sufficient and appro-
priate to provide a basis for our opinion. the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one re-
sulting from error, as fraud may involve collu-
sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-
sentations or the override of internal control. 
■ obtain an understanding of internal control rel-
evant to the audit in order to design audit pro-
cedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's 
and the parent company's internal control. 
■ evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of ac-
counting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 
■ conclude on the appropriateness of manage-
ment's use of the going concern basis of ac-
counting in preparing the financial statements 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the group's and the parent compa-
ny's ability to continue as a going concern. if 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our audi-
tor's report to the related disclosures in the fi-
nancial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclu-
sions are based on the audit evidence ob-
tained up to the date of our auditor's report. 
however, future events or conditions may 
cause the group and the parent company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
■ evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
contents of the financial statements, including 
the note disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transac-
tions and events in a manner that gives a true 
and fair view. 
■ obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence re-
garding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the group to ex-
press an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. we are responsible for the direc-
tion, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. we remain solely responsible for our au-
dit opinion. 
 
we communicate with those charged with gov-
ernance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi-
cant audit findings, including any significant defi-
ciencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit. 
 
we also provide those charged with governance 
with a statement that we have complied with rel-
evant ethical requirements regarding independ-
ence, and to communicate with them all relation-
ships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
from the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the au-
dit of the consolidated financial statements and 
the parent company financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. we describe these matters in our audi-
tor's report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in ex-
tremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication. 
 
report on compliance with the 
esef regulation 
as part of our audit of the financial statements of 
flsmidth & co. a/s we performed procedures to 
express an opinion on whether the annual report 
for the financial year 1 january - 31 december 
2020 with the file name fls-2020-12-31.zip is 
prepared, in all material respects, in compliance 
with the commission delegated regulation (eu) 
2019/815 on the european single electronic for-
mat (esef regulation) which includes require-
ments related to the preparation of the annual re-
port in xhtml format and ixbrl tagging of the 
consolidated financial statements.  
 
management is responsible for preparing an an-
nual report that complies with the esef regula-
tion. this responsibility includes: 
 
■ the preparing of the annual report in xhtml 
format;  
■ the selection and application of appropriate 
ixbrl tags, including extensions to the esef 
taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to ele-
ments in the taxonomy, for financial information 
required to be tagged using judgement where 
necessary; 
■ ensuring consistency between ixbrl tagged 
data and the consolidated financial statements 
presented in human readable format; and  
■ for such internal control as management de-
termines necessary to enable the preparation 
of an annual report that is compliant with the 
esef regulation.

parent company financial statements           independent auditor’s report  
  
our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assur-
ance on whether the annual report is prepared, 
in all material respects, in compliance with the 
esef regulation based on the evidence we have 
obtained, and to issue a report that includes our 
opinion. the nature, timing and extent of proce-
dures selected depend on the auditor’s judge-
ment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material departures from the requirements set 
out in the esef regulation, whether due to fraud 
or error. the procedures include: 
 
■ testing whether the annual report is prepared 
in xhtml format;  
■ obtaining an understanding of the company’s 
ixbrl tagging process and of internal control 
over the tagging process;  
■ evaluating the completeness of the ixbrl tag-
ging of the consolidated financial statements;  
■ evaluating the appropriateness of the com-
pany’s use of ixbrl elements selected from 
the esef taxonomy and the creation of exten-
sion elements where no suitable element in the 
esef taxonomy has been identified;  
■ evaluating the use of anchoring of extension 
elements to elements in the esef taxonomy; 
and  
■ reconciling the ixbrl tagged data with the au-
dited consolidated financial statements. 
 
in our opinion, the annual report for the financial 
year 1 january - 31 december 2020 with the file 
name fls-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all mate-
rial respects, in compliance with the esef regu-
lation.
