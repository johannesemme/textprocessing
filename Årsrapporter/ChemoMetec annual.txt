maintaining momentum 
in a year marked 
by covid-19
chemometec made it safely through a year marked by 
significant uncertainty, restrictions and extraordinary 
market conditions, and we were able to continue building 
up our business and avoid losing important momentum. we 
maintained strong growth rates and generated record-high 
earnings, and we are now looking forward to continuing the 
solid performance under more normal market conditions.     
focus on maintaining as normal 
operations as possible  
the	 past	 financial	 year	 was	 marked	 by	
	covid-19,	which	impacted	our	business	and	
our customers. for example, physical visits 
and	 meetings	 at	 our	 customers	 were	 only	
possible to a limited extent, and many lab-
oratories and other customers had to send 
home their employees or close their busi-
nesses	for	a	while.	meanwhile,	some	of	our	
customers also experienced hectic activity 
during	the	covid-19	period.
we focused particularly on adapting to the 
applicable restrictions and on protecting 
our employees and customers to the great-
est extent possible – and also on continu-
ously	 identifying	 the	 risks	 and	 challenges	
associated	 with	 covid-19.	 consequently,	 i	
am	very	pleased	that	we	successfully	kept	
up our production, quality control and logis-
tics functions and maintained nearly nor-
mal	operations.	this	way,	we	were	able	to	
meet demand for our products and by and 
large deliver as agreed. 
we also increased the use of digital tools 
to maintain contact and provide services 
to	our	existing	customers,	and	we	thereby	
also	managed	to	continue	our	sales	efforts	
aimed at potential customers to some ex-
tent.	the	implementation	of	the	new	tools	
was	 successful,	 and	 in	 future,	 we	 will	 use	
the positive experience to further optimise 
the entire sales process.      
it	is	difficult	to	assess	precisely	the	effect	of	
covid-19	 on	 chemometec	 as	 our	 custom-

ers	were	impacted	in	a	number	of	different	
ways.	 however,	 overall	 and	 in	 light	 of	 the	
extraordinary	 market	 conditions	 through-
out	 the	 financial	 year,	 we	 are	 very	 proud	
to	note	that	we	generated	growth	of	31%	–	
even	though	the	usd	rate	did	not	develop	
to	our	advantage.	i	ascribe	this	not	least	to	
our good relations to our large and broad 
group of loyal customers and an exception-
al	effort	on	the	part	of	our	entire	organisa-
tion.  
growth driven by cell-based therapy 
and sales of new cell counter 
growth	continues	to	be	driven	particularly	
by progress in the area of cell-based ther-
apy	 with	 significant	 activity	 within	 the	 de-
velopment	of	new	types	of	therapies	in	the	
usa,	europe	and	china.	many	therapies	are	
also used in practice, but scaling of the ther-
apies	 still	 takes	 place	 at	 a	 moderate	 pace	
– partially due to the high price. we expect 
continued	significant	growth	in	this	area	in	
the	coming	years,	and	chemometec	is	well	
positioned	to	capitalise	on	this	growth	op-
portunity. 
during	the	past	year,	we	also	saw	a	signifi-
cant increase in sales of our latest cell coun-
ter,	the	nc-202,	which	was	launched	in	the	
2019/20	financial	year,	as	well	as	increased	
sales of service contracts.
product development 
affected by covid-19 – launch 
of xcytomatic delayed
unfortunately,	we	could	not	avoid	that	our	
product	 development	 became	 affected	 by	
covid-19	 as	 we	 had	 difficulties	 conducting	
external	tests	and	interacting	with	potential	
customers.	likewise,	the	activity	of	our	r&d	
department	 was	 affected	 by	 employees	
working	 from	 home.	 this	 meant	 that	 the	
launch	of	our	new	fully	automatic	cell	coun-
ter,	 the	 xcytomatic,	 was	 postponed	 and	 is	
now	expected	to	be	fully	developed	by	the	
end	of	2021.	the	instrument	is	targeted	at	
the	 cell	 counting	 market,	 primarily	 within	
bioprocessing. we have great expectations 
that	 the	 xcytomatic	 and	 the	 nc-202	 will	
smooth	 our	 way	 into	 new	 lucrative	 areas	
in	which	we	currently	do	not	have	a	major	
presence – and at the same time increase 
sales to existing customers.  
developments in europe back on 
track and sustained satisfactory 
growth in the us market
one	of	our	significant	focus	areas	in	2020/21	
was	 to	 revitalise	 our	 sales	 efforts	 in	 eu-
rope.	here,	growth	lagged	behind	our	oth-
er	markets	for	some	time,	but	by	strength-
ening	 our	 sales	 efforts	 and	 reorganising	
the	 sales	 organisation,	 we	 successfully	
took	growth	in	europe	to	a	highly	satisfac-
tory	 level	 in	 the	 past	 year.	 with	 the	 new	
sales	 initiatives	 completed,	 we	 now	 have	
the right set-up to generate satisfactory 
results	in	the	coming	years	as	well.	
in	chemometec’s	largest	geographical	mar-
ket,	 usa/canada,	 growth	 rates	 in	 the	 past	
year	 were	 lower	 than	 in	 previous	 years,	
and this development is caused by several 
issues.	the	usd	rate	was	lower,	many	cus-
tomers	in	the	us	market	were	hard	hit	by	
covid-19	restrictions,	and	lastly,	chemome-
tec’s	employees	did	not	return	fully	to	the	
office	 until	 in	 early	 april	 2021.	 in	 light	 of	
these	difficult	conditions,	growth	was	satis-
factory.
we	continue	to	see	substantial	growth	po-
tential	 in	 the	 us	 market,	 and	 in	 2020/21,	
we	therefore	invested	in	and	strengthened	
our	 us	 organisation.	 in	 the	 past	 year,	 we	
opened	our	second	office	in	the	usa,	in	san	
diego,	california,	and	our	physical	presence	
now	gives	us	a	strong	platform	for	realising	
our	growth	ambitions	both	on	the	east	and	
the	 west	 coast	 of	 the	 usa.	 in	 the	 coming	
year,	 we	 plan	 to	 strengthen	 our	 presence	
further	by	establishing	a	new	sales	office	in	
boston.
in	the	rest	of	world	region,	overall	revenue	
declined,	but	we	saw	reasonable	trends	in	
the	 important	 chinese	 market.	 the	 devel-
opment in this region is not least attributa-
ble	to	covid-19.
focus on a sustainable platform
now,	we	look	forward	to	returning	to	more	
normal	 market	 conditions	 and	 operations	
as	well	as	to	paying	more	visits	to	existing	
and prospective customers. 
in	 the	 coming	 year,	 we	 will	 continue	 in-
vesting in developing our organisation. we 
are	 aware	 that	 the	 current	 strong	 growth	
and our opportunities for achieving future 
profitable	growth	depend	on	the	continued	
build-up	of	a	sustainable	platform	which	is	
robust and scalable in the longer term – and 
where	we	maintain	the	agility	which	is	such	
a	significant	competitive	parameter	to	us.
after	 a	 very	 unusual	 year,	 i	 would	 like	 to	
thank	 everyone	 at	 chemometec	 for	 their	
strong	commitment	under	difficult	working	
conditions.	 your	 efforts	 have	 been	 crucial	
for the success of chemometec during a 
challenging period. 
a	big	thank	you	also	to	our	customers	for	
their understanding, loyalty and valuable 
collaboration and to our shareholders for 
their continued support.

the past financial year was in may ways challenging due to 
covid-19, and an exceptional effort was required from everyone 
across chemometec. in that light, i am very pleased that we 
made it safely through the year – and managed to maintain 
strong growth and provide reasonable services to our customers.

our business model
our markets
cell counting and analysis are used in a broad range of areas, 
and chemometec’s analytical equipment is used in all of these 
areas – in both private and public businesses and across 
companies’ value chains from research to production.
cell	counter	market	–	 
chemometec’s	presence	and	application	
of	chemometec’s	products*
chemometec’s	 most	 important	 market	 is 
cell-based therapy,	 but	 with	 the	 launch	 of	
the nc-202 last year and the xcytomatic 
later	 in	 2021,	 we	 expect	 that	 production	
and	 process	 control	 within	 bioprocessing 
will	also	play	a	key	role.
the	markets	which	chemometec	address-
es	 are	 estimated	 to	 grow	 overall	 in	 the	
range	of	5-7%	annually,	and	this	provides	
a	good	basis	for	achieving	future	growth.	
in	some	sub-segments	of	the	market,	how-
ever,	 we	 see	 significantly	 higher	 growth	
rates, e.g., in cell-based therapy,	 a	 market	
that	did	not	exist	only	a	few	years	ago.
overall,	growth	in	the	cell	counter	market	
is driven by, for instance, increased fo-
cus on cell-based research and therapies, 
higher incidence of chronic diseases and 
infectious	 diseases	 as	 well	 as	 increasing	
investments and production in the biotech 
and pharmaceutical industry. moreover, 
the development of improved cell counting 
solutions, including better image analysis, 
helps	drive	growth.	
during	 the	 past	 seven	 years,	 chemome-
tec	has	generated	annual	organic	growth	
of	 around	 30%	 on	 average,	 and	 this	
growth	was	primarily	driven	by	new	mar-
ket	 shares.	 chemometec’s	 global	 market	
share	within	cell	counting	is	estimated	at	
15-25%,	 ranking	 chemometec	 among	 the	
three	largest	players	in	the	global	market.		
it	should	be	noted,	however,	that	the	fig-
ures	are	subject	to	great	uncertainty	as	it	
is	difficult	to	obtain	accurate	data	for	mar-
ket	size	and	growth	rates	in	the	global	cell	
counting	market.
in	the	coming	years,	chemometec	expects	
to	be	able	to	win	additional	market	share	
and	thus	to	outgrow	the	market.

among the trends supporting 
our business model and growth 
opportunities are the following:
market trends
the ever-growing demands of 
customers in chemometec’s 
business areas in terms of 
precision, quality and well-
documented processes place 
chemometec’s high-quality 
analytical instruments in a 
favourable position and entail 
attractive partnership opportunities.
stricter compliance and process 
documentation requirements 
• chemometec’s	analytical	equipment	
is	typically	used	in	areas	subject	to	
strict	compliance	with	both	internal	
and	external	requirements	(e.g.	fda	
cfr21	part	11).	the	same	applies	to	
documentation of processes and the 
overall	workflow.	thus,	there	is	a	great	
demand	for	analytical	equipment	with	
the	right	specifications	and	which,	us-
ing	the	fewest	possible	resources,	can	
be	validated	and	interact	with	other	
parts	of	a	customer’s	given	workflow.	
• in	connection	with	the	approval	of	cell-
based therapies,	the	overall	workflow	
often needs to be approved, and 
this means that the individual parts, 
including the instruments used for cell 
counting, must subsequently remain 
the	same.	it	is	very	costly	and	complex	
to change analysis methods after an 
overall	approval	has	taken	place.
• in	line	with	the	growing	requirements	
for compliance and documentation, 
many	customers	within	chemometec’s	
business areas generally allocate more 
resources	for	cell	counting	–	with	the	
specific	aim	of	ensuring	compliance	
and documentation.
calls for digitalisation and 
automation of analytical processes
• analytical	processes	are	typically	
time-consuming and resource- 
intensive,	which	is	why	there	is	a	great	
demand for analytical equipment that 
can perform analyses fast, automati-
cally	and	with	a	high	degree	of	accura-
cy.	in	addition,	there	is	a	growing	need	
for both digitalisation and automation 
of	the	overall	workflow	in	connection	
with	analytical	processes,	and	this	
entails a demand for analytical equip-
ment	which	is	easily	integrated	into	the	
overall	workflow.	in	this	connection,	
variants of the xcytomatic are intended 
to become a part of the fully automat-
ed solutions.
development of new therapies, 
including cell-based therapy
• the life science industry consistently 
seeks	to	develop	new	therapies	
aimed	at	a	wide	range	of	diseases	–	
an example is “personalised medi-
cine”, a rapidly developing area. the 
therapies	in	this	field	include	cell-
based	therapies	and	gene	therapy.	a	
common	feature	of	the	two	therapies	
is that they require cell counting both 
during the development process and 
when	the	therapies	subsequently	
come into use.

our products 
our analytical equipment comprises analytical instruments and related 
consumables for storing and preparing cell samples. 
in	 principle,	 the	 instruments	 are	 built	
around	 a	 fluorescence	 microscope	 with	 a	
built-in camera, and the images are ana-
lysed	automatically	by	proprietary	software.	
the	consumable,	which	may	be	a	dispos-
able cassette or counting chamber, is 
placed	in	the	instrument	where	the	actu-
al	 measurement	 takes	 place	 with	 one	 or	
more	images	being	taken	of	the	prepared	
sample	through	a	measurement	window	in	
the cassette or counting chamber. the dis-
posables ensure customers a particularly 
user-friendly	 workflow	 and	 a	 very	 robust	
analysis concept.
furthermore,	 chemometec	 offers	 its	 cus-
tomers a range of other services and solu-
tions,	including	software,	test	kits,	reagents/
excipients, licences for assays, installation 
and service contracts.
chemometec’s	solutions
our	unique	cassette	plays	a	key	role
our disposable cassette for the nucleocounter instruments 
is	a	key	factor	of	our	success	within	cell	counting.
cell	samples	to	be	analysed	are	sucked	directly	into	the	
cassette.	dyes	are	not	added	manually,	because	they	are	
deposited	within	the	cassette	during	production.
the cassette containing the cell sample is then placed in 
the nucleocounter instrument and the rest of the analysis 
is performed automatically. the cell count results are avail-
able	after	a	short	while,	and	the	software	used	to	control	
the	entire	process	is	compliant	with	the	strict	fda	require-
ments for handling digital data.
this is a more simple and more precise concept than 
the ones used by competing cell counters, and it elimi-
nates many of the factors typically causing measurement 
variations and inconsistencies by calibrating all cassettes 
individually during the production process. moreover, the 
cassette increases safety for the user, partly because the 
dyes	are	sealed	in	the	cassette,	and	partly	because	we	do	
not	use	trypan	blue,	a	potentially	cancer-causing	dye	which	
many competitors are using.

nucleocounter 
nc-202
the nc-202 is an upgraded 
version of the nc-200, and 
the product is based on the 
advanced xcyto technology. this 
means, among other things, 
that	we	can	offer	our	customers	
one cell counting protocol for all 
mammalian cell types, an ana-
lysis	time	of	around	25	seconds	
per analysis, improved screen 
display	as	well	as	the	option	to	
optimise	workflows	and	process	
control. 
nucleocounter 
nc-200 
the	nc-200	offers	fast	and	sim-
ple cell counting that can be per-
formed using only one cassette 
without	manual	addition	of	
either dye or auxiliary reagents. 
in	addition,	the	analyses	provide	
information	on	average	cell	sizes	
and cell clumping.
nucleocounter  
nc-250
the	nc-250	is	a	competitive	top-
of-the-line	product	offering	fast	
and	cost-effective	high-	precision	
cell	counting.	in	addition	to	cell	
counting,	the	nc-250	can	also	
perform cell cycle analysis.
the	nc-250	uses	disposable	
counting chambers made of glass 
with	two	or	eight	chambers.	
nucleocounter 
nc-3000
the	nc-3000	is	an	easy-to-	
operate,	flexible	analysis	plat-
form that may be used both for 
cell counting and various types 
of cell analysis, e.g. analysis 
of cell cycle and programmed 
cell	death.	in	contrast	to	flow	
cytometers, the nucleocounter 
nc-3000	makes	it	possible	to	
qualify the analytical results by 
way	of	a	visual	inspection	of	the	
captured images of cells.

chemometec grew its revenue by 31% in 2020/21 from dkk 
214.1 million to dkk 281.1 million despite the extraordinary 
market conditions caused by covid-19. ebitda increased from 
dkk 92.6 million to dkk 135.6 million, a 46% increase. as in 
previous years, growth was primarily driven by increasing 
sales within cell therapy in all key geographies. sales of the 
new cell counter, the nc-202, maintained momentum, more 
than quadrupling in the past year. the upcoming cell counting 
product, the xcytomatic, is expected to be released for sale at 
the end of 2021.
sales performance and 
market developments
chemometec’s	 customers,	 the	 relations	
to customers and the possibilities for car-
rying	out	normal	sales	activities	were	im-
pacted	 by	 covid-19	 throughout	 the	 finan-
cial	year	2020/21.	
as	 a	 result	 of	 covid-19,	 many	 customers	
closed their laboratories for extended peri-
ods,	while	other	customers,	e.g.	within	cell-
based therapy, generally continued their 
activities. some customers even stepped 
up their activities, for example customers 
engaging in vaccine development. 
at	the	same	time,	physical	customer	meet-
ings	were	largely	replaced	by	online	meet-
ings – even after laboratories reopened. 
at	the	beginning	of	the	financial	year,	the	
covid-19	 situation	 created	 great	 uncer-
tainty about the severity of the impact on 
our	 growth	 opportunities	 and	 revenue.	
in	 this	 connection,	 it	 was	 an	 advantage	
to chemometec that our most important 
customers	 in	 the	 private	sector	 were	 not	
as severely hit as the laboratories of the 
academic	 environment,	 which	 were	 com-
pletely	 closed	 down	 in	 many	 countries.	
moreover,	 our	 sales	 organisation	 quickly	
and	 effectively	 switched	 to	 digital	 solu-
tions	 and	 established	 new	 customer	 ser-
vice solutions. 
dkk	28.4	million,	corresponding	to	10%	of	
revenue. service contracts for the nc-200 
and	the	nc-202	were	introduced	only	a	few	
years ago, and this part of the business has 
shown	a	very	positive	trend.	revenue	from	
service contracts is expected to account 
for an increasing proportion of chemo-
metec’s	business	in	the	years	ahead.
most of our revenue, 90%, derives from 
the	lcb	market	(life	science	research,	cell-
based	 therapy	 and	 bioprocessing).	 the	
covid-19 affected our 
 customers to varying  
degrees – but we generated  
31% growth.
service contracts now 
account for 10% of revenue 
and are expected to grow 
further in the coming years. 
breakdown of revenue by business area
business performance in 2020/21
it	 is	 not	 possible	 to	 determine	 the	 effect	
of	 covid-19	 on	 revenue	 as	 the	 pandemic	
had	 both	 positive	 and	 negative	 effects.	
however,	it	is	a	fact	that	chemometec	ex-
perienced	 good	 progress	 in	 the	 financial	
year	2020/21.	revenue	was	up	by	dkk	67.0	
million	to	dkk	281.1	million,	a	31%	increase.	
chemometec’s	revenue	growth	significant-
ly outperformed the estimated global mar-
ket	growth	of	5-7%,	and	we	thus	continued	
to	 win	 market	 share	 in	 the	 cell	 counting	
area in the past year. sales of instruments 
were	 up	 by	 20%,	 while	 sales	 of	 consum-
ables	 grew	 by	 29%.	 this	 development	 is	
satisfactory	for	a	year	marked	by	covid-19.	
revenue	from	the	service	business,	com-
prising service contracts and installations, 
surged	 by	 220%	 in	 2020/21	 to	 amount	 to

business performance in 2020/21
remaining	 10%	 of	 revenue	 derives	 partly	
from	 the	 semen	 analysis	 market,	 partly	
from	 the	 markets	 for	 counting	 brewing	
yeast	and	somatic	cells	in	milk.
as	 in	 the	 preceding	 financial	 years,	 reve-
nue	growth	was	primarily	driven	by	a	sig-
nificant	 increase	 in	 sales	 of	 cell	 counting	
products	 in	 the	 part	 of	 the	 lcb	 market	
(previously	 referred	 to	 as	 lcf)	 that	 com-
prises cell-based therapy.	 chemometec’s	
revenue	 in	 this	 field	 primarily	 comprises	
nc-200 cell counting products, but sales 
of our latest cell counting product, the nc-
202,	show	good	progress.
the	nc-202	cell	counter	was	generally	well	
received	 in	 the	 market.	 sales	 of	 instru-
ments	in	the	past	financial	year	more	than	
quadrupled,	 and	 additional	 growth	 is	 ex-
pected	in	the	coming	financial	year.	
as	in	the	2019/20	financial	year,	only	lim-
ited	 sales	 and	 marketing	 resources	 were	
allocated to the xcyto products in the 
2020/21	financial	year.	one	reason	for	this	
is	that	we	have	decided	to	give	top	prior-
ity to sales of our cell counting products 
as this area is currently estimated to hold 
the latest cell counter, 
the nc-202, has been well 
received, and sales more 
than quadrupled in 2020/21. 
the most attractive potential and also to be 
more	profitable.	
with	a	view	to	supporting	chemometec’s	
overall	 growth,	 we	 continued	 our	 efforts	
to	strengthen	and	adjust	the	organisation	
in	 2020/21,	 both	 in	 denmark	 and	 global-
ly. the number of employees at the head 
office	in	allerød	increased	by	34	full-time	
employees	from	74	to	108,	while	in	chemo-
metec	overall	we	saw	a	net	increase	of	40	
full-time	 employees	 from	 107	 to	 147.	 the	
number of employees at the international 
offices	amounted	to	40	at	the	end	of	the	
financial	year,	30	of	which	were	employed	
in	the	us	subsidiary.
in	the	past	year,	we	once	again	spent	sub-
stantial	 resources	 on	 marketing	 chemo-
metec’s	products.	the	main	purpose	is	to	
generate	more	leads	for	our	sales	staff	and	
distributors.	 the	 efforts	 primarily	 target

focus	areas	in	2021/22	
chemometec’s	 goal	 is	 to	 create	 a	 basis	 for	 continued	 growth	 and	 strong	 earnings	
through in-depth insight into customer needs, continued strengthening of our state-of-
the-art	technological	platform	as	well	as	best-in-class	customer	support.
in	the	coming	financial	year,	focus	will	mainly	be	on	the	following	areas.
customers and markets
• continued strengthening of our cus-
tomer relationships by, e.g.:
 - 	great	proximity	to	our	customers	
via a physical presence in main mar-
kets	and	close	dialogues	about	our	
customers’	wishes	and	needs	
 - 	increased	sales	of	service	contracts
 -  optimising the use of digital solu-
tions, for e.g. meetings and ongoing 
servicing
• increased	sales	to	existing	customers,	
e.g.	by	way	of	sales	to	more	functions	
of the individual businesses
• focus on the bioprocessing	market	
with	the	upcoming	cell	counting	prod-
uct, the xcytomatic
• opening	of	new	sales	office	in	boston
• attracting	new	customers,	including	
newly	started	businesses	within	cell-
based therapy 
products and innovation 
• continued positioning of the nc-202, 
the latest cell counting instrument 
• completion of the xcytomatic, the  
new	high-speed	cell	counter,	and	
 subsequent launch
• increasing	focus	on	developing	soft-
ware	that	may	contribute	to	auto-
mation	and	efficiency	improvements	
among	customers	who	are	typically	
subject	to	high	standards	with	respect	
to documentation and quality control
• investing	in	new	competencies	to	
sustain innovation
• upgrading	and	optimising	our	
	production	technology	with	a	view	
to	improving	efficiency	and	produc-
tion capacity and reducing resource 
 consumption
growth	in	our	activities	entails	a	need	for	an	ongoing	strengthening	of	the	foundation	
on	which	chemometec	is	built.	consequently,	we	maintain	a	strong	focus	on	strength-
ening	and	consolidating	the	entire	organisation	to	ensure	it	can	keep	pace	and	is	well	
prepared	to	support	chemometec’s	further	development.
paigns,	 google	 seo	 optimisation,	 online	
webinars	and	direct	marketing	campaigns.	
these	web-based	activities	will	play	an	in-
creasingly important role, and not least in 
connection	with	covid-19,	digital	solutions	
were	 often	 the	 only	 way	 chemometec	
could	communicate	with	both	prospective	
and existing customers.
during	the	past	seven	years,	chemometec	
has	 generated	 annual	 organic	 growth	 of	
around	 30%	 on	 average,	 and	 this	 growth	
was	primarily	driven	by	new	global	market	
shares in the cell counting area. chemo-
metec’s	 global	 market	 share	 within	 cell	
counting	 is	 estimated	 at	 around	 15-25%,	
ranking	us	among	the	three	largest	players	
in	the	global	market.	
the upcoming cell counting products be-
longing to the xcytomatic family are ex-
pected to contribute positively to the future 
revenue	performance.	the	first	xcytomatic	
product is expected to be released for sale 
in	late	december	2021.	
during the past seven years,  
chemometec has  
generated annual revenue 
growth of around 30% 
– which reflects that we 
have won market share.

while a number of our customers 
were affected by covid-19 lockdowns, 
especially one group, those engaged in 
the development of covid-19 vaccines 
and treatment of covid-19, experienced 
an extraordinarily high level of activity. 
case: development of vaccine
chemometec has supplied equipment for 
several	 covid-19	 projects,	 one	 of	 which	
concerns	the	development	of	the	covid-19	
vaccine	“abncov2”	and	is	led	by	a	team	of	
researchers	 at	 the	 university	 of	 copenha-
gen	together	with	the	companies	adaptvac,	
expres2ion biotechnologies and bavarian 
nordic.
“we are proud to support one of europe’s 
leading teams of researchers working on 
developing vaccines against covid-19. we 
have made an nc-202 instrument available 
to the project so that they do not have to 
perform time-consuming manual cell counts. 
this means they can use their resources on 
the actual vaccine development and thereby 
realise their goals faster”, 
says	steen	søndergaard,	ceo	of	
 chemometec.
the vaccine is being developed according to 
the	same	principle	as	the	hpv	vaccine	and	
has	shown	a	very	strong	immune	response	
in animals and humans. the research team 
hopes	for	a	“full	response”,	which	will	pre-
vent the virus from entering the body, and 
potentially, the vaccine may also give a very 
long-standing	 response,	 which	 will	 make	
humans immune to the virus and virus vari-
ants for a longer period of time – potentially 
for many years. 
“we are extremely excited about the phase 
1 results of our new covid-19 vaccine. the 
vaccine was developed under considerable 
time pressure, and i would like to thank 
everyone who contributed to the preclinical 
vaccine development, including chemometec 
who made an nc-202 cell counter available to 
the project”,
says	ali	salanti,	professor	at	the	university	
of copenhagen and head of the team of 
researchers	who	developed	the	danish	vac-
cine candidate.
bavarian	 nordic	 will	 continue	 the	 devel-
opment of the vaccine candidate and has 
planned	a	phase	2	trial	later	in	2021	with	up	
to	210	human	subjects.

case: bioprocessing
stronger product portfolio 
opens up new opportunities   
in recent years, we have significantly strengthened 
our market position within cell counting. with the 
recent launch of the nc-202 cell counter and the 
upcoming launch of the high-speed cell counter, the 
xcytomatic, we will be able to enter new business 
areas – and get an opportunity to serve our 
customers across the entire value chain, which often 
comprises research, product development, process 
development, production and quality control. 
bioprocessing	will	be	a	special	focus	area	for	
us	in	the	period	ahead,	and	we	will	particu-
larly target the area comprising production 
of antibodies and proteins for use in phar-
maceuticals	–	a	rapidly	growing	area	owing	
to	the	development	of	more	and	more	new	
therapies	within	this	field.	in	principle,	cel-
lular therapy may also be included under 
bioprocessing,	and	we	have	already	built	a	
unique	position	in	this	field.	
there is a great need for cell counting and 
viability	 determination	 within	 bioprocess-
ing,	an	area	involving	work	with	living	cells.	
analysis	 capacity,	 faster	 analysis,	 stabili-
ty	of	the	measuring	equipment	as	well	as	
simplified	and	safe	workflows	are	key	pa-
rameters	to	our	customers	in	this	market	
area. moreover, customers need to be able 
to handle data electronically and to auto-
mate	 their	 data	 flows	 as	 substantial	 re-
sources are required to meet various doc-
umentation requirements and generally to 
meet	 the	 requirements	 for	 gmp	 produc-
tion	 (gmp:	 good	 manufacturing	 practice,	
the	 common	 quality	 standard	 within	 the	
production	of	pharmaceuticals).
with the nc-202 and especially the xcyto-
matic,	 we	 can	 meet	 customers’	 needs	 in	
the	above-mentioned	areas,	and	we	aim	to	
build	a	new	attractive	business	area	within	
bioprocessing	over	the	course	of	a	few	years.
